negative	expedia booked me in a dump - the village inn in annapolis , md .
negative	it was too dirty to stay there .
negative	expedia and the hotel refuse to refund my money , even_though i did not stay .
negative	customer_service through_expedia was awful .
negative	i was on the phone forever and could_barely understand the expedia agents with whom i spoke .
negative	imposible to call them !
negative	emailed cust service to return 0 parts they keep giving me rma just for one .
negative	after many emails and 00 days they have not refunded my money .
negative	today i will file credit_card dispute over $_00 . 00
negative	i ordered a book for school two_weeks_ago and never received it , when i went to the web_site and checked the order status it said it was cancelled .
negative	they never bothered to email me and tell me this .
negative	i emailed them to ask why it was cancelled and still no reply .
negative	so i waited and finally got onto an online_chat with customer_service , he said it was out of stock so they cancelled it .
negative	i asked where my money was and why i didnt have a refund yet , given the order was cancelled two_weeks_ago .
negative	he said it takes 0 - 0 days .
negative	well its been two_weeks since the order was cancelled and he said , oh im not sure why it took so long but we just processed the refund today .
negative	so two_weeks_later and they finally processed my refund ?
negative	i still have to wait an extra 0 - 0 days before that money is back in my account so i can order another book .
negative	being as i am a poor college_student i need that money .
negative	the lack of communication and me having to wait this long for a book that was never coming is just stupid !
negative	when i placed the order they had the sunglasses available after 0 days they called and said they don_'_t have it and they need to order them they said it takes 0 to 0_weeks well it '_s been 0_weeks i don_'_t have it yet and every week i have to all them so they can update me with the order i think this should be their job letting_me know at_least about the order .
negative	my order took 0_weeks to arrive even_tho it showed the sunglasses was in stock but then they said they don_'_t have it .
negative	i spoke with " tom " for at_least 00_minutes making_reservations for my daughter '_s wedding .
negative	i was told the rooms were going to be $_000_per room and that they were refundable , no problem .
negative	confirmation letters stated that the rooms were $_000 and $_000 with the rooms coming up to $_000 and $_000 with tax and handling .
negative	how did the $_000 room only become $ 0 cheaper_than that $_000 ?
negative	must have had more handling .
negative	the service did refund my money to make the rooms $_000 but then they charged my credit_card for the rooms and they were not refundable .
negative	i will never use this service again .
negative	too much_trouble and mistakes .
negative	i would not recommend this place to rent_books .
negative	i am in doctorate studies and learning the spss software which i purchased but did not need to purchase the additional statistical book , so i decided to rent it .
negative	this was my first time renting a book .
negative	the book came in a terrible state with writing / highlighting / torn pages / spine broke , but i figured " i '_m only renting it for 0_weeks or so ".
negative	i returned the book and received an_email that they tried to charge my bank $_00 for the purchase price because they got the book returned with damage .
negative	mind you , i returned it in the same state i got it !
negative	please go elsewhere .
negative	if they ' re renting out books in a terrible state , who_knows_how many other people they ' re charging full price for the damaged book and re - sending it out as a rental book .
negative	i believe it is unethical and amoral .
negative	i will never use them or recommend them .
negative	as yet have not received the product ordered so cannot_comment further .
negative	expect the new year bank_holidays have delayed things , do not feel i can give a rating yet .
negative	the hotel was nice and i have stayed here before and loved it ; however , i used there 0rd_party daycare and they reported me to cpa or dfs for my child '_s movements of her body instead of asking me what was wrong ... they hotlined me .. the worker called me and met me at the hospital .
negative	my child has oms which is very rare .
negative	but she is stable and we go to kc for treatments .... i needed a brake .
negative	she was in there care for one hour and i paided them to watch her .
negative	i will ever stay there again !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered my books on jan 0 and asked for expedited_shipping .
negative	the order page swithed it over to free_shipping due to the amount of the order .
negative	i figured no_worries , i '_ll get my books in a few day anyway .
negative	they finally showed_up on jan 00 !
negative	my last order from book_byte !!
negative	!
negative	i booked a room through bookit reading through all the policies - it stated there was a fee to cancel before 0 / 00 , it was 0 - 00 so i assumed i could cancel the same day i booked with a min fee .
negative	i was wrong apparently if you cancel you are charged a one night_stay along with a $_00 . 00 fee - hhmmmm so for a one night_stay i would have to pay to cancel and pay a fee - no kidding .
negative	to make_matters worse i found the same room on another site cheaper so i sent to bookit for their best rate guarantee and guess what ... they would not honor !
negative	i will never book with this company again and will tell anyone_who will listen what awful customer_service they have .
negative	i try all the time to give people the benefit of the doubt , but this was just too pathetic !
negative	i totally wish i could give negative stars !
negative	i booked a room and then had to change it .
negative	travelocity says they don_'_t charge a cancellation_fee , it '_s the hotel that does .
negative	this is not true !
negative	in my case the hotel did not charge a fee to cancel but travelocity did .
negative	the hotel confirmed that there is an agreement between the hotel and travelocity to charge the one night fee .
negative	the hotel told me that you can always get better rates by calling the hotel_directly and then you are not bound by travelocity '_s policies and lies .
negative	wake_up people - don_'_t use travelocity !
negative	i have ordered from you before , but your add is misleading , it say no shipping charge but you raised the handling_charge to cover it , i was unaware my wife paid it . she will not order from your company again .
negative	that '_s poor business and misleading .
negative	i had a funeral_home in africa and i was buying cards frequently .
negative	on the day of funeral service , i wanted to buy a calling card worthy of $_000 and my purchase could not go through .
negative	i wrote my concern to you guys online on 00 / 00 / 00 at around 0pm eastern time , 00_hrs prior to burial service no body replied me .
negative	i just believe you have poor services and not a reliable company esp .
negative	when someone faces a problem of my nature .
negative	every time i go in or order from victoria secret no_matter what location i am always greeted with pushy and unknowledgeable sales_associates .
negative	this makes shopping for friends or trying new items unpleasant and makes me not want to return .
negative	i purchased 0 cotten bras in my size , the were horrible !
negative	they didn_'_t even cover the breast '_s properly , width around was fine but cup size was more like an " a " instead of a " d ".
negative	i washed them before i tried them on so i can '_t even return them .
negative	i would not recommend them to anyone .
negative	damn shame i lost $_00 .
negative	plus dollars !
negative	wasted my money buying the wrong part .
negative	there are not enough pictures of parts and no one could help me on the telephone helpline .
negative	i orderd what i thought were 0 remote transponders & when i recieved my order i found out it was just the cases ( empty ) for what i thought were the actual transponders , i went back to the order that you sent me to find a phone_number and could not find one . i need to return these 0 items . if you could e_- mail me to resolve this matter , i would appreciate it .
negative	if not , you would lose a potential customer !!!
negative	!
negative	i would like to review my wheelbarrow .
negative	however i do not have it .
negative	it has not arrived .
negative	only today i was hoping that this would be the day - but nothing so_far !
negative	so this is a non_- review - although hopefully soon my non_- wheelbarrow will become real and then a real review might be in order !
negative	the item was a bbok pillow , but i found it too small to hold a book .
negative	was charged £_00 . 00 to return and had to wait in 0 - 0 !!
negative	ridiculous customer_services extremely unhelpful and rude !
negative	i registered with fu as i read that they were offering the best deals for dual fuel supply .
negative	initially easy to set_up & seemed to be trouble free until i moved_house !!
negative	i informed them of move date 00th_august & was told to make a note of readings on the day but meanwhile they will take all change of address details and name of person taking over property .
negative	i informed them this is a tenancy and gave them the agents details .
negative	i asked for a transfer of my account to my new address but was told this is not possible & i will have to got through the registration process again ( crazy ) at this point i was approx_£_000 in credit on my account .
negative	i gave meter readings on move date and patiently waited for contact from fu ..... nothing .
negative	so i rang to be told the guy i had previsouly spoken to miss informed me & i would need to give details of landlord , i told them i didn_'_t know who my landlord was as the agents had always dealt_with everything . the lady i spoke to was very rude & told me i wouldn_'_t get a refund until the landlord paid the daily tariff since i moved out .
negative	i was told i would get a call back to update me of when i would get my final bill and then they would refund the monies owing .
negative	i heard_nothing more so rang again days_later to be cut_off every time the call went over 00_minutes waiting time .
negative	eventually i got through some days_later & was told they had tried to ring me on my landline_number , i said i left my mobile number as my landline hadn_'_t been installed when i initially rang them .
negative	they quoted my old number at my previous address !!!
negative	of course they didn_'_t get a reply i had moved !!!
negative	i was told i would be transferred to the finance department but got cut_off again .
negative	i called back on 0 occasions and each time the transfer to finance cut me off .
negative	i then emailed fu to be told they are really sorry and have the refund ready to process but i will have to wait up to 00 days for the cheque to be released .
negative	this information was sent to me on 0th october ...... naturally i am still_waiting for the cheque to arrive 00 days_later .
negative	i moved_house 0 months_ago !!!!
negative	i have cancelled my application for fu in my new house and since then have made a point of informing all my friends to pass on the sorry story so they don_'_t make the mistake of trusting this company .
negative	they are happy to let my money sit in their bank_account earning interest for them .
negative	my refund is for approx .
negative	£_000 and i would prefer it in my account .
negative	i paid the suggested monthly figure in good faith to this company .... it is a shame they couldn_'_t afford me the same respect and promtly return my refund .
negative	i would not have ordered from this company if it had been clear that they would take 00 days to ship my order .
negative	at that point , it becomes pointless to order from someone online .
negative	sent me a double order of my two_separate_orders and refuse to return the full_amount .
negative	i had to disputed with them over the phone which took 0 hour to put me through .
negative	they told me that the order would be refunded for the whole amount , which they did not .
negative	after 0 month of arguing with their ignorant staff , i finally the file a dispute through my cc company .
negative	do not purchase from them .
negative	their cheap clothing really is cheap .
negative	i advise to not purchase from them .
negative	i ordered a part from the website and it showed that they had it in stock and the next_day i get an_email from them saying that they did not have the part and my card will not be charge .
negative	if you go to the site it still showed that they have my part in stock .
negative	they should of marked it as not in stock .
negative	will never order from this company again .
negative	i am not a rich woman but i do my best to take_care of my two cats as if they were royalty .
negative	when petflow sent me three orders instead of one , all three orders were billed to me .
negative	i carefully put on new labels which petflow had sent me an_email_telling_me of this .
negative	i carefully removed the old tags and pasted on the new ones i had printed on my printer .
negative	i taped the box in places were the boxes seemed to be coming apart during delivery also .
negative	just how long does a person have to wait to have the money returned to them ?
negative	as it is my account is still in the red .
negative	linda hall
negative	customer for 0 months and soon to start buying my cat needs elsewhere .
negative	i could go and move my stuff to another unit and save $_000 .
negative	the rate policy sucks !!!
negative	!
negative	i contacted their customer_service several_times and expresses i did not know how to print the screen and if somebody could call me no response and i will be calling my bank to stop payment for the card that i paid $_00 for and that did not work .
negative	if , you are truly interested please resolve this issue and perspective customer .
negative	i can be reached at ( 000 ) 000 - 0000 , thanks
negative	the online booking system doesn_'_t work .
negative	my car was not booked in , no one called me so i waited in for a non_- existent appointment .
negative	when i called to find out what was happening i was put through to the wrong team .
negative	my tyres were not in stock so they had to arrange for that .
negative	i should say that the people i spoke with were polite and apologetic and did call me back .
negative	i have not had my order fulfilled yet so cannot_comment on that yet .
negative	the turn_signal was defective .
negative	i tried to get an_rma_# for a return , but they did not give me one .
negative	i tried to send back the part and it was returned to me with refused on the package .
negative	they will not answer the 0 - 000 number .
negative	horrible business ... a bunch of crooks .
negative	i canceled my order via your 000 because the item was supposed to have been delivered already and i just called to check on the status and they said that fedex lost the package .
negative	i told them that their customer_service was horrible because first , i get an_email receipt totaling $_00 more than more then what the subtotal and the extras were ( which were $ 0 . 00 ), then they tell me the item was shipped on june_00th but i never received an_email indicating it was shipped , or even a tracking_number .
negative	now they ’ re telling_me the package was lost !!!!
negative	bad bad bad customer_service !!!!
negative	!
negative	don_'_t use them .
negative	we did exactly as the instructions indicated , the cartridges leaked inside the printer , 0 hours_later and we are off to officeworks to get the authenticate hp product .
negative	it '_s a rip - off , they haven_'_t even tested the process , or more_importantly the product , on the actual printer .
negative	but as engineers , no_doubt you will try and suggest that we did something wrong .
negative	i think not ! q !
negative	what a waste of $_000 , and more_importantly , our time .
negative	i " ve accepted the terms and condtions below just to ensure that our views are forwarded on .
negative	i ordered a plastic part that weighed no more than 0 lbs and they charged 00 . 00 for shipping and the part was only 00 . 00 , they sent the wrong part and admitted it was their fault yet they are keeping the 00 . 00 and expect me to pay another shipping charge to send it back .
negative	so after all this i will pay over 00 . 00 and still not have the part i need .
negative	i will never order from them again and recommend to anyone i know not to order from them either .
negative	bad_experience all the way around and cannot get anyone to even talk to me on the phone .
negative	very poor service !!!!
negative	!
negative	i purchased a glass model on 00 / feb ... that after the payment and " confirmation order " i was informed that the product was discontinued .
negative	so , i received two others option suggestions to buy .
negative	i accepted the suggestion and the ( second ) " confirmation order " to this was sent to me .
negative	well , i was waiting for confirmation shippment / dispacht information .
negative	and than ... after several days , this week i received a email from managerservices informing " applied refund "!!!!
negative	i don ´ t request this !!!!
negative	!
negative	i want received a product !!!
negative	!
negative	in order to solve this situation , i sent a another reply email to service / managerservices requesting other option model ( the third option ), and at this moment ... without no reply !!!!
negative	!
negative	i ´_m very very disappointed .
negative	i hope your urgent attention to this matter ,
negative	regards
negative	when my son presented the confirmation to the front_desk at the quality inn & suites phx , the clerk had no_idea what we were talking_about !
negative	said he would hold on to the confirmation but didn_'_t know anything about the parking .
negative	i placed an order over the phone .
negative	i then realized that i ordered too much , so i called back and changed it .
negative	unfortunately , i received the original amount .
negative	am very upset about it as it is lots of $$$$$.
negative	probably will never order from them again .
negative	i '_m sorry , i had an awful experience with pet_flow , however , i will say the staff were amazing .
negative	i ' d never buy from them again and yes , they had refunded my purchases but fact were none were ever delivered although petflow sent me acknowledgement that they were .
negative	too much stress ....
negative	they lost a good customer , 0 dogs and 0 cats ... and volunteers at a shelter and helps place rescues .
negative	i spent over $_000 . 00 in my first order and my experience from that point was a disaster .
negative	almost a comedy of errors .
negative	they did send sorry for your experience email , staff could not be nicer .....
negative	after waiting for more than 00_minutes to get a response from the reservation_counter phone line ( 000 - 000 - 0000 ), i am leaving this message .
negative	on may 00th , i booked a hotel for june 00 - 00 , 0000 and my visa statement showed that the bill for those three_nights were already pending .
negative	i can understand a 0 $ pending fee to see if my card is valid , but a $_000 . 00 pending fee almost two months prior to my stay is totally_unacceptable and not a normal procedure .
negative	at_least the agent could have said that this was going to be done .
negative	i will not use this service again unless this problem is addressed .
negative	the whole_process took weeks rather_than days which is contrary to your adverts which implies that the money will get to your bank_account in days , which is most definitely not the case .
negative	i recently_purchased 0 visa_gift_cards from giftcards . com , one gift_card was ordered on december 00 , and has yet to reach its_destination !!
negative	i have called 0 times about the missing christmas gift no one has yet to help me solve this problem !
negative	the other gift_card was upgraded to 0 day business delivery and made it to its_destination .
negative	i definitely will not be using giftcards . com again !
negative	i ordered a phone cover on february_00th , it '_s now february 00st and i still have not received it .
negative	i was told around 0 days i should get it .
negative	i received an mail like 0 days ago that i should get it in probably 0 more because it '_s coming from the uk .
negative	what ?
negative	when i placed my order it said it would be delivered on wednesday .
negative	it is thursday and still no package .
negative	and i have no tracking_number to see where it is .
negative	i am going out of town tomorrow and wanted to bring my order with me .
negative	i placed an order that was supposed to ship on 0 / 0 / 00 .
negative	i went out to the website to try to track the order after 00 days .
negative	i went to the online_chat & asked about the order .
negative	i was told it was on backorder and would be shipped in a few_weeks .
negative	i asked why i didn_'_t get an_email or anything & the person told me it showed backorder on the screen .
negative	i don_'_t know which screen she was referring to but i did not see it .
negative	if an order is supposed to ship but is going to be delayed for quite a period of time , the customer should be notified .
negative	i am disappointed with the customer_service level and long response time for customer issues .
negative	there should be a phone_number to reach a direct person and not contact computer communication .
negative	i wish i had read the reviews here before i ordered from them .
negative	like most people here , i placed an order ( 0 sandals ), and received it about 0_weeks_later .
negative	after opening the package and looking at their version of an " invoice ," i noticed i only received 0 of the sandals , one was back ordered .
negative	on the invoice it said if the back ordered item was not shipped within 0 - 0 days of my shipment , they would cancel the order and refund my money , which they did ( i checked my credit_card later on ).
negative	anyway , i try on the sandals , decide to return them , and look at the instructions on the back of the " invoice ."
negative	i follow the instructions , pack up my order and invoice , and pay out of pocket to send it back .
negative	two_weeks_later , the box is returned to me in the mail with a sticker that says " refused .
negative	no rma_number on the outside ."
negative	needless to say , i was enraged .
negative	nowhere was it mentioned that an_rma_number was needed .
negative	nowhere .
negative	not only that , when i opened the package to get my invoice and look , it was not there .
negative	it was then i realized there was usps tape over the opening of the box , over the tape i had put on and that one of the covers on the box was not on top of the shoe box , but underneath ( as if someone had placed it there ) and i distinctly remember placing both covers on each box and making sure they would stay .
negative	they opened the box and forgot to put my invoice back in when they resealed it to reject it .
negative	so i called and got a recording saying my call would be answered shortly .
negative	i sat on hold for 0 minutes , waiting .
negative	hung_up , called back , same thing .
negative	i finally emailed them , asking for a rma_number .
negative	two_days_later , i get am email instructing me to go to the website and login to my account ( and if you don_'_t have one , you have to make one ), and fill_out the return form .
negative	fine , i did that , then get an_email_saying that my request was being_processed and they would send me an answer shortly .
negative	what ?
negative	i couldn_'_t_believe it .
negative	but i waited .
negative	i had no choice .
negative	a few hours_later i receive an answer .
negative	rejected .
negative	why ?
negative	here is what they said , " response memo : sorry , clearance items are not qualified for return according to our return_policy .
negative	please resubmit the request again without clearance items ."
negative	my items were clearance ?
negative	nowhere , anywhere , did it say they were , and nowhere did they say that my items could not be returned because of it .
negative	i have been on other_sites that warn you before you buy an item if it '_s a final sale / clearance and cannot be returned or exchanged .
negative	amiclubwear did not have that anywhere .
negative	so , now i am stuck with 0 pairs of sandals i do not want .
negative	i will probably sell them , but this whole_experience was awful .
negative	i will never shop there again , and will_definitely warn everyone i know about them .
negative	i wish i could give them half a star , or better yet , a quarter of one .
negative	they deserve it .
negative	total lack of providing adequate customer_service and satisfaction
negative	shady business
negative	this site had a good selection of products and the shipping_charges were reasonable .
negative	i would have given 0_stars if it weren_'_t for the fact that after i completed my purchase i had no_idea if it had actually gone_through as i never received an_email_confirming my purchase and the only information i have received since then is an_email_asking me to review my purchase .
negative	so i guess that means i bought something and that at some stage i will receive it ?
negative	nice to know .
negative	they have this product listed for a 0000_ford f000 but is too large for this vehicle .
negative	can '_t get anyone on the phone and they expect me to pay return shipping and a 00_% restock_fee .
negative	bueno , nosotros hemos comprado un cuadro en bimago , el más sencillo de_la gama , y he de decir que la calidad deja bastante que desear .
negative	nuestra idea era ponerlo en_el salón exhibiendo la bonita imagen que habíamos elegido , pero después de verlo en directo lo hemos puesto en una pared del pasillo donde no se note demasiado la calidad ya_que nos da un poco de vergüenza mostrarlo en_el comedor .
negative	una verdadera lástima , ya_que estábamos muy ilusionados con él .
negative	ugh
negative	i mean , i was promised it by march_00th and they think it '_s cool to try and send it last_minute .
negative	it '_s march_0th .
negative	dad '_s trying for next - day shipping because i have a con on the 00th .
negative	i wouldn_'_t reccommend the site .
negative	it '_s amazing that when you purchase something on ebay thru pay_pal they hit your credit_card almost_immediately yet when there '_s a credit due it takes them days to refund .
negative	i '_m so frustrated !
negative	my history on pay_pal shows a refund was ' completed ' on the 00th and it '_s the 00th and it still_hasn_'_t hit my account .
negative	i called pay_pal and they say it '_s with my credit_card company because they show it transferred on the 00th .
negative	liars !!!
negative	why does ebay use them ?
negative	ughhhh !
negative	had numerous problems with wowcher .
negative	unfortunately , i '_m still in credit with them , so will have to choose something_else to buy of them but it will be the last time .
negative	they take months to deal with enquiries .
negative	i literally had to fight to have my money credited to me .
negative	i never got a refund but wowcher credits only .
negative	once my credits are fully used , i will no_longer be using this website .
negative	some products i bought were complete gimmicks but i no_longer had the strength to argue and return , so i '_ve kept them .
negative	the services i '_ve purchased were the worst i have ever come_across .
negative	i '_m not sure how wowcher is trying to build a reputation without actually vetting their suppliers .
negative	really negative experience and would not recommend to my worst_enemy .
negative	i know that i read all the fine_print but when it comes to no refunds if there is a cancellation that is kinda crappy !!
negative	who_knows what could happen to ones plans !!
negative	and then they r out of $$!!
negative	not right !
negative	i am so disappointed .
negative	i placed an order six days ago and still do not have my product .
negative	i asked if the would charge my account and was told no , why charge my account and the room is reserved 0 and half months from now
negative	must cancel and was told i would have a fee to do so that is almost the same as 0 day reservation on room .
negative	please give me my full_refund as i was told on phone to request by your email site .
negative	thanks .
negative	marilyn . harding .
negative	@ att . net
negative	i am not at all happy with no response .
negative	if you can '_t help me , then just say so , don_'_t not call !
negative	i have tried contacting your company 0 times since i placed my order on monday and am starting to get very nervous_about the authenticity of my order .
negative	no one has replied to a single email and when i look at the reviews on your website , people are saying the glasses are fake , that you kept their money , that you never returned emails ( which is what i '_m currently experiencing ).
negative	i work in online customer_service and think it '_s an abomination to leave a customer hanging for four days .
negative	you don_'_t have a phone_number to call so how else can i reach you ?
negative	!
negative	please email me asap .
negative	$_000 is a lot of money to me to have potentially stolen from an illegitimate company .
negative	which i am starting to assume you are due to all of your negative_reviews and the fact you don_'_t respond to emails .
negative	please let_me know you have my glasses in stock and everything is hunky dory asap .
negative	i '_m starting to feel_like i should have never placed an order with you .
negative	if i don_'_t hear from a real_person within the next 00_hours i '_m filing a complaint against your company .
negative	your 00 / 0 customer_service guarantee is complete bs !
negative	i mean seriously , you have my money , what the heck is going on with my order ?
negative	!
negative	ho effettuato un reso il 0 aprile , chiedendone il rimborso .
negative	dopo essere stata rimbalzata dal servizio_clienti al servizio resi , mi_hanno garantito che avrebbero provveduto immediatamente al bonifico ( erano trascorsi 0 mesi ).
negative	ad oggi , sono passati 0 mesi e non_ho visto l ' ombra di un euro nonostante molti ssimi solleciti .
negative	il colmo è che sul mio account , risulta lo stato dell ' ordine : " rimborsato ".
negative	tutto ciò è in palese violazione delle norme contrattuali che regolano le compravendite sul sito fashionqueen e che stabiliscono un tempo massimo per_il rimborso pari ad 0 mese .
negative	attivo i legali dell '" altroconsumo " , di cui sono socia , perchè procedano in mia tutela , ma mi sento di suggerire la max diffidenza : non si può correre il rischio di essere insoddisfatti dell ' acquisto , per poi perdere capra e cavoli .
negative	attenti !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	recently my husband was booking a hotel for our anniversary through_expedia and they charged our credit_card not a " deposit ", but the entire weekends stay .
negative	that said my trip is not for two more weeks and we found a better deal elsewhere .
negative	i understand hotels will put an amount on " hold ", but they don_'_t usually charge you until you '_ve checked out .
negative	when he cancelled the reservation , no one told him that if you cancel with expedia they charge you a one night_stay anyway .
negative	but they didn_'_t even do that , they charged him for 0 nights $_000_dollars later ..
negative	in their defense , they " claim " we will be reimbursed which remains to be seen .
negative	either way i will never book through_expedia again !
negative	!
negative	i paid_extra for my order to get it expedited and it still_hasn_'_t arrived .
negative	this is costing me a quiz in my class .
negative	i ordered this feb 0 , 0000 .
negative	i will never use bookbyte again .
negative	i '_ve complained to travelocity per ther customer_service rep on 0 different occasions .
negative	i '_ve not received a reside back from them yet .
negative	my trip was in march .
negative	the hotel over charged me for my dogs and i never got that back .
negative	travelocity might get you a rm but your on your own if anything goes_wrong
negative	i didn_'_t realized at the time of purchase that the card would not be able to be used at the merchant i purchased it for .
negative	i found the website through a specific google_search , the personalized_gift_card ended_up being a discover card .
negative	after sending the gift_card to the recipient , i was informed that only visa and master card were accepted at the specific merchanted i had purchased it for .
negative	i feel mislead by the website , mainly_because it came up through a google_search and i thought it was merchant specific .
negative	only after looking back now do i see the tiny print ... not merchant specific .
negative	trying to cancel a reservation was ridiculous and was charged with fees , more than just the $_00 . 00 .
negative	i would not recommend using bookit ever !!
negative	!
negative	very very very slow and when the stool and wardrobe turned_up the quality was terrible - scratched and cracked and a serious manufacturing fault !!!
negative	not been sorted_out and no compensation offered at all unless i wanted to keep the unusable wardrobe !!
negative	!
negative	have already advised others not to use and will_continue to do so .
negative	---
negative	thanks amanda .
negative	what i find unacceptable is that i have not been offered any compensation at all from made . com for all the issues and time spent trying to sort the issues out , being in for deliveries and collections and having to repack everything .
negative	i was only offered compensation if i wanted to keep the faulty items .
negative	i had hoped to be enjoying the use of some luxury designer furniture and not spending hours last night repacking everything to make it fit and vacuuming up polystyrene bits and now having to take a day off work to wait for the items to be collected without_any idea of the collection time having been communicated to me .
negative	if you can help at all with this i ' d really appreciate it as i feel that i '_ve been treated extremely unfairly .
negative	best_wishes , michelle
negative	i would never order from fommy . com again .
negative	not only did they not ship my item until 0_weeks after i purchased , but when i called about my order , their customer_service was rude and unhelpful .
negative	if you read more reviews of fommy , you '_ll see that they also frequently tend to send buyers the wrong item .
negative	didn_'_t even send a part that goes anywhere_near what i ordered .
negative	now i am reading ~ because i can '_t speak to anyone ~ that i will pay the shipping to send back !?
negative	oh and it took over 0_wks to arrive and i paid over $ 0 s &_h !
negative	ya had a few customers for this company but they are ready to shop elsewhere ... i can '_t afford to to shop elsewhere and i still have a broken headlamp cover and waiting to be pulled over !
negative	they made me give them a star to send this so just know i wouldn_'_t have otherwise !
negative	i accepted your first mistake and you force me to accept your second one
negative	true your product is great prices reasonable , but to refuse to accept and
negative	unopened still in factory packaging that was your mistake i can '_t accept .
negative	i will be telling_everyone buy at your own risk and be prepared for the rude
negative	response as the responder he had tried to contact me without_success
negative	thus would not be as he stated bothered with me .
negative	great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered flowers on a thursday for a delivery that monday .
negative	money was taken from my account same day .
negative	monday no flowers at the destination ..
negative	i rang the florist myself in the afternoon , told me he hadn_'_t received any delivery request !
negative	a few hours_later they rang back saying they only just received the order ?
negative	they delivered the flowers next_day .. whats the point of ordering a present to surprise someone if it doesnt show up on the requested day ..
negative	i was excited when the package came but when i opened it , i was shocked .
negative	the wrapping papers are wet and so are the bottles .
negative	i immediately taped back the box for immediate return .
negative	i never see such a horrible packaging .
negative	was there no qc ?
negative	or was it packed by very inexperienced person ?
negative	either way , i am floored by this experience !
negative	took the money and then declined cover , will be seeking legal advice .
negative	i wanted a bigger additional storage .
negative	my reservationwas cancel due to special_offer for new clients .
negative	since i needed a bigger storage family said they would rent to get the special .
negative	employee at public_storage would not allow us go rent because of same last name and that we are trying to beat the system !!
negative	i . moved from suburb public_storage to chicago to lower rent did to taxes .
negative	so is that beating the system ????
negative	i still have a monthly bill to pay !
negative	!
negative	as of 0 / 00 / 00 , two_weeks and still counting for the delivery of my book .
negative	i will never order from bookbye again .
negative	trying to track this order for the last_week without_any success .
negative	the unit we rented was double the price of other storage places .
negative	when we went in to move our belongings out of the unit it was only the 00th of the month .
negative	instead of refunding us the last half of the month that we didn_'_t use the unit they kept our money and wouldn_'_t prorate it like everyone else does .
negative	the lady in the front was snotty and rude .
negative	i will never recommend this place to anyone .
negative	i made a purchase from them consisting of three orders , hoping to receive them in time for christmas .
negative	not only did i receive the earrings one week after christmas , but i also only received two of the orders and wasn_'_t even credited_back for the third order .
negative	when i contacted customer_service , these thieves kept responding saying they ' re sending out a return package , which - it has_been at_least 0_weeks since my complaint and i still_haven_'_t received it yet !!!!
negative	on top of all of this , when i did receive the two other orders that i purchased from them , the earrings were tarnished .
negative	it looked like something you get from a 00 cent machine .
negative	then talk about crappy customer_service ; the only way to get in contact with this company , if that '_s even considered " being in contact , since they almost never respond back ", is through email !
negative	when i call the phone_number off of their site , it goes straight to some answering message !
negative	wtf is up with this company ?!
negative	i will never purchase from this company again .
negative	to think that i try to remain as honest as possible , and all it takes is one encounter with these people and i lose at_least $_000 . 00 of my hard_earned money because of their greed .
negative	thanks a lot .
negative	the one light up dog tag i received doesnt work
negative	my girlfriend booked a 0 bedroom_suite through_expedia at the residence inn mariott on the mag mile in chicago , il .
negative	she received a confirmation_email_stating the hotel room was reserved .
negative	upon_arrival at the hotel , we were told there was no room reserved under that name .
negative	at this point , the hotel was all booked .
negative	not to mention , majority of the rooms downtown at all the hotels were booked .
negative	so , 0 young ladies were stranded in the streets of chicago with nowhere to go .
negative	we called expedia , and sat on the phone for over 0 hours with them .
negative	expedia did not offer any sort of assistance .
negative	we even offered to pay for a room in our price range and they cover the difference for a comparable room .
negative	they were not accommodating at all .
negative	we had dinner reservations and a concert to attend , and missed out on both because we had to search for a hotel .
negative	we were able to find a hotel with one room available that had two small beds .
negative	not very comfortable for a group of ladies .
negative	someone unfortunately had to sleep on the floor .
negative	if expedia would have followed through with our reservation , everyone would of had a comfortable sleeping area .
negative	the residence inn stated that they have been having problems with expedia booking the rooms at the hotels .
negative	this is absolutely_ridiculous .
negative	especially to leave 0 young ladies stranded .
negative	how does a large company like that not offer any type of accommodations ???
negative	i used to book through_expedia for all my travels , they have lost my business .
negative	who ?
negative	haha .
negative	facebook is in .
negative	myspace has_been out since 0000 .
negative	i seriously dont_know one person that still uses myspace .
negative	feeling the same as the review from rika below !
negative	company has not followed through in regards to shipping info .
negative	nowhere on the website is there a link to shipping information so one does not know if the item shipped or not .
negative	tried cancelling my reservations and they still charged me , had a family emergency
negative	do not use this site , they do not follow the actual hotel '_s policies !
negative	marriott hotels do not charge you until you check - in and these people does not honor their policy !
negative	further more , when i called marriott , they could not even find me !!
negative	i will be calling the hotels directly and they gave_me better rates !!
negative	!
negative	i booked a christmas all_inclusive vacation 0 months_ago with bookit .
negative	i received a cofirmation email from bookit stating " this indicates that your booking has_been completed successfully and is now confirmed ."
negative	two_weeks_ago i get a phone_call from them telling_me the resort i booked is being sold and the new owners aren_'_t going to honor the current reservations .
negative	i was offered an upgrade at a sister resort .
negative	after thinking about it over the weekend , i called bookit to accept this offer and was told by the same rep to wait because they were trying to negotiate a better offer .
negative	the sister resort isn_'_t quite as nice as the original resort but we wanted to book something because resorts fill up quickly for the holidays .
negative	days continue to pass and i repeatedly send e_- mails to this rep -- with only 0 answer to multiple e_- mails .
negative	the original resort contacted me personally and told me that they are not for sale , nor have they been sold -- matter of fact , they are booked full for almost the entire month of december .
negative	i gave them my confirmation number that bookit gave_me and their reservations department is trying to see if they can locate anything .
negative	i finally got bookit to recognize my acceptance of the sister resort .
negative	--- so , long_story short , the bookit rep started out being very professional the first few_times we talked but has now become very unprofessional .
negative	bookit was not honest with me about my original resort reservation , and i am now booked ( i hope ) at a sister resort with another e_- mail confirming this resort .
negative	i will never use bookit again .
negative	i wrote a review for netcertlabs weeks_ago .
negative	netcertlabs had turned it in and wanted it to be taken down .
negative	it was taken down almost_immediately by trustpilot stating i needed to send them proof of purchase .
negative	the review of netcertlabs , although not glowing , was accurate .
negative	so i sent trustpilot the packing_slip which they said was not enough .
negative	so i sent trustpilot a confirmation with the amount and date but it had the name of netcertlab '_s sister company on it called voip pbx express .
negative	i say sister company but i believe companies like this use multiple names so they can '_t get caught running scams .
negative	trustpilot said i couldn_'_t use that because it had a different company name on it .
negative	i finally sent them the credit_card charge that said netcertlabs on our credit_card statement next to the charge .
negative	which was the same exact charge and same date on the confirmation from voip pbx express .
negative	i also sent them an_email_confirmation from netcertlabs to our company .
negative	all of these things would be considered " proof of purchase " by any other company .
negative	why not trustpilot ?
negative	do trustpilot and netcertlabs have some kind of agreement or personal connection ?
negative	or , are trustpilot , scot bernard , netcertlabs , and voip pbx express one in the same ?
negative	i have done everything trustpilot has asked of me and i have it all in writing through emails .
negative	if trustpilot and netcertlabs are two different people , then i '_m asking trustpilot to please re - post my original review .
negative	people need to know what they are getting in to with netcertlabs , and trustpilot should be true to their word .
negative	provide proof of purchase and your review will go back up .
negative	thank_you .
negative	my experience was fine , except for the fact that they sent me the wrong safe .
negative	in the picture online , and in the description , the safe is described as a rotary hopper with combination lock , and that is what is pictured , however in the fine_print at the bottom of the page , it apparently mentions ( your customer_service representative told me this earlier today ) that the safe is shown with the optional combo lock , however , no where in the check out process does it give an option .
negative	so obviously i was very surprised to receive a safe that had two keys instead of a combo lock .
negative	when i called and provided the serial_number and a picture of the safe ( instead of a customer_service rep looking up my information ) they told me that i received the safe i ordered and that it automatically sends the key one .
negative	they said if i wanted to return it it would cost me money , or i would need to get a locksmith .
negative	i '_m still_waiting for the product
negative	i landed on bravofly website when i thought i was on ryanair and was tricked into purchasing travel_insurance which i did not require .
negative	i emailed straight_away and the reply said that i should have " unticked " the box . i consider that to be underhand .
negative	ordered a part and paid for next_day air shipping .
negative	received an_email_stating that the part had been shipped about 00_minutes later with appropriate tracking_information attached .
negative	the email also stated that in order to ship same day that the order must be placed by 0pm .
negative	the tracking_information stated that the package was in transit and would be delivered the next_morning by 00 : 00 .
negative	the next_day , which was friday , came and went and no package .
negative	saturday_morning the tracking_information updated and stated that the package will now be delivered on monday_morning by 00 : 00 .
negative	i inform the customer_service of the delay in shipping expecting them to refund my extra payment for overnight shipping and they were rude and short with me via_email because this is the only way to contact them .
negative	i showed them every bit of conclusive evidence which supported my statement and still the same end_result .
negative	they kept stating that there was a 0 : 00_pm cutoff for shipments same day though the payment received email stated otherwise and the email_confirming shipment stated otherwise .
negative	i will never order another product from them .
negative	i purchased a cap and t - shirt as a birthday_gift and not only did they arrive a day late , both items appeared to be worn .
negative	the cap came without the usual cardboard insert inside and looked faded .
negative	the shirt had two stains and the price was ripped_off the label .
negative	to top it all off , the items appeared to have been thrown into the box ; didn_'_t even_bother to fold the shirt .
negative	this will be the last time shopping with them .
negative	first and only time .
negative	i booked my hotel to only find out the hotel was full when i got there to check in .
negative	so at midnight in the middle of no where i had to find a new place to stay !!!
negative	!
negative	i '_ve had problems using my visa_gift_card online and when i had to check the balance several_times to see if anything was going through they blocked the card and require a phone_call to customer_service to unblock it .
negative	its a prepaid gift_card for crying out loud .
negative	response to giftcard . com :
negative	being sorry about a poor customer experience means nothing if you fail to resolve the situation .
negative	having to check the balance multiple_times may be an indication of fraud , but may also be an indication that the card isn_'_t working .
negative	saying you ' re sorry does nothing to make my $_000 gift_card useful .
negative	second response to giftcard . com :
negative	your system blocked the card i was trying to use to make a legitimate online purchase , but then it somehow became my responsibility to contact your company to resolve the issue ?
negative	that '_s logical .
negative	there are security_measures to block suspected fraudulent activity because that type of misuse leaves your company potentially liable for reimbursement .
negative	however , there are no security_measures in place to ensure consumers are not inconvenienced by your auto block or a general inability to actually use the giftcard .
negative	unfortunately , this was the first venue i had readily_available to voice my dissatisfaction with giftcard . com as i have spent the last 00 days moving .
negative	i went to check my email and saw a convenient link right there .
negative	no frustratingly ineffective calls to be made to people with inexcusably difficult accents to maneuver .
negative	no horrible elevator music piped through my phone for an indeterminable amount of time with periodic interruptions by some automated voice telling_me how truly valuable i am .
negative	i simply clicky - clicked the super convenient link graciously sent to my email , post a review , and wait to see what happens next .
negative	ordered a sweater , in size medium , turns up in size extra small ?
negative	first thing i noticed without even unpacking it was the size , so i '_m unsure as to why the picker didn_'_t notice this !
negative	i emailed straight_away asking why this error had occurred , and requested for them to send out another one , this was on 0th april .
negative	still not had a response , and obviously today is 00th_april .
negative	diabolical company , diabolical customer_service , diabolical inability to pick correct stock !
negative	highly unlikely to use again .....
negative	i placed an order on 00 . 00 . 00 .
negative	i received an_email_confirmation , confirming the order straight after .
negative	the money was then deducted from my account (£ 00 ) straightaway despite my goods not having even been picked / packed - why do they take your money straightaway before dispatch ?
negative	is this legal ?
negative	i then received another email , saying one item i ordered had been charged for , but was ' unfortunately out of stock ', and my card refund of £_00 would take anything up to 00 working days to credit back to my card .
negative	why on earth does it take that long might i ask ?!
negative	it has now been refunded , but again , that is not the point - do not take money until items are dispatched .
negative	i wasn_'_t too bothered by the above , and to be fair to the company , my goods arrived very promptly .
negative	i was slightly disgruntled to see they use yodel , however , on this occasion , yodel had actually managed to deliver my goods .
negative	after opening the goods , i immediately noticed one of the items was missing .
negative	this item was only £ 0 , however , it is not the monetary amount , it is purely the principle .
negative	i then noticed a dress i ordered came without a belt , which should have been with the dress , as the dress has belt loops , and also the photo on their website indicated it came with a belt .
negative	upon_opening another package , another dress i ordered had come with a snapped belt - i really am not making this up , although you could be forgiven to think i was !
negative	at this stage i was absolutely disgusted with the quality of goods sent .
negative	i sent an_email on 00 . 00 . 00 and received absolutely no reply , however , i did get an_email_confirming they had received my email , and apparently , intended to reply within 0 working days .
negative	now , either they ' re completely snowed under , or they simply hit ' delete ' when a customer emails in to complain .
negative	due to having no response , i sent another email on 00 . 00 . 00 , asking if someone could have the decent to urgently respond to my first email .
negative	again , today , 00 . 00 . 00 i '_ve had absolutely no response .
negative	i '_ve now contacted the relevant governing body about this company , as they have made countless illegal acts on one single order .
negative	i am also taking the time to visit my local_store , and i would strongly urge anyone with issues to do the same thing , and i '_m going to confront the store manager in this branch , and i will not leave until my problem is 000_% resolved .
negative	obviously , if other shoppers overhear my complaint , and the fact i '_m willing to take legal_action with this company if necessary , then so be it - i can only hope they do hear it , and select loses further business .
negative	the company should not be trading , absolutely horrific customer_service - i urge anyone_who '_s thinking about placing an order not to , and go elsewhere , such as next , new look etc , where they actually respond to their complaints and deal with them accordingly .
negative	do not touch with a bargepole !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i said very specifically that i wanted a very specific restaurant .
negative	and i got a generic gift_card .
negative	i will never order gift_card from you one again .
negative	such a shame , parcel was supposed to arrive as a present on 0june !
negative	would like to know why it hasn_'_t happened ?
negative	priceline never followed though on reservation .
negative	went to check in with email letter and confirmation # and was told it did not exist .
negative	i was also told this is not the first time this has happened .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	was very delayed for wedding even_though the staff did their best to take_care of the situation .
negative	the staff at hotel was great .
negative	priceline not so much .
negative	horrible
negative	i never received my 0 boxes of cat_litter . i had 0 order numbers and waited 0 month because each time i called them i was told the order was damaged in shipment and sent back to the factory ( twice ).
negative	so i asked for a refund , i hope i do get my money back or maybe this is a cause to contact the ftc or whoever handles these kinds of deals .
negative	i booked air_fare and a hotel then realized i needed ground_transportation to the hotel so booked that .
negative	i later learned my room actually came with free ground_transportation to the hotel .
negative	travelocity should have known that .
negative	so then i tried to contact travelocity to cancel the extra ground_transportation i had mistakenly booked .
negative	i emailed , i called .
negative	i got put on hold for over hours multiple_times ( each time being told i would be called in " 00_minutes " or " 00_minutes ".... each time i
negative	listened to the truly awful choice of music for over an_hour before i gave up because i had to be elsewhere .
negative	i called and tried the " call me back option " again waiting much longer_than promised time they would call me back and they did not .
negative	i had to go elsewhere and could not spend my days waiting for a call back .
negative	after days of trying this i finally_reached them and was able to cancel the ground_transportation only ( i did not want to cancel the hotel and airfare ) and i am supposed to receive a full_refund for the ground_transportation .
negative	i am not impressed with this kind of service .
negative	i will never use this site again to book a trip .
negative	i have ordered from amiclubwear many_times , once they sent me the wrong shoes and i had to pester them for my refund and then they never payed me back for the shipping ... ok so i let by gones be by gones but then this last time i ordered one item was on back order and i had to ask them about it !
negative	its been two_weeks and nothing , so today i just went browsing went to order one pair of shoes for 00 . 00 then noticed the s &_h was 00 . 00 !!!
negative	wtf_?
negative	they are taking 00 steps back instead of getting better , im done with this piece of $ h * t company .
negative	upon first_glance , bravofly seems like a great deal .
negative	however , you more than pay for it with time and frustration .
negative	due to the nature of the company , they are unable to immediately confirm flights , despite the fact that they are miraculously able to charge your credit_card as soon as you hit " purchase ".
negative	in lieu of a confirmation , they will send an e_- mail_stating they are working on processing your booking and will get back to you later to let you know if it was confirmed .
negative	in my personal experience , i received an e_- mail_stating that my flight could not be confirmed at the original fare , but they could book me on the exact_same flight if i chose to pay an_additional 00_euros .
negative	after several_attempts to re - book the flight , and just as many price increases , i ditched the deceitful middle - man and booked my flight directly through the airline , for a cheaper price , too !
negative	i was saved a lot of stress and frustration and will never use this second - rate scam service ever again .
negative	i would recommend using this site only if you enjoy being subject to the every financial whim of this company .
negative	i highly suggest looking directly at the airline '_s website , as they are usually a reputable_company and will not charge you 00_euros in " service fees ".
negative	after receiving this type of " service ", i would sure like to know where all of that money goes .
negative	never received the part i ordered and getting through to someone was impossible !
negative	filed a dispute to get my money back
negative	why would customer wait for days before you respond to a common question , my order was never shipped but i '_ve been charged
negative	order 0000000
negative	good day !
negative	order number order #_0000000
negative	you wrote that i had a problem with a credit_card !
negative	then you have understood and confirmed that the money came to you on the account .
negative	i paid for the item .
negative	you wrote that you can not deliver the order within the specified period and reported the entire order will be fully ready to ship august 00 , 0000 .
negative	today , august 00 , 0000 .
negative	i '_m writing a letter , but you do not answer .
negative	i '_m calling , but you do not answer .
negative	when will my order ship ?
negative	portnova alexandra
negative	a0000000 @ yandex . ru
negative	+ 00000000000
negative	their system gets ' stubborn ' occasionally , and no_matter_how hard you try , you get the 000 error , and tells you to try again .
negative	and the same thing all over .
negative	i had to enable cookies to even get the site to acknowledge me , and it still won_'_t post my review .
negative	fine .
negative	i '_ll withdraw and block future cookies .
negative	don_'_t like website cookies bogging down my machine , and planting who_knows what on my computer .
negative	i must not have read all the fine_print .
negative	the cartridges ran_out of ink very quickly and i decided to buy the ink_cartridges from staples and pay full price because at_least i knew what i was getting .
negative	obviously you get what you pay for and i will not make the same mistake again .
negative	this is no bargain in $$$, time , or convenience .
negative	i ordered an ipad_cover on dec 00 ... received confirmation of the order and then never_heard back .
negative	i emailed yesterday and still_waiting to hear from customer_service .
negative	very disappointed i did not receive this in time for christmas .
negative	i recieved my jacket before christimas , but it was faulty .
negative	i have emailed care @ superdry . com on the 0th and have not gotten an acknowledgement of any sort .
negative	i sent another follow_up email and still have not heard back .
negative	so_far not a happy buyer .
negative	from : cortez , claudia

negative	cc : cortez , claudia
negative	subject : order ref : superdryus0000000
negative	hi i recently_purchased the above item from your store online .
negative	i received the jacket but was not pleased for the following reasons_:
negative	there are strings hanging from the jacket and there is a cut by the zipper
negative	on the bottom .
negative	i have marked the spots on the jacket where it is faulty .
negative	i would like to get a refund and i also wanted to see how i can return
negative	the item without_any further cost to me .
negative	code : 000000000000gwo000
negative	please get back to me as soon as possible .
negative	thank_you ,

negative	i ordered a shower_tray and enclosure , along with a toilet and hand_wash basin .
negative	0 .
negative	wrong toilet sent
negative	0 . the shower_tray has a blemish
negative	0 .
negative	shower_enclosure is poorly designed and looks cheap - but was expensive
negative	0 .
negative	last and hopefully least - my plumber has just hooked up the toilet and hidden flusher .
negative	the flusher has a hairline crack in it and is faulty .
negative	given the false wall is in , framed , plastered and tiled , this now all has to be removed to replace the faulty flusher / cistern .
negative	this will cost me £ xxxx - all due to the fact that the goods are faulty .
negative	extremely poor quality - do not use this company
negative	booked on priceline - should have checked with the hotel site first .
negative	after i paid taxes and fees for their " express deal " i ended_up paying more than if i had gone directly to the hotel to book .
negative	also priceline assigned a smoking_room to us - we had to have the clerk change it .
negative	luckily they had non_- smoking available .
negative	i will not be purchasing from bookbyte again , as i ordered a math textbook for my 0th grader july_00th and today , august_00th , it is still not here .
negative	my son had to start school without his textbook and no one will take_responsibility for it .
negative	i contacted both book_byte and the seller that is represented by bookbyte and neither one have been able ( willing ?)
negative	to offer any help .
negative	( the seller was fastmedia )
negative	update_: the company '_s response ( below ) will not help my son who still does not have his 0th_grade math text book .
negative	repeated attempts along the way were completely fruitless -- i was told to just wait .
negative	zero tracking_information .
negative	zero offers to cross - ship another one so that he would have one for the first day of school .
negative	bookbyte has an obligation to stand_behind their sellers and hold them accountable for good customer_relations .
negative	filling out a report and waiting will do nothing to resolve our current situation .
negative	i want this text book sent now - overnight - at the seller '_s ( and / or bookbyte '_s ) expense .
negative	paid for delivery two_days after order .
negative	0pm on the day of ' delivery ', got a phone_call to say they couldn_'_t deliver .
negative	no other explanation .
negative	then said it would take three to five days to process the refund to my debit_card .
negative	dreadful ' service '.
negative	it wasn_'_t the orkney islands , the delivery should have been to the middle of leicestershire .
negative	total bunch of comedians .
negative	would never , ever buy though them ever again .
negative	has left me incredibly embarrassed and now they ' re going to hold on to my money for nearly a week likely .
negative	a complete joke .
negative	while i was able to find the product i wanted and it arrived_promptly with " free " shipping , the fine_print is the import tax bill you get socked with 0 - 0 months later !
negative	the company is actually located in hong_kong so you are responsible to pay all the import fees .
negative	so that " free " shipping ends_up being ~$ 00 .
negative	upon inquiry , the company was happy to inform me this was all a part of the agreement and conditions so there was nothing they would do .
negative	the lesson to learn is to know what you ' re getting into before you make the purchase .
negative	i made an order june_0th and the order was split into two packages with two tracking_numbers .
negative	the last details on the tracking_numbers were on june_0th and the estimated delivery date was june_00th .
negative	well i waited_until july_0th and nothing showed_up .
negative	i asked my post_office but my package never came .
negative	i went on redbubble '_s website hoping to get a customer_service number and of course i couldn_'_t because there isn_'_t one .
negative	if you want to get a hold of customer_service you need to create a private discussion on a message board and they say someone will get a hold of you in two_days , but they won_'_t .
negative	and i have no way of getting a hold of anyone at redbubble because you need to wait for them to reply to your support request discussion .
negative	i was really looking_forward to my purchases too , but seeing as how i can '_t get a hold of anyone to see what is up with my order i have to say the customer_service is really horrible .
negative	i asked flight_centre to help me with a return flight from uk to johannesburg because i wanted to keep the return open for some months .
negative	i got a good price with an emirates flight but got severely stung on excess baggage charges .
negative	i was emigrating to south_africa and had 0 extra bags .
negative	they cost me £_000 !!!.
negative	it was eye - watering .
negative	when i informed the flight_centre consultant after the flight he had no awareness of the emirates excess baggage charges at all and did not seem that interested .
negative	i never_heard from him again .
negative	i wish i could give them a zero !
negative	i received an_email that the flowers hadn_'_t been delivered ( it wasn_'_t even attempted there was no note left ).
negative	i called the next_day to ask which local_florist they had used so my dad could go pick_up the flowers for my mom .
negative	they wouldn_'_t tell me but said they ' d call the local_florist , see if it was ok , and call me right back .
negative	( no call for the next hour , i have call waiting ) while waiting i started calling all the florists around my parents area and located the local_florist myself .
negative	she couldn_'_t have been nicer and went way out of her way to track down what had happened .
negative	i had ordered white daisies and the florist didn_'_t have white in so she had asked justflowers to call me for an ok to substitute .
negative	they finally got a call back at 0 : 00_pm saying it they had recieved an ok . that '_s clearly too late for delivery yet that day and they never called me to ask about the substitution at all .
negative	they had both my home and cell numbers so i was available all day .
negative	i double_checked .
negative	no messages or missed calls on either phone .
negative	so justflowers cancelled my order !!!
negative	i demanded a complete refund from justflowers and ordered directly from the local_florist .
negative	i will never use a national florist system again but find local_florists on yellowpages . com .
negative	the local ones have a business reputation to uphold and care about customer_service .
negative	i ordered from parts_geek and it was guaranteed to arrive on 0 / 00 .
negative	i still_haven_'_t received my order and there is no contact number .
negative	i hsve submitted numerous question forms and they haven_'_t yet to contact me .
negative	worst customer_service and business i have ever_dealt_with
negative	didn_'_t end up having to stay at the hostel , but still got charged full price .
negative	be sure to cancel at_least 00_hours before hand .
negative	according to pitch world we live in " non uk_mainland ", despite the fact we live in the middle of scotland , only 00_miles north of stirling .
negative	pitch world want to charge us an_additional £ 0 . 00 for them to send us an item that only costs £ 0 . 00 and weighs as light as a feather .
negative	just an excuse to ' rip_off ' the scots .
negative	no - one in scotland should buy from this company .
negative	the showerhead that i ordered did not fit although it was advertised as the correct_part .
negative	i have sent two email communications and one phone_call to try and get the correct showerhead but have had no response .
negative	very disappointed with shower_doctor .
negative	would not use them again .
negative	tres mauvaise experience , j ' ai l ' habitude d ' utiliser de nombreux services en ligne , mais la , il m ' a fallu plusieurs jours pour parvenir a faire tirer mes photos !
negative	aucune logique dans_le site , j ' ai d ' abord achete un pack 000 photos .
negative	puis apres avoir installer le logiciel de telechargement des photos , et telecharger toutes les photos , impossible de voir clairement ou utilise mon pack , et ne_pas repayer un tirage !
negative	il m ' a fallu aller jusque sur_la page de paiement , puis ne rentrer aucune information , cliquer sur " continuer " pour voir afficher le fameux pack photos achete aupravant !

negative	i emailed their customer_service department regarding my order and this is what thy sent :
negative	biblio . com customer_support
negative	feb 00 00 : 00
negative	hello from biblio . com ,
negative	thank_you for contacting customer_service .
negative	we have received your email .
negative	we
negative	are reviewing your request and a biblio . com service representative should be
negative	contacting you via_email as soon as possible .
negative	our customer_service hours are
negative	monday through friday , 00am to 0 :_00pm est .
negative	all requests are answered in the
negative	order they are received , and usually within 0 - 0 business days .
negative	thank_you ,
negative	biblio . com customer_service team
negative	ever time i sent an_email to find out what has happened to the order , they sent me this automated_message .
negative	i did call once , i was told that i must send an_email since they don_'_t respond to phone follow ups .
negative	( great customer_service !!!!)
negative	don_'_t use biblio .
negative	i had to contact then when the order did not arrive .
negative	the rep was very rude .
negative	i check my both my spam and junk folders . the so called email they sent , did not exist .
negative	i have no_idea where they sent this phantom email .
negative	i think they screwed_up and trying to blame their mistake on me .
negative	this is a poor way to do_business especially when you want the customers to come_back .
negative	on my recent return trip to cleveland , i had my flight canceled twice due to weather .
negative	while i understand that no one can control the weather , the reaction to my flight cancellations was unacceptable .
negative	i was not notified of either cancellation ( in fact , i was sent a reminder email about the second flight as the airline '_s customer_service representative as telling_me i had to rebook .)
negative	when i attempted to rebook my flights ( something that us_airways / american airways does not do automatically unlike_other major commercial airlines like jetblue ), the website directed me to call customer_service and the customer_service line directed me back to the website , stated that their phone lines could not handle the number of calls it was receiving , and hung_up on me .
negative	multiple_times .
negative	i was stranded in cleveland in a hotel that did not have any availability that night without_any transportation or access to communication with the airlines .
negative	when i finally_reached airline representatives , they failed to send me email_confirmations with vital flight information on multiple_occasions despite my requests and their assurance that they would .
negative	they were also consistently rude .
negative	us_airways , american_airlines , and travelocity failed to communicate with me and didn_'_t even offer to make up for the horrendous in any way ( e . g .
negative	a free checked bag for goodness ' sakes .)
negative	us_airways representative were rude and scolded me and other customers ( for no reason ) on multiple_occasions .
negative	when i arrived in chicago to connect through to my final_destination , the plane taxied for nearly a half_hour or more despite the fact that there was a very sick woman on board because their was a plane still at our designated gate and then the captain reported that we were experiencing ' mechanical problems ' after we had landed .
negative	this did not leave me feeling safe and made us arrive late .
negative	the first hotel i stayed in was not clean ( despite travelocity '_s ratings )- there were white stains on the walls and chips on the carpet when i arrived .
negative	when i moved to another travelocity recommended hotel , the shuttle that was due to pick me up didn_'_t arrive for 00 + minutes .
negative	when i called to investigate , they reported that they had forgotten about me .
negative	all in all , not good .
negative	i will never fly us_airways / american_airlines again and i will seriously consider_using another travel website before using travelocity .
negative	i ordered a dress on november 0 , 0000 .
negative	it did not fit properly , so i returned it .
negative	i still have not received a refund for my purchase .
negative	i purchased a kit .
negative	and only recieved one piece of kit and when i contacted them they said i had to replace the one piece i needed and reorder the kit again .
negative	they couldn_'_t just send the piece that should have been with it .
negative	keep in mind you don_'_t get any money back for postage .
negative	so i can '_t even get the piece i need for the kit .
negative	cause i would spend more in postage that the piece is worth .
negative	totally ripped me off .
negative	i will not buy another thing from them and would not recommend them either .
negative	it was there mistake and i have to pay for it .
negative	0 of my costumes came to me with outbany buttons .
negative	called them and they said u must send back that 0 and we will send u another 0 .
negative	which i had to wait for awhile .
negative	you notified me that you sent the floral_arrangement and they never received
negative	i want the flowers resent immediately .
negative	this is unacceptable

negative	i live in an area of new mexico where no merchants carry incontinence_supplies .
negative	this means i must order online -- but i do not plan to order from you again .
negative	i like your merchandise and your prices , but it takes far too long for my order to arrive -- usually at_least a week and often longer .
negative	i regularly order from amazon , target , sears and walmart ... and orders from these stores arrive within 0 or 0 days tops -- they use fedex like you , but i get my orders much sooner .
negative	why ?????
negative	also , your telephone - order person ( the person_who answers the number on your website ) is a bit surly and unwelcoming .
negative	website ) is a bit surly and unwelcoming .
negative	i have spent over $_000 with this company and i am still treated very disrespectfully .
negative	the last purchase i made about a month_ago was ' my last straw .'
negative	i received the wrong item and size and sent it right back .
negative	they told me that they would correct the problem and get the correct item shipped back out to me .
negative	i waited a week and called back and they said that i should have taken the representative '_s name down who told me that she would correct the problem because they do not send out new items without_having them shipped back in a certain way .
negative	they said that there was no note written and that there was nothing that they could do about it .
negative	i have been calling back almost every day and , after waiting 00 - 00_minutes each time , i have been hung_up on several_times .
negative	this is unacceptable !
negative	i ordered from here because they have prescription_sunglasses for kids .
negative	i picked out a pair , put in my sons prescription , and a nice feature it saves prescriptions , and ordered them .
negative	the sunglasses came and looked great , but my son put them on and said he couldn_'_t see .
negative	i tried them on , they were regular sunglasses , no prescription !
negative	when i emailed select_specs they first replied i hadn_'_t entered a prescription .
negative	i responded with yes i did and they could check because it was saved in my account .
negative	the next reply i got was these sunglasses didn_'_t come with prescription , then why did they come up under kids prescription_sunglasses .
negative	i was most upset at how they rectified it , by doing nothing , no return refund anything .
negative	i am now out the money with kids sunglasses he can '_t wear .
negative	a horrible experience with select_specs .
negative	the new battery i got for my phone does not hold a charge for very long ... put old battery back in yesterday .

negative	purchased a trolley tour which was approx .
negative	$_00 for 0 people on my trip in st . augustine .
negative	when i got there i found out that the tour did not include any of the entrance fees to any of the attractions .
negative	if i had known this in advance , i would not have purchased the tour at all .
negative	when i inquired_about adding 0 entrance fees to attractions that we were interested in seeing , i was told it would be an_additional_$_000 .
negative	that was outrageous and we did not budget for that on this trip .
negative	needless to say , i believe viator should be refunding me my money for the tour for blatantly misleading me in their advertisement !
negative	i ordered 0 rotors ( 0 front , 0 back ) all 0 lug .
negative	i got 0 - 0 lug , and 0 - 0 lug .
negative	partsgeek sent me the wrong part and they refuse to send me the right part ( the one i actually ordered ).
negative	i have to mail the part back at my expense , pay a 00_% restocking_fee and order the part again .
negative	there is not even a phone_number to call and talk to a person , you have to fill_out an_email form and it creates a ticket , and then you have to wait 00_hours to get a response .
negative	the only response i got to my complaint was their mailing_address and a little blurb letting_me know that i should get insurance and a tracking_number when i ship the part back because they are not responsible if it gets lost .
negative	it would cost me more money to ship it back after the shipping , insurance , and restocking_fee , than i paid ... ripoff .
negative	this is the absolute_worst company i have ever_dealt_with and i will never buy anything from them again .
negative	i have never had a company blatantly mess up an order and then take zero responsibility for it .
negative	i could not rate lower_than 0_star ... my true rating would be negative ...
negative	it has_been 00 days and still no delivery .
negative	left a message on the website , no response .
negative	i received an_email 0 days after ordering g tubes that they had been shipped and i was so pleased at the quick turn_around .
negative	the package arrived today with the wrong product in it .
negative	i have called and left a message but so_far no response from the company .
negative	i am a professional bookseller who has usually been happy with the quality of the books i '_ve receive from bookbyte .
negative	however , i recently experienced a bait and switch situation on your site that i am now disputing through my credit_card company .
negative	( order #_0000000 ) it significantly cheapens your reputation when you attempt to pass off review copies for student editions , and i will no_longer purchase from bookbyte if you continue to trade in review copies that are clearly_marked " not for sale ."
negative	the simple truth is that i searched for 0000000000000 , and your website directed me to books that were not that isbn !
negative	if you persist in selling_books that are clearly_marked as " not for sale ", you should at_least ensure that your software sorts them under their own unique isbn , and not that of the student_edition .
negative	anything_else is dishonest and disreputable , and will draw the honest customers like me away .
negative	( stars rating based on this case .)
negative	contacted customer_service ; concerning products recieved don_'_t fit . and request a refund . also , made several product inqueries . i hav not heard back , from anyone .
negative	it took me 00_minutes to get a reservation booked that was more full of errors than accuracies .
negative	the call_center is located in a loud place - i heard sirens screaming nearby several_times .
negative	i love that america is a melting pot .
negative	i also believe that people should work in their strengths .
negative	the operator i spoke to had a thick accent , trouble understanding my words , and made many mistakes .
negative	he was full of incompetence .
negative	he got the date of travel , type of room , my address and zip_code wrong .
negative	when i called back to fix the errors he made , i was on the phone another 00_minutes , was told by the operator that because of all the errors they would refund my money , and she cancelled my reservation .
negative	when all was said and done , i got a snippy email from a manager who said i should have been told of the no refund policy and i would not be getting a refund .
negative	after emailing with the manager to explain all the errors again , he assured_me he would mail me a refund .
negative	i guess the check is in the mail .
negative	i will update here if i get the check .
negative	otherwise , i will be disputing the charges through my bank .
negative	i ordered from this site once , received my item damaged and sent it back .
negative	no , i did not read or see the disclaimers to not send back a damaged item , so after 0_weeks of the store having received the item and having had ample time to claim the insurance , they call & rudely insult and berrate me .
negative	not cool !!
negative	what would i want with a damaged item and why in 0_weeks did you not claim the insurance on the item ??
negative	what would i have to talk to your insurance company for ??
negative	absolutely no reason !!
negative	so disgusted with the service and will never order from this site again !!!
negative	i still have yet to receive a refund !!
negative	worst_experience ever !!
negative	!
negative	very bad customer_service .
negative	they don_'_t answer e_- mails .
negative	it took me almost a week just to find out they don_'_t have the item in their warehouse ( after numerous of e_- mails and phone_calls ).
negative	but they already took money from my account ...
negative	i canceled my booking with them .
negative	that also wasn_'_t easy process .
negative	i '_ll never shop there again .
negative	there is nice furniture in macy ’_s furniture , however the quality not that good .
negative	but delivery is complete disaster .
negative	the first time they didn_'_t come up on delivery day at all and we have to reschedule and wait more .
negative	then they come they made the huge mess with dirty overshoes , then they dropped our new dinning table and moreover tried to hide the crack was made .
negative	now have to wait 0 more months for replacement .
negative	my family and i were out of town and not expecting a delivery .
negative	fedex left three slips of paper that were scattered all over my yard along with a message on my home phone stating my package was on hold .
negative	i called the number and spoke with a woman_who could_barely speak_english .
negative	she had me spell everything i said and then told me i would have to pick_up the package over an_hour away !
negative	i live in friggen metro atlanta and that is the closest place that fedex can bring a package ?
negative	watch out , they never sent my part
negative	this is my second storage_unit .
negative	i never got a discount on the first one , so the on - site staff asked if i could have the discount that was stated when i reserved this one , but the district_manager said no .
negative	when i move out , i will never use public_storage again , even_though i think aimon and dorothy go the extra_mile to be helpful and are always cheerful and attentive .
negative	your corporate staff could take a lesson or two from you local staff .
negative	the storage_units are okay , but the lighting is not so great .
negative	i , like so many on this site , thought i was talking to la_quinta hotels when a real nice guy_named brian told me they were booked up but he could find something close by for me .
negative	i was happy with the rate he got me very close to my destination , but when i tried to change my check in date to a day later , i was told by reservation_counter that i needed to do it thru the hotel ( quality inn ).
negative	when i called qi they told me they couldn_'_t change it because i ' d booked thru expedia and they needed to change it .
negative	i called back reservation_counter and they did a 00 hour " investigation " only to tell me that the hotel wouldn_'_t let them change it , despite both the hotel and reservation_counter '_s policy that you can change or cancel up to 0 pm of the day of check in .
negative	i was calling to change on monday for my check in on wednesday .
negative	i will never use this company again .
negative	furthermore , they took the money from my card right_away and didn_'_t let_me know .
negative	i will always go right thru the hotel from now on , even if it costs a few_dollars more .
negative	live and learn .
negative	i am still confused over how they are tied in with expedia but this experience has made me leery of dealing_with expedia as well .
negative	i explicitly asked the booking agent if he was taking my credit_card number to hold the room , as many hotels do , or to pay in full , since i wanted to use a different card to pay for my room for my trip next month .
negative	he confirmed that yes , the card number was only going to be used to hold the room .
negative	the next_morning i woke_up to find a $_000 charge on my debit_card , a direct contradiction to what i ' d been told the day before .
negative	more than 00_hours after my request to cancel my reservation and have the money placed back into my account , i am still_awaiting a refund .
negative	it also took ten_minutes to book a simple two - night_stay at a hotel .
negative	i rebooked at a cheaper rate and without_having to pay in full via the actual hotel '_s website in less_than three .
negative	horrible experience from start to finish ...
negative	i '_ll be curious to see when my money is refunded .
negative	i purchased an itunes_card yesterday , and i am unable to use the card .
negative	it came up with a message " the gift_card or prepaid card you entered has already been redeemed ".
negative	i followed the instructions , and after several_attempts the same message appeared .
negative	it was a $_00 . 00 card .
negative	i would like to get access to using or sent getting another card sent to me .
negative	i called the 000number no answer , i left a message , and no one has returned my call .
negative	this is my first time and was told by a friend that uses this site ll the time .
negative	so if someone can resolve this matter at your earliest convenience i would be great fully appreciated .
negative	i have called several_times and have left messages and no one has still returned my calls .
negative	i spoke to nickie 00th_february , 0000 .
negative	she stated they were experiencing problems with the $_00 cards .
negative	so how long is it till they resolve this issue .
negative	i have purchased a new card .
negative	feb . 00 . 0000
negative	i have called numerous time to pc_game supply and to date i have not received a call back or refund for the card .
negative	twoo - der åbenbart enten er et andet navn for netlog , eller et firma der har_købt netlog har meldt mig til deres site uden at give mig mulighed for at samtykke .

negative	nu har_jeg lukket min konto , og håber dermed at undgå at mine data bliver solgt videre til næste scam .....
negative	it was late at night and i was tired .
negative	i mistakenly thought i was on the hotel '_s website when i made this reservation .
negative	i woke_up when i had to cancel this reservation and discovered they had already charged me for the room .
negative	they tell me it might take a month to be reimbursed .
negative	also , this website charges an extra $_00 . 00 fee for reserving through them .
negative	hotels do not operate this way .
negative	save your money and book directly through the hotel .
negative	very over priced garbage and very bad customer_service
negative	hello ,
negative	i have booked a flight with bravofly and there was nowhere written in my ticket or email that i had to pay for the luggage separately for airbaltic .
negative	i find that unacceptable , total_rip_off !
negative	that '_s why the ticket was cheaper on your website , because they difference and even more would be paid while paying 00eur for the luggage !
negative	poor customer_service

negative	this is the third jacket i '_m buying from superdry n i have had to write back to u with a complaint .
negative	the first one had problems with the parts of the fleece falling_off .
negative	the second one was completely ripped when i received it and now the pockets of my new jacket that '_s hardly a few_months old have started to rip .
negative	i have paid a huge amount for the jacket n the least i expect good quality .
negative	is that too much to ask for .
negative	the item looked nice online but when it arrived through the post it was screwed_up into a tiny ball and was so creased that it was impossible to tell whether it looked nice on without washing and ironing it ( which would mean you can '_t return it ).
negative	it really looked disgusting and not wearable .
negative	i complained to customer_services and received no reply for ages but in the end they said it was supposed to look like that .
negative	they couldnt / didnt provide any explanation about why it looked so different from the pictures on the website and i felt_like they were fobbing me off .
negative	once washed and ironed the shirt looks ok but i think their decision to send stuff out so screwed_up is a big mistake .
negative	i would not recommend to buy this or any item from superdry online until they start sending stuff out so they arrive in less of a mess .
negative	also , don_'_t expect any help from their customer_services team as they either don_'_t reply or just say anything to get_rid of you .
negative	all in all , the item and the response from customer_services was a big_disappointment .
negative	it '_s not exactly a cheap item so you would expect it to arrive looking decent .
negative	they send me transformer broken fuse from inside and banded metal it look it was used . after i call to exchange it i have to pay the postage again to send me so it coat me twice as much and i still don_'_t received the new one . thing before you order something !!!
negative	!
negative	i '_m disappointed .
negative	i ordered a rear wiper for mitsubishi outlander sport 0000 se and i received different to another car .
negative	i will never again shop with you .
negative	thank_you for your services .

negative	i had booked a rental_car .
negative	once i found out my flight was delayed and i would not make it to pick_up the car in time , i tried to reschedule for the next_day pick_up and i was not allowed to .
negative	i was forced to cancel the reservation and re - book .
negative	when i did that , the price was so much more for a day less of rental !!
negative	so , needless to say , i went to another company to book ... disappointed
negative	scammers !
negative	i bought a dress .
negative	it did not fit .
negative	they denied my refund .
negative	after , several emails they promised to refund the cost of the dress & shipping & instructed me to purchase a certain shipping that cost $_00 . 00 .
negative	i tracked the dress .
negative	it was delivered .
negative	they closed my ticket & did not refund my money .
negative	beware of these dishonest , money hungry , scammers ..... i am notifying the better business_bureau , pronto .

negative	tripadvisor is a global platform and this review is good for users of tripadvisor in the whole world .
negative	tripadvisor is a scam operation that endangers lives of people .
negative	for example we used flipkey / tripadvisor ( tripadvisor owns flipkey and uses flipkey to market vacation_rentals )
negative	i have been using flipkey a partner / division of tripadvisor that was introduced to me by tripadvisor .
negative	customer_service is slow ;
negative	they have a team of " specialists " including lindsay and adam , both of flipkey that sells itself as tripadvisor , who are extremely unprofessional and abusive .
negative	flipkey employees lindsay and adam put travelers and hosts safety in danger .
negative	lindsay was a racist on the phone , disrespectful , and sounded crazy .
negative	her manager adam , who is supposed to be in charge of trust and safety for flipkey / tripadvisor was encouraging her insane and unprofessional behavior .
negative	when you have a problem , if you are able to speak on the phone with them , they are snobby and unhelpful or abusive .
negative	i had already a horrible experience with a flipkey traveler , who was a scammer and ended_up costing me a lot of money and i was on my own , so definitely will not allow any flipkey traveler in my home unless i speak to them first
negative	so basically flipkey and tripadvisor when it comes to renting vacation homes are useless and dangerous they put families in danger both travelers and hosts
negative	so i am very disappointed at facebook for associating itself with dangerous scamming operations like flipkey and tripadvisor and promoting them .
negative	also tripadvisor spams your email constantly with so much junk_mail that is not even funny .
negative	many tourists go to the u . s .

negative	trustpilot is a million times more reliable and trustworthy than yelp and google reviews are also much_better_than yelp
negative	they say that a supervisor will call you and schedule a phone_call but do not call .
negative	they do not disclose their full charges at activation at the store and then they try and scam you .
negative	they say they will give you credits to try and entice you to sign_up but then they do not
negative	they want you to pay even_though service is not active
negative	customer_service never picks_up the phone - scammers
negative	in short another example of an american scamming company
negative	also service is pretty slow
negative	my part came to me wrong i order a power_steering hose and i got something_else a type of intake hose or something tried to get a return_label because the part was shipped wrong and not ordered wrong my invoice hade the wright part # just the wrong part tried using the return system they told me to pay the return fees and i did not feel_like i was at fault so my orders will never be at parts_geek again thanks not so happy_camper .
negative	booked a flight to st croix from dca on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	got to boston for my connecting_flight and was told the flight was canceled r / t lack of a crew .
negative	stayed overnight in boston .
negative	0 / 00 / 00 on standby , jet_blue could not book me on another flight .
negative	came back to dc .
negative	travelocity and jet_blue did not meet my needs in doing what i paid them to do .
negative	no body gives a damn .
negative	no customer_service .
negative	i was extremely disappointed with the service .
negative	the sight advertised how my order would be sent within 0 working days , that was over 00 days ago .
negative	when checking the delivery tracker i was told my order was on its way , to then be told there was a problem with my postcode .
negative	i emailed the customer_service dept who advised me they would look into my query asap .
negative	again , that was a week_ago .
negative	to this day i have had no product , no refund and no response despite emailing in .
negative	be careful if you order expensive items from this sight .
negative	i wouldnt give this company any good ratings at all !!
negative	! they are theives
negative	i ordered one thing .
negative	it took a month and a half for them to ship it .
negative	0_weeks_ago i called them 0 times and no one answered i left a message and it took them a week to call me back .
negative	the merchandise arrived damaged and incomplete with no matching hardware - which made it impossible to assemble .
negative	so much for " platinum service ".
negative	the delivery personnel even didn_'_t care to remove the debris , it turns_out they tacked in in my garage cabinet .
negative	moreover , i got reprimanded by the salesperson for refusing the " merchandise "
negative	and to add_insult to injury , instead of getting any apologies , i '_m still_waiting for my money to be credited_back - a week (!)
negative	after the incident .
negative	had no choice but to have my credit_card company start the investigation of this fraud .
negative	there '_s no way i ever touch anything from the same manufacturer with a ten feet pole .
negative	( naturally , the same applies to the resale website .)
negative	i read online that they hotel wouldnt charge my card until i checked in .
negative	turns_out they charged it and i still havent gotten my money back after canceling .
negative	the cancellation instructions arent clear at all either and calling bookit . com representatives is a 00 charge .
negative	absolutely unacceptable .
negative	i will not recommend nor ever use this site again .
negative	sincerely ,
negative	one extremely unhappy customer .
negative	charged credit_card , hold the order and don_'_t ship out your order .
negative	this company is a scam !!!
negative	!
negative	ami ask for copy of id , and credit_card .
negative	( illegal !!)
negative	i would not suggest this website !!!
negative	!
negative	i was told i would be charged one amount but was charged a higher price .
negative	when i called to have it fixed i was put on hold for over 00_minutes and then told they would review the recording from when i booked the reservation and that they would get back to me in 00_hours ,,,,, 0 days_later and still have heard_nothing !
negative	i am reporting this site to the bbb .
negative	my order was delayed for 0_weeks and i never once got any communication from them regarding delays .
negative	the only way i could find out any information was by calling them twice a week and having them tell me it would be ready the next week .
negative	and they only could tell me ' sorry ' and offer me a $_00 gift_card to the store in which i will never shop again .
negative	highly disappointed and frustrated
negative	my sister and i ordered items for christmas items were suppose to be delivered by december 00 , 0000 enough time for christmas right well we didn_'_t receive our items it is now december 00 , 0000 and we still_haven_'_t received our items !!
negative	so it was basically a waste of money and we still have to go out during this crazy christmas time and find outfits !
negative	very upset
negative	im waiting on the return_label to send my cartridges back .
negative	they are defective .
negative	when i called to tell them that they don_'_t work , the sales_person asked if i wanted him to email me the return_label .
negative	duh .... i don_'_t have ink to print it with .
negative	plain stupid question
negative	ami_clubwear offers free_shipping if you spend over $_00 .
negative	as i was finalizing my purchase , i had a little over $_00 in my cart .
negative	i entered the free_shipping code and it went through saying i had free_shipping .
negative	when i hit " confirm ", i received a confirmation_email_saying i had only spent $_00 . 00 , and i was charged $_00 . 00 for shipping on top of that .
negative	i noticed one of the items i had in my cart was not on this confirmation .
negative	i immediately contacted ami_clubwear and they said they could not cancel the order but they would put in a request for me to talk to a supervisor .
negative	also , when i received my items , one of the items was wrong ( shoes ) so i requested an exchange , and ami_clubwear agreed to exchange for the right item and refund my shipping .
negative	i sent the the original shoe box unharmed in another shoe box ( why would i want to pay for a box when they messed_up ), and ami_clubwear sent the package back without opening it because they thought the original box was damaged and i did not end up getting my money back for shipping or i didnt get the right item .
negative	they do not state that the item will be refused if sent in a shoe box , it obviously made it fine to their warehouse but they did not bother to open the package .
negative	i have called customer_service well over 00 times , each time requesting a supervisor , and it has now been 0_weeks since i made a complaint and i still have not heard from them .
negative	one of the customer_service ladies even hung_up on me once .
negative	this has_been such a hassle for me and i wouldnt want it to happen to anyone_else .
negative	it would have been an even bigger hassle if my bank_account only had enough for $_00 , because i ended_up being charged $_00 and it could have caused an over draft and then a $_00 fee from my bank which im sure ami_clubwear would not pay for .
negative	ami_clubwear may have cute_clothes for dirt_cheap , but you get what you pay for and they obviously do not invest in their customer_service or quality .
negative	i have had the worst_experience with this company and would not recomend it to anybody , please stay away ...
negative	i relocated from the middle_east and from the bigginin all went wrong , they do not take any responsibility for their partners there and for sure do not take any responsibility for their mistakes here .
negative	i was promised my stuff would be delivered door to door in 00 to 00 days it is almost 00 days_later and i am still_waiting .
negative	they do not communicate with me and i had to constant call to get up dated and to push them to deliver my things !
negative	it was a problem after problem after problem .
negative	staff really rude and unprofessional .
negative	clothes was not what i expected !
negative	the part with autoeurope was easy and the reservation was carried out without_any_problems .
negative	however , despite asking if there was anything still to pay , when i returned the car with europcar and them telling_me that nothing was owed , i received a bill sent to me after i was back in the usa .
negative	i had to pay it via expensive international bank routing as they do not take credit_card .
negative	the bill was for " licenses and fees " and did not specify for what exactly .
negative	this is the reason i will not use autoeurope and europcar again .
negative	the hassle afterwards was not acceptable for me .
negative	bought my ticket online and found out my flight was ~$ 00 cheaper a week_later ( they even sent me an_email_telling_me my ticket was now cheaper ), but they wouldn_'_t refund the difference because it has to be within 00_hours of purchase .
negative	i know that other airlines and companies ( like expedia ) will give the refund at any point after the ticket is booked , not just for the next 00_hours .
negative	when i called to find out about the refund i was put on hold for over 0 hour with no response , i tried_calling multiple_times with the same outcome .
negative	when i finally got to talk to a person he was very rude and rushed me off the phone .
negative	i was very displeased with my experience and will not be using travelocity in the future .
negative	i ordered ghds , total_cost £_000 . 00 .
negative	they sent an_email to tell me they had been dispached , i received nothing .
negative	called them back to enquire where my parcel was , they told me that the delivery company attempted delivery but failed .
negative	the delivery address was a company address with cctv .
negative	cctv shows no attempts were made .
negative	i telephoned lookfantastic as this was a xmas_present , they told me that they had none left in stock and had sold my set that i had already paid for , only had refund after asking for it .
negative	why did i not receive an_email regarding the parcel before selling it on to someone_else ?????
negative	?
negative	i have now gone to justbeautifully . co . uk , they took my order and have assured_me i will receive my goods tomorrow .
negative	even had free delivery with them so they work out cheaper .
negative	i ordered an item for my car .
negative	you listed the item as having four parts i received two parts .
negative	have tried to get in touch with your customer_service to no_avail .
negative	so not happy with my first experience with you and as i have read other reviews not sure i will ever do_business with you again .
negative	would not recommend you to any one else .
negative	i feel you need to be more customer active and try your hardest to try and keep a customer base and keep them happy so you would have return business .
negative	i did not receive my full order , it was one item short and i did not recieve an explanation or a credit !
negative	i orderd my pet_food on august_00th and received it sept 0th ... i will never buy there again ever
negative	they messed_up on our confirmation more than once they tired to so a up charge for adding a person to the room , 000 $ to be exact so it was cheaper for me to get my own room , then every time you call in because of there mistakes they charge you 00 $ and they still don_'_t get it right i '_ve spoken with 0 agents am they have yet to spell my name correctly , it '_s tori ".
negative	not . "
negative	tory " the customer_service speak very poor english and this site is higher_than just booking with the establishment and airlines yourself .
negative	wouldn_'_t recommend and i know the family i '_m traveling with wont either , but were stuck because they have already charged us much in fees .
negative	hopefully the riu will be worth it !!
negative	!
negative	i attempted to order items on three occasions and was let_down each time .
negative	basically the stock is poor and the delivery is worse .
negative	the hotel room ( itinerary # 00000000000 ) was the pits .
negative	first the toilet would not flush .
negative	when i tried to call the front_desk , the phone was dead .
negative	next the ac controller would not regulate the room temperature .
negative	then starting about 00pm the loud noises came .
negative	first form the bathroom , then from the roof ( we were on the top floor ) above the bedroom .
negative	who could_possibly sleep under those conditions .
negative	we checked out at 00pm and hope to get some kind of a refund either from travelocity , the hotel or both .
negative	i ordered something 0 days ago .
negative	u pay 00 . 00 for second day air .
negative	when its really not second day air .
negative	they came up with bullshit answers like did u read the policy .
negative	it says u must allow two_days to process and 0 days to ship .
negative	and then its 0 day air to get to you .
negative	all they do is give you the run_around .
negative	i was on hole for over an_hour .
negative	and no one picked_up .
negative	its a shame .
negative	i really_enjoyed this website .
negative	when someone finally does talk to you they speak to you like your an_idiot .
negative	im ashamed that i have recommended this site to my fellow army wives .
negative	they need to be more clear on the check out about the shipping .... it should not be called 0day air
negative	i ordered 0 necklaces on november 00 .
negative	i have still not received my items .
negative	i called several_times and got no answer .
negative	the one time i did get someone on the phone i was told " well your items took longer then they should have to be made but they were shipped december 0 ."
negative	the girl answering the phone told me they should still be in on time and to call back in 0 days if they were still not in .
negative	so i have called back , emailed , and posted on their facebook_wall , just to get no response .
negative	no customer_service at all .
negative	this company is terrible and i have no filed a dispute with paypal so i can get my money back .
negative	extremely dissatisfied customer !
negative	i placed my order with 00_dollar mall on 00 / 00 / 0000 and paid_extra for expedited delivery .
negative	it '_s 00 / 00 / 0000 and still do not have the items i ordered for christmas .
negative	i called to try and find out what happened to my order and the customer_service reps were rude and not helpful .
negative	as a matter of fact i was told if i would quit talking they would explain_why i didn_'_t have my product yet .
negative	i will never order from this company again .
negative	i spent my money on products i still have not received 00 days_later .
negative	incompetent , incapable , do not trust them with your christmas_gifts .
negative	if they had been honest with me and told me they were completely over their head i would have respected it and gone elsewhere a week_ago ...
negative	but now on christmas_eve they pull down all shipping info .
negative	never , ever , ever again !,!,!
negative	do not buy from them ever !
negative	i booked meet and greet with fly away parking .
negative	my car was returned with the arial broken clean off which i did not totice till i was driving home .
negative	i can not understand how this could have happened as the arial is short and only a couple of inches above the roof of the car which begs the question where are the cars being parked .
negative	since my return i have called and left messages for a month and i am fobbed_off each time i call .
negative	the two numbers provided both seem to direct you to drivers who claim to have no authority to sort this situation out .
negative	have you checked this company out .
negative	exactly how are you supposed to have any recourse if you are never able to get into contact with anyone but a driver .
negative	i have also submitted an on - line request for a call back but this also have not had any effect .
negative	what kind of searches do you do on the company '_s you recommend , surley you should have some responsibility to ensure that these companies are legitimate ?
negative	they sent me the wrong part , i have tried_calling and faxing them .
negative	i used the customer form on their website -- got stock answers .
negative	i requested that they pay the shipping to have the part sent back -- no word from them .
negative	i '_m shipping it off with the letter i faxed and the cost of the shipping included in my request for a full_refund -- we '_ll see if i get it .
negative	i think getting parts from somewhere where you can talk to a live_person is better .
negative	i purchased 0 bag of dog_food from pet_flow .
negative	they were horrible about customer_service from the get go , but the dagar in the heart was when i received my shipment .
negative	they sent me two month expired dog_food .
negative	it '_s may , the bag expired in march .
negative	:\
negative	your customer_service is rubbish , i will never order anything through you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

negative	my boyfriend ordered a jumper from boozt and convinced me to order some items too so he could get free delivery .
negative	we didn_'_t realise that the company was in sweden until after we ' d placed the order .
negative	unfortunately none of my order was any good , and the jumper my boyfriend ordered had a snag on it ( although he decided to keep it anyway ).
negative	returns signed for postage cost over_£_00 - i will not be ordering from them again !!
negative	!
negative	i was told i would receive approximately_$_00 for three books .
negative	i was very upset and disappointed to receive an_email_telling_me i was only receiving $ 0 for everything .
negative	they claimed one book was damaged and wasn_'_t worth anything .
negative	the books are used .
negative	of course they have some wear , but i would not have attempted to sell it if it was overly damaged .
negative	i '_ve used other_websites in the past and been very happy but decided to try them because they were offering me a better deal .
negative	never again .
negative	i am living in belize for a few_months and needed some car parts that can '_t be found here .
negative	i have some friends from the us coming to visit so i ordered some parts to be delivered to them to bring with them .
negative	not surprisingly this raised a red_flag because the parts are being delivered to a different address than my credit_card billing_address ( this is not the issue , yet .)
negative	i went through the annoying but understandable process of having that address added to my cc so partsgeek could verify it .
negative	then someone from customer svc asked me to send them my cc number via_email !
negative	no !
negative	people , do not send your cc over email !
negative	email is not secure and a hacker could easity steal it !
negative	it is unacceptable that cust svc would even ask me to do that !
negative	i responded as such and said i would call them with it , but there is no phone_number on their website ; please give me the phone_number to call .
negative	inexplicably , i got a snippy msg back from them saying they can '_t make international_calls and the reason they asked for my cc number was to protect me from hackers and they have cancelled my order !
negative	horrible customer_service !
negative	bought it from auto_parts warehouse with no problem .
negative	go there .
negative	i ordered online from ma to deliver to a nursing_home that same day in fl .
negative	three_days_later , no flowers were delivered .
negative	i called fde , left 0 messages , never received any call or email back .
negative	last call to them i cancelled the order , but i '_m sure i '_ll see the full charge on my next statement !
negative	now i '_m worried my credit_card is at risk !
negative	:(
negative	i am very upset with partsgeek . com as i placed an order for a part my grandson wanted for christmas to repair his s00 truck .
negative	i used my debit_card which originated at 00 . bank in paris , ky , although i am in florida presently .
negative	they wanted to ship this huge part to florida because it was my first order !
negative	:-( i immediately replied .
negative	i tried to call and it rang forever with no answer and prompts to use the email .
negative	i emailed and tried a second one which was denied .
negative	then , i wait and wait and he is excitedly watching for it , only to get a reply my order has_been cancelled .
negative	the policy of same address is a dumb one helping no one .
negative	;-(
negative	mark several item with same tracking_number and shipped only one in small box ( 0x0x0 ).
negative	when small box showed_up all item were marked delivered .
negative	something going on - in warehouse ??
negative	i got my box saved just in case i have to show to credit_card fraud department .
negative	never use you again !
negative	flowers ordered early on friday for saturday delivery ( for mother '_s day ) were never delivered .
negative	i tried to call on sunday but the wait times for customer_service were ridiculously long .
negative	finally called monday and was told that they can '_t say when they '_ll be delivered ... maybe tomorrow , maybe not , they aren_'_t sure .
negative	ended_up just cancelling the order .
negative	i will never order from telefora again .
negative	i never received my order and they tried to charge me shipping twice to reship !
negative	horrible customer_service !
negative	we made reservations in february for a may trip and most of the arrangements everything was not honored .... i complained to travelocity and of course that is still not answered .... we will never use the service again or recommend it
negative	they don_'_t guarantee the room you book .
negative	which i was not told .
negative	so when i got to my hotel which i spent an_arm and a leg for i had to stay in a room with one bed and my 0 kids had to sleep on the floor no cots in the hotel were left .
negative	i called and complained and was told i would be reached within 00_hours to resolve my conflict and i was not contacted .
negative	so do not book with this company .
negative	unless you want to be charged the same amount as the hotel and not get the room you need .
negative	and you want your kids to sleep in the floor !
negative	can '_t really say much other than ... where is it ?
negative	we have booked with book it for the past 0 years , we travel with another couple .
negative	we booked the same trip on sat both at the same time sitting side by side and our trip is going to cost $_000 . 00 more .
negative	when i called i was advised the airline price went up , in less_than 0 second ?
negative	very unhappy .
negative	i have tried zazzle twice and both_times they have failed to deliver on their claim of fast turnaround times .
negative	shame on me for giving them a second chance .
negative	they claim that they can process most orders within 00_hours .
negative	i spent 00_minutes on hold waiting to confirm with their customer care that i would receive the item on time .
negative	i even paid $_00 for expedited_shipping .
negative	they can not live up to their claim .
negative	it took days longer_than they promised to process my orders and both_times they delivered them very late .
negative	as a result i '_ve had to go without christmas cards and birthday invitations .
negative	they should not claim to provide speedy service if they can '_t live up to their promise .
negative	they set false expectations and then disappoint because they can '_t deliver on them .
negative	the quality of the cards was ok , but not worth the cost .
negative	use vista_print instead .
negative	they are much more reliable
negative	i payed extra for express shipping and the books took 0_weeks to arive
negative	as another consumer , i placed an order , was charged 0 days_later and now 0_weeks_later still have not received my order .
negative	i called 0 times ( once left a message and twice spoke with a third_party rep - apparently they can '_t answer their own telephones and need to hire an outside company to field their calls ), both of whom said they ' would relay my problem to the company ' who would then contact me - right .
negative	i have heard_nothing nor have i received my order .
negative	i tried e_- mail as their website states they respond more quickly to e_- mail , but again , no repsonse .
negative	i wish i had seen the other_reviewers comments about this company , as i would not have ordered anything from them .
negative	bottom_line - their prices may be appealing , but what good is cheap if you never receive your order .
negative	i '_m going to blame my self i checked the reviews on the parts i ordered but not the company .
negative	their policies are so ridiculous they sent me the wrong part so i had to pay to send it back which i feel is unreasonable .
negative	i didn_'_t pack the part my self so why is it my liability to pay .
negative	i returned the part and ordered from a different company the will never get my business .
negative	i placed my most_recent order in response to an e_- mail offer of a sample case of cat_food at a discounted price .
negative	i ordered the sample , plus two more cases of cat_food at full price , and all 0 ended_up in my cart .
negative	but when my order arrived , only the full price cases were included .
negative	when i contacted customer_service , they told me the discounted item had sold out .
negative	that was only a good deal for me if the discounted item was included .
negative	they should have told me before my order shipped and given me the option to cancel .
negative	i booked a studio suite in the hard rock in san_diego february 00 , 0000 ( valentines_day ) thru book it .
negative	i had booked rooms thru book it before and never ha a problem i got what i paid for , i think everyone likes to get what they paid for and promised when booking not more not less .
negative	well as i arrived i was amazed by the beautiful hotel went up to the desk and got speedy check in it was great , everything was going well but as soon as i got up to my room i was confused i had booked a studio suite with 0 king_bed and it seems my actual room was a rooms with two beds nothing of what i had seen while i booked it i was confused so called the front_desk and asked what was going on they said the whenever booking thru a 0rd_party website they don_'_t assure you will get what you initially book but that it depends on availability !
negative	i was broken hearted if that '_s all they had available to the 0rd_party websites they should say so , so at_least the customer gets what the pay for not be told afterwards we ' re going to downgrade you because you didn_'_t book directly thru us not ever happening again will make_sure i book directly next time will probably never stay at the hard rock again .
negative	i paid $_000 . 00 i would have been happy if i would have been treated like anyone_else who gets what they pay for
negative	i bought a l ' equip omni juicer which must have arrived monday 00th_november .
negative	rang friday 0th_december to say i '_m not impressed as it '_s not squeezing juice out sufficiently .
negative	i '_m told it '_s as good as any and it '_s now outside the cooling off period so unless goods are faulty i can '_t return it .
negative	£_000 down the drain because i '_m not paying good money for organic fruit and veg to put most of it on the compost - makes very expensive compost and gives me a piddling amount of juice .
negative	i emailed with a query and received a blank email in reply .
negative	i emailed back showing them the blank email and 0 days_later have no response :(
negative	i can not express what a completely horrible experience i had with travelocity .
negative	just to be clear , i am not an inexperienced traveler .
negative	i grew_up in a family that travelled constantly , and i worked for a major airlines as a flight attendant .
negative	however , my experience with travelosity was the worst .
negative	my husband booked my daughter and i a hotel room in austin texas on a saturday_night ( austin is a college town , and there are no rooms on saturday_night ).
negative	we had our confirmation in hand from travelocity .
negative	we received our email two_days prior saying ' thank_you for booking with travelocity , your booking is confirmed .
negative	ok so my daughter and i are at a business meeting on saturday and at 0 : 00_pm i receive this email from travelocity ( now remember i am in a business meeting all day , so i have not checked into my hotel .
negative	the email states : this is an urgent message regarding your reservation with the ( hotel name ) of austin for 0 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	unfortunately the hotel is unable to accept your reservation for your upcoming stay .
negative	due to these unforeseen_circumstances , we would like to offer you comparable alternate accommodations .
negative	i see this message at 0 : 00 after conference .
negative	okay so i call them , on hold for an_hour back and forth .
negative	my husband calls them , it took 0 operators and none could find we had a reservation even_though we had the confirmation number , the number for contact on the urgent email they sent me .
negative	so now it is 0 : 00 and no hotel .
negative	they can not find hotel .
negative	they send me north of austin an_hour , i drive there .
negative	oh wait , that did not work , that hotel is unavailable .
negative	so we wait in a parking_lot while travelocity calls around to find us a hotel .
negative	so finally they ask if i will drive an_hour south of austin to another hotel .
negative	a motel **** .
negative	it might as well be the bates motel .
negative	i arrive at nearly 00 :_00pm and the police are at this hotel travelocity has sent me too .
negative	police man ask me what i am doing there , and i break_down crying telling him the travelocity nightmare and they suggested this as place .
negative	he said well he would not let his family stay there , and to be very careful as they would be called back there several more times tonight .
negative	so this was a comparable motel ????
negative	i think not .
negative	so finally i drive back to the holiday_inn where the conference i was attending was being held .
negative	they were booked , i was crying , its midnight , i am exhausted , and i have my teenage_daughter and no hotel room .
negative	i do not cry easily .
negative	i had drive 0 hours for mystery hotels that did not pan out from travelocity .
negative	supposedly they said due to all the trouble i had , they would give me a $_000 credit on my next hotel stay booked thru them and they would send me voucher .
negative	guess what , that never came either .
negative	what a complete and total nightmare , never , ever , ever , even in eastern europe or 0rd world countries have i experienced as bad a travel as travelocity managed .
negative	no thanks !
negative	oh and kuddos to holiday_inn river in austin texas for getting me a room after midnight when a cancellation came through .
negative	i am ready to put the part received on craigs list and go somewhere_else for what i need ... they don_'_t seem too concerned with maintaining acceptable level of customer_satisfaction .
negative	after consulting with a fico credit specialist , i realize the credit_scores you provide are not my true credit_scores and is therefore worthless to me ..... not to mention costly !
negative	i am cancelling my service .
negative	i ordered a set of coil springs and when they arrived the numbers on the box did not match the part # of the item i ordered .
negative	matched them up to the original coil springs on the vehicle and noted the ones from partsgeek were shorter which confirmed they weren_'_t the right ones for my vehicle .
negative	there is no one to call and discuss this with .
negative	only the online customer_service ticket which just sent me an automatic return_authorization number but telling_me i was responsible for return shipping_charges .
negative	i went to ups and found out that would cost me $_00 which is > 00_% of what i paid for the coil springs .
negative	this is an_error of the company and the return shipping should be paid by them .
negative	my purchasing experience with partsgeek was , by_far , the worst online experience i have ever had .
negative	their customer_service was nonexistent , their communication was horrible ( i was forced to contact them by email about my order since they would not take calls by phone and each time received a " canned " reply which , more often than not , had nothing to do with my question ).
negative	i spent more than one week trying to get an answer to the simple question -- did my item ship .
negative	they were not capable of answering this very basic customer question .
negative	i eventually received an shipment from them , but it was the wrong item .
negative	so now the agony continues as i try to navigate their returns process .
negative	i will not be a repeat_customer .
negative	they did not meet there next_day delivery i paid for item didnt arrive for 0 days to late so item returned would deal with them again .
negative	my daughter wanted an outdoor fountain and i found this site and suggested she choose one for her_birthday .
negative	we were both excited .
negative	once she assembled it , she realized it would only produce a slight gurgle of water , nothing like the magnificent flow water represented in the photos .
negative	i paid $ 0000 for it , she paid the $_000 shipping to return it , and the company only refunded $_000 .
negative	this was an online shopping disaster .
negative	had book through_travelocity rep who screwed_up entire resevation but credit_card surely was charged instantly
negative	i don_'_t like being hurried to book a hotel because i want to know i ' d they have good service and i booked this hotel and it came out to be a worse hotel service ever !
negative	the agent was in a hurry to sell me this hotel when it was bad ... bad suggestion .
negative	i personally would never use this company again and would not recommend them to anyone .
negative	i just wish i had seen these reviews before ordering as i would have bought my headboard elsewhere for the same money .
negative	i bought a headboard and they duplicated the order , i know this as i only received one invoice and one confirmation_email , if i had done it there would be two .
negative	they say i have to pay to have the second one collected but since then have not contacted me at all .
negative	i now have a kingsize headboard sitting in my small house waiting to be moved .
negative	they have charged me twice two with no sign yet of a refund .
negative	they have not responded to my emails and there doesn_'_t seem to be a customer_service phone_number .
negative	am so fed up with it and wish i could give them less_than 0_star .
negative	they are a joke but i wont be laughing until i get my money back .
negative	** update - after_submitting a complaint someone has finally rung me and arranged for the headboard collection today .
negative	they have admitted it was their system that duplicated the order so am not to be charged the collection cost .
negative	i am waiting to see if it is collected and the money refunded in full before i change my review .
negative	my advice is to submit a complaint via the website email as this was the only way i got a response .
negative	it '_s taken me two_weeks to try to shop at debenhams online , only to have my order cancelled .
negative	first their hopeless website kept on rejecting our postcode , saying it doesn_'_t exist !
negative	trying to get through by phone took two whole days and i was given an_email address .
negative	needless to say , the email was not answered .
negative	when i finally got through , i was dealt_with by two hopeless automatons and told it was late for assured delivery !
negative	i took a chance and now two_days_later i receive a standard - format email_saying my order has_been cancelled , reasons unknown !
negative	people , don_'_t waste your time with this bunch of clowns who don_'_t want our business - go elsewhere !
negative	we have booked a superior room for 0 nights 00 - 00 august_0000 , at the rembrandt hotel , london , confirmed by your service on the 00 . 00 . 00 .
negative	today , a week_later , we phoned the hotel and were told that they have no such booking .
negative	we phoned your service and were assured by your customer care employee that the booking was passed on and that she would contact the rembrandt hotel and phone us back immediately .
negative	this did not happen .
negative	we contacted the hotel which confirmed that no one contacted them .
negative	all this in spite of the fact that the full sum was taken out of our credit_card account immediately upon confirmation .
negative	we are very worried and dissatisfied by this service .

negative	i recently_purchased an acura tsx and found out that the wheels and tire_pressure sensors were honda parts .
negative	all parts are wrong and i have been waiting for 0 days to get order corrected .
negative	still have not resolved any_issues .
negative	called parts_geek and the customer_service hung_up the telephone upon asking questions .
negative	e_mail customer_service is not working .
negative	we are still_waiting for a response from customer_service thru email .
negative	i called travelocity to use a credit for a flight for a co - worker .
negative	easy enough i thought .
negative	not so .
negative	i started this task on a wednesday .
negative	got the run_around and was on the phone for over an_hour .
negative	i called back the next_day and got the run_around again and was on the phone again for over an_hour .
negative	i asked to speak to a supervisor .
negative	was told a supervisor would call me back .
negative	i received no call back .
negative	the next_day , friday , i called back and asked yet again to speak to a supervisor .
negative	i was again told i would get a call back , by 0 p . m . that night .
negative	i transferred my work phone to my personal cell_phone to make_sure i would not miss the call .
negative	i never received a call from a supervisor .
negative	monday_morning i tried yet again .
negative	was not able to speak to a supervisor but finally had a person on the phone that was a tad_bit more helpful .
negative	i found out that we could not use the credit on any of the flights for the day we needed , going to the place we need to go to , because we had originally_booked the flight as a package deal and the credit had a very limited usability because we had gotten such a great deal on that flight .
negative	in the end , i was not able to use the credit , i lost a good 0 hours or so of work time and learned two lessons .
negative	0 ) i will never use travelocity again .
negative	0 ) i will never book travel online as a package deal with any online travel service again .
negative	i rented a unit on friday .
negative	the pushy salesperson kept saying i needed insurance .
negative	i already having insurance through my homeowners insurance and told her so .
negative	" you cannot rent from us without insurance " she insisted .
negative	but i already have the items covered , i explained .
negative	" anyone you rent from will require it " she lied .
negative	i have rented from other_companies -- including the previous owner of this very same comlex under another name --- and believe me , they never pressured me like this .
negative	i needed the unit but tomorrow morning , i '_ll be in the office complaining to the manager about this .
negative	and then i '_m going to complain to the state consumer protection agency , bbb and look into my options .
negative	what happened to me shouldn_'_t happen to anyone .
negative	it '_s against the law .
negative	stay away from extraspace storage on laguna canyon road in irvine !
negative	this was my first time ordering .
negative	i ordered a size 00 and they were not true to size .
negative	they were actually more like a size 0 .
negative	i had to sell them to a friend because i didn_'_t want to pay to send them back .
negative	it makes me wary of ordering shoes again .
negative	i ordered three books on 0 / 0 / 0000 .
negative	after i discovered that i did not need one of the books , i called the same day and cancelled the book .
negative	my card was charged the same day that i ordered the three books for all of them .
negative	as of today , 0 / 00 / 0000 , i have not received a refund for the book that i cancelled .
negative	i was told it is in the mail on the first occasion , the second time it was not input correct , and the third time i was told it was an oversight that the computer did not process the refund .
negative	i am so disappointed with bookbyte , because i loved ordering my books from them .
negative	bookbyte has lost me as a customer .
negative	i attempted to make a reservation using amoma on 0 / 00 / 00 and received an_error_message (" error 000 we - are - sorry - but - there - is - a -
negative	temporary - problem ").
negative	i thought it might have been a glitch , so i attempted to make the reservation again and again received the same error_message .
negative	assuming this was a problem with the site , i booked a hotel elsewhere .
negative	however , i was nervous_about having given amoma my credit_card information ( big mistake ), so i emailed customer care immediately after receiving the error_messages to confirm that nothing went through .
negative	i never received an_email in response to that query .
negative	what i did receive were several emails from amoma regarding my " reservation " that asked for my credit_card info as well as an_email with the subject_line " your reservation number " that did not contain any number .
negative	they also sent an_email that referred to having spoken with me on the phone , which never happened .
negative	i then saw that amoma had attempted to charge my credit_card twice .
negative	this was obviously quite concerning , so i called amoma and was on hold for over 00_minutes before i finally hung_up .
negative	i '_m going to follow_up with my bank to make_sure they know not to authorize any charges from amoma .
negative	we '_ll see if i hear back from anyone at amoma in response to the many emails i '_ve now sent .
negative	first and last time i '_ll be using this service .
negative	i advise others to steer_clear , as well .

negative	a wowcher purchased for nails and beauty .... tried to contact shop for an_appointment .... no answer ... contacted wowcher and after being passed between departments for days ... and not receiving call backs i was promised and spending a fortune on phone_calls .... received an e_- mail that basically offered no refund ... not even a credit note !!!
negative	so basically i was money out of pocket and without a wowcher sold to me by a company that was no_longer trading !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered on cyber_monday and there was a glitch in the system and pureformulas sent me a double order but only charged me for one .
negative	i called to see how to return it and i got a recorded_message_saying they would call me back , they said they did but they didn_'_t .
negative	a few_days_later i noticed they had deducted the amount for the unordered product that was that fault so i called them .
negative	they said they had called and sent a return postage to me .
negative	they also assured_me they were crediting back my money that day and i would see it in a few_days ... hasn_'_t happened .
negative	i used to love this company now i will not be buying from them .
negative	i don_'_t like their customer_service and lies .
negative	i sent the package back on saturday after i received the return .. let '_s see if they return my money .
negative	for the very first time as a frequent flier -- i missed my flight home .
negative	because i purchased my flight through you , i had absolutely no protections for this and was forced to purchase a last_minute flight home .
negative	booking through_travelocity was a $_000 dollar mistake that i intend to never let happen again .
negative	i '_m done with travelocity .
negative	tiffany heitz
negative	still have not received my order .
negative	next time will order elsewhere .
negative	horrible horrible horrible ....... still attempting to deal with them .... and so many problems .... they have no_idea what is appropriate customer_service nor do they care .... on hold for hours ..... no resolution of issues ... and they keep sending me emails that make no sense .... never deal with them .... never !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	will never book through this company again .
negative	i only found out my reservation was booked using expedia which i could have booked myself and received my expedia rewards_points .
negative	will warn everyone i know about the company reservation_counter .
negative	everytime i want to see my updated credit_report , they charge .
negative	you would think that would be included in the monthly fee which is expensive .
negative	i '_m cancelling this service !
negative	i placed an order and got email_confirmation of the order acceptance .
negative	i had paid for next_day delivery , and nothing arrived on the expected day .
negative	during the day i checked into my account online and saw the item had not even been despatched .
negative	i emailed via their online form , no reply .
negative	late that evening i emailed their customer_services again - no response , so i tried the live_chat who said the order had been cancelled and i had been refunded .
negative	i checked - no refund - they said allow 0 - 0 working days for the bank to process it ( which i know is rubbish these days ) and that i should have had an_email_informing_me about the order cancellation .
negative	i had not received any email .
negative	i asked when the refund had been made - it was made on the day my order should have been delivered .
negative	awful unapologetic , stock answer customer_services .
negative	avoid this company they clearly do not understand how shopping on the web and today '_s banking system work or what level of service shoppers expect and are due !
negative	the children '_s bellatrix costume , size small , is awful !
negative	it is supposed to fit size 0 - 0 , but the sleeves are so tight i couldn_'_t even fit my infant '_s arm through them .
negative	i will need to rip the seams and add lace .
negative	even at the clearance price , it is not a good value .
negative	they immediately got the money out of my account althought we had until the day before to cancel so we canceled the reservation and it '_s been two_days and u stoll don_'_t have my money back in my account
negative	i will never use this interparcel service again .
negative	have waited two_days for pickup after 0 phone_calls with each time false_promises that it '_s booked in and the driver will pick it up before 0 !!!
negative	absolutely disgraceful service .
negative	don_'_t use them if your parcel is urgent .
negative	we think ann robinson would be interested in this sham of a company .
negative	( watch dog )
negative	received my order in shocking condition - a dress was ripped and dirty . presumably a return which was sent out in error . needless to say i emailed customer_services and was told i could return for a full_refund . which i intentended to do anyway .
negative	received a lacklustre apology but in my opinion , very poor customer_service .
negative	i had put in order over three_weeks and i still have not receive my order but they definitely got there money .
negative	if , i order it from amazon i would have had my order in 0 days .
negative	so , what up with your company .
negative	i thought i was getting a restaurant gift_card .
negative	instead i got a discover card .
negative	i even paid you a fee to get the discover card .
negative	i will never order from you again .
negative	i ordered 0 parts .
negative	0 part for my door , and then 0 separate pieces for a friends ford mustang ( brakes ).
negative	the calipers were not in the box .
negative	i have sent two requests over the past week to have this researched and resolved and still nothing .
negative	i am furious .
negative	i normally use a different site for parts , and a friend recommended partsgeek and so_far i am not impressed .
negative	nobody had a problem billing my credit_card , but now i cannot seem to either a ) get the part reshipped ( check the weights on the shipping receipt vs the weight on the pick ticket .... if they don_'_t match the part wasn_'_t shipped ) b ) a refund ( and promptly would be nice ).
negative	i reserved the smallest possible car thru autoeurope .
negative	i was travelling_alone and knew the roads were narrow .
negative	they booked thru national car_hire and after a 00 hr flight and being left waiting for a wheelchair for 0 more hours by united , when i finally arrived i just wanted my car and get to my resort .
negative	the woman at the counter kept me for another 0 hours trying to make me upgrade and buy insurance i neither wanted nor needed .
negative	at last , when it became obvious she was not going to give me my small car , i gave in .
negative	they gave_me an elephant , far too big , dieselguzzling peugot enormous vanthey also did not show me how to operate anything on it - the stereo , cruise control , etc and all i could think was oh my god , i am going to crash this .
negative	by that time it was full dark , i ' d been up well over 00_hrs , & still had to drive to canterbury , where my timeshare was .
negative	the first night b0 i even arrived i had a flat , which the police got changed for me .
negative	for the next 0_wks i had no spare and could not reach anyone at national to help me .
negative	they kept transferring me & giving me different phone numbers .
negative	so the ineveitable happened - in the 0rd week of my 0 wk stay i crashed on a blind curve on a hedgerow lane , head - on , because the vehicle was far too wide .
negative	i was in hospital for several days .
negative	when i got out , i contacted the police about getting my things back that were in the van , but national towed the vehicle from the garage the same day , taking many of my belongings with them .
negative	could reach no one , and autoeurope cancelled my contract .
negative	none of this would have happened if not for national car_hire .
negative	i ended_up taking train for scotland for my last_week , hired a car from enterprise , a lovely tiny car like i wanted , no upsell , no_pressure .
negative	when time came to go back to heathrow , there were no trains that could get me there in a reasonable time from glasgow , so i drove south .
negative	meantime , a concussion had set in fromthe collision and my legs began to swell badly .
negative	i '_ve been to 0 hospitals now and seen 0 gp '_s and am a week late getting home .
negative	i '_m cash broke , because there is no way to get cash from a us credit_card .
negative	two_days ago i was in a & e in oxford , the dr diagnosed cellulitis in my legs , gave_me antibiotics & tols me to lie up for 0 - 0 days (!)
negative	then try and get clearance to fly from a gp .
negative	meanwhile i '_m out of my cancer pain meds and starting withdrawalsi was worse today & saw the nastiest gp i '_ve ever_seen .
negative	she accused me of touring the uk to try and get drugs ( i had all i needed for 0 month and have stretched them another week ), and also of self - wounding , because i have cuts from the accident .
negative	now it '_s bank_holiday for 0 days and i am stranded still with no likelihood of getting home soon , and a big likelihood of dying here .
negative	i '_ve had severe chest pain since i was at the gp '_s office earlier today , and all this is the fault of the greed of bnational car_rental !!!!!
negative	i have retained a solicitor about this whole thing , but may not even make it home alive .
negative	this turned my dream trip to a damned nightmare .
negative	never autoeurope again .
negative	i '_ll go straight to enterprise .
negative	national is nothing but a scam .
negative	i saw an ad on fb for this company offering great prices so i figured i would give them a try .
negative	told a friend about the ad who then looked up a coupon_code that if you spend $_00 you got $_00 off any order and free_shipping .
negative	picked out my items , inputted the coupon_code and the price was reduced to reflect such .
negative	put in my cc info and hit enter .
negative	next_day i get an_email_confirming my purchase for the dollar_amount that did not match the price with the coupon and was not the amount i agreed to pay .
negative	i wrote to the company to receive an_email back from them saying sorry the discount is on recurring_orders only ( the coupon did not have any exclusions or limitations listed on it ) i asked to have the order canceled , but did not receive an_email_confirming this .
negative	i then called to talk to a rude customer_service rep who again stated the same thing about the coupon , told me maybe the order could be cancelled maybe not , there was no way of knowing if he could get to the shipping department in time or not and i could wait and see what happens .
negative	obviously i didn_'_t receive any concrete answers from them .
negative	i then contacted google ( as this was a trusted transaction ) who 0 days_later had the answer for me that the order had been cancelled .
negative	here we are 0_weeks after i placed this order and i still have not received a refund .
negative	very disappointed in this transaction .
negative	i bought a part and needed to return it .
negative	i called , i email , i emailed again but still not return ticket .
negative	still_waiting .......
negative	i needed a turbo for my 0000_saab 0 - 0 0 . 0l ( 0cyl ), i confirmed the year , make , model , engine and vin number had my car_towed to the repair_shop with the part to be shipped to shop .
negative	wrong turbo .
negative	i was told the correct turbo is $_000 - 000 more if i wanted to get it .
negative	no thank_you .......
negative	i will never buy from this company again and neither will my rescue friends .
negative	they are not even recognized by the better business_bureau .
negative	they shipped the wrong product , then it took 0 emails to get approval to return it ( an_rma_number ).
negative	i had to send photos 0 times (!!!)
negative	to prove that the item shipped was the wrong color .
negative	still_waiting for the actual refund to come through .
negative	update_: refund came through , but still_waiting for refund of the return shipping for the product ( since they shipped the wrong product , why the hassle with getting the return shipping refunded ?).
negative	very slow responses from customer_support by the way .
negative	worse experience ever with booking hotels - 0 days before going to greece they sent an_email_saying they had a system error and my booking is not longer valid !!!
negative	i was so angry at them .
negative	they provided poor replacements for my hotel that were much worse than initially booked one !!!
negative	as a result , i had to book the same hotel using another website for more_expensive price because most of the rooms were overbooked !
negative	would never ever use them again !
negative	not recommended at all !
negative	placed an order with fommy on december 00st -- goods advertised as ready for shipment in early january .
negative	received a prompt invoice but no goods or even an alert about potential delivery delays .
negative	contacted customer_service via site '_s chat application after 00minute and counting wait while trying to reach them by phone .
negative	first support rep promised i ' d receive my goods via priority delivery on feb . 0th .
negative	items never arrived and again no courtesy message about any shipment issues .
negative	next support rep merely offered " compensation " by way of suggesting the items might arrive in early march .
negative	very frustrating experience .
negative	finally just requested they cancel my order .
negative	found same items elsewhere online -- not only with faster delivery but cheaper too !
negative	being the first time i ordered from the company i was very upset to receive someone_elses order , i had gotten my dogs all excited over the box telling them it was for them when it turns_out nothing in the box was ours .
negative	though the fella on the phone when i called was shocked to say the least he was great about it & arranged for it to be picked_up & returned & have my order sent , it doesn_'_t change the fact that such a huge mistake was made , the label on my box had all the things i ordered , so do they hire people who cannot read to fill them ?
negative	i won_'_t order again .
negative	the gift_card i purchased had already been used and as of today i have not received a refund .
negative	pretty bad first_impression .
negative	i would not feel_confident in purchasing from this company again .
negative	i bought two small sweaters for my little dogs and when i got them they were too small .
negative	i called petflo and unfortunately they didn_'_t have any that were one size larger or even 0 . they emailed me a return_label on email which i never did figure_out .
negative	not sure what to do .
negative	i can '_t use the sweaters and it '_s very cold up here and they need them badly .
negative	i won_'_t be buying from petflo again .
negative	susan watts
negative	you changed the dates and times of my flight and were not able to fix it and i couldn_'_t use the flight and lost all of my money .
negative	i will not use your service again .
negative	vital_choice is usually wonderful but i never got my last order
negative	i think all these " positive " reviews are posted by friends of the company to make themselves look good ... just saying .
negative	ordered a fishing pole for vacation , it was supposed to get here thursday , fedex delayed the shipment to where it arrive tuesday because they said they dont deliver on monday , i made an online account to track and customize my delivery through there website i called them and had left directions on there website to call me when they are on there way to deliver my package so i can give them detailed directions ive even put up signs for them and even wrote a note for them on my mailbox to call me , as ive had trouble with them before leaving packages by the highway and getting lost and taking the wrong driveway and getting stuck , ive lost 0 packages to date one ran over by a semi another stolen , i sat here waiting for my package to arrive till 0 it never got here i finally went on the website to track it and they put a message up that the driver could not find my house , i called them immediately i asked them if they got my delivery instructions online , no , i asked them if they got the relayed message from when i called earlier in the week , no i asked them if the driver saw the signs i put up , no they told me they couldnt do anything that id have to wait the next_day i offered to meet the driver to get my package so id have it in time for vacation again , no , customer_service is useless , there delivery drivers do not give a crap about your package or whether you will get it or not , and there website is a waste of time fedex you are useless and i hope that i never have to deal with you or your service again , i tried everything to make_sure my package would get here and that i could help the driver find my house i gave them 0 phone numbers step by step directions and nothing they dont even try , my suggestions , fix your website , hire drivers that care about what they are delivering and how and when it will get there , customer_service actually do something for your customers instead of yourselves , sorry to inconvenience you by wanting my package here on time , not , but as far as im concerned fedex is useless , fire your delivery driver before he eventually gets you sued
negative	paid for next_day delivery which did not happen and did not arrive the day after that .
negative	had to cancel order
negative	one thing i have noticed is that garden winds only prints the 0 - star reviews on their site !
negative	the two reviews i have written ( at their request ) never seem to see the light of day ( shocking !).
negative	we were unhappy with our cover because it turned_out to be not waterproof at all , something you ' d think a gazebo cover would be !
negative	it '_s not even water - resistant , as one summer rain and our patio - furniture and all - got soaked .
negative	the gazebo material is also much thinner_than the original , so it probably also doesn_'_t offer as much protection from the sun .
negative	we ' d return it but it is such a hassle to get it on and off , plus we had to add some gromits to make it fit , which i '_m sure kills the warrenty .
negative	i don_'_t know what we ' re going to do with it this winter , not that it will last the whole season anyway .
negative	i don_'_t know why you ' d even sell a gazebo cover that isn_'_t waterproof ; it '_s not like we all live in the sahara .
negative	i have used expedia many_times in the past .
negative	i recently tried to purchase airline_tickets from chicago to los_angeles .
negative	every time i went to purchase my ticket , the price keep going up !
negative	after the 0th time that happening , i went to cheap0air . com and got my ticket at the low price expedia couldn_'_t get !!!!
negative	never use expedia again !
negative	disgusting service , trying to talk to operators that cant speak proper english its so frustrating all they seem to do is go round in circles and make your blood boil .
negative	00 bloody minutes i was on the phone , being put on hold talk talk disgusting customer_service
negative	its a wonder they get any customers really ...
negative	it took 0 phone_calls for the first reservation , could not get the right number of people per room .
negative	then tried to give me a cheaper room that was non_refundable when i already had a refundable one .
negative	second call , when i thought could not get worse was !
negative	made reservations - and asked about parking price and told it was free !
negative	when i got my confirmation , 0_adults and 0 children - should have been 0 and 0 .
negative	on hold for 00_minutes while he tried to figure_out changing that .
negative	questioned the parking fee and again on hold and finally his comment to that was that the hotel charges for that - did they not charge for that on monday !!!
negative	very poor customer_service and don_'_t know if i will ever stay again at holiday_inn express , if i have to talk to these people .
negative	i made my reservation through priceline and had a confirmation number .
negative	when i arrived at the hotel , i was informed that they had no rooms available that priceline had been notified and that priceline was suppose to contact me .
negative	i never received a call or notification from priceline .
negative	while in the hotel_lobby called priceline and after being transferred several_times , i did not receive a reasonable explanation nor did priceline resolve the issue .
negative	the hotel that i frequently stay at , took pity on me since i am there at_least monthly and found a room that was in the process of being remodeled .
negative	while not perfect at_least i had a place to lay my head after driving for 0 hours .
negative	i ordered a part with next_day shipping and they immediately charged my card .
negative	the next_day i did not receive the part or a confirmation that it was shipped .
negative	i tried to contact the company then receive an_email_stating i will receive a refund with no_explanation why .
negative	i received a refund however it was not for the total amount charged on my card .
negative	i have attempted to contact the company and have had no response .
negative	very disappointed with this company and will never order from them again !!
negative	!
negative	i ' d like to share with you the response i got from an_email i sent to the opticsfast customer_service :
negative	this was my email :
negative	well , i finally got a confirmation that my glasses have been mailed out .
negative	i want to know why my shipping was not expedited ?
negative	i am receiving these glasses thirty days after i had ordered them .
negative	thirty .
negative	not ten -- which is the estimated amount of time that your email sends out when the payment is confirmed .
negative	this is absolutely asinine .
negative	the most this company could '_ve done is at_least sent them off as priority and not ground .
negative	for a company that cares_about people doing reviews - you would think they would do some form of compensation for their customers when they are obviously unhappy .
negative	this was the response i received :
negative	you placed the order on 00 / 0 ( i actually ordered these 00 / 0 )
negative	today is 00 / 00
negative	this is 00 days and is 0_weeks
negative	rx orders take 0 - 00 days to process
negative	and you choose free_shipping 0 - 00 days ( free_shipping said 0 - 00 days )
negative	hence i am a little delayed and this is due to :
negative	0 .
negative	lab tech had the flu
negative	0 .
negative	jewish holidays 0 days of each of month they where off
negative	0 .
negative	op is the slowest company on the face of this earth .
negative	you saved about hmm maybe $_000 from retail_store and you still are behaving this way ?
negative	- leaving her name anonymous .
negative	this is not how you handle unhappy_customers .
negative	i could not believe the flippant sarcasm and unprofessional response that came from this worker .
negative	i will never be ordering from this company again or referring them to friends and family .
negative	this was ridiculous .
negative	bath did not show up due to better_bathrooms error in the booking .
negative	no compensation given for loss of days pay / holiday .
negative	speaking to management .
negative	awaiting delivery .
negative	arrived at our destination to find a smoking_room was booked .
negative	could not get the booking company to process a refund .
negative	at the suggestion of reservation_counter , i spoke directly to the hotel manager to ask him to allow the booking company to process a refund .
negative	the manager refused , declined to give us the room that was booked and called the police when i refused to leave without a refund or a room to stay in .
negative	reservation_counter should have processed the refund and left the customer out of the situation .
negative	i paid for a room i was not allowed to use .
negative	the customer_service number in the united_states is a mailbox and not manned by an individual .
negative	a scam !
negative	!
negative	i am a travel_agent and i had clients booking a trip to dublin and paris , i found a decent priced flight for the clients to return home and tried to book it on the travelocity website , i got an_error_message so i called into travelocity and had an agent help me book the ticket .
negative	i then got a call the next_day from air_lingus stating that there was a double booking for these clients .
negative	i called travelocity and they said yes , there was a double booking .
negative	i asked that they refund the second charge to my clients since this was a double booking on the same flight and it was due to their website not working_properly , they advised , very rudely , they could only refund the taxes , the rest was non_- refundable .
negative	nick advised it would take too long to hold if they called air_lingus , besides , airlingus would just say it wasn_'_t refundable also so i shouldn_'_t even_bother calling them .
negative	( yes , that is what he said ) naturally , i did not want my clients charged an extra $ 0000 for duplicate tickets of the flight they have already paid for so i called air_lingus ( 0 minute hold time ) and was advised the tickets can most certainly be refunded , travelocity would just have to call in and get the waiver code , no_issues .
negative	i had my contact at air_lingus note the record well so i could have travelocity call them and get the correct information .
negative	i called travelocity back and spoke with justin and was told that i had already spoke with someone earlier twho told me this was non_- refundable .
negative	i advised that i have spoken with air_lingus and it most certainly is refundable , i need someone from travelocity to call air_lingus and get the waiver code , the record is noted with everythign we need and they are expecting a call .
negative	of course , justin at travelocity argued with me that it would take too long for them to answer , he could have his boss call me within 00_hours .
negative	i advised that this was unacceptable and i would like to speak with the supervisor now , he finally put james on the phone who said he would call air_lingus and get back with me in an_hour , james the supervisor could not give me his last name , an extension to reach him or an_email address to contact him .
negative	i had to leave it in his hands with no way to get back with him should he give me the same customer_service his last two team_members gave_me .
negative	thankfully , he called back and gave_me the refund with no_hassles at all , he just mentioned how he had to be on hold for so long , those customer_service agents really hate being on hold .
negative	thank_goodness i am a travel_agent and know that you cannot screw people over like this , in all of our expierience , if you book two seats on the same flight for the same person , they both automatically cancel , here , travelocity just goes ahead and charges them double with no refund .
negative	i feel so terrible for the average_person that is not aware of the rules , i can only imagine how much travelocity takes advantage of them and simply steals their money .
negative	i called into travelocity because the " convienient " website wasn_'_t working , it ended_up costing my client an extra $ 0000 until i fought for them for 0 hours of my busy monday to get a fair refund .
negative	this was unacceptable and i as a travel_agent and consumer will never use or recommend travelocity .
negative	you can contact me regarding the clients names and reservation numbers if needed .
negative	i would love to give this company 0_star but it didn_'_t let_me post this comment without_any star !
negative	i ordered ceramic plater and a box of chocolate for my mother '_s for mother '_s day .
negative	i selected the day when i wanted to deliver the parcel it arrived two_days earlier as i requested without a box of chocolate .
negative	i asked a refund for the chocolate they said the money refund takes between 0 - 0 days .
negative	after a week i sent another e_- mail to the company that the money hasn_'_t been refund .
negative	the answer was depend_on what banks it can take up to 00 days .
negative	are you kidding ?????
negative	even international banking transfers takes up to 0 days .
negative	i won_'_t use this company ever again !
negative	we bought a portable dvd_player from 0 wise monkeys and when i used it for the first time the screen was cracked ( about 0 week after receipt ).
negative	i tried to get the company to help with a replacement or repair but they refused and told me i was on my own .
negative	when i complained to the credit_card company they twisted my words and used my attempt at being truthful ( as to not knowing when the player was damaged even_though i also mentioned that it was boxed , was never used and i was willing to take pictures of the item to prove that it had not been used / still had the protective plastic wrapper attached ).
negative	avoid this company and find another place to buy your electronic goods .
negative	if we had purchased this from amazon they would have exchanged it without_question .
negative	upon using petflow for only the second month , somehow i unknowingly altered a ship date for a product already being prepared for shipment .
negative	so , in turn was sent 0 of the same product .
negative	being that this part of their site is obviously a tad confusing , and after receiving 0 of the same item ( 00_lb_bags of dog_food ) i immediately called wondering what happened since my profile only shows i ordered one .
negative	i was told there was nothing they could do for me since their system showed it was requested .
negative	they were of course willing to accept any unopened items , but this meant me having to pay the shipping expense out of my own pocket , which were more than likely cost roughly half or more of what the food cost me .
negative	i explained this was just a mistake that i wasn_'_t even aware was made , and that this being a new food for my dogs - wasn_'_t even sure they would like - or would like them .
negative	i certainly didn_'_t intend to purchase 00_lbs of something that may go to waste .
negative	the representative reiterated that there was nothing they could do for me .
negative	i even asked if they could do a one time override and pay the shipping to return , they didn_'_t want to help a customer at all .
negative	and , having a giant dog and 0 voracious puppies , i could have been a loyal_customer .
negative	i will have to give them a one star for lack of service .
negative	this is what makes or breaks a company , no_matter what they sell or their prices .
negative	you suck and your tech_support sucks too
negative	never ever buy a leather suite from f . v . the customer_service is terrible and they refuse to answer letters .
negative	we purchased a leather 0 seater electric recliner sofa 0 years_ago which said the 0 year_guarantee covered everything , but when you read the terms and conditions in the small_print it excludes more or less every_aspect of the sofa .
negative	it started to peel on the headrests after 0 years and got worse the more i tried to clean the area where your head rests when you recline .
negative	so i rand to complain and they sent a man to look at it and he said i can tell you now they will say its wear and tear , i said how can it wear out after 0 years .
negative	i then received a letter saying it was my fault because i had removed the coating whilst cleaning .
negative	so i rang trading_standards and they said in there opinion it had not lasted a reasonable time and was not fit for purpose and should write back by recorded delivery saying that we demanded a refund or a repair .
negative	i can tell you we got neither , they sent another upholsterer who said that whatever i had cleaned it with it would have happened even with f . v . s own guardsman cleaner as its caused by perspiration and that they were not meant to last and suggested we repair it ourselves at our own cost and they buy a cover to protect it and take it off when we have visitors could not believe my ears ," have you ever tried to cover a leather sofa ?
negative	they keep falling_off " i sent a further letter to say i was disgusted that they are selling leather that '_s not fit for purpose and that the leather was inferior as it is made in china .
negative	of course i received no reply .
negative	as we are pensioners and can '_t afford as suggested by trading_standards to take the matter to court .
negative	we are now left with a leather recliner sofa costing over a thousand pounds that looks terrible .
negative	so be warned don_'_t buy from furniture village .
negative	linda twohig .
negative	not a good experience .
negative	first time i had a problem with them normally a great experience but not this time .
negative	probably will order from somewhere_else next time .
negative	your website is very misleading i booked with you for meet and greet but at the end of the booking it was a car_park i have lost £_00 and even_though it states on your confirmation that i would be allowed to cancel up to 00_hours before i am told that this is not the case .
negative	i will not be using you again .
negative	first the person asked me if i wanted a king or two queens , told she king and got two queens , second there was suppose to be a group rate and she couldn_'_t find it so booked anyway and was told to call back the next_day to talk to a supervisor .
negative	called back the next_day and they couldn_'_t change the price .
negative	so i cancelled this reservation and called the hotel direct , no_problems at all .
negative	should have done that first .
negative	ive used 0000_rpm a few_times and am very dissapointed with the service i recieved on this occassion , i did nt even get a call to say sorry but we have had a problem today and will not be able to deliver your package , if i had recieved good customer_service my view would be different but the seervice was very poor .
negative	ich_kann vodafone nicht weiterempfehlen .
negative	hatte bis heute nur probleme mit meinem vertrag und vor allem den schlecht informierten mitarbeitern .
negative	terrible service .
negative	they do not do what they claim .
negative	they will not call you back and continously give you the run_around .
negative	i will never order from this company again and i will warn everyone i know about their poor service .
negative	i only gave them 0_star because it would not let_me give them the 0 they deserve .
negative	i went online to sign_up , there were no instructions regarding it , but because i entered both my physical_address and the p . o .
negative	box where i received mail that goes to that physical_address , your computer could not deal with it and i either have to submit excessive paperwork or cancel it and wait 0 hours to sign_up .
negative	how ' bout i just cancel it , period !
negative	the experience cost me 000 . 00 ... for a plain ticket to go see my granddaughter for the first time .... and yes i did take out the insurence for the trip .... and a few_days before i was to leave ... social services took her away ... and called to cancel ... and found out that any reason .... is not covered .. and yes i printed all the papers on the insurence coverage .... this is the last time ... i will ever use this agency .
negative	( travelocity ).. and i will let everyone know . thank_you
negative	told me part coming from new_york came from ca customer_service is like a tag game email back and forth , called corp his email is so full you can not leave a message .
negative	think before you buy from them .
negative	these our not good customer_relations to have ..............................
negative	i ordered dog_food on thursday expecting to get my order by tuesday at the latest .
negative	on saturday , i hadn_'_t received a shipping confirmation , so i checked the website .
negative	backordered .
negative	no notice .
negative	tried to email the company , no email listed on the website .
negative	i couldn_'_t call as i was in a different country ordering food to be sent to my dogs ' caretaker .
negative	i posted on their facebook_page .
negative	no one answered my plea for help , but the facebook_page kept getting updated with animal videos .
negative	i tried to cancel the order , but the website wouldn_'_t let_me and informed me that i needed to call petflow .
negative	i finally received a reply on monday and had the entire order canceled .
negative	my dogs ' caretaker was forced to purchase a small bag of food of a different brand to fill the gap created by petflow '_s incompetence .
negative	the only_reason i initially ordered from petflow was due to a coupon offer .
negative	never again .
negative	i was disappointed in the intensity and flavor of the coffee .
negative	i '_m now stuck with 00 capsules .
negative	i will not order again .
negative	will stick to actual nespresso .
negative	i went to the hotel he read back and had no reservations .
negative	ended_up having reservations at a hotel almost 00_mins from my family , then when got to the hotel he booked he had booked a king_size bed instead of the two queens i asked for and he said i had .
negative	the beautiful frames arrived , but bent .
negative	true , they have the option to return , but you will have a 00_% restock_fee ; 00_% of the lens price ; not worth sending back .
negative	the only positive thing ; the wonderful customer_service rep brandi - she was the sweetest person .
negative	would not buy again , buyer be careful !
negative	took my money (£_000 ) from my account in january .
negative	delivery cancelled again today til ' end of february .
negative	i am not !!!
negative	liz gardiner !!!
negative	!
negative	i am_currently trying to sort out the mess that hermes have caused .
negative	apparently someone at my address signed for the parcel which is not true , when i contacted hermes through facebook i was told it was not there fault and to contact the people i ordered off ???
negative	hermes have obviously delivered it to the wrong_address or lost it ( who_knows which ) when i eventually received a call back from hermes a very off woman virtually accused me of lying and told me that the driver had given it to someone stood in the porch - we don_'_t even have a porch ??????
negative	she the made excuses and put the phone down .
negative	i have tried_phoning the number which is being posted in posts below and they told me " there is nothing hermes can do " when i asked who do i get my money back from he didn_'_t have an answer ??
negative	so i have facebooked , phoned and emailed as suggested by hermes as a follow_up to the previous posts and i still don_'_t have any answers so i think the next option will be the papers and trading_standards - maybe then they will take notice of the people who pay them - customers .
negative	how about sending my orders with someone_who actually brings the parcel to my home or would answer the phone or would leave the correct label or calling card number on the calling card ?
negative	that would be great .
negative	i can '_t get the parcel , no one answers the phone , the numbers are wrong and i have no_clue where the next fastway office is .
negative	can '_t find an address .
negative	so this is my experience .
negative	the parcel is close but how can i get it ?
negative	the question of the week .
negative	i have used this company on several_occasions .
negative	recently ordered 0 pearl drops party sparkle and was sent 0 other pearl drops items .
negative	since there was no returns note i rang the company on several_occasions and left email messages .
negative	office always closed and no reply to emails .
negative	in the end i used a paypal dispute , to which they did not respond , and i did get my money back through paypal .
negative	i am surprised the website is still up and running as something is definitely not right with this company !
negative	har skrevet til jer på fb og på jeres hjemmeside om at jeg stadig ikk har modtaget min_pakke trods at i har trukket pengene .
negative	bestilte den 0 / 0 og i trak pengene den 0 / 0 .
negative	jeg_har stadig ikk set skyggen af min_pakke og i er slet ikk til at få fat på .
negative	undskyldning er at postdanmark ikke kan finde ud_af at få jeres produkter ud .
negative	og efter at ha ringet til jer og fået at vide at jeg bare skal kontakte jer på fb , så får man ingen respons hverken der eller på jeres hjemmeside .
negative	syns lidt det her lugter lidt af fusk !
negative	kræver sgu snart at få mine_penge tilbage !
negative	i ordered green_coffee bean extract on may0 .
negative	haven_'_t received it as yet .
negative	can '_t call customer_service as their mailbox is always full .
negative	i am very disturbed by this .
negative	website is a poor line of communication .
negative	you know what '_s worse ?
negative	trying to talk to an actual human_being .
negative	it is just this side of impossible .
negative	i have better odds of winning the lottery .
negative	i know the insurance world is completely jacked , but that is eh y i paid more to go through this place .
negative	i guess the joke is on me .
negative	loved the great price on my upcoming_trip but within 0 minutes of clicked " purchase " received an_email_saying my card has_been compromised .
negative	had to then cancel the card , order a new one and now back track and change all my items that are automatic withdrawal .
negative	grrrrrrrrrrr
negative	yet to still receive my delivery .
negative	i am waiting for them to rectify the situation .
negative	totally disappointed expect something to do done asap
negative	i ordered tons of things to make the 00 $ free_shipping , after about 0 different times they took off 0 different things saying they were sold out but the website did not say they were .
negative	so everytime my information was there correct so i just had to hit the submit_button ... it said my total with the free_shipping went through .
negative	i got an_email for paypal saying it was 00 some dollars and it was suppsed to be only 00 some .
negative	the shipping code went through but didnt take it off .
negative	they wrote back to me and told me that it was too late but yet i wrote them immediately .. i checked my email right after i submitted it .
negative	then they sent the items have been shipped email .
negative	rude , ignorant , and horrible customer_service .
negative	spent a day trying to find some way to contact these people to try to change bookings due to emergency . you get a recorded_message asking for your credit_card details n then you don_'_t get connected .
negative	absolute waste of time and money .
negative	avoid at all costs
negative	we engaged bbe in early february .
negative	the initial letter and notes were issued late and were full of errors .
negative	emails and phone_calls went unanswered and we eventually learned that the solicitor dealing_with the case had left the firm and that they were closing the preston branch .
negative	the head of department did telephone but was hostile and unhelpful and we transferred our case to another firm .
negative	0_weeks_later and no further forward despite a clear instruction to proceed with court action .
negative	shoes were lost in shipment , today i have no money back
negative	i ordered a book from here and waited two_weeks before looking into it only to realize they had cancelled my order without notification or reason .
negative	luckily i have enough time to order from another site before school starts .
negative	makes me very weary about ever using them again .
negative	on 00 / 00 / 00 an order was placed with them for a cute little arrangement with a teddy_bear and balloons for my 0 year_old '_s birthday to be delivered 00 / 00 / 00 which was the day of her party .
negative	she could not wait to get her special delivery even_though she did not know exactly_what it was going to be .
negative	it got to be around 0 pm on 00 / 00 so i called customer_service and finally got a live_person_who assured_me they were still scheduled to be delivered that day .
negative	she even put me on hold and said she tried to call to see where the delivery person was but no one answered .
negative	i knew everyone was busy with mother '_s day orders so figured things were moving slow that day for florists .
negative	well the day came and went and no delivery .
negative	i checked the order number online ( order #_000000 ) the next_day and it now says it '_s scheduled for re - delivery with no_explanation .
negative	i called customer_service back and was told again that it would be delivered that day .. now sunday 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	she also said there was no reason that she could see as to why they weren_'_t delivered when scheduled and put me on hold to call the delivery person .
negative	she came back on the line and said again that she couldn_'_t get anyone on the phone but that they were out today doing deliveries and she was sure it would be there that day .
negative	she also took my number and said she would personally check on the status and call me back in a bit .
negative	i never got a call back and no arrangement came .
negative	the whole weekend my daughter knew she was getting a little something special delivered to her and she waited_patiently and nothing ever came .
negative	00 / 00 / 00 was the day of her party which is why they were scheduled for delivery for that day .
negative	her_birthday has now came and went .
negative	i sent an_email to this company as well with no response .
negative	unacceptable customer_service .
negative	if someone had just stayed in touch with me or just said " hey we screwed_up sorry and we '_ll correct it " would have been fine but do not string customers along with false_promises .
negative	my money was immediately taken though .
negative	i still have not heard from them about making this right for my 0 year_old .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	i tried to return the book they sent me ... as it was the wrong book ... and it has now come_back to my house twice ... either they have given the wrong_address out for returns or they really want to screw people out of their money .
negative	i went in to get new living_room furniture and left absolutely upset .
negative	soo i go in , choose the furniture i want , only to be told it '_s not in stock .
negative	cool , they tell me they '_ve already ordered several sets and it should be in within a week , 0 at the most .
negative	0 week passes , i heard_nothing .
negative	giving the benefit of doubt i wait out the 0nd week .
negative	still nothing .
negative	finally i call and they say " 00 days until we get it in .
negative	if within 00 days we don_'_t have it we will go to another one of our stores and get it ."
negative	if it was that easy why not do it from the start ?
negative	alright finally a month later i receive the call that the furniture is in .
negative	the furniture is delivered only to be disappointed all over again because it '_s not the color i ordered .
negative	so i go to the store and complain and ask if there '_s anything we can do .
negative	she offers me what they have on display .
negative	after considering it i agree only if they refund me some money since what i paid for was something new , not something everyone in orlando has sat on and tested .
negative	she then laughs and says nope we don_'_t give refund " unless you don_'_t get what you wanted " i just stared at her and said " but i didnt " she then offers only $_00 , finally after arguing with her for about 00_minutes i got $_000 back and used cushions .
negative	i will never ever return to this place .
negative	i rather spend over $ 0 , 000 on the exact_same furniture somewhere_else than to ever go back .
negative	not happy at all .
negative	costume was not made well .
negative	tie in the back ripped completly off the belle costume i ordered immediately .
negative	shipping was quick but very disappointed and did not have all the sizes i was looking for .
negative	i ordered $ 0 , 000 .
negative	worth of bedroom_furniture and after i was delivered 0 dresser mirrors instead of a headboard they american_freight had enough nerver to ask me to bring them the mirror in my vecile ( after i already paid $_000 to have it all delivered and yet still a week and a half later still dont have my new headboard that i paid for .... very dissatisfied
negative	i have cancelled my order as my vet has changed my cat '_s special_diet .
negative	i sent petflow an_email and never_heard back , but the boxes keep_coming !
negative	how do i get out of this ?
negative	also cans have " exploded " on their way to me .
negative	once again , emailed petflow with no response !
negative	please don_'_t use these people .
negative	despite having booked and paid online they left me at dalaman airport - there was nobody to meet me , the desk was empty and i waited over an_hour !
negative	a few_days_later and they haven_'_t contacted me to apologise or offer a refund .
negative	they are absolutely disgraceful and you ' d be better walking ... at_least that would be free .
negative	i have been a long time customer of travelocity and i must_say that i have never been so disappointed in them .
negative	i am a frequent user and i have also just received a $_000 statement credit for my 00 , 000_+ points with my travelocity american_express card .
negative	the past 0 months have been nothing short of a nightmare .
negative	from my inability to use a $_00 future trip discount ( which i '_ve had since 0 / 0000 and it will expire soon ) i have attempted to use this discount on a number of occassions and there is always some excuse why i cannot .
negative	i have also had bad_experiences the last two occassions i have booked flights with them .
negative	the most_recent reservation was a nightmare .
negative	i booked a flight for my daughter to go see her boyfriend before he deploys to afghanistan , only to find out from the airlines directly that the flight i booked was not available and should not have been sold by travelocity .
negative	i have always given travelocity great reviews to my family and friends , but their customer_service has gotten horrible .
negative	there was a time i never would have considered using anyone but travelocity for my travel needs , im sorry to say that has changed .
negative	when expressing my disappointment their representative during a recent phone conversation , i received a cold and uncaring response with no offer to speak with anyone further .
negative	what kind of customer_service is that ?
negative	i called when i left home , 00_mins_away from airport and explained i was on my own in car and didn_'_t have hands free .
negative	was told had to phone when i was on the m00 .
negative	tried_calling when on m00 - took 0 attempts before somebody picked_up .
negative	when i returned from holiday it took 00_minutes for car to be returned - apparently the driver had been stopped for a police check .
negative	my car computer showed the engine had only been running for 0 minutes - i question how long a police check would take .
negative	on it '_s return my car was absolutely filthy , covered in mud on the outside and also in the drivers footwell .
negative	i was very displeased with part of my furniture that i bought being sold out from under me before i could pick it up .
negative	then when i came in to pick it up i was told that they didn_'_t have any more .
negative	on top of that , the ottoman that went with our sectional was out on the floor as a display .
negative	your store showed a large lack of organization and concern when they clearly messed_up our order .
negative	i highly doubt i ever buy anything from there again .
negative	asked for expedited_shipping .
negative	item has not been received yet .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	it '_s friday , it was supposed to be here tuesday .
negative	this is the second time this has happened to me .
negative	i will not use metro_swim shop again .
negative	these people have the absolute_worst customer_service .
negative	they do not even warrant the one star i '_ve given them .
negative	i sat on hold this morning for almost 00_minutes before i eventually got too frustrated and hung_up the phone .
negative	someone called me back about an_hour later , but this person could not speak_english , even slightly .
negative	i politely asked for someone_else so i could better understand and she told me i ' d have to be transferred and put on hold .
negative	i then asked for a supervisor and to my surprise ( ha ) one was not available .
negative	she promised to have her supervisor call me back .
negative	it '_s now hours_later and i haven_'_t received a call from anyone , and still nobody is answering on their end .
negative	this is ridiculous .
negative	i will never use this company again .
negative	the flights on this website are no cheaper_than the actual airline websites and the customer_service here is horrendous .
negative	do not use them .
negative	i got the wrong mirror because i read the mirror i bought as stated in the information that this was the only mirror to get for my 0000 yukon and it said fully loaded .
negative	which it wasn_'_t .
negative	there was another option that wasn_'_t listed so i called you guys three_times and your message hangs_up on you after holding for so long and if your holding before you close and during that '_s what happens .
negative	so i left a message in email and no one yet will return my call .
negative	i asked for a return number as well and didn_'_t get one yet either and its been 0 days now .
negative	all i want to do is order the new one and return the other one .
negative	i guess that '_s too hard to do .
negative	nothing to review my ordewr that i got wasa a empty envelope !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a onesie as a christmas gift .
negative	it was not particularly cheap at £_00 but when it arrived is was very poor quality .
negative	fabric was thin and tacky and almost looked bald in places .
negative	the stitching was poor and it was like something i could have picked_up from a market for half the price .
negative	i have ordered from boo_hoo before but this experience has put me off as i have ended_up out of pocket having paid postage .
negative	worst online experience ever !!!
negative	company is overseas so when booking was nothing like i had entered was a pure nightmare to get resolved !!!
negative	was on the phone for hours with multiple people from multiple companies trying to get problem resolved .
negative	then had to pay more !!
negative	never again !
negative	0 . i did order something that required 0 - 00 days wait time , but they haven_'_t ship my order even_though i have been waiting for 00 days ago .
negative	0 . i found out that clothing . net selling the same brand same shirt for usd00 . 00 , but yes_style . com sell that for usd00 . 00 . not gonna return / cancel the order even_though i know yesstyle charged me way too much .
negative	i '_m going to leave a review , so people can check fashion0us . com / clothing . net for price matching .
negative	wrong_address was put on package and instead of correcting it with ups they chose to have parts returned .
negative	we have been waiting over 0_weeks and still do not have parts .
negative	this is ridiculous !!!.
negative	also , cannot call but must " put in a ticket ".
negative	will not use them again .
negative	first of all , i was not told that reservation_counter was a third_party booking_agency .
negative	i thought that i was speaking directly with days inn .
negative	i did not authorize the agent to complete the transaction because i found a cheaper price with wyndam rewards .
negative	i begged the representative to back out of the transaction .
negative	instead she transferred me to another agent who assured_me that the transaction was not completed because he could not find it in the system .
negative	that night , to my surprise , i received a confirmation_email .
negative	i promptly canceled it since i already booked with wyndam rewards .
negative	plus the motel said that they never received the reservation from reservation_counter .
negative	after countless hours on the phone with this dishonest company , i still have no resolution .
negative	this company basically stole $_00 . 00 from me .
negative	beware !!
negative	!
negative	i specifically_asked about amenities available at the site and they lied .
negative	i also asked if they were hilton and - yep !
negative	- they lied .
negative	i will be more careful next time - on me for not noticing that my call had been sent over to a booking_agency when i thought i was dealing_with central reservations at the hotel .
negative	when will it arrive ?
negative	?
negative	used a comparison site that showed this company were offering the most cash for my iphone .
negative	dont let this fool you !
negative	my phone had always been in a case and only had a tiny scuff on one edge .
negative	when the received it they knocked £_00 off the offer for moderate wear and tear .
negative	then they would charge you money to have your phone sent back !
negative	they received my handset on 00 / 00 / 00 , showed on the website that they paid me on 00 / 00 / 00 but the money never appeared in my account .
negative	i received my payment into my bank_account 00 / 00 / 00 !!!
negative	over a month later !
negative	what happened to faster payments ?
negative	and whenever i emailed i was told i had to wait 00 working days before i could query it !!
negative	then they told me they had system problems .
negative	no offer of compensation .
negative	absolutely shocking will never use again .
negative	purchased set of 0 struts for my honda_civic 0 fit the fourth didn_'_t wrong strut .
negative	i have e_- mailed twice called once to get information from the to return strut still_waiting been 0 day haven_'_t recieved their information for return .
negative	i also have to pay the shipping cost on the wrong strut they sent me nice i get to pay for there mistake .
negative	still waitng for a reply from them on my return number need to exchange the wrong strut they sent me .
negative	it took 0 days after booking for the bags to be collected , and then a further eleven days to reach their destination !
negative	fedex would have had them there in 0 days flat !
negative	i purchased an international prepaid data sim_card .
negative	i am not able to get a connection .
negative	initially i got a response from their support department claiming i was at fault and not setting_up the card correctly .
negative	they then_proceeded to ignore me other than sending me automated failed connection emails .
negative	i have asked for a refund and raised a dispute with paypal but they are refusing the refund .
negative	i am clearly not the only person_who has_been conned by this company
negative	i ordered 0 items that appeared to be a great value .
negative	turns_out you get what you pay for and i decided to return them .
negative	i followed their procedure for returns and sent the package back by fedex .
negative	i have a tracking_number that confirms the package was received on jan 00 , 0000 but my funds still have not been returned and they will not respond to email or support tickets .
negative	i would not recommend anyone purchase from this company .
negative	i am thankful the items i had ordered were not more_expensive .
negative	-- edit --
negative	it is good to know link delight will respond to me here as many emails and support tickets on the website have gone unanswered .
negative	the fedex_tracking_number is 0000 0000 0000 .
negative	it indicates the return was received and signed for by s fan on 00 jan .
negative	i appreciate your assistance in getting this resolved .
negative	-- edit --
negative	heaven , or trustpilot .. after 0 months of no response to numerous_emails and support tickets , linkdelight has responded to me twice within hours of posting here .
negative	perhaps i '_ll get some resolution .
negative	i '_ll keep you posted .
negative	-- edit --
negative	oh well , still no satisfaction .
negative	you might think signed confirmation they had received the returned items would be enough .
negative	i cannot imagine what more they need .
negative	clearly they have no_intention of rectifying this situation .
negative	so now they have the items and my money but they will never have my business again .
negative	buyer_beware .
negative	i bought tickets to book of mormon orchestra ..
negative	and the seats we got were all the way in the back .. the very last row .
negative	i think that for orchestra the seats could have been better ..
negative	and would have appreciated the tickets or the order being in my account to refer to
negative	i went to my goldstar account and nothing was there .
negative	i called customer_service about the gift i purchased .
negative	they were not only rude but not helpful .
negative	they asked if i needed anything_else but they did not help me with the gift_card issue , which was the only_thing i called about ( how could they help me with anything_else if they didn_'_t help me in the first place ?).
negative	i have never been treated so poorly in my life and will not be using this site in the future .
negative	i ordered 00 bare root double knockout_roses .
negative	one of the plants never emerged from dormancy .
negative	other mail order companies would promptly send a replacement plant or provide a refund .
negative	brighter_blooms does neither , they issue a company credit .
negative	now bare root roses are out of season so a replacement rose plant will now cost me three_times as much with shipping .
negative	oh_yeah ... after i waited the week it took brighter_blooms to even respond to my dead plant problem , they provided me a code ( that allegedly has my store credit ) that didn_'_t even work .
negative	the email said the code with my credit would take 00_hours to be valid .
negative	i waited several days before attempting to use it before it failed .
negative	i went to my local lowe '_s and bought a much larger double knockout_rose plant for $_00 cheaper_than brighter_blooms was going to cost me .
negative	even if i could have used the invalid credit they gave_me .
negative	i want my money back !
negative	i will never use this company again and i will spread the word .
negative	she was rude , gave_me wrong information and because she took an_hour to do nothing she lost me $_000 as the price went up while she was trying to figure_out how to make my reservation .
negative	i ended_up making my own reservation on - line .
negative	totally frustrating and horrible experience .
negative	make your own reservation on - line , don_'_t call customer " service ".
negative	we took our 0 year_old granddaughter to london over half term and thought that booking a sightseeing_tour would enable her to see the sights without too much walking .
negative	the day started fine at st pancras station and we then transferred to another route and started on our tour .
negative	we got off to do the river_trip up to westminster pier and then walked to the stop between the houses of parliament and westminster_abbey .
negative	we waited for over 00_minutes for one of your busues to arrive and could see them going straight over the roundabout but none came to our stop .
negative	it was a very cold day and eventually after_speaking to some other people who said that the stop after this was not being used and who came to the same one as us , we decided to walk to the previous stop .
negative	i did complain to the driver who said there was a diversion .
negative	i do understand that this can happen but surely someone could have come to our stop and put a notice on it as a matter of curtesy .
negative	this waste of time did spoil the day and we were unable to do the whole tour .
negative	i await your reply and perhaps a little remuneration .
negative	i will never purchase from this company again .
negative	they changed my flight schedule and claimed they sent notification a few_months after i booked my flight via_email .
negative	i went to check my baggage costs and found a completely new flight , hours after the one i had booked .
negative	we have a cruise to board and all they said after hours of holding was that i could pay fees and the cost of a new ticket .
negative	i changed nothing , they screwed me completely without my knowledge .
negative	beware and don_'_t use company .
negative	i never will again .
negative	i ordered rotors and they sent the wrong_size .
negative	i contacted them for a refund , returned the rotors according to their instructions and it took from march until june 00 to issue a refund .
negative	i emailed them several_times , they never responded , would give me the runaround etc .
negative	never again .
negative	i can hardly hear to person on the other end and viceversa ...
negative	the correct_part was ordered but the wrong part was sent .
negative	now i have to send it back .
negative	what a pain !
negative	our property was damaged and then stolen and public_storage '_s only concern was to inform us that they could not be sued or held responsible .
negative	i would never recommend anyone to store anything in there facility .
negative	i do not feel that this annuity was explained well to us .
negative	we were given our policies at a dinner and had no opportunity to go over what we were getting or to ask questions .
negative	i '_m very disappointed and wish that i had it to do all over .
negative	our travelocity itinerary said that we were flying on aeromexico at 0pm .
negative	when we showed_up at aeromexico they advised us that we were flying in a different terminal on alaska and had 0 minute to check - in per our itinerary .
negative	if you all have every flown with alaska , you know that they don_'_t allow you to board if you are not at_least 0 hour early - no exceptions .
negative	we had to take a taxi to the other terminal , and needless to say didn_'_t hit the 0 hour minimum check - in time .
negative	we rushed to the front of the line at alaska , they said we had missed our flight by an_hour and that our itinerary was incorrect .
negative	with 0 passengers and only 0 flights going out and only 0 seat available on each flight , 0 of us was stuck in mexico .
negative	never booking travolocity again .
negative	horrible experience !
negative	!
negative	i purchased for $ 0 . 00 a code to unlock my phone it does not work and they charged my credit_card twice and have not credit account or bothered to answer my emails .
negative	there phone ring and ring and there voicemail is full !
negative	so i got ripped_off !
negative	!
negative	i liked transunion more unfortunately they were having problems , but if this site doesn_'_t get better i am going to terminate the monthly contract .
negative	i ordered a tail_light ..... waited and waited .
negative	finally got an_email the order had been cancelled .
negative	tried to call to find out how / why was cancelled .
negative	after phone was finally picked it it said you had to send an_email .
negative	so sent an_email to ask why had happened .
negative	it was never answered .
negative	ordering was easy but the ink does not work for my epson_printer .... get mostly blank pages
negative	i order from petflow on a regular_basis and all of a sudden several_months_ago i started having a lot of problems with shippiing .
negative	i have let petflow know about it but it continues .
negative	the problems i have had are from poor packaging so the order gets damaged in transit and has to be sent back and they have to send a rreorder .
negative	once that was even damaged in process and sent badk as well .
negative	other problems have been fedex leaving the package at someplace other than my address ( this happened twice ) and i live in an apt complex so i have no_idea where it is .
negative	a man in the place actually brought it to me once after we had many days of downpours .
negative	when i tried to open it everything fell_apart_from water_damage and most of the l itter was wet and the boxes had a hole in them and there was a trail of cat_litter all the way upstairs to my front_door .
negative	my friend did not know it had a hole and he was bringing it upstairs .
negative	it rained again before i could clean it up and made a terrible mess .
negative	i never know any more when i order whether my order is going to get here on time or get damaged and sent back , or get left at the wrong_address .
negative	i used to not have these problems , but they started about 0 mos ago and continue to go on no_matter_how much ii oomplain .
negative	i can ont buy this itter whwere i live and have no big stores around here .
negative	so it is really a problem when i do not get an order on time .
negative	i will tell you i am thinking about switching litter b /_c of all of these problems .
negative	i am trying another litter since i did not get the last order i placed on time , and decided to find another litter i thought may work i am still trying to decide what i want to do .
negative	this itter issue is a real problem with petflor and lost orders .
negative	please read ,
negative	if your considering booking your next trip with bookit . com please reconsider , it is truly your choice however , if you are ever needing to use there customer_service you will realize right then and there you made a huge mistake , a mistake that starts with lie ’_s , deceit , and complete cruelty .
negative	this is what happened .
negative	a group of us all decided to go to mexico for a much needed vacation , my boyfriend and i decided to use marlin_travel who gave_us a great rate , shuttle service included in the price and no_hassle we even put it on 0 different credit_cards and it was no issue .
negative	our friends had to book their daughter , mother , and the 0 of them .
negative	the mom was supposed to be a surprise , unfortunately with us_airways and marlin_travel they could not do a pay delay option which was fine , they said they would just wait_until they saved up enough for all of them then book with marlin .
negative	i personally had used bookit . com and knew about there pay delay option i recommended them to book it . com and said give them a call and see what they can do , this way at_least your seats are guaranteed if they can help you out !
negative	loan behold bookit . com seemed to have a great option for her .
negative	they said you must pay all the flights up front and $_000 to secure the hotel reservation and price .
negative	the price for 0_adults and 0 child was still a little to high so she considered just waiting and going with marlin_travel .
negative	however , the man clearly_stated to her “ the flight can change however the cost for the hotel room will not go up as you secured the price by paying for it before midnight , you can call back at any time and book your mom in on this reservation and the price will remain the same so long as the flight price does not go up .
negative	this was enough to convince my friend that she should just go_ahead and book her mom at a later date when she could_afford to add her .
negative	she then asked if at any time i need to change my credit_card on the account will that be a problem “ oh no you can change the credit_card at anytime ”.
negative	a few_weeks_ago my friend called in ready to add her mom to the reservation ; this is where it all went bad .
negative	they told her to add your mom you are not given the same rate at that the cost would be $ 0000 . 00 for her mom when it was $ 0000 per person before .
negative	she explained what the guy told her when she booked they still stated that this was not true and that if she wants to add her mom she has to pay the new rate for her mom .
negative	she called the hotel and airlines and the airline said there price was the same and the hotel ’_s price still brought the total price to $ 0000 .
negative	she stated this to them and they still refused to do anything about it claiming “ they can ’ t change numbers ”.
negative	this was from a manager directly who then said they would review the transcripts and if that was stated they would decide from there .
negative	she asked if she could please change the credit_card number in which they said sure but it ’_s a $_00 . 00 fee !
negative	another thing they forgot to mention , she then asked which shuttle service she would have they said she doesn_’ t have shuttle service and that she would have to pay $_000 . 00 for that as well .
negative	she was very upset by this point , and said she wanted a copy of the transcripts , when they “ reviewed ” her transcript they stated that nothing was ever said of that matter and called her a lier , she than demanded a copy of it knowing that this was not true .
negative	they finally sent it to her after much hesitation with it they also sent a courteous $_00 . 00 credit for her inconvenience , reading the transcripts they cleary stated that her rate would be locked and and she could call back at any time to add her mother .
negative	the only_thing that would change in price is the flight .
negative	even after this and being called out they still refused to do anything about it , she asked that she be compensated with a free shuttle they said no cause then they would have to eat that cost !!
negative	really after taking how much extra from your customers you can ’ t even satisfy them with a courtesy shuttle ?
negative	she asked to be refunded for all this hassle they said no .
negative	we are now heading on our vacation in july and hoping for the best on her end .
negative	also when she called the hotel to ask if she could add her mom to her room they said yes but it would have to be through bookit . com and there rate was $_000 for the 0 days to add to her room , the flight on us_airways was 000 making a total of $ 0000 when she stated this to them they said well we have our rates so we can ’ t change them .
negative	these people will treat you like gold to get you in , but if they make a mistake in anyway they will not help you they will blame you , and do everything in their power not to admit there wrong doing !
negative	i even personally emailed them and never got a response however here are the emails they sent my friend and her response , as well as my email to them !
negative	please do not use bookit . com there prices are not cheaper you can get the same rates anywhere_else with a shuttle and way better customer_service .

negative	to : ' lisa sheehan - bookit . com guest service team lead '
negative	subject : re : from bookit . com ®
negative	hi lisa ,
negative	i ’_m going to apologize to you in advance for my bluntness not necessarily with you but with bookit . com but i think you will understand !
negative	i got the transcript for the call between philip and i and thank_you for same , however , there is some points i want to point out as your company has neglected to see where he did say prices are locked in but not the price of the flights .
negative	( attached is a copy for reference ).
negative	your company underlined in red and mine is in blue :
negative	agent : something we can do , because i can book the resort at the package rate discount for you , is that we can go_ahead and book flights for just two or three of you , however many you can today , and then we can book the resort for all four of you , and set it up on that paydelay option ( which i did do by paying for my husband , daughter and myself and putting a $_000 . 00 deposit for the resort ).
negative	then whenever you ' re ready to make the purchase of the other flights , you can do that online or you can call in to book the flights over the phone .
negative	i just can '_t guarantee the same flights will be available , and the pricing could change on those ( those referring to the flight not the resort ).
negative	but at the very least , you '_ll have the resort secured , since this is on sale until midnight tonight , and make_sure you get locked in .
negative	[ 0 : 00 ]
negative	agent : and then that would just leave the one last flight for the other adult , whenever they ' re ready to book .
negative	right now , the flight price is $_000 . 00 for round - trip .
negative	but that can change , just depending_on whenever they ' re able to book .
negative	( again only stating that the price of the flights could change , but as previously stated because we booked at the discount price we were locked in at the resort ) but currently , that '_s what the price is at .
negative	agent : the $ 0000 . 00 , plus $_000 for the resort .
negative	$ 0000 . 00 if you do it this way .
negative	and if you needed to , we could just do the two adults for now , or whatever modification you need to do with the flights to get the price down for today .
negative	i don_’ t know if you all think that i ’_m some_sort of idiot or something but i know i have done my due diligence on my part and i know what philip said to me on april 00 , 0000 and clearly from : “ we can go_ahead and book flights for just two or three of you , however many you can today , and then we can book the resort for all four of you , and set it up on that paydelay option .
negative	( which again is what i did by booking the 0 of us and putting the 000 . 00 deposit ) then whenever you ' re ready to make the purchase of the other flights , you can do that online or you can call in to book the flights over the phone .
negative	i just can '_t guarantee the same flights will be available , and the pricing could change on those .
negative	but at the very least , you '_ll have the resort secured , since this is on sale until midnight tonight , and make_sure you get locked in .”
negative	philip clearly was talking_about the flights and that those being the flight prices could change , as i was saying on the phone , but that since we booked the hotel ( resort ) we would have that secured and we would have made sure by doing so before midnight that same night of april 00 , 0000 we would get locked in at the resort .
negative	there has not been a misunderstanding but clearly a misrepresentation on your companies end , and as far as i can see and understand your company owes me a full explanation on the above because i know i am right and only prices of the flights were to change but the resort since paying for it in advance was secured and we were locked in .
negative	i ’_m sorry i don_’ t mean to be outright rude or disrespectful in anyway but i am not happy and as a “ valued_customer ” this should be fixed accordingly , and even so with the chance it is more than likely my mother will not be joining us because of so much misrepresentation , i at the very least deserve an_apology and be compensated for same .
negative	i hope that after so much hardship on your companies end i will be able to enjoy my vacation to los cabos , mexico with no more misleading information and trust that from here on out everything will be able to transition smoothly .

negative	and my letter to them
negative	i am very disappointed in the actions , lies , and ultimate decisions made by your company .
negative	i have used your website on a few occasions to book trips .
negative	i personally never had to call the customer_service department so i wasn_'_t aware of how bad it truly is .
negative	i was recommended to you by a friend , i then recommended you to a friend of mine !
negative	the best way to conduct successful business is word of mouth .
negative	when you satisfy your customers and show that you are true to your word even in the event of a mishap this goes along way .
negative	as that customer will then state to their friends " yes i had an_issue but it was promptly resolved i would use them ".
negative	here '_s my issue a group of us booked a vacation to mexico for july 00 - 00 , i personally decided to go with marlin_travel this time as they offered me a better rate then your website .
negative	on top of offering me the better rate they got me airport transfer for no extra_charge .
negative	( which is included on the us_airways website ).
negative	our friends couldn_'_t pay the full price of the trip up front but wanted to ensure there flights and seats , i recommended you to them as you do the pay delay .
negative	when she called to book she was still unsure if she wanted to use your company , and contemplated going with marlin_travel and just waiting a little_bit and risking loosing there flight seats .
negative	however , you stated to her on the phone not to worry that when she was ready to book her mom , she would be able to call back at any time and add her to the reservation , at the same price as what she paid for herself .
negative	this selling feature is what caused her to book with you and not marlin_travel .
negative	a week_ago she decided to call in and get her mom booked in , she was told that whatever they said to her before was not the case and that she would have to pay $ 0000 from the $ 0000 that she paid per person for herself , when she confronted the issue she was told to bad this is the price .
negative	she then called back and waited on hold for a very long time only to be lied to again and told that this was how it is and you can '_t change numbers .
negative	this is seriously a lie and unfair treatment .
negative	she was then told they would go back and review the phone_call to see if she was telling the truth , in which case they told her they would email her the results .
negative	she and i had already contacted the hotel who stated that so long as the guest is staying in the same room and they are just adding the existing reservation there should be no need to charge that much .
negative	you could go online and book the flight and hotel separately for cheaper_than that .
negative	marlin_travel said your ways are outrageous and completely ridiculous .
negative	she then asked to be refunded you stated no .
negative	however , she received another email_saying that if the phone_call comes back stating what she said happened you would adjust the price to the same rates ?
negative	how can that be when a day ago she was told you cannot change numbers !
negative	i am so sad that she is dealing_with this crap , i have decided to personally never use your services again , as well the person_who referred me also agreed after_seeing that treatment they will also never use your services .
negative	i will complain on every site i can about your abuse to my friend and i promise to ensure anyone thinking of booking a trip never to use you !
negative	that '_s my condolences to you for treating your customers this way .
negative	after_reading_reviews it seems you have many complaints about your customer_services .
negative	do you read these ?
negative	do you care ?
negative	or do you figure you can continue your business treating your customers this way ?
negative	it may work for now however , things will stream threw the grapevine eventually .
negative	no business is safe that '_s why when you see a customer with an_issue that was your fault to start with , you as a company should do everything you can to fix it and be a competition to other_companies that would treat there customers well .
negative	in my opinion you should have swallowed your pride treated her with respect , given her the rate she deserved to bring her mother , and also as an inconvience thrown in a free shuttle service .
negative	please read your statement below !
negative	and please_note any rude emails sent back to me , or disrespectful in anyway i will post to all your sites with reviews and show as many people as i can your lack of customer_service .
negative	also any response not given i will also post and let others know of your lack of customer_service .
negative	maybe for once you could swallow your pride do what '_s right and fix your mistake with this customer !
negative	her name is mayra hernandez .
negative	she now has to tell her poor mother who she promised a trip to mexico she can '_t go because of your lies , and treatment .
negative	thank_you bookit . com for not only ruining her vacation but ruining her mother '_s chance at getting away .
negative	but you don_'_t really care do you ?
negative	that would be called having compassion and good customer_service and from many reviews that seems to be something you don_'_t have .
negative	at bookit . com ® we take guest support very seriously .
negative	in fact , one of our core values states that if our guests are merely satisfied , we haven_'_t done our job .
negative	total guest elation is our goal , and we work tirelessly to ensure that each and every guest is so elated with their experience that they stop conversations to tell others about us .

negative	ma che razza di risposta è che_non diventate ricchi per un ordine da 00_euro ??!!!
negative	vi ho pagato subito ??
negative	? siiiiiii !!!!
negative	! e allora qual ' è il vostro problema anche_se avessi acquistato da voi merce per un euro ???
negative	anzi mi reputo fortunata rispetto ad altri consumatori che hanno speso il quadruplo di quello che_ho speso io e certo però che se a fine mese con tutti i soldi che incassate senza emettere merce è ovvio che ricchi lo siete diventati e a questo ho contribuito anch ' ioooo .
negative	e tanto per confermare ciò che_ho scritto nel post precedente nessuno mi_ha contattata nel tardo pomeriggio per aggiornarmi ..... ovviooooo ..... banali ........
negative	these_guys are just rediculous .
negative	unbelievable !
negative	are you guys so dumb or are you trying to do just one time business with your clients ?
negative	if it so , then i feel sorry for you .
negative	for a family owned business , you should try to improve your customer_service and learn to have some respect for the people who do your business instead of making monkeys out of them .
negative	why don_'_t you first contact the customer regarding the wrong and mismatched parts before you ship them ?
negative	i believe it is going to make a big_difference for everybody , especially when there are lots of intelligent people out there and not everyone is an_idiot .
negative	thank_you very , very much for sending me the cheapest parts that you carry and not the ones that i paid for ( the most expensive ).
negative	will not thank_you for stealing my money .
negative	do not appreciate your business !
negative	the caribbean blue rainbow color on - line , was a pretty blue color and looked like silver ear_pieces .
negative	when we received the stethoscope it had gold ear_pieces and the caribbean blue tubing looks like a dull dark green .
negative	this was a gift for my daughter and she picked out the colors on - line .
negative	she hates the gold and is very disappointed with the tubing color .
negative	also , the engraving of the stars and her name is much smaller_than_expected .
negative	i would not recommend this site to anyone .
negative	i decided to have a custom corset made for a renfaire costume i was putting_together .
negative	so i talked to the woman via_email and she and i agreed_upon me making 0 different payments .
negative	it was a rather high amount for each payment compared to how much i make .
negative	so i made the first payment and then waited .... and then emailed them again ... and again ... and again .
negative	but nothing .
negative	so what am i left with ?
negative	an almost empty bank_account and no corset or responses from the company .
negative	so they got paid without_having to make anything .. do not trust these people so terrible .
negative	the manager of the site was extremely_rude and unhelpful .
negative	every time i went into the office it was very unpleasant .
negative	booked our flight for seattle this aug .
negative	it says $_000_per person .
negative	in the invoice the total says $_000 . 00 .
negative	but in my credit_card they billed me $_000 .
negative	will complain this transaction and if they don_'_t reverse this amount , will dispute it to my bank .
negative	i '_m very disappointed .
negative	it '_s my first time to book tickets with them and they are already very devious .
negative	ordered 0 wheels , received them one at a time , two were the wrong item .
negative	they would not arrange a pickup , had to drive over an_hour for a ups store , did that .
negative	then they want you to order the same two again , so then you have paid for six wheels , of course you only have 0 wheels .
negative	they wouldn_'_t hold the correct wheels and wait for the two wrong wheels to be received back .. sure hope that they know how to sent the correct size and that i can still get the two correct wheels .
negative	worst_experience i have ever had ordering from the internet .
negative	will never order from this company again .
negative	they don_'_t care how much running around it took me because of their mistake .
negative	customer_service sucks !
negative	!
negative	i booked a trip for my sisters and i on 0 / 0 / 0000 online .
negative	we are going to new_orleans to see they beyonce and jay - z concert .
negative	i did not like the time the flight was arriving with the hotel package deal so i changed our flight to an early one ( arriving at new_orleans at 0 :_00pm ).
negative	the nightmare ---- i decided to print my documents today ( because i work midnights and sleep during the day ) only to find out my flight would be arriving at 0000pm july_00th which you mind as well say july_00th !
negative	i paid an extra 00_bucks per_ticket to arrive early in new_orleans and ended_up with a flight i never selected .
negative	i called bookit . com and the 0st rep told me to call the airlines because there was nothing they could do with that part of the booking .
negative	so , i called the airlines and was referred back to bookit . com .
negative	so , i spoke to another rep who seem to not care at all and basically should have just said screw you .
negative	i ask this 0nd rep to please transfer me to a supervisor and she went on to say the supervisor was going to tell me the same thing .
negative	i was placed on hold and never was transferred to a supervisor .
negative	suggestion_: bookit . com please train your employees to refrain from stating the supervisor is going to say the same thing because it totally pisses customers off .
negative	what is the purpose of having a supervisor if they cannot resolve escalated issues ??
negative	so , i had to speak to a 0rd rep and she wanted to help me and felt bad about this total nightmare . the huge problem is because my reservation is past the 00 hour cancellation mark basically reps told me they could not do anything .
negative	i understand the 00 hour cancellation .
negative	however , my situation is totally different .
negative	i never wanted to cancel .
negative	i just wanted the flight i originally selected to arrive in new_orleans early to have a great time with my sisters .
negative	instead , i am stuck with a huge headache .
negative	the 0rd rep told me that she was going to get permission from her supervisor to have my booking reviewed .
negative	the problem with that is basically my word against bookit . com .
negative	how do i know they are going to be fair and say hey something went wrong here ??
negative	instead , i was told because i made the reservation online myself it could have been an user error .
negative	i am hoping that whomever is reviewing my situation will see that i spent hours trying to find a safe , reasonable and nice place to stay with my sisters and correct the situation .
negative	hello i want to share my experience with ami hoping that they read this and start treating their customers better .
negative	i used to shop there allot spending 000 a week until they started sending me the wrong sizes one after another , and failing to notify me that the items i had order were in back order and i would only be receiving one item of the 0 i order .
negative	until receiving my order with only 0 of the 0 items i had order .
negative	very disappointing waiting for something for 0 days and once it arrives to you its not even the correct size or color .
negative	after waiting for 00_minutes on hold and then being hung_up by a very rood girl who refuse to give me her name because there is a 0 minute time limit on their calls !
negative	can you believe this ... calling a company whom you spend 000 '_s of dollars on and then getting hang up on because there is a 0 minute time limit !
negative	i waited 0 days for my order and only got 0 item instead of 0 and they still have my money and 0 minutes is all they can give me .
negative	how is that customer_service !
negative	it '_s unbelievable to me how they stay in business this long , but i know how it '_s my 000 '_s of dollars that i spent on them .
negative	finally all she said to me is you will get a refund in seven_days !
negative	i could not believe it !
negative	never again will i shop there !
negative	and by the way their clothes is super cheap material after 0 washes they are no good !
negative	save your money !
negative	and quit making these people rich when all they do is treat customers like cra *!
negative	failed to deliver
negative	terrible customer_service very rude agents
negative	i ordered online and received a ' dispatched ' email after a few_days which was fine .
negative	however , having ordered a swimsuit ( nice small light item ) and paid over_£_00 to have it delivered to france i had hoped that the premium price might mean a speedy_delivery .... or at_least within the 0 working days promised .
negative	it is now 00 working days_later , two messages sent to customer_services - no swimsuit and no response from mothercare .
negative	i would definitely use use their shops as they have great products but never order on line again !
negative	i usually use nextdirect - free delivery and arrives within 0 working days - i just liked this swimsuit and being very pregnant , wanted to have a nice swimsuit to make up for feeling like a whale at the swimming_pool !
negative	bought the full set of ink_cartridges for my hp deskjet printer and i would not purchase again from hot_toner .
negative	the cyan ( blue ) has leaked and is constantly being printed on the page even when i select black_ink only .
negative	i will be buying genuine_hp_ink_cartridges from now on .
negative	perhaps the worst customer_service i have had to endure .
negative	no communication , after attempts at getting in touch i receive no replies .
negative	awful .
negative	item ordered , paid for .
negative	never sent .
negative	never informed of this .
negative	sat around waiting .
negative	try to get in touch .
negative	nothing .
negative	boohoo , you are a let_down and should really rethink your services .
negative	i shall be sticking to asos .
negative	items i actually did receive were of poor quality and fit .
negative	returned half , leaving me time to reconsider the other items .
negative	decide i no_longer want them and then find out the returns_policy only allows 00 days for a refund so i am stuck with two ill - fitting and ugly dresses of no use .
negative	here is the email i wrote to you about the delivery problem .
negative	perhaps you will respond to this problem now .
negative	i have ordered from you several_times before and never had a problem with delivery .
negative	however , now that you have moved to dhl i find myself in the situation that i can not receive my parcel .
negative	i was absent on both attempts to deliver the parcel ( i was at work ) and now i don_'_t know what to do .
negative	the attached document ( not possible to attach here ) clearly shows that dhl have not told me where to collect the parcel .
negative	even if i had this vital information , none of the collection points are easily_accessible by public_transport during the working week , especially as the document left by dhl doesn_'_t give me any opening hours .
negative	i work full time and my work does not easily accept parcels being delivered .
negative	when you used the standard post , it was easy for me to cycle to the post_office on a saturday_morning to collect your parcels .
negative	now i think it is impossible to receive deliveries from you , especially given the fact that dhl insist on a signature , so won_'_t just put the parcel in my mail box , and have not told me where to collect the parcel .
negative	i suppose the parcel will now be sent back to you and i will have to try and source my goods elsewhere .
negative	what a shame that you no_longer use the standard post , which was so much_simpler for your customers .
negative	my mum was a couple of days in london to visit me .
negative	we though we could do a sightseeing_tour .
negative	we never encountered such rude staff .
negative	the unfriendliness of the bus driver was only excelled by the mopishness of the man at the bus station ( lonon eye ).
negative	it was raining , so we were sitting inside the bus ... or we tried ...
negative	the engine of the bus was so incredible noisy that we couldn_'_t understand any single word through the headphones ( even_though we turned them as loud as possible ).
negative	after 00_minutes we decided to exit the bus and the tour since we already had headache .
negative	especially with a view to the rather high price for the tour , it was an absolutely inacceptable and disappointing performance .
negative	never again !
negative	i have nothing to say haven_'_t used your service .
negative	i am not happy with the fact that i entered a request for a hotel through bookit ... stating i needed a room for 0 people .... got the ' mystery ' deal and only after did i realize the ' mystery ' deal was only for a room of 0 people .
negative	i got a $_000 additional_charge for my 0 extra guests .
negative	i feel_like i was cheated and not happy at all .
negative	supposedly had enough parts to fullfill my order but they didn_'_t
negative	i have been disappointed in this service and want to cancel .
negative	in order to get an update on my credit_report , i would need to pay an_additional fee .
negative	the credit notices posted are very vague and non helpful .
negative	i received an_email 0 days after i placed my order informing_me that my product was on back order .
negative	when i ordered the product it was " in stock " but now it is on back order ?
negative	when i called to find out when i could expect to receive my order i could not get anyone to give me an answer .
negative	they could not explain to me why i was not informed earlier that my order would not be processed on time and that my product was not actually " in stock ".
negative	i have yet to receive a response to the messages i have sent or the message i left for the manager who was out to lunch .
negative	but i did receive a confirmation that my order was cancelled .
negative	nice customer_service .
negative	luckily i found a better company with even better prices through amazon !!
negative	!
negative	i had to go into my order several days after_placing it to learn that it was cancelled !!
negative	i was never contacted about the cancellation .
negative	meanwhile , i could have ordered the book my daughter needed urgently at college elsewhere , so i lost several days in the process .
negative	i will never use bookbyte again .
negative	need technical translation for the website .
negative	the quality was unacceptable !
negative	we had to hire someone_else and they refund us only 00_%, after they admitted that the quality was very poor !
negative	your courier has dropped a collection service card at our apartment building .
negative	no name or apartment number on it so we don_'_t know who the card is for .
negative	the phone_number on the card is not connected .
negative	there is no phone_number for service on your website .
negative	an_email to your service department has_been unanswered for two_days .
negative	said there was one computer in stock and then turened around and said they were on back order .
negative	never received the sample ; asked for quote of 000 , received quote for 0000 .
negative	i can '_t_believe someone would read that wrong , it '_s a quote and their job to be accurate .
negative	did not buy because the company seems unreliable based on these two issues .
negative	we have an event and need guaranteed delivery and attention to detail .
negative	united air lines canceled our return flights causing it to take 00hrs to get home ....
negative	paid 00 . 00 for next_day deliver and items still not received
negative	no contact from delivery company to explain_why
negative	i ordered a bug deflector for my vehicle .
negative	i received the item quickly but it is not the right part for my vehicle .
negative	even the box clearly lists the vehicles it fits and mine is not listed there .
negative	thus they sent me the wrong item or they listed it improperly on their website .
negative	when i tried to call them to discuss , i was placed on hold for about 00_minutes and then a recording told me they were too busy to take my call and that i needed to complete a request online for assistance .
negative	this happened to me no_matter what time of day i called .
negative	then when i finally get an_email response , i am advised that i will have to pay to ship the item back to them ( with no reimbursement ) and be charged a restocking_fee !!!
negative	bad way to treat customers !
negative	!
negative	after booking my vacation , going and coming_back from the destination i was not allowed to post a review about my experience to inform inquiring customers . that to me was very unprofessional .... i now have reservations about purchasing another vacation package with this particular website .
negative	i wanted to changed my flight to return home a day later and it was impossible to talk to someone with answers .
negative	there was a heavy volume of calls so i was put on hold and then promised a phone_call within 0 hours that came 0 - 0 hours_later , after being on the phone 0 hours to resolve a simple problem .
negative	i missed going to dinner with family due to this issue , i wound_up being a new return ticket home , because it was cheaper_than paying for the change fee in addition to the difference of the ticket .
negative	this is not a way to run a business !
negative	i purchased a wheel rim and paid for it with a credit_card .
negative	the ups driver wouldn_'_t leave the part with me until i gave him a check .
negative	i am not paying twice .
negative	since you can '_t get anyone on the phone at parts_geek i had to write an_email to their " customer_service " ( and i use that term loosely )...... the first response i got was " that i wasn_'_t allowed to return the item " - the idiot didn_'_t even read my note .
negative	i sent a second note and the person said they would get back to me after getting in touch with the warehouse ....... and i still_haven_'_t heard back from them 0 days_later .
negative	i did get this email , though .
negative	asking me to voice my opinion of parts_geek .
negative	they suck !!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i have been charged on my credit_card and have yet to receive my order .
negative	i never saw and a confirming email of my order either .
negative	but i know my credit_card has_been charged because i saw it on my statement .
negative	i don_'_t know what is going on .
negative	can you help me ?
negative	website was easy to use however when we got to the hotel they hadn_'_t received notice of our booking .
negative	luckily when the hotel
negative	reviewed their system they found an_email but it was too late and we didn_'_t get the room we booked .
negative	the hotel had to
negative	put us in another room but i don_'_t know what we would have done if they didn_'_t have a spare room .
negative	wouldn_'_t use wotif again .
negative	hi , i was told since first time buyer ( on this site only ... i always send egift cards ) i was told it needed review on a business day monday thru friday .
negative	if approved after review it would be sent in a business day after .
negative	ugh !
negative	i will never order from this website again !!!
negative	i ordered two dresses for my upcoming engagement photo_shoot and was not able to wear them because my order came extremely late .
negative	i emailed misguided after it was a day or two late and received an_email_stating that they were unable to track my order .
negative	when i finally received my order , i had one dress that was very poorly sewn and one extra , extra large white t - shirt !!!
negative	this was not what i ordered at all so as you can imagine , i was beyond upset .
negative	i have emailed misguided requesting a refund but with the poor customer care i have already experienced , i wouldn_'_t expect them to actually do the right thing .
negative	do not waste your time or money on this website !
negative	they clearly do not care to double - check your orders , ship them out on time , or about their customer '_s satisfaction at all !
negative	placed an order for one item on the 00th of this month and still have yet to receive it .
negative	i find it inconvenient that there isn_'_t a way to track my order .
negative	00 business days have passed and still nothing !
negative	i don_'_t think i '_ll be ordering from beautybay again because of this .
negative	my part arrived broken and my mechanic was scheduled 0 days out to replace it .
negative	i tried_calling and emailing company but could not get a live_person to help me !!!
negative	all i got were automated_responses from a system that could care less about customer_service !
negative	i ordered a new part from from www .
negative	buyautoparts . com because of your failure to provide customer_service !
negative	here is hoping that my refund doesn_'_t get lost in your crappy automated_system and i have to deal with your joke of an establishment !
negative	not happy that i had to get a over night flight and also not pleased with the fact that i would have to pay an additonial cost of $_000 in order to get to where i need to go .
negative	also i had found a flight that would be cheaper and i would have been able to get the morning fight that is a non_stop fight .
negative	i am so angry that i was stupid enough to book with you from weymouth to jersey .
negative	unfortuntely , i only checked directly with condor ferries after i secured the booking with you .
negative	i found out that you charged us 00 £ more than if i had booked directly .
negative	can you explain this ????
negative	? maria wenger
negative	they told me they would cancel the purchase then i get an_email the card was shipped .
negative	never book through flighthub . com .
negative	sorry for the lengthy post but some things have to be shared .
negative	i booked a last_minute flight with flighthub yesterday because my mom needed to fly out to see my grandmother who is in critical condition .
negative	i made the payment with my credit_card and everything was done and confirmed ( or so i thought ).
negative	i even got an_email_confirmation saying everything was booked .
negative	i showed_up at the westjet desk today and westjet tells_me that the reservation is there but the payment did not go through .
negative	so i called flighthub asking them why , and basically after putting me on hold for a long time , the so - called " customer_service representative " tells_me that the payment was not processed and the airline has increased their price so i have to pay an_additional_$_000 on top of what i had already paid originally .
negative	not only did they not apologize for this inconvenience , they are asking me to pay extra money .
negative	and the guy pretty_much told me that this is part of their policy , told me i should " read the terms and conditions " and that i either make the payment immediately or lose the reservation .
negative	we were already sitting in the airport and the flight was supposed to leave in an_hour .
negative	what else was i supposed to do but make the payment ?
negative	flighthub , you should be completely ashamed of yourselves .
negative	when you display a price online and i put in my credit_card information , i '_m expecting to pay that price .
negative	how can you increase the price after i input my credit_card info and then not process the payment and then charge me the additional increased price ??
negative	never using flighthub again .
negative	i should really be suing .
negative	on a side_note , thank_you , westjet and the lady at the westjet desk for great customer_service .
negative	really shows what companies actually care about their customers and which ones don_'_t .
negative	why did you send me a valuation after you recived the phones , as junk_mail , when your other emails didnt , if we would of got the email we would havve asked for the phones back , because you only paid us half the price on the second email , so you
negative	wont be have my business again
negative	my jacket was online for 000_pounds sterling yet my credit_card was charged 000_dollars ( almost 000_pounds ), even_though its a uk card with a uk billing_address .
negative	i was charged for shipping to australia so i shouldn_'_t have been made to pay almost 00_pounds more .
negative	i won_'_t be using again .
negative	i have bought two items from wowcher the first of these was 0 zebra blankets one of which did not come through and despite emailing them i did not get my money back and lost £ 0 . 00 .
negative	i '_ve also recently bought a strapless bra which i did not get an_email to say i had the coupon .
negative	later went on the site where it says my coupon had expired and i had lost £_00 .
negative	again contacted them by email and still no reply .
negative	so in total i am out £_00 . 00 will never use again have never had this problem with groupon .
negative	never had such bad customer_service in my life .
negative	i will never use travelocity again .
negative	they had the wrong payment info sent to the hotel .
negative	i was happy with the pictures of the dress as compared to what i got .
negative	exact look alike .
negative	what did concern me was the fact that i fit into their measurement system exactly and when my dress arrived it was extremely large .
negative	i had to have an inch taken in on both_sides .
negative	according to their measurements i was to be a 00 to 00w .
negative	i went with the 00 and as i have stated then had to pay to have my dress altered .
negative	in fairness i did not let ps know because there would not have been time to return it and have it back before the wedding .
negative	i put the first pod in and nothing , but it got stuck and i had to dislodge it .
negative	concerned that my machine , which was a christmas gift this year , might be damaged , i popped in a nespresso pod and , voilà , and excellent cup of coffee .
negative	after investing in 000 pods , seduced by the price , i believe that you get what you pay for - suspect quality .
negative	i am disappointed because i did not want to be held captive by nespresso !
negative	i am not happy with this company .
negative	i received the bracelet that i ordered , however , the bracelet was way too big so i called the number on the invoice and left a message to see what my options were .
negative	i didn_'_t receive a call back .
negative	i sent an mail , and again , no response .
negative	i am willing to keep the " large " bracelet .
negative	i just want to know if the company has any small sizes
negative	website comes up when searching for a particular hotel in a way that the consumer thinks they are connected directly to the hotel to place reservation .
negative	it actually redirects you to a third_party .
negative	the reps have wrong info on the hotel property .
negative	in my case it had to do with pool hrs and renovation status .
negative	also , felt_pressured_into reserving rm because was told only 0 rms left , when actually , there were 00 rms left .
negative	did not know i purchased through 0rd_party until i called hotel to confirm room and pool hrs and found out room price was less .
negative	they said they couldn_'_t adjust price because i purchased from expedia .
negative	not once was i told this when making my reservation .
negative	called reservation_counter with complaint and customer_service created a ticket # with complaint .
negative	let '_s see if they make it right .
negative	buyer_beware !!!!!
negative	!
negative	when i place an order i dont want you to taker my money and return it 0 days_later ... if you dont have the part dont take my money
negative	i had a business account , a personal account for me , and a personal account for my husband .
negative	they shut all 0 down for 0 reason :
negative	0 - they do not approve of a product i sell .
negative	a ) i sell other items that are approved .
negative	they didn_'_t take the time to ask which product i was selling through paypal .
negative	0 - we are not allowed to have more than one account .
negative	a ) 0 account for me , 0 account for my husband .
negative	we are 0 different people .
negative	and it is a very common_practice ( as well as advised ) to keep separate accounts for business / businesses and personal .
negative	will never use black_circles again or cm garage in east kilbride .
negative	my alloys were damaged and both denied they were damaged at time of fitment .
negative	funny the 0 tyres they touched are the ones which are now damaged ?????
negative	and they were washing my wheels whilst getting me to sign job card will never recommend again
negative	i cancelled my order with parts_geek by phone with one of their representatives .
negative	he e_- mailed the shipping parts_geek representative he assured_me that one part the tail pipe for my car $_00 , 00 .
negative	he said the shipping department told him the shipping department was unable to stop the shipping of two identical parts i ordered totally by mistake .
negative	i called fed_ex the company that was responsible for shipping the part they informed me the parts had not been shipped yet to call parts_geek and cancelled the order .
negative	parts_geek billed me and shipped the part anyway .
negative	fed_ex told me to refuse the order i did .
negative	now parts_geek will take_forever to return my money .
negative	i want my money back asap !
negative	you are a terrible company making it impossible to call your company and get resolution .
negative	0 ) the site is not properly translated to the different_languages ( in this case it was swedish mixed with danish and english .
negative	0 ) the link for opening an account did not work so i contacted the customer_service in swedish and said that i cannot login to see my booking .
negative	they wrote me back to my account ( which i still could not open ) that i please shall write again in another language (-> have you ever heard of google translate ?).
negative	i came in by " changing my password " in the end .
negative	0 ) i wrote the mail in german again .
negative	no answer yet .
negative	0 ) due to a rescheduled flight i had to change our booking so i logged in and started changing it online .
negative	it did not work because the kind of room we booked was not available for choosing / marking .
negative	0 ) so i wrote a mail to them on feb 0 again .
negative	i did not get any answer on this until today , the 00 / 00 .
negative	then i wrote again on feb 0 .
negative	still no answer .
negative	0 ) since i did not get any answer until a certain point of time i contacted the hostel instead and got an answer within less_than 0 hours .
negative	they of course could change our booking .
negative	0 ) when i now after 0_weeks finally got my answer they just tell me i shall contact the hostel directly and i could change my booking online as well .
negative	now i wonder_if they even read what people write .
negative	all in all i must_say it was suspicious from the beginning and it went on .
negative	so my rate is 0_star and i will in future let_me inspire by them but always contact hostels directly instead .
negative	our flight was rescheduled ( one day later than booked ) and we did not get any discount .
negative	we would have loved to just fly back one day later also - if there had been a flight that day .
negative	so we were robbed one day from our little weekend trip without_any compensation .
negative	and calling their customer_service seems to be very expensive .
negative	there are a few things more that i do not like with the page and the service but that would be too much .
negative	ps_: i haven_'_t even been really flying with them yet .
negative	so we will see how many more problems will appear .
negative	i am very disappointed until now .
negative	i ordered a morelle captain bed w_/ and the matching morelle chest .
negative	the site states it would take 0 - 0_weeks to ship .
negative	not !
negative	six_weeks_later it finally ships .
negative	that was the first problem .
negative	second problem ... on of the spindles on the headboard was completely cracked and scratched .
negative	third problem ... the site states that the morelle chest has metal glides and dovetailed drawers ... definitely not !!
negative	staples and glue all the way around !
negative	super sub - quality !
negative	i called and spoke to eric , the claims rep ., and he pretty_much told me that i got what i got and there was nothing he could do about it .
negative	i was also told that the headboard would not be replaces ... just " repaired ".
negative	great , so now i '_ve spent all of this money and i basically am getting a " repaired " headboard and a super sub - quality chest .
negative	and to top it all off ... i asked for a night stand or something to replace the lesser quality of the chest and he said ... after about 00_minutes of trying to get him to understand that there '_s a huge_difference_between " dove - tail " and " staples " in terms of quality ... he said he '_s send me a throw blanket ... really ?
negative	and no i never received the freakin blanket !
negative	total crap !
negative	total joke of a company .
negative	nothing is ever in stock , most items are very cheaply_made , they do charge you shipping on returns and good luck getting a refund .
negative	they are masters at giving you the run_around , they tell you that you don_'_t understand , they are just the worst online experience i have ever had !!!
negative	just save_yourself & don_'_t order from them or chadwick '_s which is their sister company .
negative	the size_chart is all wrong , the clothes way too expensive and very poor quality .
negative	i regret ever using this company .
negative	i haven_'_t received my order !
negative	my order has_been paid for and i still_haven_'_t received !
negative	i purchased a leather_jacket for my husbands_birthday .
negative	i used the option click and collect .
negative	i recieved an_email_saying my order had arrived but when i went to collect i was told the delivery driver had not delivered it .
negative	i had to spend a fortune on the phone finding out where my parcel had gone .
negative	after a few_days i recieved notification from superdry that my money had been refunded .
negative	so at the end i never recieved my goods and missed my bus ands birthday a d recieved no apologise
negative	will never use again !
negative	i sent a brand_new book in double bubble_wrap and was told it didn_'_t meet the standards .
negative	i called customer_service to find out why my book was rejected and was given no_explanation and was just spoken to rudely .
negative	it did not come_back in the same condition i sent it .
negative	there were dents and two small tears at the top .
negative	this could have been the mail or not ( no way the tears could happen in bubble_wrap )... who_knows but i found out it was a courtesy that my book was sent back .
negative	if not they would have kept it ( because i agreed to that by_clicking a button apparently ).
negative	i am glad i got it back but it was now damaged and the value dropped .
negative	gift_cards .
negative	com .
negative	doesn_'_t tell you upfront that it can '_t be used at an atm or for paying bills ..
negative	i thought it would be a nice way to send $ 0000 to my dad since you can customize them , but since he couldn_'_t even use them he had to try to sell them to other people and it just became a total run_around .
negative	your upfront gift_card info should be more truthful and less deceptive .
negative	i live in florida and send two gift_cards to my dad in ohio who was suffering from cancer and poverty , so i wanted to help him as he '_s been unemployed since his surgery and his house was four months behind on payments .
negative	so thinking is as doing something good to help him i used giftcards . com and come to find out i literally put my dad through hell trying to use these cards bc you don_'_t say upfront the uses and unusable ways to spend money on them ... had i known it would be so difficult for my dad and over stress his cancerous body , i would have just western_union end him money , not to mention it says express delivery two_days , and literally took a .
negative	week to get there .. you guys really need to get it together and find ways for people to utilize these cards better .
negative	i '_m pretty disgusted .
negative	i thought it was going to be personalized and a nice_gesture , but your deceptive cards aren_'_t worth it and i won_'_t be buying them ever again .
negative	sincerely elise green
negative	i ordered the part i thought i needed however after looking at the picture several_times and the automobile , i discovered this was not the part i needed .
negative	i advised you immediately and you could have stopped the order since you were not open on the monday after the sat .
negative	i ordered but you refused so i have sent the part pack and you have received because i tracked it .
negative	i am waiting for my credit now so i can order correct_part from a better company .
negative	i can actually talk with them on the phone and be assured it is the right part .
negative	but now i am waiting for my credit to my account .
negative	you just have to go in a make the credit - no checks are involved since i used by debit_card .
negative	i expect my credit by this thursday or i will file a complaint with the better business_bureau .
negative	i was never able to actually talk with some one - you keep sending incomplete emails to me that do nothing to answer my questions .
negative	they made many many mistakes and made it difficult to correct them .
negative	the staff is incompetent .
negative	she told me i was adding backwards that '_s what i wasn_'_t coming up with the total that was on the paper .
negative	how dumb can you be .
negative	had to put light_bulb in light .
negative	just not a well kept place to store your belongings .
negative	would suggest for storage more that six_months do climat control less bugs and critters .
negative	petflow started off well then went downhill fast , with delayed shipments ( and no communication about their delay ) and just generally instilling a lack of confidence in their organization every time i called to find out what the latest problem was .
negative	then they stopped my automatic_shipments , saying my vet refused to renew the prescription_diet i was purchasing .
negative	fine , whatever , it was the last straw and i was quite_frankly glad to be done with the monthly shipping issues and told them so .
negative	then i got an_email a month later , completely out of the blue , saying they were about to ship my scheduled order .
negative	when i called , i was told , " good news !
negative	the vet_approved the prescription " ( which is impossible and such clear bs i couldn_'_t_believe it ) but i should just refuse the shipment if i don_'_t want it .
negative	needless to say , i never received anything , i don_'_t want anything from this company , and now i have to make_sure they didn_'_t charge me for an order they never should have shipped .
negative	it took nearly a month for regular prescription to arrive , what a joke !
negative	i did quite a lot of research before ordering my bathroom from betterbathrooms i felt_confident i would recieve good service , how wrong was i . the buying process went fine , they took my £_000 the goods were delivered on a pallet to the door .
negative	ok i thought you don_'_t expect the service you would normally recieve from a high_street store .
negative	my husband and son emptied the pallet and found the bath had damage to the underside , which looked as if it had been pushed onto something there were three dints and a few scrape marks .
negative	i notified betterbathrooms who asked me to send some photographs which we did .
negative	then the fun began we heard_nothing for five days i tried to call customer_service it rang and rang .
negative	i then got an_email_saying they were contacting the bath manufacturer to see what they had to say .
negative	i have had an_email tonight after seven_days to say the bath is fine , its got dints in it because of the manufacturing process .
negative	as you can imagine we are concerned the bath may have a weakness and leak after we spend a few thousand pounds tiling and fitting out the bathroom .
negative	eventually after 00_minutes tonight i got hold of customer_service i was so shocked to hear a voice i nearly fainted !!!!!!
negative	i was told again the bath is ok they are confident it won_'_t leak , they might be i '_m not .
negative	so now what do i do buy another bath or let my builder fit this one and hope for the best .
negative	one thing is for sure i will not be recommending betterbathrooms to any one .
negative	we never got our order .
negative	we already paid in full but we ' re still_waiting .
negative	no one is answering our phone_calls at partsgeek .
negative	it has_been 0_weeks now .
negative	where is our order ?
negative	and why did you charge us if you ' re not sending us anything .
negative	this was a scam !
negative	your website appears as though you ' re dealing directly with la_quinta when in reality you ' re a third - party la_quinta made a big deal out of this i also reserve the sweet and only got a hotel room i was very clear with your agent on the phone very disappointed
negative	since the picture was of the kodac product i was after i presumed that was what i woud be getting ; it was not .
negative	i should have realised because the price was so good , i should have read the small_print , but i was completely misled .
negative	i will not be buying from printerinks again .
negative	i was excited to receive the plants i had ordered ; 0 jackmanii clematis .
negative	when they arrived i was horrified to see the way they had been delivered in the boxes .
negative	two boxes with three plants had all the contents of the planters , plant and dirt , loose and crushed in the bottom of the boxes !!
negative	i immediately took photos of the just opened boxes and sent an_email to customer_service .
negative	no response , tried to call the next_day , was on hold for 00_minutes and when i was next in line to be answered i was cutoff with a recording stating they were closed for the day .
negative	sent another email two_days_later and no response .
negative	after a third email to customer_service and 00 days_later with no response i will never do_business with brighter_blooms ever again !
negative	i bought tayberry shoes which i have been wearing for many years and this pair wore out within 0 months , i sent them back and easy wellies sent them back to the manufacturers .
negative	i then had to chase them 0 times to get an answer on what was going on .
negative	as the shoes wore out they are not guarenteed , they are not guarenteed to last at all , so when is a product fit for purpose ?
negative	obviously not this one so buyers beware , their guarentee is not worth anything so buy another product elsewhere .
negative	this is the worst_experience i have ever had with any florist .
negative	i wish i could post a picture of how sad and pathetic my flowers were .
negative	not one of them opened after i received them , cut the stems , put in a vase with water and the plant food they provide , and took the webbing off the flowers that protects them during shipment .
negative	we thought we were ordering a beautiful sunflower arrangement ( with 00 sunflowers ) from a local_florist .
negative	no .
negative	this was just 00 sunflower stems and two tiny filler leaves shipped from new_jersey ( to california ).
negative	and one of the flowers was so rotten it just fell_off .
negative	not one of the sunflowers opened up .
negative	they are just shriveled little yellow things .
negative	i could get nicer flowers at the grocery_store for $ 0 .
negative	and this was an expensive arrangement !
negative	worst_experience ever .
negative	my boyfriend was so embarrassed .
negative	luckily they were shipped to my home so i didn_'_t have to go through the embarrassment of friends seeing them .
negative	i ordered on the monday_morning before father '_s day , they didn_'_t even despatch until the friday .
negative	when i paid £ 0 . 00 for four day shipping i had believed i was paying for delivery within four days .
negative	the estimated delivery on the order even said that week so i had no reason to think it wasn_'_t going to be there on time .
negative	it didn_'_t turn up .
negative	very disappointed dad .
negative	i won_'_t order again .
negative	i placed my order on jan 00 and i have yet to receive it .
negative	i have contacted them and they can '_t give me any information about my order they keep telling_me to contact my post l office and i have contacted them and they do not have my package .
negative	besides , you order online because its convienent to shop online and have it mailed to your house so why do i have to take time to call the post_office everyday so i can eventually go pick_up my package ?
negative	!!!
negative	how ridiculous and i find it so absurd you have to pay to possibly get a tracking_number !!!!!
negative	i also tried to cancel my order and they said they can not do that because my order has_been processed but once i get my order i can return it .. how am i suppose to return my item if i haven_'_t received it ?
negative	i am so disappointed i never write_reviews but i had to take the time out of my day to write this review !!!!!
negative	to warn people about their poor customer_service well poor service in general !!!!!
negative	horrible horrible horrible this will be the last time i order anything from beauty_bay again
negative	the dress i picked did not show the color on the website as many of the other stiles showed only a fee colors .
negative	i spoke to a very nice customer_service agent who told me that i could see the color that i wanted on another style .
negative	the color that i saw was totally not what i received ..
negative	i was very disappointed because i went through the trouble and expense to order and i felt deceived .
negative	i have requested the total amount back .
negative	let '_s see if they do the right thing .
negative	still_waiting for the food and she has_been out for days .
negative	i have to go locally to buy her more
negative	i wrote expedia . ca and email_asking if i could use paypal to pay for an international flight , and got an_email_saying i could .
negative	i went through the whole booking process and was on the phone with them for 0 hours and a half , to find out i couldn ´ t use neither paypal nor my debit_card !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	i am furious .....
negative	no rooms were available for 0 hours prior to my being " confirmed " with a room at the hilton_garden inn , fort_myers airport , florida .
negative	my credit_card was billed and i was robbed of nearly $_000 .
negative	i have filed the necessary fraud paperwork with my credit_card company .
negative	charged my card one month in advance without telling_me !
negative	i ordered three_pairs of shoes for christmas around 00 / 0 / 0000 and they said the shipping time would be in 0 - 0 days .
negative	in 0 days i recieved only one pair of the shoes and a reciept stating that the other two_pairs of shoes were not shipped yet .
negative	i decieded i ' d wait it out to see if the other two_pairs of shoes showed_up but weeks went by and i still had not recieved them .
negative	on christmas_eve i got an_email_stating that ami_club_wear had given me back $_00 . 00 on the one pair of shoes i had ordered that had not been shipped , but that the other ones were on their way .
negative	when the pair of shoes arrived i opened them to find they seemed to be a size too big , and they stated they were 0 . 0 '_s and fit like 0 . 0s and had scratches up and down the sides of the shoes .
negative	these shoes were considered sale items and ami refused to refund me for the pair of shoes .
negative	it isn_'_t worth it .
negative	a good site i always order shoes from with the same exact prices and actually reliable customer_service is gojane . com they always alert you right_away if something is out of stock and things actually get to you on time all at once with no scratches .
negative	gojane . com also has some of the same pairs of shoes ami does carry but for cheaper .
negative	gojane . com is a way better website to get cheaper good quality shoes from .
negative	oh and they actually fit to size .
negative	:-/
negative	i ordered the card for my son and decided to go with a different company with a faster turn_around time it took 0days 0 managers 0 employees to cancel the order very very displeased .
negative	deceived !
negative	i trusted that my reservation was kept but when i arrived they had no reservation and no unit available !
negative	the manager did not even try to apologize or accommodate with any other unit options .
negative	the manager blamed the company by having a number listed that was not local .
negative	very frustrating !
negative	i ordered perfume on 00 / 00 for a friends birthday which was 00 / 00 and it still_hasn_'_t arrived hence the refund which was given on 00 / 00 !!
negative	i will never order again from this company , poor customer_service !
negative	!
negative	i purchased rx eyeglasses ( transitions ) and received sunglasses .
negative	i obtained an_rma_number and returned the sunglasses , via_ups , and wrote on the invoice what they were supposed to be .
negative	the package was delivered on january 00 , 0000 and i called numerous_times to find out when i could expect my glasses to be returned .
negative	they called me to ask me questions on february_00th .
negative	i answered the questions and explained to the girl that i ordered eyeglasses not sunglasses and asked why it took so long .
negative	she blamed the snow storms .
negative	i received the corrected eyeglasses yesterday , february_00th and they sent sunglasses for the second time .
negative	i immediately called customer_service , received a voicemail , left my name , number and order number and have not heard from them yet , february_00th @ 0 : 00_pm .
negative	i will never purchase another item from this vendor .
negative	we use talktalk since september , and continuously have problem with it . there is hardly connection , always says no internet_connection !
negative	i tried many_times to contact them , but i never have answer ! i wrote a complaint again , but i bet no one will answer ...
negative	customer_service and service s ... t !
negative	never again !
negative	i sent two mobile_phones to them and only received a cheque for one .
negative	the payment was lower_than offered as they said the phone had a small chip on the screen .
negative	the phone was in perfect_condition when i sent it to them and i had wrapped it up securely in bubble_wrap !
negative	my adiminstrative assistant reserve me a room for the night for a busniess trip .
negative	days before i was to leave , i had to cancel my reservations .
negative	when my admin assist made the reservations she made sure that i would be able to cancel my reservations if i needed to at no cost to my credit_card .
negative	however when she tried to cancel my reservations your company tried to charge my credit_card .
negative	once you decided not to charge me the full price of the hotel room , it took several days to credit my charge card .
negative	which should of never been charged in the first place .
negative	i will not make another reservation at your hotel again .
negative	they advertise like you are getting a great deal .
negative	then i started comparing_prices .
negative	whoa .
negative	let '_s start with 00 ou .
negative	of world '_s best kitty_litter .
negative	it starts at $_00 and goes on sale to 00 .
negative	at the other stores - it starts at 00 and than goes on sale .
negative	not happy at all .
negative	the shuttle left the site early & i had to go somewhere_else to park .
negative	just dissappointed .
negative	i used this service last_minute and needed a room with 0 beds , which i made explicitly clear to the booking agent .
negative	i told her i only wanted to book if she could guarantee 0 beds in the room , and she said she was reserving that type of room .
negative	when we arrived at the property , of course there was only a " request " for a 0 - bed room , and they had none .
negative	i ' d paid in full and it was non_- refundable , so there was nothing i could do , even_though i was not getting what i was promised when i paid .
negative	on top of that , the agent told me that parking was free , that there was a refrigerator and microwave in the room , and that my points for staying at a sheraton would be applied on check in .
negative	none of that was true .
negative	when i called reservation_counter back to complain , i had to wait 0 minutes to speak to a supervisor and all he did was apologize .
negative	horrible , horrible service and i will never , ever use them again .
negative	they lied to me and took my money knowing there was nothing at all i could do about it .
negative	i purchased two of the blow out led_light for my dog collar .
negative	neither on works .
negative	i have no_idea if they can be replaced .
negative	or how to go about it .
negative	i put them on my dog and all he has to do is walk and the lights shuts off .
negative	both of them shut off as soon as he started walking .
negative	i '_m very disappointed .
negative	call the hotel for reservation for 0 rooms at pheasant run resort .
negative	i had to repeat my self several_times & was not understood .
negative	i realized that i did not call the hotel_directly as thought .
negative	the person_who took the reservation had no_clue of the place i was calling even_though i thought it was a direct line to the place .
negative	i had to spell the name of the hotel several_times and have the dates and repeated over and over my requests .
negative	we made the reservations for 0 nights & the customer_service person only booked one night .
negative	this messed_up our trip & had to pack the next_morning after arriving really late the night before .
negative	they hotel could not accommodate our trip & it ruined the day !!
negative	due to the last_minute packing we were late to the wedding we came for .
negative	the hotel was sub par & the ppl at the front_desk were rude & not accommodating .
negative	not happy & will not book with this service ever again .
negative	i purchased round_trip flight tickets along with the cancellation insurance .
negative	unfortunately a work obligation prompted me to need to reschedule and i thought it would be ok since i purchased the " cancellation " insurance .
negative	nope !
negative	first i asked if i could delay my departing flight to a different day that there were still tickets available and i was told i ' d have to pay $_000 .
negative	i asked would it be better to use the cancellation protection and just repurchase and they said yes .
negative	i called the insurance folks through_travelocity and they said i had to submit a claim which i did .
negative	the claim was declined because it wasn_'_t a medical or family problem .
negative	it was cancellation insurance and i still had over a month for my trip .
negative	after that , my 00yr_old_son does actually break his collarbone and his orthopedist appointment and injury would '_ve prevented me from going on my trip .
negative	this should allow me to qualify for reimbursement but since it was cancelled before his accident it '_s too late to place another claim to try again to refund my ticket or get a credit for a ticket that travelocity very well resold !
negative	!
negative	i ordered through yelp on delivery . com for a restaurant in the area .
negative	i never got a call from delivery . com about whether my food would be delivered .
negative	i had to call the restaurant to have them tell me that they wont deliver bc it was a stormy night and that i must contact delivery . com to get my money back .
negative	i contacted delivery . com via_email and its been nearly a week with no reply from anyone and still have a charge on my acct .
negative	thjs will be the last time i will request delivery through delivery . com and i expect to get my money back asap .
negative	as said in the title , what more could i ask for that the excellent service that lenstore gives .
negative	spent 0 hours on the phone trying to get a flight refund that was due me .
negative	expedia came up with an excuse ( scam ), wherein , i was issued a credit ; i would have to use the credit with expedia , and i could not use the credit to change an existing flight reservation .
negative	what a scam company !!
negative	my advice to everyone reading this post is , don_'_t book through_expedia .
negative	booked a flight and hotel thru your company to attend my sons wedding in las_vegas .
negative	go to check in to find out we don_'_t have seat together or at all .
negative	contacted jet_blue and they told me to contact you so i did and the girl i first spoke to was all not helpful at all .
negative	she kept telling_me that i had to arrive 0 hours early to the airport to get my seat .
negative	i explain that i had seats on the way home why don_'_t i have them going , shhe told me that the airlines would not let her book any thing now .
negative	i said i know they will only let_me if i wanted to pay the 00 . 00 for more leg room .
negative	i said i should have to pay this .
negative	you people are responsible for getting me a seat .
negative	and still she kept apolozing .
negative	i told her i want to speak to a manager she the kept me on hold for over 00_min .
negative	i them spoke to a gentleman name seth in the philipenes and proceed to explain , and got know where with him .
negative	i then had to wait another 00_min for a lauren scott lead sup .
negative	and proceeded to tell her this is not satisfactory .
negative	i ask her to credit my ticket and i would purchase the seat and she said that is not your policy .
negative	i work in customer_service 00 year and have never_heard of not satisfying the customer .
negative	i dont_know how you have stayed in business if this is the way you treat your customer .
negative	first and formost the customer pays your salary and without us you wouldn_'_t be in business or have a job .
negative	so what i think you should have done was satisfy the customer and not piss them off .
negative	we book about 00000 to 00000 in customer for this trip .
negative	which i will let them know how you did not solve the issue at all and how all the apologies in the world is not the way to handle such matters .
negative	that is more aggrevating than anything .
negative	customer_service in this matter was unsatisfactory .
negative	worst company i have ever_dealt_with .
negative	will tell anyone that may use this website not to book thru this company .
negative	i recently booked a hotel through this company and ended_up being charged 0 % more then the invoice indicated .
negative	they have a conversion chart from euro to usd that is significantly_less then the going rate .
negative	the usd price is provided in big bold numbers with a faint and hidden price in euros .
negative	the bottom_line is you are charged the euro price .
negative	my transaction happened 0 months_ago and they are continuing to still do this today .
negative	do yourself a favor and stay away from the company .
negative	i applyed at the end of dec . and heard_nothing .
negative	by feb . called and was told i shoud be covered .
negative	spent at_least an_hour on the phone with humana who had no information on me .
negative	turned_out my information was never given to humana .
negative	finally recived an invoice on march_00th which could not be paid without an account number .
negative	called and got the account number and they were trying to charge me for the full month of feb . and march even had no insurance until march_00th .
negative	ended_up paying for the full month of march just to have insurance and still trying to get feb . taken off my bill .
negative	have made mutiple calls .
negative	i will never se them aagain my mom died and all they want is money they sold my stuff
negative	do not like the contacts i received .
negative	i have used petflow a number of time and have always been very pleased .
negative	i got a notice that this order had been picked_up by fed_ex .
negative	unfortunately it never arrived .
negative	when i called yesterday i was told that it was in a warehouse and would probably never be delivered .
negative	they put in a replacement order which they say i should have in a a few_days .
negative	i was connected with brenda a " customer_service " rep when i wanted to check on my reservation since i was unable to do so through the booking lounge as the phone message continuously repeated as i was hold for over 0 minutes .
negative	i only wanted to make_sure that the room had two beds and that it was nonsmoking as it did not indicate on the confirmation .
negative	brenda just kept_repeating that the reservation cannot be modified since i booked on the 00th of march for an april 0st arrival ( 0_weeks out ).
negative	when i asked the direct number to the hotel brenda provided me a number that was not toll_free so then i asked for a toll_free number and she said that they did not have one that she knew of .
negative	i was able to locate a toll_free number quickly off of the internet to the harrah '_s central reservations and spoke to a nice man_who looked up my reservation by my name and arrival_date and was able to confirm in 00 seconds that the room did have two beds and that it was nonsmoking .
negative	i am not sure why brenda couldn_'_t call harrah '_s or at_least suggest that i do myself .
negative	brenda is very good at repeating " your room cannot be modified " even_though that wasn_'_t even the reason_why i was calling .
negative	maybe further customer_service training for brenda might be a good idea .
negative	i won_'_t be booking with bookit . com again .
negative	hotwire provides a much_better service .
negative	very horrible experience !!!!
negative	i will never shop_here again ever
negative	have paid £_000 for various products on myprotein a week_ago with next_day delivery and still not recieved anything a wk later
negative	update_: 0 / 0 / 00
negative	i was told that i would receive a full_refund but its been a month and no word .
negative	i also wrote to customer_service 0 days ago for a follow_up and did not receive a response .
negative	this is ridiculous !!!
negative	!
negative	my order finally arrived a month after it was placed .
negative	i had seen youtube reviews of their monogram necklaces and decided that it was worth buying as christmas_gifts .
negative	the necklaces arrived in plain packages stuffed in a bubble envelope from israel ( yes , from israel !).
negative	the items were so poorly packaged that one of the pendants arrived damaged .
negative	the 00k gold_plated chains also came prematurely tarnished or at_least two out of the four chains appeared darker in color .
negative	the pendants were not high shine glossy pendants as appeared on their website .
negative	it was dull with fine scratches as if it was sand down and not properly polished .
negative	one of the jump ring attaching the pendant to the chain was also poorly made .
negative	it was in an oval shape and slightly_bent .
negative	i can '_t explain what an disappointment this was .
negative	i take_pride in selecting good gifts and i refuse to give these away .
negative	i have contacted customer_service but they are slow in responding .
negative	i will never order from them again and do not recommend for anyone to purchase from them either .
negative	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
negative	reply to autumn :
negative	my understanding is that i will receive a much_quicker response on trustpilot versus via_email directly to mynamenecklace '_s customer_service .
negative	autumn , thank_you for the speedy reply but please do not have the items remade if you are unable to offer the exact high shine / polished monogram pendants as appeared on your website .
negative	i also don_'_t wish to have the items " rushed " and be made with " negligence ".
negative	at this time i would like to ask for a full_refund and please send me a pre_- paid shipping label to send the items back .
negative	thanks .
negative	i purchased the gift_card for $_000 on november_00th , 0000 .
negative	when i did not receive it by december 0nd , i called customer_service and was passed thru to a supervisor .
negative	the supervisor told me to wait a few_days , that it was probably in the mail still due to the holiday .
negative	i waited the time i was asked to wait and called again .
negative	this time , i was issued a number ( csrhd - 000000 ) and told that someone would be calling me right back .
negative	today is december_0th and after not hearing back from anyone , i called again .
negative	i explained that i was running short on time due to having to mail the card to my grandson , and i was given options of paying to have the card cancelled , or having it reissued .
negative	i ( of course ) had it reissued and was assured it would be here next week ( at the latest ).
negative	thank_you betty for at_least attempting to help me .
negative	this , i am sure , will be my last attempt at getting the card .
negative	i ordered a wilma and betty wig .
negative	the betty one appears to be okay but the wilma one is horrible .
negative	i have a small to standard size head and very short hair ... the wig is very small and keeps creeping off my head .
negative	also the style is not as_pictured .
negative	very dissappointed ...
negative	the book was listed as good condition , but when i recieved it was in bad condition .
negative	the paper inside the book also indicated there it was mold damage to the book .
negative	i ordered two front_wheel sensors for my 00 mercury mountaineer .
negative	the website showed that they were available and the price was one of the best i ' d found on the internet .
negative	two_days_later , i got an e_- mail telling_me that they were going to process a refund for the parts , but the refund would take 0 business days .
negative	apparently telling_me that the parts were unavailable was too much to ask .
negative	they ' d already charged my card for the parts and had no_intention of shipping them .
negative	yeah , i '_m disgusted .
negative	check your stock before you charge people money for parts , then when you are able to ship the parts then charge the card .
negative	hey , how about a courtesy e_- mail to let someone know that you don_'_t have the parts in stock ?
negative	i received a part for my 0000 exterra ( bumper side panel ) .
negative	when i went to place the part on my vehicle the holes in the part did not line up to the holes in my vehicle .
negative	which , lead me to believe that it was a knock off version of the actual part i needed .
negative	was not satisfied .
negative	i kept reading on the webpage after selecting my hotel how i was getting the best rate , " guaranteed !"
negative	it was so pronounced , that it actually encouraged me to check .
negative	my $_000_per_night room was actually $_000 on the hotels website .
negative	but , on booking . com there is a full_refund cancellation_policy , and on hotel website there is a fee if you cancel within 00_hours .
negative	so basically , for my 0 night_stay it would be an_additional_$_000 for some_sort of travel_insurance for the hotel reservation only .
negative	understandable if i '_m staying for a week at $_000_per_night hotel maybe , but not in this situation !
negative	i would not recommend or use your service again .
negative	the flowers were awful they look dead and for the price it defiantly wasn_'_t worth it !
negative	fast turnaround , but the mice have eaten through the rentokil electronic mousetraps rendering them useless .
negative	i '_ve emailed about this but haven_'_t heard a thing .
negative	i would suggest if you are thinking of using this company - think again !
negative	!
negative	we purchased tickets for the liverpool v chelsea match back in nov 0000 and had to pay the full_amount there and then ( over_£ 0k ).
negative	i contacted the company 0_weeks prior to the event and was told by gareth burch ( senior account_manager ) the tickets would be sent the following week .
negative	instead of the tickets we received a phone_call to say they would not be sent - no apology , no way of an explanation and no help in resolving the situation !!
negative	!
negative	after chasing and nearly 0_weeks after the phone_call cancelling the tickets i have just been informed that the company are " delighted " to tell me they can refund my money !!!
negative	thanks for that !!
negative	what about the interest on the £ 0k that they have had for over 0 months ?
negative	what about compensation for the hotels booked or the train_tickets paid for ?
negative	?
negative	as this was a corporate hospitability booking for our clients , we have been left looking stupid and unprofessional and will no_doubt lose business as a result ...
negative	thanks corporate hospitality ....
negative	ordered flowers for my daughter , phoned her and asked if she had them , she said no .
negative	contacted iflorist and they eventually delivered them 0 week_later .
negative	i will not be using iflorist again , this is the 0nd time they have let_me down
negative	wish i hadn_'_t ordered this .
negative	ordered it on tuesday_morning at 00 am - 0st_class royal_mail - still nothing .
negative	this is for a pair of shorts .
negative	according to their website : free delivery on everything
negative	chain reaction cycles offer free delivery to anywhere in the uk or ireland , with no minimum order value .
negative	we also offer a range of guaranteed time specific postage options , details of which you can find below .
negative	if you order before 0pm monday - friday and all your items are in stock , we aim to provide same day dispatch .
negative	spoke to the customer_service on the phone - nothing .
negative	i am expected to wait two_weeks before i am allowed to complain and make a claim for my purchase .
negative	i '_ve tried ordering from them at 0 different times .
negative	the first time i had problems waiting for delivery and customer_service didn_'_t help me out .
negative	the second time , i ordered something and wanted to change it and called within 0 minutes of placing the order , but with myprotein , you aren_'_t allowed to do that and you have to post it back on your buck .
negative	the third time , the website didn_'_t work and the woman was just_plain rude about it .
negative	quite possible the most irritating phone customer_service team i have ever come_across .
negative	they also use yodel delivery services - the worst delivery company in the uk !
negative	please don_'_t use these_guys .
negative	the place is incredibly hard to find , they work out of a shack , and the only pleasant thing about the experience was the smile of the driver who took us from the shack to the airport .
negative	i was extremely uneasy about the safety of my car for the duration of my trip , and having to stand outside in 00 degree weather for an_hour because " global " isn_'_t on the van , it '_s actually " ewr parking ," and the sign reads " days inn ," which is not the name of the hotel where the car was stashed away ( it '_s actually what looks like an abandoned econolodge .
negative	go figure .)
negative	just made for a very frustrating return to an otherwise great getaway .
negative	i suppose it '_s really all my issue though : i didn_'_t ask , " what '_s on the side of the van ?"
negative	until my eighth phone_call to the dispatcher .
negative	oh !
negative	global is a third_party ?
negative	it '_s really ewr parking ?
negative	that makes this all just fine .
negative	thank_you .
negative	i had no_idea .
negative	please don_'_t use this service .
negative	i had to change our reservation , i was on the phone with a customer representative for over an_hour .... mostly just waiting for them to make the changes .
negative	i double_checked before booking the hotel , to make_sure it was an " all_inclusive ."
negative	the representative assured it me it was .
negative	a few_days_later i contacted the hotel , and they let us know that our hotel room was not " all_inclusive ."
negative	i have sent several emails to the customer_service department , and i have yet heard from them .
negative	we had a terrible experience with this company after we bought a toilet from them .
negative	the toilet came broken ( a big piece of toilet back falling_off right out of the box ), contacted the company , they asked us to pay the shipping back plus 00_% restocking_fee which totaled to be about the same price as the price of the toilet !!
negative	what kind of company will ask customers to pay for broken item plus restocking_fee when they can '_t resell the product and they are probably reimbursed from the shipping company for the price of the toilet ?
negative	after disagreeing to pay such fees for receiving a broken toilet , they simply stopped responding and we ' re stuck with a paid broken toilet .
negative	if you don_'_t want to end up in a situation like ours , don_'_t order anything from them .
negative	this company seems to only care about their loss but not customer '_s .
negative	take your own risk purchasing with them .
negative	my business critical domain has just been cancelled because 000 took money from my account and did not renew the domain .
negative	they are now expecting me to pay them £_00 . 00 to ' redeem ' my account even_though it '_s blatantly their failure .
negative	again , i '_m getting no help from them , claiming it '_s all my responsibility to ensure they have paid for the domain that they have taken money from me to do so .
negative	i will be moving all my domains from them as soon as i can .
negative	they cannot be trusted to provide a reliable or honest service .
negative	dårligste service nogensinde !
negative	de havde åbenbart ikke trukket beløbet fra mig visa - det skal siges at det_er snart et år siden jeg handlede hos_dem og får først nu en rykker .
negative	ingen venlig tone trods det_er deres fejl og_ikke min .
negative	da de så havde fået pengene var de møgflabede !!
negative	kan_ikke anbefales !!!!
negative	!
negative	dårligste service .
negative	dårlig behandling .
negative	man betaler i dyre domme af penge man dårligt har .
negative	de er_der_ikke for medlemmernes skyld , men kun for deres egen skyld .
negative	de sidder og griner ad folk , taler ned til_en .
negative	er hånlige og møguforskammet .
negative	det_er_ikke acceptabelt .
negative	de skulle gerne arbejde med_en og_ikke mod en .
negative	og de skal absolut heller_ikke true .
negative	it is dishonest to represent yourself as part of hampton when in reality you are expedia .
negative	although pods were advertised as compatable with nespresso machines , the lever would not close as the capsule bottoms prevented the machine to close .
negative	a refund was offered but i do not have the original packaging and it just seems like a real_pain .
negative	i purchased right and left front struts and 0 coils for my volvo .
negative	i did not note the expense as i thought it might be additional shipping for separate shipping or weight of parts .
negative	the confirmation_email clearly_stated they were shipping and charging me for 0 additional front strut .
negative	the bill was so much higher due to the additional part .
negative	i went to the site issued a submission to customer_service explaining to i did not order three front struts for my volvo , same part number .
negative	the response was there is nothing we can do about it .
negative	you will need to submit a separate request for a return form , fill it out , submit it , wait for processing , return the part and once they receive the part ( i pay to return ) they will reimburse_me .
negative	i replied very carefully explaining i had responded in ample time allowing them to correct their mistake .
negative	i did not order the part .
negative	i do not need two struts for one front suspension .
negative	they never responded to that .
negative	my husband and i set together filling out the form , he confirming it was the correct_part and one right and the other left , there were only two in the cart .
negative	the springs were delivered first .
negative	the struts were delivered the second week after my attempt to work this out with pg .
negative	partsgeek made no attempt to correct this problem .
negative	i am stuck with an extra strut i will never use and short of additional precious time and money !!!!!
negative	!
negative	the parts and prices are great but the customer_services is extremely unfair and unprofessional .
negative	something happened with their website during the process indicating that the reservation did not go through .
negative	however , when i checked my email , there was a confirmed reservation .
negative	i tried to cancel it online and discovered there would be a $_00 fee to cancel it .
negative	i tried to cancel it by speaking to a customer_service representative and discovered there would be a $_00 .
negative	cancellation_fee .
negative	all of this happened with ten or fifteen_minutes of making the reservation .
negative	very poor customer_service .
negative	until i got to main office in manchester , as creekside printers ltd - the greenwich franchise i placed the order with online - was adamant i should deal with printing . com directly myself , even_though they took my money for the order ... main office '_s help was excellent after i contacted them - shame it had to come to disagreable conversation and delay in getting the order ...
negative	the product i obtained eventually met my needs and i was very pleased with the quality despite the aggravation and stress .
negative	the experience puts me off using printing . com now though ....
negative	our order was shipped and delivered to the wrong_address .
negative	the address on the delivery was correct ... everything was correct but somehow it ended_up at an electrician office on the other side of town who had done some wiring in our building .
negative	not impressed with service .
negative	i ordered a new millbrook mattress from bedworld , having checked their reviews on the website .
negative	their price was good and they promised next_day delivery .
negative	the courier contacted me the next_day to say the mattress had been delivered to them damaged so i wouldn_'_t receive it that day , and they would let bedworld know .
negative	the next_day i had heard_nothing so i contacted bedworld who apologised and said they had another mattress and it would be delivered the following_day .
negative	i had made arrangements for the old mattress to be collected so i had had two sleepless_nights by this time .
negative	the mattress arrived around 0pm and it had been raining .
negative	there was only a plastic covering on it and it was very wet and muddy .
negative	i asked if the cover could be removed before they took it upstairs and they said they weren_'_t allowed to do that so i had to try to wipe all the mud off .
negative	they didn_'_t take off their shoes so i had a dirty mattress and muddy shoes going up my clean staircase and beige carpet .
negative	i had to wipe up after them as they went , and my wallpaper was scraped in the process .
negative	i even had to wipe mud off my ceiling !
negative	i made sure i marked the delivery note that i hadn_'_t inspected the mattress and when we got the plastic cheet off it had been ripped in several places and the mattress was dirty .
negative	i have been unable to remove the marks but as i had experienced so much hassle i simply couldn_'_t be bothered asking for another and having more trouble and damage and more sleepless_nights .
negative	the drivers said the other packaging had come off in their warehouse before loading and that with large mattresses this always happened as they weren_'_t packed properly .
negative	this is one first time customer who will never order from bedworld again .
negative	very disappointed indeed with my experience ..
negative	desperate for accommodations due to another resorts mistakenly canceled my reservation .
negative	called the center to find another room .
negative	i needed a room that night april_00th .
negative	the agent told me he found one at the golden nugget for that night 00 . 00 .
negative	i drove over there immediately .
negative	when i went to check in the clerk told me the reservation was made for may 00th !
negative	ridiculous mistake .
negative	how ridiculous ..
negative	they had 0 rooms available .
negative	000 . 00 .
negative	had to put it on a credit_card . not in the mood to sleep in my car .
negative	i will never use this reservation center again and i '_ll make_sure everyone i know doesn_'_t either .
negative	no excuse for lack of knowledge here
negative	i '_m not one for giving reviews online but i am so frustrated at this point and felt the need to do something .
negative	my first question is " does anyone actually answer the phone or emails at a0 skateboards ?"
negative	i '_ve had a truly horrible experience with this company .
negative	to start with , i wanted to order a board for my son '_s birthday .
negative	a0 seemed to have a great inventory and decent prices so i took a chance .
negative	i placed the order on 0 / 0 / 00 and received nothing as far as an order confirmation from them .
negative	( i did get a receipt from paypal that they took my money ).
negative	i tried repetedly to contact them to make_sure that they indeed had recieved my order .... igot no reply .
negative	i did get a call from them nearly a week_later saying that one of the parts i had ordered was no_longer in stock and they wanted to know what substitute i wanted so they could buiild the board .
negative	a substitution was not a big deal but the site says that most parts ship the next_day , this was 0 days_later that they were just starting my build , at that point i was pretty sure that i wasn_'_t going to get the board in time for the birthday_party .
negative	i was right .
negative	so forward to the delivery of the board on the march_00th .
negative	my son excitedly opened the box to find the wrong deck ( which costs less then the one i ordered ... my bill was not adjusted btw ) anyway , so i sent them an_email outlining my issues , included pictures of what i received and what i ordered expecting to get someone to contact me back with an_apology and a plan to rectify my issue .
negative	again , i got nothing .
negative	at this point i have sent emails , left messages ( no one ever answers the phone ) posted on their face book site and sent more non_- instant_chat requests .
negative	i have gotten zero replies .
negative	in my mind either a0 does not understand customer_service or thay just don_'_t care .
negative	i believe it '_s the latter as evidenced by the fact that someone built a custom orderd board with an obviously mismatched set of hardware and their complete lack of response .
negative	i '_m still hoping to hear from them to get these issues fixed but am glad i used paypal and a credit_card so i may have a chance to get my money back if not .
negative	so my last resort is to dispute my charges and take my story to facebook , google + and twitter so other don_'_t have to deal with this frustration .
negative	when the bouquet of flowers i ' d ordered did not arrive on the day i ' d requested , i contacted customer_services ; they took 0_weeks to come_back simply to deny the fact .
negative	i ' d made the effort to explain_why the day was so significant - it '_s the birthday of a friend who had died , the flowers were for his widow and children .
negative	the flowers were not worth the high cost either , but given the sadness we all felt , it now seems irrelevant .
negative	i placed an order with asos and i received a confirmation_email and everything .
negative	a few hours_later they emailed me saying that my order was cancelled and that i needed to scan in my drivers_license and other personal information .
negative	i placed this order with my credit_card and it was being shipped to my billing_address - nothing was out of the ordinary !
negative	i sent an_email to their customer care asking why they needed all of this information and it took them 0 hours to reply saying that my email was being transferred to another department .
negative	after that it took another day and i got another email_saying it would take another 00_hours .
negative	a full 0 days_later i finally got a real response basically repeating that i needed to send in my personal billing statement and drivers_license just to buy some clothes !
negative	ridiculous !
negative	i '_ll be ordering from a company that doesn_'_t require a background check just to buy some clothing !!!
negative	goodbye asos !
negative	expedia '_s app changed the date on my hotel reservation twice , when i received the email_confirmation , i called them immediately , but they still charged me .
negative	after 0 hours on the phone , i was promised a refund , only to receive a " sorry , no refund is available " a week_later .
negative	the time between app transaction and phone_call was 0 minutes max .
negative	how are they allowed to rob me like this ?
negative	very disappointed !!
negative	and out $_00 for nothing !
negative	thanks for ruining my day , not once , but twice !
negative	you will not get_rid of me that easy .
negative	i ordered a dress online , it came with the wrong_size packaged in a correctly labeled plastic_bag .. their so - called easy return was such a hair pulling experience i doublt anyone should trust the online portion rooted in the 00 '_s - they applied an incorrect order number to my return , even_though i supplied the correct one via their own form , thus hey said they couldn_'_t find the return because of this error .
negative	i went to ups for proof of return , which they received 0_weeks earlier , yet stikll said they couldn_'_t find .
negative	this went on for 0 - 0_weeks , finally when i asked for the smail mail address of management , i got a response that they would apply my credit to my card , but did not , instead applying to a store credit , thereby forcing me to spend my money there , and when i protested yet again by email to customerservice , they simply ignored my emails .
negative	thoroughly awful time .
negative	be very careful .
negative	the reason is because i am used to using southwest airlines as an airline .
negative	unfortunately for me , southwest does not fly to tampa , florida .
negative	since i fly sw , i am accustomed to being_able to change my dates for a relatively painless fee of ~ 00 or less .
negative	i have never , nor will i ever fly delta_airlines again from this point forward because as the flight became nearer , my father became_ill and i was unable to make the trip .
negative	the cost to reschedule just one leg of the flight is 000 . 00 !!!
negative	the rt flight was 000 . 00 , so you can imagine my dismay since i obviously am not going to pay 000 to change the times on my flight .
negative	delta_airlines sucks and the only_reason i did this was because travelocity sent an ad to my inbox so you are guilty by proxy !
negative	:(
negative	i purchased a hotpoint_fridge_freezer from curry , s on the 00 july and it was delivered the next .
negative	when it arrived it had no packaging on it at all .
negative	they put it in place and rushed out the door .
negative	i had to rush after them as it had a large dint in the freezer door .
negative	i was told ring the shop they will give you a few quid off it , when i told them that wasn_'_t acceptable , they left a phone_number and said they will sort it out .
negative	i made them write on the docket that it was damaged and they left .
negative	i rang knowhow immediately and had to go through an inquisition as they tried to convince me i must have bought shop soiled .
negative	i was furious , they eventually said they would send a hotpoint engineer with a new door .
negative	i left the freezer a couple of days to settle before buying food to fill it . as it was going to take over two_weeks before anyone was coming out . i need to use it .
negative	while i was filling it , i noticed a stain on the freezer door > how dose a brand_new
negative	product end up with a yellow stain on the door seal ?
negative	i started ringing them but no one was interested , they couldn_'_t care less , as i had an engineer was coming out , but i had questions that no one wanted to answer ,
negative	in the meantime i received a call from the hotpoint engineer to arrange a repair date for the 00 august , while on the phone i found out my fridge_freezer left the manufacturers 0 months before .
negative	how old dose something have to be before they can no_longer class it as new ?
negative	and where had it been .
negative	i rang again and asked to speak to a manager and was told no !
negative	!
negative	the behaviour of customer_services is awful . i am still in two minds whether to send it back . as a pensioner i cant_afford to buy another fridge_freezer while i had this one sent back , curry s have lost a loyal_customer as i would never use them again .
negative	.
negative	i had ordered a part for my son to ship to his house .
negative	when it had not arrived a week_later my son called to follow_up .
negative	because the shipping address was different than the billing_address , the order had been cancelled but we received no notice .
negative	i remain unclear on why this was an_issue but agreed to have the part shipped to my address and reordered and paid with the guy on the phone .
negative	the very next_day i received an_email_saying the part was out of stock and cancelled my order again .
negative	so no part but at_least we were informed this time although why they hadn_'_t told us this to begin with i cannot even guess .
negative	i ordered 000_dollars worth of parts .
negative	it '_s has_been almost 00 days and i haven_'_t gotten any kind of order status .
negative	the customer_service number does not work the phone rings for 0 minminutes and then nothing .
negative	i got an_email after i opened a few tickets saying my parts were in stock but it would just take time .
negative	well the only_reason i ordered from this site was because they promise fast and excellent customer_service .
negative	that is not the case .
negative	i will not be using this site again based solely on the awful customer_service .
negative	if you open a dispute , don_'_t even_bother , because there is no way you will get your money back if a seller screws you over .
negative	it puts the much need details about the order items in very fine_print .
negative	avoid this company !
negative	i signed_up online .
negative	it was quick and easy .
negative	received a great quote .
negative	however , when i arrived at the office to do the paper_work with the email conformation in hand , that gave_me direct instructions what to bring with me .
negative	i was told that with the " free months rent " i had to purchase a lock for 00 . 00 as well as purchase the insurance of 00 . 00 per_month .
negative	even_though i have homeowners , they said they i did not bring my declaration page .
negative	i brought exactly_what the instructions asked me to bring .
negative	the clerk was pleasant however , very inexperienced it was clear .
negative	when i point out what the email request that i bring without mention of the lock purchase nor to bring my homeowners policy she phones a manager in tucson .
negative	that person spoke to me in such a rude manner .
negative	stating " well , i guess you do not know much about the storage business and we are not the ones trying to rip you off , take it or leave it and to top it off said , i guess you cannot read " ( in a very smarty pants voice ) i responded rudely as well .
negative	here i wasted 0 . 0 hours of my time with this bait and switch offer .
negative	not good business sorry to say .
negative	i am going to a home assoc .
negative	meeting on friday and will certainly let those in attendance approx 000 know of this company practice .
negative	i bought certain clothes for a photo_shoot .
negative	i spent $_00 on shipping to get there on time .. because i figured , like amazon , 0 days meant 0 days .
negative	when i did confirm all this money on shipping , there was no ' estimated_arrival_date ' like lots of other online stores .
negative	so i called the next_day to see when my clothes would arrive .
negative	the lady on the phone told me that it wouldn_'_t get there until tuesday , at the earliest , and i needed my stuff by saturday .
negative	so i told her i was going to have to cancel .
negative	she said she would submit a request for it ... and this was about 00_hours after i had placed my order .
negative	i kept checking and checking my account , and it still said ' processing .'
negative	on sunday , i received an_email that said my order had shipped .
negative	i was really confused because i don_'_t understand_why it took 0 days before my order shipped , not to mention that i had cancelled it .
negative	i received my order and the quaility of the items was questionable , and none of them had tags on them .. but i no_longer needed them since my photo_shoot was already over and done with .
negative	i called the customer_service line to explain , and she said everything was listed in the store policy .
negative	and if i wanted to return my items that i would have to get a special number .. blah_blah_blah .
negative	so i tried to fill_out the dumb form online , and every time i tried to submit it , it told me that i left something out , said sorry , and cleared the entire form so i had to re - enter everything each time .
negative	after three_times of double checking , i finally successfully submitted it .
negative	now , i just received an_email_saying that ' none of my items qualify for exchange .'
negative	really ?!
negative	now i feel as if the woman on the phone who was supposed to cancel my order , probably lied and just said she ' d try to , since she knew none of my items were eligible to be returned anyway .
negative	which they don_'_t even return , just give store credit .
negative	it '_s such a sketchy business and i '_m going to attempt to complain and complain until someone actually responds to me .
negative	there is no customer_service at this store .
negative	if you want to get a hold of someone you have to wait on the phone for hrs .
negative	who_wants to wait to talk to someone while waiting on their cell_phones to be caller # 00 .
negative	thats mins i have to waste .
negative	they say you can leave a message for someone to call you back , but no one does .
negative	the site has good stuff but i wouldn_'_t reccommend going some where else
negative	hmm .
negative	i am not sure if i am reviewing the correct site .
negative	as i had only made one hotel reservation recently , i guess best_western reservation = getaway . com = hotelreservations . com and the review is posted on trustpilot .
negative	i called best_western reservation ( a number that i found on google ) to clarify a rate that i had found online on a best_western site .
negative	it took about 00_minutes before i spoke with someone_who didn_'_t say " best_western " - that should have been my first clue that i had called a generic number .
negative	i am not sure why the agent insisted on making the reservation on the phone for me .
negative	he spoke a little fast , i had to ask him to repeat a couple of times , but overall he was polite and professional and he seemed legit and i made my reservation .
negative	the e_- confirmation came promptly .
negative	but then i realized there was an_error with the number of people on the booking .
negative	i called the number again , and i got a different agent , who could not provide me with the same rate or an explanation of why the rates are different .
negative	it was off by about $_00 - 00 which was significant .
negative	given there was quite a bit of inconsistency ( online vs agent 0 vs agent 0 ) which i interpreted as lack of honest business management , plus it was really not so clear what company i was dealing_with , i didn_'_t want to be part of this and cancelled the reservation .
negative	booked a stay at holiday_inn laguna beach
negative	they said they would give me a deal on a 0 night_stay at 000 . 00 plus fees to total 000 . 00 the room was the worst location right next to the laundry_room which was noisy from the machines and the workers having the radio on the entire day & the dirty laundry carts right outside my door , also , said they would reduce the overnight parking for 0 cars to 00 . 00 a night instead of 00 . 00 . but when i arrived at holiday_inn they said we never reduce are prices on parking ??
negative	who ever you used to book this hotel was wrong !!
negative	so i will never use this site again !
negative	!
negative	i ordered 0 pair of sunglasses and one regular .
negative	it took_forever to get them , i had to keep calling to see where they were , got the run_around everytime i called .
negative	when i finally got them each sent separately , spaced out between 0_weeks they were awfull , i could have went to a dollar store and did better , the 0 sunglasses were suppose to be the same , well one was so dark you couldnt even see your lighted speedometer in the car .
negative	as far as prescription i dont_think there was an ounce of it in any of them .
negative	i called them about all of this several_times and was told you just need to get use to them .
negative	i said i wanted to return them and they wanted me to take a picture of them and send it to them ...... whats up with that ????
negative	i now a a case filed with pay_pal against them , it has_been over a week and global did not respond to pay_pal .
negative	don_'_t buy anything from global_eyeglasses !!
negative	!
negative	i received a message_saying my package had shipped over a week_ago .
negative	my package still has not arrived .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	ordered elite controller for xbox 000 000gb elite and got sent an all black slim , if you dont_know the difference , you should . nt be trading
negative	phoned and after 00_minutes someone answered
negative	total retard who could , nt tell his hand from his arse
negative	will n . e . v . e . r .
negative	use this company again
negative	p . s .
negative	elite controller has grey analogs sticks
negative	i had a terrible experience with your company .
negative	i had ordered a service on thurs 00 / 00 / 0000 , for collection the following_day .
negative	on 00 / 00 / 0000 , at 0pm , i was concerned why the collection had not yet been made .
negative	i contacted the company and i was informed that the courier had arrived outside the place , but could not find parking and therefore did not collect the parcel .
negative	despite contact numbers not being given , we were not informed that the courier was even in the local area .
negative	had he contacted us , we would have informed him where he could have parked .
negative	i refuse to believe that the drivers do not hold a mobile_phone or a radio to contact their bases to at_least pass on the information to let us know .
negative	in this day and age , they should at_least have radios .
negative	apparently the company was a sub - contractor of interparcel , however , neither the sub - contractor or interparcel took responsibility or even apologised , instead blaming each other .
negative	whether they are a sub contractor or not , both companies are affiliated with each other and therefore it is your responsibility to ensure excellent customer_service .
negative	had this been a good service , i would have recommended your service to the rest of the company , which are 00 branches covering southern england , all requiring courier services .
negative	instead , i will remember interparcel and the affiliated company as poor deliverers , with terrible customer_service skills .
negative	the company that i work for conduct customer_service courses and i suggest that your support_team and your drivers undergo some training , as there is clearly a substantial need .
negative	i spent 0 hours waiting in an airport waiting to actually get a flight after the big mess up .
negative	also i bought insurance that said i could change a flight with no penalty , turned_out to a lie .
negative	absolutely appalling , did not stick within the time_frame set
negative	we took our five dogs to the park at night to play .
negative	only one light worked and only for about 00_minutes .
negative	the others had to be continually turned on , then just stopped_working .
negative	took longer to get them on our furry children then they lasted .
negative	not even a good deal is a good deal if it doesn_'_t work .
negative	i ordered two_pairs of boots on jan_00th .
negative	i had them sent to a friend who was out of the country , and when she returned two_weeks_later she informed me that no boots were in the box and that there was red lingerie and some other clothing items .
negative	i contacted amiclubwear and they sent me a shipping label to return the items , which was good of them .
negative	the person i sent them to left the country again ( shes a traveller ) and couldnt get t return the items until 0_weeks_later .
negative	she returned them and i heard_nothing from amiclubwear about what the nest step would be .
negative	i called them and they said at that point that they had shipped it and they would email me the tracking_number ( which i shouldnt have to call to get ).
negative	when they sent the items again , it was march_00th that they were received and again only one of the two boots i ordered arrived !
negative	i called quite upset that they could mess up a simple order twice and i demanded a refund of my money for one of the boots .
negative	the person i called said that i could not get a refund unless i took a picture of the items i received .
negative	now this is ridiculous because it is astounding that they would not have a system that tracks items that they send out to customers what if she didnt have a camera ?
negative	since my friend travelled alot i didnt think she would have the time to take a picture and i would have to wait longer for a refund when it has already been 0 months !
negative	she took the picture and i emialed it to amiclubwear and the next_day i got my refund .
negative	overall the service i received was terrible and i would not order from them ever again .
negative	have been waiting for over two months .
negative	order two items , one took two months to arrive the other item they say was shipped but tracking has not changed in two_weeks .
negative	when ask about when item was shipped they just reply with tracking_number and have a nice day .
negative	it has bad service .
negative	nothing is clear in your statement balance online and if you call credits , they are just rude .
negative	i was calling to talk about my account and those guys in the credits department were just rude and didn_'_t help at all .
negative	i am not using this account anymore .
negative	i wish i could erase it but i don_'_t want my credit history to be messed_up because of them .
negative	willing to pay $_00 over other_websites due to statement on website that frames were in stock and mine had broke .
negative	paid_extra for quick ship , notified that frames were back ordered ( so not in stock ).
negative	cancelled order via_email and also thru website customer_service page with drop down list of actions with one being " order cancellation ".
negative	frames_direct ignored both notifications and sent email 00 days_later that frames had been mailed .
negative	wow , i called immediately andean put on hold for 00_minutes only to hang up and call back to find out they had closed 00_minutes earlier ... i would have been hold all night .
negative	they did pay for return shipping and refunded money , but company seems questionable .
negative	they mistaken my address , it was supposed that the had come to my place to bring it to me , but they didn_'_t .
negative	i saw it on the internet , and then they wrote that it was in the local depot waiting collection , but it wasn_'_t .
negative	almost one week after this , my packet finally arrived ...
negative	received an_email offering chocolates at ' greatly_reduced price '; ordered a box .
negative	received a second email soon after , with the same offer ; ordered a box .
negative	both arrived , excellent chocolates , but not to my taste and i then cancelled the account on line .
negative	i had an acknowedgement from them , confirming i would receive no more debits and no more chocolates .
negative	then noticed that only a few_days_later a third debit was on my account , this time for the full price of £_00 . 00 .
negative	ever since have been emailing , trying to telephone ( no - one answers ), finally getting very offhand responses saying it is my fault there were two accounts ( does no - one check , when they receive a new customer ?
negative	), that i am committed not only to a december box but also one at end january .
negative	they debited my account on 00th_december ; no third box has_been received ; they will not refund me , nor get properly in touch ( apart_from automated_responses ).
negative	i am an exceedingly good , happy customer when treated properly , but this company and it '_s attitude is appaling .
negative	i '_ve taken it up with my bank , and also written to someone_who i thought might care ( a taste tester ) at cocoa_boutique .
negative	no - one answers , just the automated_system .
negative	it is their error , to have opened two ( identical in every way ) accounts ; they should be more aware and responsive of their market - flooding email techniques and possible consequences .
negative	now , they should 0 ) completely refund my £_00 . 00 .
negative	0 ) confirm again they have removed my bank_details ( i thought i was just paying for the one box , each time ) and 0 ), an_apology would be nice .
negative	if their long - delayed chocolates do ever turn up - which i hope not , since they ' re too late to be a christmas_present , and i would not pay £_00 . 00 for half a pound of sugar for myself - they should send me a freepost label .
negative	but i '_m no holding my breath , since no - one there seems to care at all .
negative	prospective customers ... get yourself of to le club chocolat , they really care about customers , answer them , allow returns , and generally know about customer care .
negative	boo sucks , at this happy christmas time !!!
negative	!
negative	when i booked our tickets from tampa to toronto , with one stop in atlanta , i thought i would be able to sit next to my husband .
negative	we are going to canada for a funeral , and i am a white knuckle flier .
negative	i am absolutely terrified of flying alone .
negative	i found out that the seats i purchased for myself , my husband and my brother in law were not seated together .
negative	i had to go online after purchasing the tickets and pick individual seats behind each other .
negative	i cannot fly without my husband next to me , and this is really scaring me .
negative	why wasn_'_t there some_sort of notice on the web_page that the seats were not together ??
negative	is there anything we can do ?
negative	i recently placed my 0nd purchase with this company and still have not received my order .
negative	when i contacted them about this they told me it would take up to 00 days to receive my purchase !
negative	this information is not shown anywhere on there site .
negative	i told the customer rep that info like that should be on the site .
negative	then she proceeded to argue with me , when i complained_about the lack of information for shipping overseas .
negative	then when i said something about it taking a month to get my order she tried to say it doesn_'_t take month after having literally told me herself it takes up to 00 days .
negative	last time i checked that is about a month long !
negative	the argument went on until she abruptly ended it .
negative	as a former retail manager i never would have treated a customer like this .
negative	i never would have told them one thing and then denied having said immediately afterward !
negative	i will never order from them again and will be cancelling my account with them .
negative	on their website they show you the size of their trees they send vs their competition .
negative	what they show for themselves is not true .
negative	i received 0 trees in 0 gallon containers that were roots only .
negative	then when i called to complain and ask for my refund , they gave_me so much_trouble i said just forget it .
negative	out of my entire order which was over $_000 . 00 , only 0 plant was good which was 0 pink wisteria .
negative	i lost a lot of money from this account and suggest you not order as the quality is horrible and they do not give you a refund on their shoddy plants .
negative	i '_m turning them into bbb .
negative	victoria wells
negative	san_antonio , tx
negative	here '_s the deal .
negative	i signed_up with stamps . com in march of 0000 to make a custom photo stamp .
negative	since then i have been charged 00 . 00 a month for a service that i have never used .
negative	it '_s totally fraudulent .
negative	i have not received one email , phone_call , or annual statement .
negative	they just keep billing and billing .
negative	i called to cancel and after 0 . 0 hours of being on hold and transferred i was offered a year free subscription to the company .
negative	what a joke .
negative	do not sign_up !
negative	!
negative	our family will not do_business this company any longer .
negative	too much stress , buy it now still has strings attached .
negative	wish they could do something different .
negative	order number is 0000000000 i '_ve been trying to track my two orders all week .
negative	when i order the four oxygen sensors i had to put in my credit_card address i never got around to changing my address on the credit_card after i sent the order i noticed that i put the same address for shipping i didn_'_t mean to do that .
negative	i went to the post_office in winter park and the lady told me that the package wasn_'_t there she told me they sent it to 0000 aloma ave apt # e i went there checked the mail box i didn_'_t see the package i went to the door i knocked and no one answered .
negative	i wanted the packaged to go to 0000 destiny blvd unit # 000 kissimmee , fl 00000 so if i can '_t get my two packages that i payed $_000 . 00 for then i want my money back on my credit_card please .
negative	i '_m so frustrated "
negative	this site is a joke .......... paid a ton for a beautiful big resort in mexico thru them .
negative	got to my resort , and half the resort got sold off and we were unable to use everything at the resort which travelocity did not disclose .
negative	tried to contact travelocity to figure this mess out and all i was told was i had to email h . r to resolve the problem !
negative	i could not speak to anyone !
negative	really ????
negative	i '_m in mexico !!!!
negative	a few_weeks after given the run_around ......... i got a response from the vice president there .
negative	basically i was told sorry .
negative	that '_s it !
negative	travelocity does have a motto how they guarantee everything and if something is not right , they will work with their partners to make it right .
negative	well , guess what ....... they made nothing right !
negative	do not use this company if u feel_like getting ripped_off !
negative	there are pleanty of good competitors out there .
negative	please do not use this company .
negative	they are scammers !
negative	i made no purchase with travelocity ... but they charged my cc today in the amount of $_000 and proceeded to send me this email_asking if i was happy wit my experience with them ?
negative	wtf_?
negative	west gate vacation villas were very outdated and not impressive .
negative	pictures from the website don_'_t display the actual units they put you in .
negative	the worst part was when we checked in ....
negative	arrived around 0pm without stopping for supper first and had to stand in line in at desk to check in for over thirty minutes , obtaining key cards were easy , they did charge $_00 per day resort_fee which i was aware of thanks to bookit , they make you use their bellman that drives a golf cart while you follow in car .... then get to unit and it is occupied .
negative	he leaves us standing outside occupied unit as he looks in the adjoining units for signs of occupancy .
negative	several minutes later after standing outside in the cold wondering what '_s going on he has us enter a unit while he sits on the phone still without explaining anything to us .
negative	he asks me if i rented 0 bedroom_condo and i replied yes .
negative	he finally gets off phone and says this is our unit and starts to walk out the door with a look of intent of needing a tip for doing nothing .
negative	so i say no this is not our unit because i booked a two bedroom and this is only a one bedroom .
negative	he said well the front_desk says you only booked a one bedroom .
negative	i was irate !
negative	about the time he was trying to walk out the door ..., a group of about 0 people walk in dumbfounded as to why their unit is occupied .
negative	they were irate too as they had checked in earlier and found a dirty room to which they had been waiting on to be cleaned and once they had waited they came back and we were sitting on their couch !
negative	anyways ...
negative	i called bookit and they helped .
negative	got moved to a two bedroom .
negative	no sorry or offers of upgrade or free service was heard of from westgate .
negative	glad we spent almost all of vacation outside of the resort .
negative	will never go there again !
negative	shopping at this site is very frustrating nothing in stock but says it is never able to speak with a rep
negative	it is another bad review about the company as i understood .
negative	they offered a certain rate for my nokia ( which wasn_'_t the best , but for some_reason i went for it ) and then they sent me an_email that my phone cant be accepted as working because it doesn_'_t look like new !!
negative	they asked for £ 0 . 00 to send me my phone back and it took them 0 days to actually return my phone !!
negative	i wrote countless emails and apart_from the explanation that they have " some technical_difficulties " i couldn_'_t get any proper reply .
negative	after i asked them for the official email to start filing the case i got my phone back ( but still got charged ).
negative	a week_later i sold my phone for a top price to another ( good ) company !!
negative	people !
negative	read_reviews before you choose something !
negative	you '_ll save time and money !
negative	!
negative	havent received it yet
negative	you stole my email address and signed me up for an account without my permission .
negative	i hope your go out of business sooner rather_than later .
negative	do not shop on this website .
negative	the items are cheaply_made and look nothing like the pictures .
negative	customer_services is a joke ..
negative	they don_'_t understand a word you say !!!
negative	!
negative	when i called for reservations , i specifically told the agent that i was with a group with a special rate in place .
negative	she never told me that i needed to talk to the hotel_directly to book to get the group rate already negotiated .
negative	she continued booking the stay and when my confirmation_email came , it was for a higher_rate .
negative	i called back and that agent told me that i had to talk to hotel_directly that they don_'_t have special negotiated rate information .
negative	that was totally_unprofessional for that first agent to mislead me and book the stay when she should have known that she couldn_'_t continue .
negative	i purchased insurance from ehealth in december_0000 for a january 0 , 0000 effective date .
negative	i was guaranteed i would have coverage and it would be back dated to january 0 .
negative	i called ehealth every week for a month and a half but they never had a response for me .
negative	i finally heard back from them in mid - february and found out my coverage would not begin until march 0 .
negative	i told the , this was unacceptable and they should not be guaranteeing customers coverage that they cannot up hold .
negative	very disappointed in ehealth !
negative	i can not rate this product because i still have not received it !
negative	i don_'_t want to even rate it 0_star .
negative	priceline assured_me that breakfast was included in the price .
negative	i went online to " chat " with representative and was told that , yes , breakfast was included .
negative	i subsequently talked to three representatives and said i would '_ve gone to a different hotel , that they mislead me , and all said -- with varying degrees of politeness -- that they could do nothing about it .
negative	when i asked to speak to a manager , i was informed that there was no way to do that .
negative	i stated that i would '_ve cancelled my reservation and made another one with them , but that was told that was unacceptable .
negative	the ad says no fees with this hotel for cancellation , but i was told otherwise .
negative	poor service , total lack of communication .
negative	certain items of order were not in stock but co didn ’ t advise me , and held order up unknown to me .
negative	after about 0 days i enquired , found out and cancelled the non availables .
negative	goods then arrived quickly buy why didn ’ t they let_me know the problem ?
negative	as it happened i wanted some items quickly ( within week ) but all these were available !!
negative	so good serice was made into poor by lack of communication .
negative	a pity .
negative	when we went to obtain the car at the airport , we had to pay an extra 000_euros at the rental_counter , although we ' d paid autoeurope 000_euros for what we thought was the total rental already .
negative	europcar pointed_out the fine_print in our autoeurope voucher that we had to pay several taxes and fees separately , and it felt_like a nasty and expensive surprise .
negative	technically , it wasn_'_t dishonest but i wish the companies had set expectations better .
negative	also , i do not like being forced into paying the fuel refill fees and we learned at the rental_counter that it is a company policy for all rentals over 00 days .
negative	( we reserved for 00 days .)
negative	i prefer to have a choice .
negative	in the future , i will probably choose a vendor that clarifies what the total bill will be , taxes included , so that i am not surprised .
negative	i will say that the car fit our needs perfectly .
negative	follow_up : i have discovered an_additional_$_00 in fees a month after returning the car .
negative	we will not be using autoeurope again .
negative	i booked a hotel on 00 / 00 / 0000 and last wednesday i had requested a cancellation ( several_times through phone and email ) i contacted customercare @ olotels . com , cancel @ olotels . com , and even tried the contact us email on olotels . com home page ( which i know states you will be contacted within 00_hours ) .
negative	i have not had one email or phone_call back regarding my cancellation .
negative	i even tried to login to my account and it did not let_me sign in ; so i typed in my email to receive my password ( several_times ) and no email was sent .
negative	i would like to know when i will be refunded ?
negative	i bought a sweater and a skirt with them .
negative	first i would like to talk about the sweater , the quality is bad ,
negative	i waited for almost 0_weeks and it is damaged .
negative	then they ask me for photos and ship back for store credit which is focusing me to shop with them again .
negative	also , i need to pay for the shipping fee for them to ship me a defective item .
negative	second is the skirt which is ok but i found one very similar at forever 00 for only $_00 but i am paying $_00 + shipping .
negative	it will be my last time to shop with them after my store credit is used .
negative	i contacted you last_week to say that the payment had not arrived .
negative	you e_- mailed to check my details and i have heard_nothing since !
negative	i would be grateful if you could please sort this asap !!!!!!"
negative	you sent me an ipad keyboard that was damaged ( dented ) in shipment ( improperly packaged in my opinion ) and i contacted you via im and was told a replacement would be sent along with return materials to get the damaged goods back to snugg .
negative	snugg sent the wrong replacement item ( some_sort of plastic case ) and did not include the return material for shipping back the damged part .
negative	how do i get help to resolve these issues ?
negative	one pair of boots sent in two different_sizes .
negative	solution offered , 00_% reduction if kept !!
negative	!
negative	play suit and dress badly cut and didn_'_t fit right and on the skirt the seam was ripped :(
negative	i ordered some wheels for my daughter '_s car and they did not fit .
negative	so i tried to call the company for serveral days and got no one .
negative	i sent them an e_- mail which they ok ' d my return .
negative	now it has_been at_least three_days if not longer and they have not sent me my return information so i can get these wheels back before my thirty days are up .
negative	i have to drive a long way to get to a place where i can send them back .
negative	i will never use priceline again !
negative	i used the " name your own price " option for hotels .
negative	on top of my " named price " i was charged high resort_fees after my stay at the hotel .
negative	these fees were never disclosed anywhere .
negative	there is no option to have the hotel reservation refunded or cancelled , so if they match you with a hotel with all_kinds of additional add - on fees , you ' re basically stuck paying them or forfeiting the reservation and losing even more money .
negative	not to mention , the hotel they " matched " me with advertised the same price on their website as i got on the priceline " deal ."
negative	this is a total_rip_off , and the response i got from customer_service was essentially " too bad ."
negative	the customer_service rep just repeated in a robotic fashion " there is no option to refund any fees ."
negative	i think this is a deceptive practice to hide the hotel name and then make a non_- refundable reservation at a place with a bunch of additional , non_- disclosed fees .
negative	i will never use this website again .
negative	very very limited car options and they still try to force you into cars that you do not want .
negative	they are severely overpriced and do not listen to the sales people when they say they go off employment .
negative	they are lying .
negative	we booked a hotel via splendia for the first 0 nights of our_honeymoon .
negative	it was our first experience with splendia and the website says that it '_s about luxury resorts .
negative	i was really exited because i was looking for something special for our_honeymoon .
negative	the hotel : on the website of splendia there is made a difference in a regular double room , a junior_suite and a senior suite .
negative	the site clearly says that the bathroom characteristics of this junior_suite are omongst others a jacuzzi and multi - jet shower .
negative	the room should be about 00m0 .
negative	we booked this junior_suite because we thought that was very romantic for our_honeymoon .
negative	when we arrived at the hotel we where given a much smaller room ( i guess about 00m0 ) and a bathroom with a normal shower and without a jacuzzi .
negative	when i asked about it at the reception they sayd that they only had 0 rooms with a jacuzzi !
negative	that while they also say on the website the senior suites all have a jacuzzi !
negative	so if you only have 0 rooms with a jacuzzi than don_'_t mention it as a room charasteristic for a type of room that has more rooms without than with the charasteristic !!!
negative	something is not right about the roominformation they gave .
negative	also we did get a payment receipt from the hotel when we payed the price for a junior_suite which was 00_% more_expensive than the regular double room .
negative	on the payment receipt is written that we stayed in a double room !
negative	i explained to splendia what had happened .
negative	they contacted the hotel about it , but they believe everything the hotel says ( that there are also junior suites without a jacuzzi ( or multi - jet shower ) but with a normal shower ), really weak because on their website it '_s very clear that we should have had another room from the room description than the room we had in the hotel .
negative	and the hotel is surely right about the fact that not every junior_suite has a jacuzzi , in fact i think it '_s possible that only the senior suites do actually have a jacuzzi .
negative	but from the roominformation they placed on the website you might reasonnably expect as a customer that you do get a more luxcurious room than a regular double room .
negative	i found it really disappointing .
negative	i will never book with splendia again .
negative	i think the organization sucks !
negative	they should fight for the customers rights but they don_'_t .
negative	they say that the hotels are responsible for the information which they place on their website and in that case they should claim the hotels that give wrong information .
negative	splendia only say that they will give a discount of 00_% of my next stay .
negative	i don_'_t think that it compensates for the situation at hand .
negative	i explained to them that if they would give the 00_%_discount on the stay we had at the hotel where we had our_honeymoon i would be satisfied , but that is something they won_'_t give me .
negative	do they actually think that i would book at their website again and make use of the 00_%_discount ?
negative	i do ' n think so .
negative	i had better experiences with other_websites which don_'_t claim to be " luxurious "
negative	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
negative	this was the information about the junior_suite :
negative	junior_suite
negative	00 m0 - 0 queen_size bed ( s )
negative	comfortable and spacious , the junior suites feature air_conditioning , telephone , satellite tv , internet access , and minibar .
negative	each has a jacuzzi bathtub or shower .
negative	room amenities
negative	[...]
negative	bathroom characteristics
negative	jacuzzi , multi - jet shower , hair_dryer , bathrobe
negative	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
negative	splendia refers to the first part , while i refer to the last part .
negative	if a jacuzzi is not the charasteristic of the bathroom of a junior_suite , than don_'_t put it there .
negative	if it is the choice between a jacuzzi or a shower you do expect a multi - jet shower in the room and not a normal shower , because that is one of the bathroom characteristics .
negative	i ordered two textbooks per the class requirements and was sent two instructors editions .
negative	you are not identifying that what people are ordering is an instructor '_s edition .
negative	i am sending the books back .
negative	shame on you .
negative	i will never at all in my life time order parts from parts greek .
negative	i have one car an count on having the right parts so i can make it to work !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i never write bad_reviews but i '_m overly frustrated this time .
negative	i ordered two t - shirts for a birthday_present ( same shirt in 0 sizes because i just didn_'_t know what size ) on 0 - 00 - 00 .
negative	plenty of time to receive them before the birthday on 0 - 00 - 00 .
negative	but i still_haven_'_t received them !
negative	i '_ve contacted zazzle three_times regarding this with no response .
negative	in all fairness my third try was today .
negative	my hope is just to get help from zazzle on this .
negative	i want the shirts !
negative	on the website it says it shipped but does not give me information on what company shipped it , usps , ups , fedex ?
negative	i cannot go any further finding my order without knowing this .
negative	hoping i can re - write a better review once this is fixed .
negative	but as of now , if you are looking to order gifts , go to amazon for reliability !
negative	i thought the $_00 was a deposit .
negative	i made the mistake of trusting this message when i booked a flight on spirit_airlines .
negative	what it should have said was that travelocity doesn_'_t penalize you if you cancel within 00_hours , but the airlines might .
negative	in my case , i not only had to pay a non_- refundable administrative fee of $_00 . 00 for the cancellation , but i also had to accept a voucher for the reminder of the ticket price instead of a refund , because i booked the flight within 0 days of departure ; the voucher was only good for 00 days .
negative	to make_matters worse , i wasn_'_t informed about this until after i purchased the ticket and tried to cancel within the 00 - hour_period .
negative	( the terms and conditions that were available online didn_'_t mention anything about cancellations ; it just talked about making changes to the reservations .
negative	so i took travelocity at its word , and assumed their cancellation_policy applied -- i . e_., there would be no penalties .)
negative	when i tried to complain to travelocity , i was told i had to talk to spirit_airlines about it .
negative	they weren_'_t allowed to handle spirit reservations .
negative	this is unacceptable .
negative	travelocity obviously handled a spirit reservation when i purchased the ticket from them .
negative	and i wouldn_'_t have booked the flight if i hadn_'_t seen travelocity '_s reassuring , but misleading and possibly fraudulent message .
negative	travelocity should have taken responsibility for it and at_least noted that their message caused the problem .
negative	it should either be changed or not displayed at all .
negative	to be fair ( since the rating_system puts words in your mouth ) i should add that no one treated me rudely ; the agent was polite when he referred me to spirit , but that doesn_'_t excuse his ignoring the complaint ..
negative	i ordered new lenses on july 0nd and sent my frames off the next_day .
negative	my visa was charged immediately , of course , and now 00 days_later i '_m still_waiting for the return of my glasses .
negative	i '_ve been given excuses for the delay and several promised dates that have come and gone but now i find out there '_s another delay .
negative	this is no way to run a business .
negative	i '_m not only out $_000_+ dollars but also my perfectly good frames .
negative	at the very least , don_'_t charge people until their glasses are being sent to them .
negative	it '_s now sept .
negative	0th !!
negative	and still no sign of my glasses .
negative	they '_ve now been in reglazing for the past 0 days .
negative	why .
negative	why , why ??
negative	?
negative	i contacted the warranty dept .
negative	within 00_hours with my concern for a potential problem with my car .
negative	i was then routed from dealership to warranty dept .
negative	several_times but , no one would take_responsibility .
negative	i visited two repair shops and one said the brakes were new and within specs but , the wrong brakes were placed on this car ( bmw ).
negative	seeing that this car is a bmw , the right kind of parts is important for car performance and safety .
negative	needless to say , midas said that this was a "( cheap )" less_expensive pair of pads and also that the rotors would need turning or be replaced .
negative	during the purchase of the car ( down payment of $ 0000 . 00 ) it was stressed that if a problem occurred to call them back or call the warranty dept .
negative	will take_care of it .
negative	this was the promises and guarantee .
negative	i would to see you stand_behind your ( word ) and promise .
negative	shirley unhappy camper .
negative	the order came in a very timely_manner which pleased us .
negative	however , we were very disappointed in the order itself .
negative	the unit was not well_packed and was slightly_damaged in areas that would not have affected the workings of the water_heater .
negative	however , it never produced hot_water .
negative	we were referred to the manufacturer to solve the problem .
negative	after a week of not receiving my order i chased it up with a phone_call to be told that they have no record of my order !
negative	we wanted the flowers del on friday but was told the funeral was to earley at_0am so you del thursday we should have been told this before we orded them as it was not until wedsday we was told it was to late to go any where eles .
negative	absolute garbage from beginning to end , you should be ashamed of yourselves .
negative	be assured that no one we come in contact with , will ever use travelocity !!
negative	!
negative	this was the first time i '_ve ever used this company to purchase contact_lenses .
negative	and i can safely say i will not be using them again .
negative	i placed my order on the 0th january , it '_s now the 00th and i have still not received my contact_lenses !
negative	( bearing in mind the website says 0 - 0 days delivery ).
negative	after 0 days i had still not received a shipping confirmation .
negative	when i contact the company they told me the reason for the delay was that my particular lenses were out of stock .
negative	in the terms and conditions it states that when items are out of stock u must allow 0 - 0 days delivery .
negative	it also says you will receive an_email notifying you of the delay - another email which i didn_'_t receive .
negative	i then contacted someone a few_days_later to enquire further .
negative	i was assured my lenses would be here no later than the monday ( still 0 days after the order was placed and confirmed ).
negative	monday passed and still no lenses .
negative	it '_s now thursday and there '_s still no sign .
negative	i '_m absolutely disgusted with this company .
negative	not only have they left me with no contact_lenses , but i '_m also out of pocket which isn_'_t ideal being a uni student .
negative	truly disgusting .
negative	via go go was absolutely zero help when it came to our rolling stones tickets .
negative	basically , they sent the tickets to our billing adress instead of our shipping adress .
negative	so the tickets have arrived in virginia when we are in london , and the concert is in london in 0 days .
negative	there is of course , no humanly way to contact viagogo ( the phone either disconnects or rings and rings but with no answer ).
negative	what a wasted trip to london to see a concert when the tickets are just sitting back at our home .
negative	literally will never use via gogo again and will never recommend it .
negative	i don_'_t like the fact that when ordering you have to give a street address and not allowed to give a p o box .
negative	all of our mail is delivered to a p o box at the post_office .
negative	i understand that for fedex and ups a street address is required , however ; when the package is coded " smart post " by the shipper and not advised to the customer , that is not good customer_service .
negative	our purchase was returned to the shipper becuz of this situation and their reply was we will refund you money .
negative	really disappointed as i bought a duvet_cover that wasdescribed as a duvet_set and i then had to spend extra 00pounds to get pillow covers !!
negative	!
negative	after learning i had accidentally booked through reservation_counter instead of the actual marriott site ( i make it a point to never book through 0rd_party sites , but must have mistakenly clicked on an ' ad ' link when googling the marriott in chicago ), the front_desk at the marriott then informed me that it was not the correct hotel of my week long business meeting .
negative	they apologized and said they could not transfer the funds to the other marriott down the street because it had been booked through a 0rd_party ( ie_: reservation_counter ).
negative	i immediately got on the phone with reservation_counter customer_service to see if they could transfer my payment / reservation to the marriott down the street and they informed me that would not be possible .
negative	i asked to speak to a supervisor , was given a hard time , but when finally connecting with the supervisor was told the same line : they could not transfer my reservation / payment to the marriott down the street .
negative	my frustration is 0 fold : 0 -- i am furious that i even booked with a 0rd_party vendor without my acknowledgement .
negative	0 -- i am very disappointed with the lack of customer_service that i received when trying to adjust my reservation which would have kept the funds with them regardless .
negative	please steer_clear of this 0rd_party booking site .
negative	terrible business_ethics .
negative	every thing that i purchased was of very poor quality .
negative	the lap desk had so little cushioning that i had to cut the material and add more pellets so that it could even keep it on my lap .
negative	the whisks were so flimsy that they would not hold up to what i was mixing .
negative	when the box came to my front_door it was hardly together .
negative	the tape was off and the postman apologized , but also said that it was sent that way .
negative	i am sorry for the bad review but i tell it like it is .
negative	i would send everything back but i refuse to spend the money for the postage !
negative	live and learn !!

negative	i understand amazon uk is a business whose goal is profit .
negative	what i just don_'_t understand is the disrespect it was shown to a large part of their foreign and loyal_customers , who a week_ago would be here rating amazon uk as a 0_star company .
negative	we were informed after the fact that the free super saver delivery would be ending when this had been decided long ago , and their logistics partners had been warned - mrw in portugal started letting people go 0_weeks_ago , expecting deliveries to substantially drop with this amazon uk decision .
negative	and some days on , the silence , albeit a standard reply email , is still going strong .
negative	i '_m sure there '_s a plot here at play , but it doesn_'_t seem very smart : i used to buy a pack of gluten_free doves farm flour for around 0 euros , and now with the shipping_costs , it will cost me almost 0 euros - i can get it at the local supermarket for 0 , 00_euros ... not really worth the bother now to go shopping at amazon uk .
negative	i guess this is the end of a beautiful ( commercial ) friendship .
negative	every time i order something i am never happy with them .
negative	i won_'_t be ordering again from the online site again .
negative	we have four of our nap mats that were ripped before we even got them out of the plastic !
negative	when i called customer_service the lady acted_like oh no big deal just send them back !
negative	well this is a huge deal especially after order 00 of them i would assume with someone spending that kind of money customer_service would show a little compassion !
negative	not even oh im sorry to hear that !
negative	was a little_disappointing !
negative	as a large daycare it is mandatory that our children have nap mats to rest on now it is going to take several weeks before because we have to send the ripped ones back and pay for shipping and then they will take a look at the ripped ones and then decide if they are going to replace them ???
negative	so frustrating and completely a waste of money !!
negative	not good customer_service these should be replaced no questions_asked when spending this amount of money !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i was lied to the amount i was quoted was not the amount charged to my card .
negative	i didn_'_t authorize the amount to be charged and the gentlemen said he was the actual hotel not a third_party billing agency .
negative	when i called the hotel to dispute the charge that '_s when i found out it was not the hotel i booked with .
negative	i finally_reached the third_party billing company and i was bullied and informed i could not get my money back .
negative	i am very disappointed that my first order ( and over_£_000 . 00 !!!)
negative	was such a let_down .
negative	my son has just bought his first house with his_girlfriend .
negative	both work in the community and always need lots of washing ( uniforms etc ) done .
negative	i bought him a hotpoint_washing_machine as a gift , placed the order on the 00th_october_0000 , for it to be delivered to the new house on thursday 0st november_0000 .
negative	quite straight_forward , you ' d have thought .
negative	paid_extra for the delivery ( not a next_day either ).
negative	hotpoint rang him the night before , to confirm he was at home for the delivery .
negative	he had taken the day off work .
negative	next_morning , hotpoint rang to say that they hadn_'_t got a washing_machine in stock to actually deliver , and re - arranged delivery for the next week .
negative	my son had to book another day off work .
negative	in between times " very " advertised that particular_model of washer with free next_day delivery .
negative	when i rang to complain_about the service , i was told that very had nothing to do with the delivery , it was all down to hotpoint , and nothing could be done through very !
negative	not even a refund on the delivery charge .... when everyone else got theirs for free .
negative	i have since e_- mailed a complaint to hotpoint , and it will be interesting to read their reply .
negative	i wonder_if they will blame very !
negative	!
negative	it seems a bit of a cop - out , blaming each other for what is fundamentally bad customer_service .....
negative	lamentavelmente não recebemos nossa compra
negative	still_waiting , three_months in , for the promised refund .
negative	will not use travelocity again !!
negative	!
negative	i don_'_t the time to list the reasons_why bt provide such appalling customer_service , but whilst their products are absolutely , as a business customer for over 00 years , i have not once had a bill that has_been correct , meaning i continually have to call them to receive a refund .
negative	i get passed around from pillar to post and the only call_centres that are actually effective are the customer options team who you only get as a last resort .
negative	i have had to re - explain my issues over and over and over again , wasting valuable time and missing important customer calls .
negative	i will be leaving them shortly , once i have received a full_refund of all of the charges they have taken from me - enough is enough .
negative	i have tried to book hair appointments with two different salons .
negative	one has not returned calls , voicemail box full and doesn_'_t respond to email .
negative	i informed wowcher and they haven_'_t got back to me about this and it has_been 0 days now .
negative	the second had availability but wanted to charge 00_% extra because i have shoulder length hair .
negative	surely it would have been professional to advertise that there would be a surcharge for shoulder length hair ?
negative	very disappoint and have lost trust in wowcher , how the deals are structured and advertises .
negative	going back to paying full price at my regular salon , at_least they don_'_t make you invest hours of time trying get a refund !
negative	please read and believe every bad review on this site .
negative	my experience is virtually identical to every one of these customers who have had a nasty experience with this company .
negative	fortunately , i left it to my credit_card company to retrieve my money that redhill appliances had been hanging on to since 00st october_0000 after they said they could not fulfill my order ( after much chasing by me to find out when i was going to get it ), which they had accepted , told me it would be available in two_weeks , and took the dosh for .
negative	sooner or later someone is going to place an order for appliances from this company and not get their order and lose their money also .
negative	beware !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a side_mirror for my powered 0000 !!!
negative	ford_fusion i was given a 0000 to 0000 model which if you knew anything about ford_fusion they all dont fit the same .
negative	i wasnt even given a return_slip or invoice either with my order .
negative	so the mirror is useless please realize that the plugs dont all fit every fird fusion that there diffrent .
negative	waste of time and money never will i order parts from you pkus the option to ship thete wasnt one and took way longer_than said in my email
negative	i was looking for a way to order stamps online .
negative	i started to fill_out my information but about half way through decided that this wasn_'_t the right service for me , it was trying to get me to buy a scale and i only wanted a sheet of stamps , i usually just mail letters and not that often , so i closed out the window before i finished .
negative	a few_weeks_later i got a packet with some stamps but i never got charged anything so i forgot about it assuming it was only a gimmick to get me back .
negative	about a month later i started getting charged $_00 . 00 a month but i didn_'_t notice until two months later .
negative	i cancelled online but the website said i may still get charged one more time .
negative	i called , there isn_'_t a number for complaints , so i hit " 0 " the number for signing_up because i knew they would answer the call right_away which they did .
negative	the lady told me that she would wave the last fee scheduled for 0 / 0 / 0000 .
negative	less_than 00_minutes later i got an_email from my bank which alerts me when my funds are less_than $_00 .
negative	i checked to see what had just happened and stamps . com charged me another $_00 .
negative	they had just charged me $_00 on 0 / 0 / 0000 and less_than 00_minutes later they charged me again on 0 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	so i called again and hit " 0 " but this time it took a lot longer for them to answer .
negative	i was put on hold a few_times and finally a supervisor named ron told me a confirmation number and said that my money would be returned in 0 to 0 days .
negative	in the mean time , i already have another transaction pending and now my account will not have enough to cover it .
negative	now i have to borrow money from my boyfriend until they pay me back .
negative	i hate stamps . com .
negative	the place is hard to find .
negative	they took almost an_hour to come pick me up at the airport and it was 00 : 00 on .
negative	they scratched my car in the lot .
negative	luckily was one of those black scratches that can be remove with some polishing .
negative	the guy_who picked me up was nasty and rude .
negative	stay away from this place .
negative	they do not go over policies and then lie about rates when you can call the hotel and get it cheaper .
negative	they suck
negative	i ordered two onesies only one in package , i '_ve emailed numerous_times but get an_automated email_saying someone will contact me and i '_m still_waiting !!!!
negative	ordered these fir a charity bed push which was yesterday .
negative	is anyone ever going to get back to me not impressed
negative	these fit poorly and were thinner_than the tena diapers we have been using -- no way they would have gone all night .
negative	we were hoping for a pull up diaper to use instead of a wrap around , but these were not it .
negative	we threw them away .
negative	my partner mistakenly clicked on this site thinking it was the ziggo dome and went through the ticket purchase process .
negative	he paid 00_euros each for two tickets .
negative	when they arrived in the mail , they were photo copies and the face ticket price was 00_euros .
negative	the tickets were accompanied_by a letter which stated that they are a reseller of tickets and that the price is higher dependent upon the popularity of the event .
negative	my partners argument was that he didn_'_t see this explanation on the site when he purchased the tickets .
negative	small_print !
negative	upon_receiving the tickets we went to the ziggo dome site and checked the availability and pricing and there in fact were seats left at 00_euros .
negative	00_euro profit on each ticket ?
negative	i '_m all for free enterprise but predatory enterprise is not right !
negative	how is this company still in business when there are complaints as far back as 0000 ?
negative	amazing !
negative	lesson to be learned : do your research before purchasing anything on the net !!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered plusnet broadband and phone line moving in to a new house .
negative	i had nothing but problems , terrible phone line and very slow if it worked at all broadband .
negative	when it did work i followed all guidelines on help page , i rang plusnet 0 times over 0_weeks to resolve problems , only to get told do this do that .. wait 00 days etc ...
negative	eventually told ' well we could send engineers , but could just be your area !'
negative	so gave up cancelled and went with someone_else .
negative	plusnet now threatening me with a third_party debt collector to collect £_000 as i cancelled before the contract even_though i have paid up to when i had it even_though it never worked properly .
negative	i am disgusted at the customer_service , and when i rang to try and resolve the issue i spent over half an_hour with a guy_who said ' there '_s nothing i can do ' ... in absolute despair that this is happening !!
negative	!
negative	i placed an order on november 0st , it is now almost christmas and my order has not left china .
negative	it has_been shipped , so the order can not be cancelled .
negative	my payment has_been drafted from the company , and i have nothing for it !
negative	i have emailed annie at customer_support multiple_times and i have no replies .
negative	i posted on facebook , got one response .
negative	" what was your shipping method you choosed ?"
negative	so i guess it was my fault for choosing the wrong shipping method .
negative	why offer a shipping option if it sucks and can '_t be relied on ?
negative	this company has terrible customer_support and then blames the issues on shipping , or the customer .
negative	i would not recommend using them .
negative	lol lol lol are you kidding .
negative	i just received my 0nd reply to my email from this company turning down my request to return the product i purchased .
negative	i opened the product so they would not accept it as a return .
negative	i am at a total loss as to how you can determine that you don_'_t want a product unless and until you open it !
negative	my dog took 0 bites of one item , would not let his lips touch either of the other 0 items i offered him .
negative	accordingly , silly me , thinking " 000_% guarantee " really meant 000_% guarantee , sent a nice email explaining my dogs ' reaction & was told since i opened the product they would not accept a return .
negative	i have since found many complaints about this company so i guess my own fault for not searching those out first ( i usually do ), so this is a first for me !
negative	wow , first china with their poisoned food & now a wonderful american company taking_advantage & making false_promises .
negative	by the way , i was really excited to try some product made in the usa for my 0 . 0 year chihuahua .
negative	an interesting story regarding another company i found online with usa products .
negative	when i contacted them to return a part of the shipment my chi didn_'_t like they said not a problem but don_'_t ship it back , give it to someone you know with a dog & they will hopefully become a customer .
negative	they also chose an item that they think my dog might enjoy & it is in the mail to us as we speak .
negative	now that is customer_service & honesty .
negative	they also said so sorry your dog didn_'_t like it .
negative	oh my , good people do still exist ... just very few & far between .
negative	omg don_'_t understand_why this company is still open and why walmart uses them to ship our online stuff ...
negative	they are the worst shipping company . shipped my stuff and they couldn_'_t from walmart and they couldn_'_t locate them after sometime ...
negative	this site has no costumer_service available at all .
negative	:( it '_s so frustrating .
negative	you can '_t call them , when you e_- mail them , you get automatic answer with useless and unrelated suggestions :( i dot defective shirt , with part of the paint missing from the print .
negative	i am trying to contact this company for 0 days already with no results , just automated_responses with promises , that someone would answer :(
negative	hi ,
negative	we organized some time to stay at a place in sidney recently .
negative	due to a change in plans , we emailed the person involved a month before we were due for arrival regarding our change of dates .
negative	he whacked us with a $_00 . 00 charge because he said that it was impossible for him to change that time_slot .
negative	somewhat annoyed we agreed to this .
negative	but on arrival we discovered that he had managed to book other people into our time_slot and that he was not out of pocket at all .
negative	he was an extremely friendly host but to the point of being somewhat over the top .
negative	we were never left alone - ever !!!!
negative	we would come in at night exhausted , desperate for a little peace - perhaps a shower and read a book but no - he was in our room the whole time !!!!
negative	to the point that my husband was falling asleep mid sentence at 0 am ( 0 hours after arriving ..) with him talking the whole time .
negative	the place needed a good clean !!!
negative	the bathroom was far from spotless , dust over everything .
negative	it was at the point that we did not want to go back after a day '_s touring because we knew that we could not rest - or even go to the loo !!
negative	!
negative	i am embarrassed to say that i left him good feedback only for the fact that he was such a nich person but i would not recommend this place to anyone_else .
negative	sincerely dee
negative	i would have never ordered this had i known the length of time to get it ...........................
negative	i still don_'_t have it !
negative	where is my part ?
negative	i suppose you wanted me to write a glowing review , but i was supposed to receive my dogs ' food on the 0th or 0th , but i didn_'_t .
negative	instead , i had to race to petsmart after work yesterday and buy food .
negative	i haven_'_t received any kind of notice from fed_ex or petflow about where my dogs ' food is at this time .
negative	i have a very strenuous demanding job , and the reason i ordered pet_food online was to give myself a little_bit of a break in one area of my life .
negative	instead , i '_m going to have to get online and on the phone and try to find out where this whole operation broke_down .
negative	i probably will not be trying this again .
negative	i '_m very disappointed .
negative	very very .
negative	the shower door i bought from heatandplumb leaks .
negative	the design is such that there are gaps around the seals and the insructions are so poor that i can '_t blame the fitter , he has done what appears to be the only logical thing with the bits available - but of course heatandplumb say it is because it has_been fitted incorrectly , but they won_'_t giive any more information about how it should be fitted to try to prove their point .
negative	for months now i have been emailing and calling them .
negative	they have been stringing me along with ' we will contact the manufacturer ', ' manufacturer will email you ', ' they will send you better instructions ', ' they will send you new seals '.
negative	' i will escalate it to the managing_director ', ' i will call you back ' etc etc .
negative	no one emails me , no new seals , no better instructions and if the managing_director has_been involved he just ignores the problem .
negative	so i have spent £ 0000 on a shower that is completely unusable .
negative	next step is the small claims court .
negative	as past poor reviews of heatnadplumb show , it isn_'_t just me , if there is a problem you are on your own .
negative	i will never book with you again !!!!
negative	i made a reservation with you on 0 / 0 and was told if i cancelled before 0 / 00 that there would be a penality 00_% of my down payment plus 00 . 00 assessed .
negative	so i should of been charged $_00 plus $_00 and been refunded around $_000 .
negative	i cancelled the same day ( 00_mins later ) because the reservation was no where near monterey bay suites hotel in myrtle_beach , sc where i wanted to be .
negative	( lie # 0 ). you took $_000 of my debit_card .
negative	i waited 00 days like you said for the balance to come_back on my card no money came .
negative	( lie # 0 ) i called in to your customer_service had a 00 minute wait time just for you to tell me charged me $_00 cancelllation fee , plus 00_% of my entire stay ( 000 ) plus a $_00 fee to cancel with an agent which was never in the paperwork i received and never dicussed .
negative	so bascically you charged me 000 . 00 for a reservation i had all of 00_minutes .
negative	you will never have to worry_about me booking with you ever !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	expedia website experienced an_error before completing my order , no confirmation was received and was informed and didn_'_t go through .
negative	therefore , booked elsewhere and then received my confirmation from expedia 0 hrs later .
negative	after being on hold for hours trying to cancel , i am transferred to powers which not only tells_me i won_'_t be refunded but also says i am lying about the website '_s error !!!!
negative	talk about adding insult to injury !!!!!!!!!!
negative	had to select at_least one star to post , but expedia deserves none !
negative	i needed to receive my item within 0 - 0 business days , yes it was my fault for waiting but i chose this site to get my order within that time .
negative	it was three_days before my item was even shipped and i did not receive my order within the max of five days even_though i paid quite a bit extra to do so .
negative	don_'_t order here if you need it in a short_period of time , they get in no hurry even_though they charge you for it .
negative	i ordered a bouquet for my mother for mother '_s day at the end of march and still to this date , april_00th , have not received any resolution from this company regarding my complaint .
negative	the bouquet clearly_stated roses , tulips , carnations and foliage .
negative	my mum received about 00 carnation .
negative	how incredibly embarrassed i was that the most_important lady in my life was celebrated in this way .
negative	let '_s see if this review gets their attention !
negative	i have nothing to say , except i am extremely upset !
negative	!
negative	after a stone broke my drivers_side_mirror , i went to the dealership for a replacement .
negative	it would be over $_000 for the part and the labor .
negative	so i thought there had to be a better option .
negative	i searched online for the left hand glass replacement for a 0000_honda_civic and found it on partsgeek . com .
negative	unbelievable - it was less_than $_00 including the shipping .
negative	so i ordered it .
negative	it didn_'_t fit , i must have done something wrong in the order .
negative	i returned the part with $_00 in shipping and then was charged a re - shelving fee .
negative	i tried ordering the part again through partsgeek . com , this time being very careful to check the year , the model and the part , and , again , the cost was right around $_00 .
negative	and again , it doesn_'_t fit .
negative	this time , i am not going to pay the return shipping and re - shelving fee .
negative	i '_m going to take this loss and go back to the dealership .
negative	and never , ever , ever will i use partsgeek . com again .
negative	i paid a total of 0 . 00 the ring i order was so badly scratched and kind of bent i threw it away . i wish i had gotten my money back the jelwery looks like used jelwefy . i would not recommend a friend at all . i will never make a purchase from them again . just being honest
negative	i ordered and paid for a filter in april_0000 , from the fridge filter shop . com .
negative	they took the payment but they never sent the filter .
negative	they do not answer their phone and you can '_t leave a message and they do not reply to emails .
negative	i know by reviews on other_sites that quite a few others have been caught by this scam and i '_m amazed they are still allowed to get away with it .
negative	i '_ve tried just about everything but no one seems able to stop this scam so save your money , save_yourself the stress and don_'_t bother .
negative	my experience with you partsgeek guys wasnt very nice i didnt know that a company could select who they want to do_business with by checking order history my money is good so i guess we wont be dong business anymore since you guys are bias
negative	i ordered this product over two_weeks_ago and still_haven_'_t received it .
negative	i am very worried_about this product and company .
negative	i ordered my dresses on the 00 . 00 . 00 - its 00 . 00 . 00 and i '_m still_waiting .
negative	i purchased a blackberry and paid for 0 day shipping the phone arrived weeks_later and was obviously used with scratches on the body and heavy use of the sim_card area , they replaced it which again took weeks .
negative	when the second phone arrived it was better_than the first one but still showed signs of sim_card usage .
negative	i contacted melvin at cell0get who was rude and aggressive and refused a refund !
negative	i bought a pair of ray_ban sunglasses from this company and got an_email soon after that the glasses were in stock at suppliers and to be shipped very soon .
negative	three_weeks_later and nothing .
negative	i enquired and my order number is invalid , still is when i last checked and no help from smartbuyglasses .
negative	now i am told they may come in 0_weeks if i am lucky .
negative	thats six_weeks with the money paid and no glasses .
negative	they never notified me of a problem ; it was up to me to contact them .
negative	i do alot of internet shopping and this has_been the worst result to date .
negative	if you cant supply the product don_'_t advertise it as available .
negative	i bought shoes and i send a complaint about this product .
negative	until now i don_'_t have any answer , it was a week_ago !
negative	my right shoe was painted with white colour .
negative	my order
negative	ecco angel
negative	numer produktu : 0000000000000
negative	rozmiar : 00
negative	kolor : black
negative	this company should change its name to opticsslow !
negative	they have the worst customer_service and wound_up being the worst company i have ever done business with over the internet .
negative	they did nothing the said they would in the time_frame stated .
negative	i had to threaten them to get my $_000 worth of sunglasses shipped back to me after i had paid for the return shipping .
negative	they still owe me for a warranty that i paid on the repairs that they said they could do and then after quite a long time told me they couldn_'_t repair them .
negative	it took over a month and a half to find out they couldn_'_t repair my sunglasses and to get them back .
negative	the customer_service people fought with me all along the way instead of just taking_care of the problem .
negative	they actally asked me to send them a ups label for them to return my sunglasses to me after i paid for the return shipping !
negative	they have an f rating on the better business_bureau site and for good reason .
negative	go elsewhere .
negative	wir_haben uns im august ein cabrio in san_francisco gemietet und dieses den highway 0 runter gefahren bis zum lax ( los_angeles ).
negative	buchung und ablauf sowie auto selbst waren dabei völlig ok . nur achtung beim preis !!!
negative	wir_haben über sunny cars gebucht , als abholstelle san_francisco eingegeben und als rückgabestelle lax , uns wurde als preis für 0 tage 000_€ angezeigt .
negative	wir_haben gebucht_und auf_der rechnung stand ebenfalls 000 €.
negative	das große erwachen kam dann beim abholen in san_francisco wo uns auf einmal gesagt wurde das wir zusätzlich $_000_+ taxes für_die rückgabe des wagens zahlen müssen !!
negative	!
negative	diese summe schreibt sunny cars klein und wie ich finde nur versteckt als ausnahme für_die monate juli und august in ihren mietbedingungen .
negative	von einem seriösen vermittler hätte_ich mehr transparenz erwartet - diese summer hätte mit in den preis des fahrzeuges gehört und nicht irgendwo ins kleingedruckte !
negative	this was my first time using avenue 00 , and the shoes i used were too small .
negative	there were no smaller_sizes available , so i had to return my shoes .
negative	after getting my return number , there was some complicated thing about getting my return_label .
negative	i am going on a trip , and have my fingers_crossed that i will get the label before i go out of town , and of course there is a time limit to return the shoes .
negative	too complicated !!!
negative	!
negative	the terms and conditions in the contract you enter online are not the ones they apply when you go to collect the car .
negative	if they have sourced the car from a supplier with an_additional requirement they won_'_t give you the car .
negative	then they say you cancelled the contract and keep the full_amount .
negative	we turned to a reputable supplier , which i should have used in the first place .
negative	i called to book a room at the days inn in sellersburg indiana i asked them not to build my credit_card what if it was going to be billed i did not want to make the reservation the customer_service rep kept telling_me don_'_t worry don_'_t worry when i got the confirmation_email the room was booked in the wrong city it was booked in sullivan indiana which is probably 0 or 0 hours from where i needed to be and they had already build my credit_card after i told him i did not want it to be billed and i wasn_'_t making the reservation if it was going to be when i called customer_service they informed me it was non_refundable which is ridiculous because it was their mistake not mine and after 00_min on the phone was finally able to get a refund .
negative	i will never use this service again
negative	my info not updated since august 00 .
negative	need to cancel asap
negative	this place is a dump .
negative	will not ever stay here again
negative	these_guys sell used , demo models as new .
negative	be aware , the entire company has one single stuck up customer rep , becky_s . she is the manager , she is the care , she is the only person_who you would end up with .
negative	be aware .. dont order .. you will regrest , as i am regretting my $_000_dollars + shipping_costs back and forth ...
negative	i booked hotel accomodation and transfers with alpharooms . com last_year . we went on the holiday on the 00 march for 0 nights to benidorm with myself and friends . we arrived at alicante airport went to the resort hoppa desk for out transfer to be told blueskytransfers have gone bust . please can you inform me why we were not told ? it cost us 00_euro to get to benidorm . we were disgusted . we well defiantely not use alpharooms for transfers again , very annoyed .
negative	i kept seeing seeing priceline . com commercials running as if they were such a popular good standing company so i figured i would give them a try instead of hotels . com or expedia which i have used several_times in the past .
negative	originally i was going to just book a room through their so called drastically reduced rates .
negative	however the website kept popping up suggesting that i save 00_% by naming my own price .
negative	what a joke , i entered $_00 for a three star_hotel in anaheim .
negative	it came back stating that they couldn_'_t find anything close to that price for that quality ( give me a break full price 0_star rooms are $_000 average ) and suggested that i increase to $_000 .
negative	against my own intuition i tried it .
negative	so it told me it booked me for a room at the annabella hotel , after it charged my credit_card it would go on to state that it could not tell me what type of room i would be getting but i would have to contact the hotel_directly for that .
negative	what a shock i end up having to do more work for the so called travel service .
negative	i call the anabella , first occurrence they did not yet have my reservation and suggested i call back the following_day .
negative	so as i call the following_day i am told that they had booked me for a single room , and if i wanted to have a double i would infact have to pay the hotel_directly $_00 more dollars .
negative	needless to say i was furious , i called priceline . com customer_service , which oddly_enough seems to be based in india .
negative	after 0 phone_calls and several push and enter options i spoke to a real_person .
negative	guess what he was about as helpful as a .
negative	from what i could understand he was saying that in the " contract it states that they do not guarantee what type of room " excuse me , but what the he !!
negative	am i going to do with a king_size bed and 0 people i told him .
negative	he went on to say there was nothing they could do ..
negative	i of course requested a supervisor who offered more of the same pathetic nonsense .
negative	while i was on the phone educating him in us profanity i happened to look up the price for the annabella on hotels . com .
negative	what do you know there was the room i needed for $_000 , $ 0 less then the priceline . com guaranteed lowest_price .
negative	i decided to just disconnect the call with the so called supervisor of stupidity and called the hotel direct one more time .
negative	i asked to speak to the manager , then and only then was i finally able to get some assistance .
negative	because they have had negative experiences with priceline . com she understood the problem and assured_me she would upgrade me to a room with two beds .
negative	hallelujah , it only took 0 hours out of my saturday to obtain a rate i could have booked directly through hotels . com to begin with .
negative	do yourselves a favor do not waste a second of your time or any money on this foolish , deceitful company .
negative	i received a broken item .
negative	" a request for support has_been created and assigned ticket #_000000 ."
negative	no one has contacted me to issue a replacement , and no one has contacted me with a rma #.
negative	absolutely , the worst customer_service , and i will tell_everyone i know about my experience .
negative	i have contacted my credit_card company and disputed the charge .
negative	very annoying experience .
negative	i was waiting for dog_food that never arrived .
negative	when i called they were unsure when the food would be shipped or when it was coming in .
negative	very unprofessional !
negative	suppose to take 0 - 0 days .
negative	took 00 days .... will never ever order from there again !!!!
negative	!
negative	the flight was due to leave yesterday morning & when he arrived at the airport he was told the flight had been cancelled !
negative	they did not send any email to inform him & he is still stuck there !
negative	please email us on albi00 @_hotmail . co . uk or him on drenica @_hotmail . co . uk
negative	thank_you .
negative	after one wash i lost several of the tags .
negative	i did apply them according to directions .
negative	first time ordering from this company , will not do again .
negative	i did not expect my son to open his scooter on his birtday only to find it was broken .
negative	we didnt_realise until after failing to put it together took it to local shop for help .
negative	the bolt through the middle stem was broken as where washers .
negative	paid out for new parts .... not a happy customer .
negative	i was not told that the reservation was non_- refundable until after my credit_card information was recorded ; the call taker spoke terrible english , was difficult to understand and was thoroughly unable to resolve my concerns .
negative	calling back and speaking to mario was not much_better - while he stated that he would accommodate any cancellation that i may need , his word alone was not at all reassuring .
negative	i will never use this service again .
negative	the minor discount in the room rate is not worth it !
negative	it took them two_days longer_than what was agreed_upon for delivery ... then once i received my parts i realized not only did they send the wrong parts but also i was missing an entire front_bumper .
negative	i tried to call their company for 0 days straight without beung able to get thru ... also i checked them out through better business_bureau and they have 000 complaints filed against them
negative	did not receive my books and i contacted bookbyte and all they did was give me the generic spill reading from a script .
negative	it '_s been almost 0_weeks and i still_haven_'_t gotten my books .
negative	i will never ever use bookbyte again .
negative	i guess it '_s true cheaper definitely isn_'_t always better .
negative	sometimes it '_s just better to pay the higher price .
negative	having ordered the product on a monday_morning there was still no communication on the wednesday when i was hoping it would be delivered by ; it was a present !
negative	i had to contact the company who did not even apologise and did not understand the need to inform the customer that a . the order had been received and b . it had been dispatched .
negative	it was going to another address which made it even worse .
negative	looked for airfare to uk .
negative	noticed virgin atlantic ( which i wanted ) and delta had same times ( different flight numbers ).
negative	called to verify and was told they were different altlho leaving at same time .
negative	when asked for agent to book it , he said he could not seem to find the virgin atlantic although i was looking at it on my screen .
negative	suggested i book it on line .
negative	long_story short .... i am now on delta not what i wanted to begin with and no meals either way .
negative	first trip abroad and was hoping for it to be memorable .
negative	well it is but not in a good way .
negative	i placed my order on ( 00 - 00 ) in time for it to ship to my daughters house in colorado .
negative	i was going to be there over the holidays ( i live in mississippi ) so i placed it early so it would get there in time .
negative	i received an_email_stating the shipping address was different than the billing_address and i called numerous_times and left several messages for someone to call me .
negative	i finally received a call on monday the 00th .
negative	i told them that the order needed to get to me by friday the 00th , so that we could put the parts on my daughters car .
negative	i told mike this and he said he would try .
negative	well he didn_'_t try hard enough the parts will not get there till the following friday , december_0th .
negative	the customer_service and call back team needs many improvements as far as response times and also trying to please the customer .
negative	i hope the parts i ordered are going to work because after all this trouble i had to go thru to get them , they better .
negative	we were told all we had to pay when collecting our car in the uk was car tax equating to a " few_dollars " once we had paid the initial booking .
negative	to our suprise we arrived to collect the car and were told that it wasn_'_t including insurance so we had to pay an extra $_000 !!!!
negative	auto_europe were aware we had never hired a car from canada before ( we emigrated two year_ago ) and failed to inform us about the insurance !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i booked a reservation last_week and had to cancelled it because of having a change of plans .
negative	i have spoken to several customer_service representatives and their supervisors from this company , are extremely_rude and they are refusing to refund my money .
negative	they have two statements on there iternary that they send to you , one that states there is no refund if there is a cancellation and the other one states that you will receive a full_refund if you cancel the hotel within 00 - 00_hours prior to your stay .
negative	when i spoke to the customer representatives , they tried to tell me that this money goes to the hotel when it is canceled , that is not true .
negative	i spoke with the hotel staff and they said that they receive no funds when the reservation is canceled .
negative	they are not only liars , they are thieves by taking peoples money .
negative	i will never use this company again and have never been so dissatisfied with the way a customer is treated .
negative	obviously they don_'_t respect there clients .
negative	i would highly suggest not ever using this company .
negative	book your hotel_directly , so that you will not be ripped_off $_00 . 00 like i was .
negative	very unhappy .
negative	i ordered these for my mom '_s 00 birthday and they were not delivered
negative	reserved parking for dec 00 through jan 0 .
negative	the website changed the dates i entered .
negative	i didn_'_t notice this until i went to the library to print reservation prior to going to airport .
negative	lessened learned to check everything .
negative	i called talk to customer_service rep , she transferred me to manager phone , left message , no call back .
negative	called several more times , no answer , left another message , still no call back .
negative	it is now jan 0 , still no call back .
negative	will not use global again .
negative	i had to cancel a reservation for a hotel room with expedia .
negative	they never cancelled and i never got a refund .
negative	my phone conversation that was supposed to be recorded magically disappeared and based on that i never got my money back even_though i did cancel !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i have heard a lot of people that had a problem with expedia .... beware ...
negative	i don_'_t received the tickets .
negative	i bought my tickets in the viagogo ， but in fact ， i don_'_t received the tickets . and they won_'_t refund .
negative	i was cheated . i think this is a cheats .
negative	transaction id :_0000000
negative	ticket ( s ): section 000 , row 00 , ( 0 ticket ( s ))
negative	event : paris saint - germain vs toulouse
negative	venue : parc des princes
negative	date : 00 september_0000 , 00 : 00
negative	i '_ve just got the worst_experience in my entire life with " last_minute "!
negative	no other services were so poor and non_- professional and representative + supervisor were so ignorant !
negative	they sent me email two_days prior the trip ( international destination ) that the reservation was canceled without_any apparent reason !
negative	honestly , neither the rep nor the supervisor did explain me what was the reason ....
negative	they claimed that they called me , but it '_s far from truth as i did not receive any voicemail .
negative	they started giving some other stupid excuse saying my bank was closed on the weekend !
negative	my bank - td - is the only one that actually is open 0 days a week !
negative	and there is always a representative who will assist you on the phone even during the weekend !
negative	so what they say it '_s b . s .
negative	and lie !!!!
negative	when i spoke to supervisor she put the phone away and so when i didn_'_t speak there was silence ! no answer !
negative	after sometime you could hear her picking_up the phone from the table and saying repeat it again ....
negative	this is soooooooo beyond my understanding !
negative	now the tickets are much more_expensive as the date of the trip is soooo close ( 0 days away ).
negative	no one will pay me a difference !
negative	so you guys make your mind and don_'_t use that poor service !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i bought a $_00 card for a friend for a present .
negative	even_though we got the code , it won_'_t work .
negative	my friend bought himself a $_00 card and he can '_t get that to work either .
negative	i sent an_email to pcgamessupport and it came back as failed delivery .
negative	we order a bmw coolant and partsgeek ship us a toyota coolant , they ask us must ship the wrong parts back and pay the shipping fee by ourselves , that '_s totally doesn_'_t make_sense to me , why i have to cover their mistake ?
negative	i ordered some parts for my car and then they emailed me letting_me know that they cannot ship any items unless the shipping matches the billing_address .
negative	i looked for a number to call but unfortunately none was available .
negative	i responded to the email and it took them 0 days to respond .
negative	i explained my situation that my house still was being renovated due to sandy .
negative	after they responded it was the same exact email they sent initially .
negative	when i emailed again , same response .
negative	this was the worst customer_service ever .
negative	since when a legitimate company doesn_'_t have a phone_number available .
negative	i wanted to give less_than a full star but it '_s the only one available .
negative	i can '_t_believe that you took delivery of stock on tuesday and even_though you had orders waiting you still hadn_'_t processed them by friday .
negative	i made a custom homemade cider label and they misspelled my last name .
negative	ofrecen reservar en hoteles donde una vez descontado el importe total en tu tarjeta de credito , te comunican que no hay disponibilidad .
negative	tienes que tramitar , gestionar , someterte a un burocratico proceder para que te devuelvan lo descontado de tu tarjeta .
negative	en_las condiciones escritas , dice que la tarjeta sera utilizada solo como garantía de reserva pero el pago total de_la reserva solo será efectivizado en_el hotel siempre y cuando se respeten los plazos de vencimiento .
negative	es lamentable tener que reportar esta falta de honestidad .### su tarjeta de crédito y / o tarjeta de débito ( en adelante denominada " tarjeta ") se utilizarán únicamente para garantizar su reserva con_el hotel .
negative	el pago total debe realizarse directamente en_el hotel durante el check - in .
negative	a menos que_se indique lo contrario en la página web ###
negative	december 00 , 0000 i ordered a part & here it is december 00 , 0000 & nothing .
negative	this is no good .
negative	i want my money back .
negative	my first time experience with a online website to buy tickets .
negative	i was dealing_with some agent called " ben ".
negative	he was very promising in the start , big talk , enthusiastic but after i actually booked my flight , he made my life miserable .
negative	i was running in circles to get my tickets issued which in the end i had to cancel a few hours before my flight .
negative	he not only ruined my trip but made me so miserable for something that i bought with my own money .
negative	i will never deal with travel house again and make_sure no one else does too .
negative	my prescription changed , and they ' re supposed to allow you to exchange your lenses when this happens .
negative	opticontacts wouldn_'_t ( although the cs_rep initally said i could have a merchandise credit , but denied saying that once she realized i ' d accept that offer ) the grounds for this is that i opened the box .
negative	never mind that none of the lenses ( and all six were there ) remained unopened .
negative	the cs reps tend to be condescending and treat the customers like preschoolers .
negative	this happened on another occasion when i called .
negative	i took my business to a competitor who matched opticontacts ' pricing and agreed to issue refunds for prescription changes even when * gasp * the box was opened .
negative	i am changing my rating , because i ordered and it went through just fine , until i got an_email from them saying that they would not honor the competitors prices that i found .... what is the point if you the company is going to tell me that they are all invalid .
negative	ridculous , i never had trouble with them before , bs !!
negative	!
negative	i bought a costume from allanimecosplay on october_00th and also purchased express shipping ( 0 - 0 business delivery time ).
negative	the package was suppose to be here by now .
negative	i live in california , but when i called usps about my package update they told me that my package had ( still has ) a totally different address and isn_'_t even being shipped to california .
negative	if this isn_'_t going to be resolved i ' d_rather just get a full_refund ; especially on the express shipping .
negative	i '_m sorry , but i will not be paying $_00 extra for a package that is simply going to get here two_weeks or so later than payed for .
negative	i have emailed them with my concern / complaint and even messaged them on their facebook_page .
negative	i have received no response and still no package .
negative	i tried to take initiative and fix the shipping address problem myself , but usps can only fix it if i have the company '_s address , weight of the package , and postage price , which i have none of .
negative	i attempted to contact allanimecosplay once more to simply send me that information ... nothing .
negative	i am more than dissatisfied with this company and trust me when i say i will never be purchasing anything from their store again .
negative	i want a full_refund on my purchase if that wasn_'_t clear enough .
negative	don_'_t ever buy from amiclubwear , you might get impressed by their prices and beautiful shoes they sell but let_me tell you , there is no quality , the stuff they sell is cheap and pretty_much discardable .
negative	i bought two shoes from them , and both of the shoes falled apart , one pair i worn once and the other pair twice .
negative	i tried to get it exchanged , saying that those shoes are defective because impossible to break after a little usage , i sent pictures of the shoes but they didn_'_t care , said it '_s not their policy to replace shoes that been warn even if they are defective ....
negative	my son was desperate for the tennis_shoes he ordered to arrive before his big match but they were out of stock .
negative	an_alternative was suggested but he chose another pair instead .
negative	these too were out of stock and i had to chase the order to even find that out .
negative	his third choice were also out of stock and by now we had missed the deadline to get any shoes in time .
negative	we have since found the original shoes in a shop for half the price !
negative	within two_weeks of purchasing a bike , the right pedal had fallen_off .
negative	we contacted customer_services who said it must have been a problem that we caused when putting on the pedal .
negative	the companies ' compromise ' was that they would send out new parts that we would have to pay for , and also pay to be fitted !!
negative	do not use this company for any purchases .
negative	i ordered a dress in mid november , planning to wear it on christmas day .
negative	it finally arrived 0_weeks_later , i am convinced due to the chasing i did via twitter .
negative	however , it was the wrong_colour .
negative	i returned it on 00 / 00 / 00 and have had to follow_up today , 00 / 0 / 00 , as i '_ve still had no refund or confirmation of return .
negative	what a shocking way to run a company , i must ensure i unsubscribe from their emails so i am never ever tempted to give them my money again .
negative	truly a joke .
negative	after waiting 0_weeks for my book to ship , i tried to use the tracking_number and they lost my book .
negative	then when i asked for a full_refund they found the book and took a week to allow me to ship it back to them .
negative	never using this site again .
negative	none of your sizes are true !
negative	i have been a 0x for 0 years and none of the clothes i bought fit !
negative	in the plus size i ordered a 00 size pants .... they were for a 00 inch waiste
negative	i was told i booked through_expedia and at no point did i see anything about expedia and none of my confirmation was from expedia .
negative	i was not pleased at all and will avoid anything associated with them in the future .
negative	i contacted sd customer_service line when my parcel had not arrived after 0_weeks .
negative	it took me over 0 minutes to get through to someone_who told me my parcel had been delivered to a neighbour but they had no record of which one .
negative	they suggested neighbours up to 0 doors away from me and couldn_'_t explain_why the courier hadn_'_t delivered a card through my door stating which house he had delivered it to or why they didn_'_t know !
negative	the customer_service advisor was rude , deliberately unhelpful and unsympathetic .
negative	i requested to speak to a manager but she said no one was available and someone would call be back later that day - no one did .
negative	i have emailed to complain but hold out no hope of getting to the bottom of this as this company seem absolutely unconcerned with the customer experience or the service they provide .
negative	i will never use this company again and advise others to steer_clear .
negative	i phone and the person on the other line was not helpful .
negative	i loved the idea of a gift_card , but i will look for a different company who does the same thing .
negative	this is my fifth gift_card and i am not satisfied with your company .
negative	very disappointed with this company .
negative	placed an order on a saturday , tuesday i get an_email your order has_been cancelled no_explanation .
negative	of course i go to the website to see if the item is sold out , no the price has_been raised by $_00 . 00 .
negative	i then contact the customer_service that seems to be nothing but an answering_machine .
negative	i finally get someone to answer after repeated calls , i tell him i '_m calling about my order , he responds by telling_me the person i had talked to won_'_t be there till tomarrow .
negative	i had never talked to anyone .
negative	he then tells_me he shouldn_'_t have answered the phone it was a mistake , the person_who can help me is very sick today , but will help me tomarrow ?
negative	this seems very fishy to me !
negative	i sent 0 emails with no response , and have called repeatedly only to be transfered to the answering_machine again and again .
negative	overall i '_m very disgusted with this company , or this one man show that lacks 000_% in the customer_service department .
negative	i wouldn_'_t recommend to anyone !
negative	i was charged twice for the same booking and it has bern over a month and a half and i still_haven_'_t received my refund after 0 hours on the phone with support .
negative	fraudulent nextag charges on my credit_card totaling over $ 0000 - could not contact someone at nextag to discuss .
negative	bad customer_service .
negative	bad .
negative	i ordered a part for my 0000 plymouth van and i was sent the wrong part .
negative	i had to go through this annoying process on the computer and was not able to speak to a person on the phone .
negative	it was completely unprofessional .
negative	i was so upset because i had questions and could not speak to a live_person to gt them answered .
negative	please tell your friends not to use this site .
negative	i will never use it again .
negative	there are some others out there that you can call and speak to a live_person , i am going to use autoparts warehouse from now on .
negative	i spoke with a guy on the phone and he let_me know that they didn_'_t have my part .
negative	that is how i ended_up using parts_geek .
negative	now i have to pay a restocking_fee and who_knows_how long before they return my money and i have to pay to send the part back .
negative	all this at my expense for their screw up .
negative	there was hoop after hoop and i did not even get the book i ordered .
negative	i hope the refund my money .
negative	i booked through easytobook and it sure was easy to book a hotel , howerver ; when i realized that a mistake was made on the dates on my part , i call the number that is on the confirmation_email and it saidthat they where close .
negative	i then call my credit_card company and they told me that i could try expedia since it looks like they where part of it .
negative	expedia then conected me to another party and in the mean time i email the customer_service that shows on line and no answer .
negative	now i am not sure if i will get charge double booking .
negative	i will have to wait .
negative	i think having a 00 hour booking system , we should be able to also make_changes in the event this happens again .
negative	several weeks_ago i purchased ( and paid for ) 0 pairs of shoes .
negative	about a week_later i got an e_- mail saying they had only shipped 0 items ( and no mention of a refund for the missing item , nor a replacement or anything ).
negative	i called the company ( amiclubwear . com ) and had the worst customer experience of my life !
negative	after about 00_minutes on hold , the lady that took my call actually told me that they have a time limit ( of about 0 minutes ) on their support calls , that the supervisors are never on the floor and then my 0 minutes were up and my call got " disconnected ".
negative	i have never disputed a credit_card charge before in my life , but i '_m definitely disputing this one .
negative	my advise is do not buy from this people unless you ' re willing to risk receiving what they want instead of what you ordered .
negative	don_'_t be_fooled by the nice web_site , this people obviously have no inventory and no control over their supplier '_s inventory .
negative	i live several miles from a pet_store that sells my dog_food .
negative	it '_s a tremendous_help and money saver not to have to chase it down .
negative	i love that i can set_up automatic_deliveries .
negative	the price is the same as the pet_store and the shipping is free as i order two bags at once .
negative	that means i '_m saving time and gas money .
negative	thanks !
negative	!
negative	i only give them a one star because i cant give them 0 / 0 of a star , because i only received 0 / 0 of the amount i ordered .
negative	when i told them it was wrong and they just apologized for the mistake on the website .
negative	i didn_'_t get the rest of my parts , and i didn_'_t get my money back .
negative	they used false_advertising and didn_'_t even fix it on the website .
negative	i '_m very unhappy with this website and hope they fix there problems before they lose all of business .
negative	you can not trust them , they did not deliver the plant or the fruit , been in contact with the person that should of received it and they never received the goods .
negative	i am very disappointed .
negative	it cost me alot of money .
negative	my first experience with frames_direct last_year was great , i told everyone about you and planned to be a customer for life .
negative	this time however it has_been hands_down the worst_experience i have ever had ordering anything .
negative	i placed my order on feb 00 and it is now april 00 and i still don_'_t have my glasses .
negative	after one month of waiting i was shipped the wrong frames .
negative	i sent those back and was told by the customer_service rep that the ones i needed were available .
negative	come to find out they did not have the frames but needed to order them , which they wouldn_'_t do until my return was processed which added another week of waiting .
negative	then still no gglasses so i call again and was told the frames were lost so they had to reorder them .
negative	in the same conversation they told me my lenses didn_'_t fit the new frames so they were redoing the lenses .
negative	i don_'_t know which story is true .
negative	all i know is that it has_been almost 0 months and i still don_'_t have my glasses .
negative	i don_'_t know if this company is under new ownership but given the fact i have seen others reporting similar recent experiences , something clearly has changed .
negative	i will not be buying from here again .
negative	it is worth the extra_cost to order locally - at_least then i have glasses in a week .
negative	oh i am not happy with you guys .
negative	not even a little .
negative	booked a 0 queen at la_quinta in albany oregon .
negative	yay us , they put us in a spa suite ... with a king_bed .
negative	yeah so i am traveling with a disabled companion , who needs his own bed , and he is a platonic friend .
negative	not to mention my sig other would have flipped out if i slept in the same bed with another guy .
negative	so they had no double queens .
negative	they brought me a decrepit rollaway which couldn_'_t have supported a child , let_alone an adult ( with arthritis ) and had a high spot in the middle and rusty broken metal parts sticking out .
negative	so i tried it anyway but my legs started falling asleep ...
negative	i finally had to fold up the death trap .
negative	i dragged the cot ' mattress ', if you can call it that , on the floor , and that is where i slept .
negative	you guys had one job - one job ... book a room with two queens .
negative	if it wasn_'_t available you shouldn_'_t have sold it to me .
negative	i will not be usong travelocity to book in the future ( and after my friends saw the pictures of our ' accomodations ' they probably_won_'_t either ).
negative	seriously i do want my money back ( but don_'_t feel too bad - my chiropractor friggin loves you ).
negative	i was not pleased with the delivery .
negative	i ordered in early december and white_flower didn_'_t deliver within the next week ... when the weather was warmer .
negative	no they waited_until the weather was extremely cold and then left the orchid on the door_step .
negative	i would have hoped that the flower recipient would have received more than what they were supposed to get .
negative	they didn_'_t even get an orchid because they were " out " of the product .
negative	grr
negative	still_haven_'_t received the part i ordered !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i bought a frame and case from the clearance sale section and was really looking_forward to receiving it .
negative	when i got it , it was only the frame .
negative	i wrote to the customer_service [_name removed_] to inquire_about it , her response was : " the reason items are cheap there is reason behind this ."
negative	at the same time , all product descriptions were amended , wiping off all traces of their mistake .
negative	i can '_t_believe_how unprofessional the customer_service handled the case .
negative	i hope this is just an isolated case and i am still keeping my faith that the company will act in a professional way when dealing_with similar cases in the future .
negative	this is the last time i buy something and it is only because i have to use my coupon .
negative	my last order cost $_000 . 00 , i have chosen express shipping .
negative	but it took about a month to arrive because of unavailable items .
negative	when i got the packet , nothing suited me , everything was in a poor quality textile ...
negative	so i decided to send all the package back and wanted to be repaid .
negative	the new package cost me about $_00 !
negative	finally , i received a mail from yesstyle saying that they refund $_000 , 00 instead of the initial cost ($_000 . 00 ) because ...
negative	they deduct express shipping fee of usd00 from my refund ??
negative	?...
negative	originally , for any total order over $_000 the shipping is free .
negative	so why ?
negative	to conclude : the order was expensive , the repack was expensive , on your refund a shipping fee is added as a surprise gift and there is not any compensation .
negative	it '_s totally unreasonable .
negative	yesstyle = never again
negative	i stayed at the marriott in hollywood , ca , along with a few of my clients .
negative	we requested to have 0 boxes moved from the guest check in area to one of the rooms and was charged at fee of $_000 . 00 .
negative	( which they were moved on a cart , in one trip .)
negative	completely shameful !
negative	i can understand a charge , but $_000 . 00 ?
negative	we were not even made aware of this charge in advance .
negative	when questioning the charge on my card - here is the reply i was given by management .
negative	miss young ,
negative	a request was sent to my controller disputing a $_000 shipping charge on xxxxx folio .
negative	however , that request has_been denied .
negative	the shipping charge is not for actual shipping services from ups .
negative	the shipping for $_000 . 00 on 00 / 00 is a delivery fee from hotel shipping center to guest '_s room : 0 oversized boxes over 000 lb .
negative	each at $_00 delivery fee = $_000 .
negative	therefore , the charge is correct and will remain on the folio .
negative	i do apologize about the inconvenience and you have a pleasant day .
negative	thank_you !
negative	i ordered parts for a 0000_dodge dakota .
negative	all 0000 dakota sport and st ect .
negative	models calls for the same part # for lower control arm bushings .
negative	i talk to 0 dodge dealers .
negative	parts_geek sells rep . ext 000 and 000 told me i ordered the wrong part .
negative	they told me to get the sell rep . from dodge : name and # so they could call them to verify what i was telling them .
negative	when i called them back both of them hung_up on me at lest 0 times each .
negative	i spent 00_min .
negative	to 0 hr .
negative	waiting to show them this was 000_% there mistake .
negative	there selling parts that fit 0000_dodge dakotas as parts for 0000 . the body styles changed in 0000 . now they want me to pay for shipping to return there mistake .
negative	there web_site is . wrong and there sell reps . are rude .
negative	they claim mopar says these parts are right for 0000 sport model that '_s not true the parts they sent me only fit 0000 to 0000_dodge dakotas .
negative	im turning them in for advertising the wrong part and charging me for shipping .
negative	now they say it will take 00 days to get my money back .
negative	and there going to deduct return shipping from my refund .
negative	the odds of me doing any kind of orders with them is slim .
negative	and i order a lot of parts too .
negative	the parts was also in a zip lock bag and 0 was rusty with stickers no boxes .
negative	thank_you
negative	travelocity charged me 0 x and i cant get the damn bill corrected .
negative	customer_service put me on hold and i gave up after 00_min
negative	ok , i '_m still not grasping the concept of you guys not being open saturday or sunday when you run an internet business !!
negative	i couldn_'_t get up with anyone regarding my order .
negative	i sent an_email on the 00th of sept . and did not get a response until the 00th of sept .
negative	i ordered my product on the 00th and will not receive it until the 00th !
negative	the next shipping option you have available is next_day which is usually around $_00 so that isnt an option for me .
negative	0 days is way too long for an order to process ( for me )!!!!
negative	seriously need to consider having customer_service and shipping departments open on the weekend .
negative	or inform people of the possible delay .
negative	not satisfied , i thought when you do reservation for room they hold room until you check in and then charge you i got charge the day i did reservation .
negative	i will never use this site again
negative	they did not send us a self address stamp in a box to send back for the core , nothing .
negative	i ordered the correct_part online and when i recieved the parts i recieved one correct_part and one part was wrong , i put in a ticket (# 000000 ) and i have not had a reply .
negative	so i have the wrong part and the way i read on the website if i do send it back i have to pay for the shipping .
negative	i am very dissatisfied and will not recommed this store .
negative	i really think pet_flow is a good option for me !
negative	fiz meu pedido dia 0 de fevereiro e ate agora não chegou
negative	i purchased a wedding_dress that arrived after my wedding day .
negative	i had to purchase another dress to wear on my speacial day & i can '_t return the wedding_dress that i bought off of lightinthebox . com .
negative	i would never shop on this site again !!
negative	i wasted my time and money
negative	checked on parcelforce internet website for prices to send a parcel weighing under 00kg across to other side of country for repair .
negative	the site gave impression of only two price bands - one at £ 0 . 00 +_vat for 00 hour delivery and another of £_00 . 00 +_vat for 00_hours delivery .
negative	00_hours suited us and it said insurance cover was up to £_000 and no weight restriction .
negative	took parcel to post_office - counter girl had completely different page on her screen and insisted she had to follow that - it cost us over_£_00 to send and insurance was up to £_000 only and weight restriction was 00kg !
negative	posted last friday_afternoon and it was delivered to destination at 0pm tuesday .
negative	company effected repair and got it back to us via another carrier by 00 . 00 this morning - thursday !!
negative	so pull your socks up parcelforce - your methods smack of unfair trading !
negative	they responded to an_email of complaint by saying they had to vary their rates in accordance with different situations - rubbish !
negative	how different a situation could it have been ?
negative	imagine my disappointment when i arrive home to find my grille assembly sitting on my porch , a plastic car part , packaged in a mere plastic_bag . i arrive inside , and open the package to see a two inch corner broken off of the part . when i called the customer_service number , it said that there have been a lot of calls lately , so the trouble ticket online is the only way to address my issue .
negative	so i filed my trouble ticket and the only response i have received so_far is a question ; " did the box appear to be tampered with "?
negative	i am satisfied to know that this company at_least occasionally packages delicate products in an appropriate manner .... meanwhile my car is still without that crucial part and i am so_far out fifty bucks and all to show for it is a broken grille .
negative	i '_ve still not received my money can you tell me when i '_m going to get it
negative	i ordered stuff for my sons first birthday , was to be 00 of each item , turns_out it was 00 napkins and spoons / forks .
negative	everything else was 0 .
negative	i have been trying to contact them with the # provided on their website but all you can do is leave a message .
negative	the answering service doesn_'_t even say where you are calling .
negative	i am still trying to get my money back .
negative	horrible
negative	guess ill go through <_external link_removed >!
negative	shoes are wonderful the salesperson was less desirable and do not wish to have him return
negative	i felt very deceived by this company .
negative	they represent themselves as if they are the actual hotel reservation desk .
negative	i thought i was speaking with the westin hotel and the representative on the phone led me to believe he was part of the hotel staff .
negative	there were several errors on my reservation including the misspelling of my name .
negative	i also requested two queen_beds and he reserved one king_bed and then told me they would straighten it out when i checked in .
negative	feeling very uncomfortable with this response , i did more research to find the local number for the hotel .
negative	i called and spoke with an actual westin hotel employee who stated that i most_likely would have not gotten the two beds because it was a holiday_weekend .
negative	she also gave_me a rate that was $_00 cheaper_than this third_party " reservation_counter " i have cancelled my reservation with them and after 0 days , still_waiting for them to reimburse my credit_card .
negative	not happy with this company at all !!
negative	!
negative	one of the colors leaked and made a mess .
negative	the blue /
negative	no flowers on the day requested , no one to talk to , and no reply to my email inquiry !!
negative	!
negative	would not recommend teleflorist !
negative	!
negative	order number twie000000
negative	you took the money from my account and it took 00 days to receive my book .
negative	i ordered several books from other_sites and received my books within a couple of days .
negative	do not know why it took so long if others can get books out fast but you can not .
negative	will not be ordering from you again .
negative	first , i went on the internet and searched " courtyard_marriott rockford " and booked our room .
negative	at that time , i wanted a two - double_bed room , however , the only availability was a king_room , however , it said it sleeps 0 people , so we took that instead of moving to another hotel .
negative	when we got in our room , the pull - out was a twin bed , so , in actuality , it only sleeps 0 !
negative	terrible misrepresentation .
negative	then when we went to change the room , we were told there was a two - double_bed room that we could change to .
negative	when they pulled_up our reservation , we were told we could not change because we booked through " expedia ".
negative	i did not realize i booked through_expedia because nowhere on my confirmation did it say expedia .
negative	i was then told that expedia pays to use the courtyard_marriott logo and then expedia basically gets a kickback for the booking .
negative	however , when you book through_expedia the customer is not allowed to make room changes once they are at the hotel .
negative	i think this is false_advertising and very deceiving to the customer .
negative	we we slept uncomfortably in a supposed " king_room with pullout , which sleeps 0 ", when it is actually a room that sleeps 0 !
negative	when we said that they shouldn_'_t advertise it as sleeping 0 , we got the answer " well , a lot of people run_into that problem but we can '_t switch your room because you booked with expedia ", which , as i stated i did not know .
negative	i think marriott courtyard and expedia rip people off !!!
negative	i will never stay at another courtyard_marriott and i will never book with expedia , and as we were told , will call the hotels we book at directly because they will match expedia prices anyway !
negative	very unsatisfied customer !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered the red robin arrangement twice for two different family_members .
negative	the one i received a picture of showed the fruit in the arrangement as being very large compared to the rest of the flowers etc .
negative	it was very disproportionate and very disappointing .
negative	i didn_'_t see the second arrangement but i can only assume it was the same way ~ not like the picture at all .
negative	i have been ordering products and chemicals from this company for years and for some_reason this year i have never had the worst service from any company in all of my life .
negative	between their customer_service department giving me wrong information . to speeaking with a supervisorr named anna who gave_me all the incorrect information and said you would call me back but after a day and a half she never did .
negative	after all of this trouble all i received was chlorine tabs in awhile brush i had ordered about 0 other types of chemicals for my pool that i never got the rest of the merchandise as it was sent back because it was damaged but they never notified me of that fact .
negative	now two_weeks into the pool season i have no chemicals but i am afraid to place another order through this company .
negative	it '_s true ... you get what you pay for , but i didn_'_t think i would get scammed !!
negative	the stuff is cheap ... they totally overcharge for shipping and returning their products is one headache after another .
negative	they have to approve your return and you have to get a rma_number and if you don_'_t display it properly on your packaging they reject your return .
negative	then they give you pennies for your return ... i '_m not kidding ...
negative	i paid $_00_bucks for a pair of shoes once ... returned it ... got $_00_bucks back store credit .
negative	and here '_s the worse part ... warning warning warning ...
negative	once i got my store credit ...
negative	i bought another pair of shoes and followed the instructions to use my store credit ...
negative	they charged me full price !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	only after you call them ( and yes the horror_stories are true ... calling a 000x to get thru and then they put you on hold for 00 - 00_min .)
negative	and complain that your store credit wasn_'_t deducted from your new order do they give you your money back .
negative	was this an accident ??????????
negative	yeah right ...
negative	this has happened to me twice !!!!
negative	it has happened to my sister and a good friend .... they pray you don_'_t notice that they didn_'_t deduct your store credit and get away with charging you full price .
negative	crooks !!!!
negative	i '_m already writing a letter to the bbb , i have written an_email to them , and i '_m thinking about calling my bank and saying they committed fraud .
negative	it '_s not worth it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	trust me ... buy from the other_places they might be a little_bit more_expensive but in the end you get what you pay for !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i am absolutely disgusted with the service provided by ziffit .
negative	they have taken my cds which i sent packaged carefully and in good condition , then i get a report telling_me that most of the items are in poor condition - which is not true .
negative	also they tell me that several discs were missing , this is a complete lie , they were double_checked before packaging up for posting .
negative	several cds it says are missing a cover , which is also not true .
negative	i think they just make it up as they go along , ie accept one , say one is missing , one in poor condition , repeat until end of list .
negative	then they happily tell you they can '_t return any items , sorry , and give you 00_% of the money they agreed .
negative	never , ever use this company , they are crooks .
negative	either sell your stuff on ebay or give to charity , i certainly will in the future .
negative	i ordered about a hundred_dollars worth of items and never received my shipment and it '_s been two_weeks
negative	i have not taken my flight yet but prices was very competitive compared to the other_sites i was checking .
negative	my flight is to barcelona and most other_sites that had a better rate were for overnight layovers which was not an option for me just to get a better deal .
negative	the flight insurance seemed a little high compared to say priceline .
negative	and my only real complaint was i guess my screen timed out and the site advised me to call the flyeurope costumer_service .
negative	when i did the man_who answered was very rude and abrupt with me .
negative	he kept cutting me off , got really impatient when i was making a decision , spoke really quickly and when i would ask him to repeat he would do so like i was deaf and slow .
negative	it was embarrassing costumer_service .
negative	i decided to try my chances on the site again and got of the phone with him as quickly as a could .
negative	i almost did not purchase with the site just because of the service experience .
negative	its too bad so many online companies take good costumer_service for granted .
negative	i '_m a former shutterfly lover .
negative	i '_ve made cards , luggage tags , mailing labels but mostly books .
negative	this review is not to comment on the quality of the product which i find to be good .
negative	this is about customer_service .
negative	recently we vacationed with my sister and her husband .
negative	during that time we picked_up some coupons for free 0x0 photo_books .
negative	i made a book and used the coupon i received .
negative	my sister made a book that went way over the 00 pages that the coupon covered so i offered to let her use my credit_card to pay for the rest of her book .
negative	when she went to order her book the coupon was denied .
negative	she called shutterfly and they told her that because my credit_card was used to pay for a book using a similar coupon hers would not be honored .
negative	does that make_sense to anyone ?
negative	i understand shutterfly not wanting people to take_advantage of a one time only offer but that wasn_'_t the case .
negative	she tried to explain that to the shutterfly representative but was told that once the coupon was denied there was no way to reinstate it .
negative	she was offered 00_%_off her book , a special they had running at the time .
negative	i '_ve had other problems with shutterfly in the past , mostly server problems that caused me to lose days of work .
negative	this was just the last straw .
negative	i will no_longer use shutterfly for anything ever again .
negative	booked cruise through_travelocity because of onboard_credit promotion .
negative	should have received $_000 but only received $_00 .
negative	you did not deliver on your promise and for that i will not use your website again .
negative	i will also share my experience with others .
negative	the cruise was fantastic , but that has nothing to do with you .
negative	my advice to anyone would be if you can book the reservation yourself , do it .
negative	the only_reason we called the reservation number was because we were using a credit_card that typically offers discounted rates on hotel_rooms ( which they ended_up not being_able to help us with anyway as we have to wait_until we check in to the hotel ).
negative	when we called the number we were connected with an agent with a foreign accent .
negative	we couldn_'_t understand him and he couldn_'_t understand us .
negative	after a grueling 00_minutes , i mentioned to my husband that i thought he may have misspelled our name by the way he was trying to pronounce it and i was afraid there may be a problem with the charge on our credit_card if the name didn_'_t match .
negative	turns_out is was misspelled .
negative	this threw the guy for a loop and he had to bring on his " assistant " who had to bring on her " assistant " ( both with foreign accents and at which time my husband handed the phone to me because he couldn_'_t take it anymore ).
negative	after another 00_minutes and everything was supposedly corrected , i asked the girl to confirm with me what she had booked .
negative	turns_out she booked the wrong room - i had asked for queen with a view of the river and she booked queen with no view .
negative	at this point i was so frustrated that i asked the girl to cancel the reservation .
negative	another couple of minutes passed and the girl gave_me my cancellation number and calmly asked " is there anything_else i can help you with today ?"
negative	i went_ahead and booked online which caused another issue ... i now had two large charges on my credit_card ( not sure why full payment is needed before checking in anyway ) as the refund for the first reservation won_'_t be on my statement for a few_days , and i received an_email from my credit_card company saying because of the two large charges they suspected fraudulent activity and the charge had been denied .
negative	i then had to contact the credit_card company and the hotel to make_sure the reservation was in order .
negative	the hotel is lucky we are still staying with them because my husband wanted nothing to do with them after this ordeal .
negative	don_'_t buy anything from this company at lease you want have a nightmares ....!!!!
negative	!
negative	the coffee is very weak - an opinion expressed by everyone at my house who has drunk it .
negative	also .
negative	the capsules are suppose to fit the nespresso machines and , although you can get them to go in , i think they may be damaging to the machine .
negative	definitely not happy with the product and will not be reordering .
negative	difficult to work with .
negative	picture doesn_'_t accurately depict what product really looks like .
negative	would not recommend this site to anyone .
negative	i received the dress i bought and it was ripped and did not at all look like the color on the website .
negative	also , the dress had a stain on it which i assume was because it was already returned since there were no tags on the dress .
negative	i will never order from this site again and i strongly urge everyone else to do the same .
negative	i will be returning the other items i also bought in the transaction because i was so disappointed in the quality .
negative	i ordered a black sequin dress .
negative	when it turned_up it was ripped and torn all over .
negative	sent it back for refund and never received t money back !!
negative	!
negative	the website said i wouldn_'_t be charged until i arrived on the day of my reservation .
negative	as soon as i entered my card it immediately charged it .
negative	i took a photo of the page where it said that i wouldn_'_t be charged yet .
negative	that '_s false_advertisement in a way , and i will not use this site again .
negative	uønsket post de opkræver fler og fler penge er ærlig talt rigtig sur !
negative	jeg_vil sgu ikke betale for en vare jeg_ikke_har bedt om og_jeg sender den enda retur hvad kan de forlange !
negative	svindel !
negative	i accidentally booked on this site , thinking i was on marriott '_s direct site .
negative	when i called immediately to cancel , the agent said he could not find my reservation , after_reading the # to him three_times .
negative	then , he asked for my email address .
negative	even thought i read it very clearly and slowly , he couldn_'_t speak_english well enough to understand me .
negative	when i told him that and asked to speak to someone_else , he hung_up on me !
negative	i called back immediately and told the second agent this and asked to speak to a supervisor , he wouldn_'_t let_me - he refused three_times !
negative	he again , asked for my reservation number , could not find it , and asked for my email address .
negative	again , he kept_repeating the wrong letters back , like the call_center room was too loud or his english too poor or it was intentional to keep me from cancelling .
negative	i hung_up and cancelled online , only to find out my credit_card had already been charged for the full stay !.
negative	scam company --- stay away !
negative	when my order was extremely late i decided to check in to see why . the people on the phone were very very nice and helpful but , as it turned_out , half my order had to come from another place and petflow did not bother to call and let_me know when or if it would be coming nor did they send the petfood they actually had on hand to fulfill the other half of the order .
negative	i don_'_t know why they waited and why , after taking so much information from me and how to contact me , they didn_'_t simply call or email .
negative	this communication ( any communication ) would '_ve gone a long way to help and i would not have had to go out and buy from someone_else .
negative	now i have way more than i need
negative	also misleading about discount ... don_'_t you just hate that ?
negative	i was sent the wrong part , i ordered a 0000 window_motor for buick roadmaster and sent a part for 0000_chevy , which of course did not fit .
negative	when i placed the order , it was early monday_morning .
negative	i gave my credit_card and the guy assured_me it would be mailed that day , to be received no later than wed . then i get an_email on tuesday showing it just shipped , and would not arrive till thur .
negative	i called and was told even_though the guy that took my order said it was approved and would ship on monday , that he did not have my correct billing_address for my credit_card .
negative	i even gave him the correct address as he said at first it was declined .
negative	i use a po_box for billing and my physical_address is different .
negative	i needed the order asap as i have 0 golden_retrievers taking medication right now .
negative	very disappointed in customer_service .
negative	the thunder jacket did not help .
negative	i am very disappointed because there was no receipt enclosed with the order and no directions for returning it .
negative	i waited 0 months for my supposedly free gift that is worth five_pounds , to which when it came i opened the big box and at the bottom under all the paper was 0 perfumes , a lip_gloss and some foundation .
negative	all of which were the tiny free_samples you get from your local beauty counter .
negative	the only good thing i can say is the company did keep_up the correspondence , saying the would send out my parcel soon !
negative	hhhmmm i '_m sorry i wouldn_'_t call that a good free gift from the company .
negative	got bounced between travelocity and air_canada repeatedly .
negative	ended_up with air_canada telling_me i ' d be able to reschedule under the circumstances , called back the next_day after the doctor meeting where i found out how long i ' d be needed , and was then told too bad , you can '_t reschedule , you could only do that if you were going sooner instead of later .
negative	travelocity did not help at all .
negative	i called cash one , about my loan and how i didn_'_t have enough money to make my payment this time and for them to double up my payment for next payment cycle .
negative	and the branch manager said " no , we don_'_t do that ".
negative	we in fact they have done this for me before .
negative	i told her that i was sick and wasnt able to make it into work .
negative	the bm , said she needed some kind of proof from my job about not making enough hours to cover my payment .
negative	to me that '_s ridiculous , i am not some kind of child .
negative	i am trying to work with them so they don_'_t overdraft my account again !!!!!
negative	and she_thinks that i '_m lying .
negative	i asked her if she could tell that district_manager call me , and she said " no , because i '_m am telling you what do to .
negative	i need some kind of proof of your job ."
negative	i have had problems with this company before and the dm has called me personally and fixed them .
negative	the dm has also said that if i have any other problems , to let the bm know to call me .
negative	i am so frustrated with this company , and i '_m sick of being treated poorly .
negative	i have had some poor customer_service in other_places but nothing tops this place .
negative	this is my second review on this place .
negative	complicated .
negative	leaves you wondering .
negative	too bad the arm of the law wont reach to china .
negative	there " business " is nothing short of criminal .
negative	i made the mistake of not checking the reviews before ordering .
negative	no refund no response to email . live and learn .
negative	captain poontang
negative	parts_geek shipped an incorrect part to me and i had to return it at my own_expense .
negative	it '_s been over a week since i returned it and still have not received credit !
negative	you can '_t call them , the automated phone system will eventually hang up on you !!!!!
negative	don_'_t order from here !!
negative	!
negative	my husband '_s experience with expedia is also a bad one .
negative	but after_reading the reviews , it seems he got off lightly compared to many of you .
negative	my husband had to go out of town for work on short_notice and had to book a hotel at the last_minute .
negative	he had trouble_finding one that was available for the first night of his stay .
negative	he checked expedia .
negative	the room he ended_up booking was touted , with the supposed advantages , like " close to the main road ", etc .
negative	.
negative	when he got there , he found it was a very seedy motel in a ghetto - like area .
negative	he is being charged the price of a nice room , and he figures he is being charged double what anyone_else who stays there is paying .
negative	during the day , he is taking his suitcases in the car , because he doesn_'_t trust leaving them in the room .
negative	this is our first experience with expedia ; and needless to say , it is the last .
negative	after_seeing the other reviews , i don_'_t see how they stay in business .
negative	we recently_purchased car parts for our bmw from this company .
negative	they sent us a honda accord car part .
negative	they made the error and have now refused to exchange it .
negative	i have to wait for the credit and then re - order .
negative	it will take another couple months .
negative	it was their error and they are not making good on it .
negative	bought a kgb deal for a weekend away for £_00 . on phoning the hotel i was told it was fully booked until the deal expiry_date 00th_june and to ask for a refund . as stated in other reviews there is no contact phone no for kgb just an_email to ncrowd , i have sent around 00 emails in over two_weeks i just get automated_responses with a ticket no . i have sent endless replies to my threads and new requests which just bring up a new ticket no . i have sent similar request to other deal companies and received a refund without a problem . i dont hold out any hope of getting my money back and advise people not to use the site . i am sure this has happened to other people who have bought this deal so kgb are quids in .
negative	i made order on00 / 00 / 0000 ...... to day is 0 / 00 / 0000 and fashionqueen . net have not dispatchet my item ... no reply of the e_- mails i send ....... what a company they really are !.,.....
negative	it '_s too long to wait for online shoopping ......
negative	i just wait for several days for any unswer ........ otherwise i will report to police and my bank .
negative	i have had the worst_experience with this company , it '_s just appalling .
negative	first off , i ordered a car to pick_up at the cancun airport in mexico .
negative	long_story short , we waited an_hour for our car only to find out that they didn_'_t have one for us .
negative	we ended_up having to go find another company to rent a car with and paid almost twice as much .
negative	i emailed economycarrentals . com and told them this but they said they had to speak with their representatives in mexico before they would refund me my deposit .
negative	i emailed them every week and they would say the same thing , that they hadn_'_t gotten a hold of the reps , so no money back for me .
negative	finally , after a month of harassing them , they told me i would be getting a refund .
negative	that was 00 days ago and still no refund .
negative	horrible company , terrible customer_service !!
negative	i would stay far away from them if i were you .
negative	operator did not identify himself as being with expedia .
negative	i thought i was talking to hilton reservations .
negative	he took a long time and did not give me the group rate as requested .
negative	email_confirmation did not state it was via expedia but showed a picture of the hilton with whom i was booked .
negative	cancellation has to be done via expedia .
negative	not only was i erroneously charged in advance for my reservation after reserving 0 room for 0 adult , and told i would not be charged until i checked out , my bank_account was charge $_000 (+ cents ) for 0 room with 0_adults .
negative	when i received the cancellation notice , it stated a credit would be issued within 00_hours but may not show up on my account for 00 days .
negative	easy to book on line , however , the product turned to be out of stock , when it finally came in , over a month later , it took another month to ship .
negative	the shipping company , i parcel , had computer problems and glitches ..... this was a fiasco of an order .
negative	i am not sure that i would buy from you again .

negative	att thinks i have the new u - verse , well they didnt put it in yet ........
negative	its been over a month .
negative	i looked at over 0000 pairs of shoes online and after a week i specifically picked out 0 pairs to match my outfits for a special_occasion .
negative	i actually called while ordering on line to make_sure that if i pressed the express shipping button and paid the $_00 . 00 , that i would get these shoes on time .
negative	i was leaving for vacation and would be gone 0_weeks . the lady said ; " absolutely !
negative	i promise you !
negative	the delivery would be 0 to 0 business days after shipping .
negative	i received an e_- mail_stating that my package was shipped on a saturday .
negative	long_story short , the package came in 0 business days , the next friday , according to the house sitter and i was long gone .
negative	i had to spend hours at the mall looking for shoes to wear and the last_minute and stressed to the max .
negative	i will never order from macy '_s again !!
negative	the express shipping is a lie and cannot be counted on !!!
negative	when i called they said there was nothing they could do about it and that home deliveries take 0 business days after shipping and not 0 business days like their website indicates .
negative	so basically this is a huge scam in order for them to get more money from your pocket to theirs .
negative	i '_m sure they count on people not complaining_about it while they pocket the money for the express shipping .
negative	macy ....... you are not a " class_act " store .
negative	you are pathetic !!
negative	!
negative	when we went in to look the staff couldn_'_t be more happy to spend our money .
negative	when we had issues with the delivered furniture we were hung_up on , yelled at , and treated rudely .
negative	messages were not given to the manager we were dealing_with .
negative	return phone_calls never happened .
negative	if i could give 0_stars i would .
negative	i have told everyone i know looking for furniture to not even_bother going to american_freight .
negative	the quality of the furniture is almost as poor as the staff .
negative	signed_up and it tells_me i might want to talk to dhs for government assistance .
negative	not even an offer of other insurance .
negative	not qualified for dhs so i needed something_else .
negative	had to go and find one on my own .
negative	it just upset me that they claim to give you choices and i only got one .
negative	i wanted a listing and to decide for myself .
negative	the above rating makes no sense .
negative	i spoke to no one , so the rude conduct , is it referring to the website ?
negative	so you see , even this survey isn_'_t right .
negative	i read that the toys were tiugh toys and i ordered themthinking they would last longet than 0 0 / 0 hrs !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered chicken strips for my dog .
negative	when i got them in the mail they were from china .
negative	i refuse to feed my dog anything from china .
negative	have we not learned anything yet .
negative	if it is not from usa i won_'_t buy it .
negative	you need to let people know where it comes from .
negative	first , they had the wrong product pictured on their website - so the part i received was not the part i ordered .
negative	second , even_though i received authorization to return it & did so promptly & according to their policy and instructions to do so - i still have not received a refund & it '_s been over a month !!
negative	all i keep getting are useless emails_telling_me their " return_policy " and asking for proof of delivery - which i have provided several_times .
negative	at this point , i '_m going to escalate to the bbb as the part was $_000 !
negative	it '_s a shame because i thought i was going to be a big_fan of this company until this happened .
negative	this is ridiculous !
negative	i even re - ordered the correct_part & was happy with it .
negative	i signed_up , went to the post_office ( as requested by rushmypassport . com ) and found out from the post_office that going through them is actually faster_than rushmypassport !
negative	what a rip_off .
negative	now , rushmypassport won_'_t give me a refund .
negative	the post_office told me they ' re a scam , wish i had gone there first .
negative	post_office takes 0 - 00 ( not business ) days .
negative	follow_up to previous complaint :
negative	i was contacted by bookit after posting negative_reviews about my terrible travel experience .
negative	they said they would give me a credit for one nights stay in the form of bookit credit .
negative	i explained that i would never be using their company again and a credit would not be used .
negative	the woman then talked to her " supervisor " who then offered $_000 refund .
negative	i told them it was not a fair offer but i would check with my boyfriend as he had paid for the trip .
negative	when i called them back to discuss the woman told me it was not $_000 but $_00 .
negative	this is a lie .
negative	when presented with the compensation offer , they also wanted me to remove all of my reviews and commit to a nondisclosure of the terms of the agreement .
negative	i will never use the company again and will encourage_anyone i know not to use them .

negative	previous complaint :
negative	my boyfriend and i returned today from a trip for my 00th_birthday to playa del carmen booked through bookit . com .
negative	the trip was a quick 0 night trip from may 0 - 00 .
negative	our flight was cancelled due to weather on the 0th .
negative	we were not notified that the flight was cancelled .
negative	i understand weather cannot be prevented but when we contacted bookit we were told that nothing could be done and that we needed to contact the hotel to make arrangements .
negative	we were stranded in indianapolis and did not have international_calling .
negative	we were told by bookit that the hotel had considered us a no call no show for the first night .
negative	bookit was not helpful at all .
negative	we requested that they contact the hotel to see if we could extend our stay a night and for assistance in getting flights rescheduled and extending our stay .
negative	they told us it was our responsibility and we needed to make arrangements .
negative	our flight was also cancelled on the way back and what should have been a 0 hour flight turned into over 00_hours and we were not helped or compensated for anything that went wrong with the short trip which ended_up with us only being at our resort for 00_hours for $ 0000 +.
negative	we were also told that someone would meet us at our hotel to set_up transfer back to the hotel but they never showed nor called .
negative	we had to have the wonderful people at our resort help us .
negative	bookit was not helpful at all through the entire_process and we will never use them again and we will make_sure that all of our friends , family and any one we know do not use them .
negative	on the good side , the resort we stayed in was amazing and the people there were amazing .
negative	( ocean maya royale ).
negative	i had previously used iflorist and been quite impressed so i decided to use them again to send my mother some flowers for mother '_s day .
negative	they were delivered on the 00th_march as_promised , but they delivered the wrong flowers !
negative	i had spent quite a while selecting the right bouquet for my mother ( pink fizz worth almost £_00 ) only for her to receive a bunch of tulips which are worth a lot less !
negative	i have tried emailing to get back the money i have lost but that was 0 days ago and i still_haven_'_t heard_anything .
negative	i can '_t ring because i '_m not currently in the uk and the chat_feature on their website is always offline .
negative	it '_s completely_unacceptable for them to take my money for quite an expensive bunch of flowers but then to deliver something a lot cheaper !
negative	we were heading to reno , nevada , and up to a festival called " burning man " attended by 00 , 000 people .
negative	needless to say , i booked the vehicle , a 0 - seater suv , well in advance to make_sure we got a decent price and that there were still vehicles available .
negative	i booked the rental , using my credit_card , but was required to provide details of the driver on booking .
negative	i put my friend as the drive , since i preferred him to drive .
negative	this meant that the entire booking went under his name , and i didn_'_t even receive the confirmation_email , he did .
negative	when we arrived at reno airport , we realized that my friend '_s license was expired , and dollar rentacar said we ' d have to call rentalcars . com and get them to change the driver in their system before dollar could change it and give us a car .
negative	we spent five hours on the phone with rentalcars . com , all the while them saying they were changing the driver , and were just waiting for it to update in dollar '_s system .
negative	after five hours , the guy on the phone finally said , " you called us after your pickup time , so actually your rental is void .
negative	we will not change the driver , and you will not have a vehicle .
negative	we don_'_t even have to refund your money , but we will just to be nice ."
negative	we were totally screwed !!!!!
negative	dollar offered to rent us the same vehicle for $ 0000 , versus the $_000 we had originally_booked it for .
negative	i refused and we found another way , but we could '_ve spent those 0 hours searching for another vehicle , rather_than sitting around waiting for rentalcars . com to tell us we didn_'_t have a vehicle !
negative	what idiots .
negative	they just absolutely don_'_t care about customer_service , at all , one bit .
negative	do yourself a favor and don_'_t use these_guys .
negative	it may look cheap but it '_s not worth the nightmares .
negative	we had problems with the rental_car .
negative	we were tools that the car we reserved could fit a suitcase but when we got there we were told it was a hatchback car with no luggage space so of course had to upsize and pay alot more .
negative	our flights there and back we delayed and some cancelled and it would have been days before we got home if i wouldn_'_t have called to raise hell .
negative	not satisfied
negative	hey man , i ordered a window switch from partsgeek , and they sent me a heater valve .
negative	they dont give you a phone_number to contact them , and now i know why .
negative	i have been exchanging emails , but i still have no window switch , and they say that they dont give refunds or exchanges .
negative	they sent me the wrong part , and now i have no part .
negative	if i were you man , i would not even think about ordering from these sam artist .
negative	i have used_serenata before and never had any_issues .
negative	however for the first time i have used my mobile to order some flowers to be delivered to the uk .
negative	straight_away i had problems , the address wouldn_'_t change from a us address to a uk address when i had selected paypal as payment option .
negative	then when i decided to use a normal bank_account to pay the address was still being displayed as a us address .
negative	i pressed back to cancel the transaction and the next thing i know i '_m being emailed with an order confirmation .
negative	i tried to track down a telephone_number to call a customer_service representative , couldn_'_t find a number anywhere .
negative	i tried to complete a contact form on the mobile website , it would not work , i tried three_times and once more on my husbands mobile_phone .
negative	i have since emailed serenata to explain this was not an order i wanted and due to their website having technical_issues when used on a smart phone i have been charged .
negative	i ordered a book from bookbyte .
negative	after 0_weeks it still hadn_'_t arrived , nor had i received an_email about any delay .
negative	when i tried to track my order i was told that the order had been cancelled .
negative	i was never notified via_email or any other means that the order had been cancelled .
negative	i still need the book , but i will be taking my business elsewhere .
negative	i had to order the same book more than once because they kept shipping the book out with no apartment number .
negative	i never did receive the book i ordered and had to drop the class .
negative	they have no phone_number to call , only email and fax number .
negative	the email response is generic and is of no help at all with questions or concerns .
negative	i really despise this company .
negative	it caused me nothing but stress and grief !
negative	you shared a whole raft of personally identifiable information with a third_party email address not belonging to your customer , in breach of the dpa .
negative	your it and security_systems are laughable .
negative	you have been reported for the unwarranted spam and the breach of confidentiality .
negative	legal proceedings to follow - contact your legal department asap before responding to this complaint .
negative	bought an itunes_gift_card for digital delivery and it has not been delivered 00_hours_later
negative	next time i will call the hotel_directly , it would have been a lot cheaper !
negative	mr . hinton is exactly right , money ( in crazy increments , by the way , min $_00 ) is gone after some time .
negative	congrats , mobilitypass , doing good !
negative	i ordered pink and white flowers for mothers_day and to coincide with announcing to my mum that she '_s going to have a granddaughter .
negative	i live overseas now so put_together a little something special online to be delivered on the saturday .
negative	unfortunately , despite me choosing sunday delivery and accepting saturday or sunday delivery ( fair enough , it '_s a busy time ) and ordering a couple of weeks in advance so that everythng should have arrived together on the saturday , the flowers and message arrived on the friday and ruined the surprise .
negative	good luck making that up to my family .
negative	dirty , shabby , with scary clientele .
negative	you get 00_minutes to decide if you ' re keeping the room .
negative	do yourself a favor and stay anywhere_else .
negative	sink was wobbly .
negative	yes the sink and the counter it sat on wobbled .
negative	i was afraid to take my shoes off .
negative	one swipe of the floor with a damp cloth and the cloth came away with a black hand print on it .
negative	do not ever use this site to by parts .. very cheaplyt made , but the return_policy is the worst .
negative	the ups store has hundreds of complaints about the return_policy .
negative	you make returning the part nearly_impossible .. original box , the same order has to be sent back in the different boxes it came in .
negative	it was going to cost me $_00 . 00 to send back a crappy part that cost $_00 . 00 plus 00_%_off to " restock " the item .
negative	ebay is a more trustworthy place to buy parts .
negative	i made a reservation asking for 0 beds .
negative	i received an_email_confirmation showing one bed .
negative	i called back to try to rectify the situation and was told to call the hotel .
negative	i did .
negative	the hotel told me they could do nothing because i was dealing_with expedia .
negative	i had no_idea until that time that i was dealing_with expedia .
negative	i called back the original number and after about 00_minutes on the phone , the situation was rectified .
negative	in all i spent about 0 0 / 0 hours on the phone trying to change a bed size .
negative	i sent marriott an_email_telling them of the situation .
negative	they sent me back a " boiler plate " email_saying that i must have been ordering a car or a flight .
negative	such was not the case .
negative	i sent an_email back telling them that i did not order a car or a flight and have heard_nothing from them since .
negative	i am only hoping that when i get there , i find two beds in the room .
negative	ridiculous !!
negative	!
negative	there was a party of 0 that we booked from kelowna to new_orleans roundtrip .
negative	i did not get on the flight from kelowna due to a expired passport .
negative	i contacted expedia to change my flight to the next_day out of vancouver .
negative	i was put on hold for 00_minutes and then disconnected , i called back and the next agent had not information about my issue and so i held for 00_minutes and was then disconnected again .
negative	i called again and held for 00_minutes to be told that all my flight to and from were cancelled as soon as as i didn_'_t get on first flight and the other 0 passengers flights would be cancelled back from new_orleans . they then told me they could book me one way flight from vancouver to new_orleans the next_day for $ 0000 .
negative	i said no thanks and called united directly and found out that none of the remaining legs of the flights had been cancelled for any of us .
negative	i gave up trying to work with expedia and just drove to seattle to meet the next leg of my flight .
negative	what a nightmare , i will never use them again and i will tell_everyone that i know to never deal with them
negative	from the ratings here it seems this company is either a hit or a huge disaster .
negative	i '_ve had one disaster after another with them and frankly i '_m sick of it so here '_s my story :
negative	i bought two of their travel cases to use for getting my company '_s imacs to and from events in one piece .
negative	i paid a ridiculous amount in shipping just to get them over to the us .
negative	and now , a little over three_months later , both cases are broken and they '_ve damaged the very expensive computers inside .
negative	when we wrote to ask about a refund they told us : " by the looks of the photographs the case has_been treated very badly .
negative	any object treated this badly is going to have damage , the purpose of the flight case is to help protect the equipment if dropped or treated badly .
negative	we can not offer you a replacement free of charge on this occasion ."
negative	so the purpose of the case is to protect our computer if it is treated badly , they say that it has_been treated badly , but our computers have been damaged and therefore not protected by the case , and even_though that is the purpose of the case , they cannot offer us even a replacement .
negative	... uhh , okay that makes no sense .
negative	0_stars for their products , 0_stars for their customer_service .
negative	my cabinet arrived a lot longer after i ordered it and was then actually damaged .
negative	little matters such as non_- working drawers and a damaged paintwork , showed it had not even been checked after dispatch from the factory .
negative	the delivery drivers had to be asked to put the cabinet together - rather_than just doing it and i had to gather up packaging so they would take it all away .
negative	very disappointing indeed .
negative	i now have to wait for a new cabinet and there is no mention of compensation at all .
negative	not a satisfactory service , considering i was ordering from you again , i am now really not sure !
negative	ordered a swim bag and was delivered an ugly swim cap .
negative	when i called the person insisted that that is what i ordered .
negative	my husband called and explained that when you try and look for that swim cap on their website it was a dead link and no way possible to order .
negative	on my order i specified pink or purple and medium .
negative	there are no options for color or size for that silly looking swim cap .
negative	finally they gave in and agreed something must have happened with their website and they refunded my money and i sent the cap back and they let_me buy what i originally thought i had purchased .
negative	the part took longer to get here than_anticipated .
negative	it was not packed properly .
negative	the part was put in the bottom of the box with bubble_wrap put on top instead of having packing_material in the bottom of the box the part in the middle and more packing_material on top .
negative	part of the plastic was broken when we received it .
negative	will not be ordering anything again or recommending you to friends .
negative	i do not blame the lady_who helped_me yesterday , i '_m blaming their overall lack of information on what storage_units are really available .
negative	i was told a local unit had climate_control units , as well as an 0 x 00 unit .
negative	they went_ahead and reserved this unit for me , i thought it was easy and great !
negative	until i got a call later that night from the storage_unit '_s manager saying that they did not have any climate_controlled units , and they do not have 0 x 00 units .
negative	at .
negative	all .
negative	i wasn_'_t upset with the man , of course , i '_m more upset with selfstorage '_s lack of attention to detail .
negative	she told me they had plenty of open 0 x 00 units , when they don_'_t even have any open units , let_alone the 0 x 00 .
negative	thanks selfstorage .
negative	i placed an order on march 0 , 0000 , the email i received said when it shipped i would get an_email .
negative	i checked the status on march 00 , 0000 and it said processing so i sent an_email but did not get a response .
negative	when i checked march 00 , 0000 it says it was shipped .
negative	but i still have not received an_email to find out where my order is .
negative	order #_000000000
negative	totally rubbish - ordered a ladies cardigan and received a mens onesie , it has taken days for customer_service to reply and i am still_waiting for a refund , i will never recommend or use boohoo again .
negative	and after_reading different reviews on boohoo it would seem i am not alone !
negative	!
negative	i had just clicked the confirm button on my purchase when i realized that there was a line item on the invoice for sky_tours ' own fee , for $_00 usd on my flight on jat .
negative	just to check , i checked jat '_s own website , and the flight was not only cheaper to begin with , but included no such fees .
negative	checking skyscanner and some other_sites , these_guys only come up among the first when the airline pricing engine itself ( such as jat ) is not included in the price comparison .
negative	definitely use with caution .
negative	if they ' re the cheapest , check the airline '_s own webpage to make_sure beforehand that they ' re not pulling a fast one .
negative	have used this company a few_times .
negative	twice_now , the codes on the voucher have not provided the cover expected in the us and dollar car_hire each time state the voucher_codes are provided by usrentacar and they have to adhere to them .
negative	had to change my booking this time due to a cancelled flight and usrentacar would not honour the ' price match ' as they had done when i booked it ( less_than a week after booking it ), and if i wanted to cancel the booking i would lose my £_00 , which would then have cost me more than booking with another company , so they had me every which way .
negative	shame that this inconsistency and poor customer_service means i won_'_t be using them again .
negative	i ordered a taillight lens for a 0000_ford_ranger and rec ' d a taillight lens for a 0000 explorer .
negative	i re - ordered the 0000_ford_ranger tail_light lens and it was fine .
negative	i went through the process of returning the wrong tail_light which is not easy -- you have to fill_out an on - line form and wait for 0 - 0 days for authorization and the return #.
negative	i followed the instructions about returning the wrong tail_light and never received my refund .
negative	i tried_calling and the only calls you can do it to order or give a credit_card ; you can '_t talk to anyone in customer_service and when you hang on for someone to talk to it hangs_up .
negative	never again !
negative	so after i followed all the process i still don_'_t get a refund !
negative	i have ordered from ilumi in the past and have been very happy with the food .
negative	but i placed an order on the 00th_april and im still_waiting for my delivery ( now 00th may ) i have rang customer_services and emailed and have been told the parcel has_been delivered to someone i have never_heard of .
negative	currently their appalling customer_services are calling me back .. so_far 0 days waiting for the call back ..... simply not good enough .
negative	the money has_been taken and i have no food .
negative	sort out your courier company and replace my order or refund my money
negative	ordered a display of flowers for delivery to my daughter yesterday .
negative	phone_call from eflorist late_afternoon to say local_florist couldn_'_t deliver as driver not available .
negative	offered delivery today plus free upgrade to ' medium ' from ' regular ' which i accepted .
negative	when my daughter sent me a photo of the flowers that arrived i was devastated - minimal flowers and badly arranged .
negative	customer_services less_than helpful , the second person i spoke to was rude - she wasn_'_t listening to me and talked over the top of my conversation .
negative	all she could say was ' you got the value of the goods you ordered ' - yes there were an extra couple of roses and lilies to replace the carnations but the display was sparse because of this and lost all it '_s beauty .
negative	i '_ve taken the 00_% refund and will make_sure i post this honest feedback in as many places as possible .
negative	the flowers were bought for a very special_occasion and eflorist '_s concern / reiteration that they had met their ' financial ' obligation demonstrates to me that they value finance over customer_satisfaction .
negative	needless to say this was my one and only purchase from this company .
negative	i just used the name your price option on priceline . com , i bid $_00 on a room in charleston , wv .
negative	on the confirmation page they said i would be paying $_00 plus hotel taxes and fees for a total of $_00 .
negative	after i hit continue , i was directed to a page telling_me i won the bid .
negative	i received the confirmation_email , and found out i was being charged $_000 plus taxes for a grand_total of $_000 . 00 .
negative	a far_cry from the $_00 i bid .
negative	not to mention the price on their website is only 00 . 00 .
negative	why would i bid 000 !
negative	after an_hour on the phone with their customer_service company , which is obviously not in the u . s ., of being told they are sorry they can not change or cancel the reservation .
negative	i got no where with them .
negative	they only changed the rate to $_00 plus tax .
negative	i have never had such horrible customer_service before !
negative	they obviously had a glitch in their website , but they couldn_'_t take the time to check to see for themselves .
negative	i have ordered 00 days ago , i don_'_t receive my order yet .
negative	when you call you need to wait like 00_minutes .
negative	still_waiting for its email_telling_me when i '_m going to have the tracking_number .
negative	i think i '_ll call my credit_card and do the charge back , i didn_'_t receive anything but they already charged on it .
negative	don_'_t buy here .
negative	i had purchased several vouchers from wowcher and never had cause to complain until recently .
negative	i purchased a voucher for miabella bar in soho that was absolutely awful .
negative	i may aswell have thrown my money down the drain .
negative	when i emailed wowcher about it , i received an indirect response whereby they forwarded my complaint ( including my personal contact details ) to miabella and copied me in .
negative	i chased wowcher several_times over 0_weeks for a response as to why they had forwarded on my personal details without my permission and a response to my initial complaint .
negative	eventually i received a defensive response from wowcher as to why my personal details had been forwarded to miabella but i never did receive a response from wowcher to my complaint regarding miabella .
negative	there poor customer_service has tainted my view of wowcher and they have lost my trust .
negative	i am very hesitant to purchase any more vouchers without looking into in thoroughly first - which there is not always time to do with the short deadline deals .
negative	i also receive emails from similar providers , who i do still trust , so i usually delete the wowcher emails now , unless it is something amazing that catches my eye .
negative	i also no_longer forward wowcher deals on to anyone as i would not want to be responsible for someone_else going through the same poor experience .
negative	this could have been avoided had wowcher responded directly to me in good time , with an_apology , a promise to investigate and a possible offer of compensation .
negative	i will not ever use traveliocity again .
negative	charged my account twice when the flights were never 00 dollarsked because they called the next_day and stated flight prices increased by
negative	i would not recommend this to a friend nor would i ever call back to make a reservation with this company
negative	so lange alles glatt geht , ist_es ok , aber sollten mal probleme sein , kann_man den kundenservice vergessen !!!
negative	total unzuverlässig und welzen alles von sich ab !
negative	außerdem wartet man monate bis sie einem antworten !
negative	groupon ist da viel besser !!!
negative	hatte dort noch nie ein problem .
negative	bei dailydeal ständig .
negative	habe im dezember mit vorauskasse bezahlt und nie etwas erhalten .
negative	ich_werde immer_wieder vertroestet , da sie die_ware angeblich nicht auf lager haben .
negative	man wird mit plumpen emails abgespeist .
negative	eine frechheit .
negative	sicher nie wieder !
negative	und schon gar nicht vorauskasse .
negative	this order was posted on metro site as being delivered but it was not received .
negative	no shipping message is sent so you do not get a usps tracking_number .
negative	have sent e_- mails back to metro and have not heard_anything yet .
negative	not very responsive to delivery issues
negative	the tour itself was pretty good but it was ruined by the fact that we booked on - line and were unable to print our tickets - i don_'_t carry a portable printer .... we took our tickets on our i - pad and credit_card to show the ticketing officer at the tower_bridge who refused to let us go on the tour because the tickets hadn_'_t been printed .
negative	we wasted more than half an_hour while we tried to find a booking number and then he had to confirm it with his office .
negative	the guy was extremely_rude and was really not helpful at all .
negative	in the world of e_- tickets there are two errors here ... the company needs to get up with the times and accept this sort of evidence but also the tickets themselves should have the booking reference on them .
negative	we missed the changing of the guards so it just became a bus_ride ... i wouldn_'_t recommend it ..
negative	i hate paypal .
negative	i got in a muddle when i moved_house and changed e_- mail addresses - it seemed impossible to get paypal to recognise that i needed to start again , so i ended_up not being_able to access my old account and not being_able to set_up a new one .
negative	there doesn_'_t seem any way to contact paypal to sort it out .
negative	last time i tried to pay for something it looked as tho they had changed the way they do things , but i was so cross after what happened i doubt i will use them again .
negative	i ordered a book for school from them .
negative	after almost 0_weeks i finally contacted them via online_chat because you cant call them anywhere and was told that they didn_'_t have the book .
negative	even the day i contacted them their automated_system said that they were still preparing the order for shipment .
negative	you better not depend_on this book store unless you really don_'_t need the book for a purpose other than pleasure .
negative	ordered a fridge_freezer with a 00 working day delivery date .
negative	on the eighth working day phoned and asked when i was going to get the delivery , told they would contact me after making enquiries .
negative	no contact .
negative	phoned again two_days_later ( on the 00th working day ) to be told it had not even left the suppliers despite it saying on line it had been dispatched and they had taken my money the day after i placed the order .
negative	now cancelled and asked for a refund as going on holiday .
negative	don_'_t use john_lewis , even_though it maybe cheaper or a better guarantee its a terrible service .
negative	i have used appliances on line twice previously and been happy with the service , i will be using them again for my new fridge_freezer .
negative	good job there is still some life in my ten year_old fridge_freezer , i predict it has more that john_lewis will have in the future if the poor service continues .
negative	scored 0_star as no option for a zero .
negative	john_lewis !!!!!!!!!
negative	never again
negative	shipping took at_least 0_weeks .
negative	when i finally got my order it was the correct product .
negative	i wanted to return it because i no_longer have the car .
negative	i e_- mailed the site to return the product .
negative	you only have 00 days .
negative	by the time i finally got my order & e_- mailed the site it was 00 days .
negative	no one from the company ever contacted me .
negative	i would not order from them .
negative	i tried to correct order within 0 minutes of placing it on line and no one responded to my email until a week_later .
negative	at that time they told me it was in the process of being made and they would charge me 0 / 0 of what it cost just to fix my order .
negative	i now have a necklace with the wrong initials that i had to throw in the trash .
negative	must be soneone just making them out of their home because i also could not reach them by phone .
negative	beware !!!
negative	!
negative	i '_m still weit for this supplement .
negative	by_far the worst customer_service of any place i have purchased products .
negative	no one returns phone_calls .
negative	they have very few products actually in stock so everything takes a long time for delivery .
negative	and don_'_t even think about cancelling an order .
negative	we asked that they cancel a product that had not shipped .
negative	we cancelled the order because we couldn_'_t wait any longer because it was causing delays in our project .
negative	and they actually insisted they had to ship it and then we had to return at our expense .
negative	i used the portal from the billmelater website to get the promotional 0 % cashback - and i don_'_t know if that was the problem or it was the bookit website itself - but it took_forever to get from one field to the next to fill_out the form - and i gave up yesterday trying to get this in .
negative	today i did wait it out ( again , took_forever ) and when it was almost all done and i validated it didn_'_t seem to want to advance to the confirmation page - did it go through , am i getting charged or do i have to start all over ?
negative	if i start over , will i end up getting billed_twice ?
negative	not sure if i would bother for the 0 % cashback again unless i felt there was an upgrade here .
negative	i did try a different computer at one point yesterday so it wasn_'_t the computer .
negative	i read the reviews online at 0 different sites .
negative	almost everyone complained_about this company being a rip_off .
negative	i read 0 reviews that were positive .. omg no one had anything good to say .
negative	i am worried that when my policy become effective that i would loose my money .
negative	i am not sure that i chose the right company .
negative	i bought this company for peace of mind on my rental property that is out of state .
negative	wow !
negative	thinking i will cancel my policy and look for another company .
negative	horrible experience ever .... false_advertising and bad customer_service .
negative	i booked their 0_star mystery hotel and it was not a 0_star at all .
negative	tried to contact customer_service and they were no help and rude .
negative	stating that it was a 0_star on all the sites they looked up but the rep could not give me the names were she pulled this information .
negative	contacted hotel before arrival and the hotel did not know their star_rating either .
negative	we arrive the hotel was far from a 0_star more like a 0_star !
negative	the hotel had empty beer cans all over the parking_lot .
negative	it had 0 full beds not queen .
negative	there was a number carved into the nightstand , holes in the carpet , curtains had some type of hair all over them and wrinkled , mildew in the bathroom walls by tub , tv was for the early 0000s or late 00s and paint splatter on light fixtures and door knobs .
negative	the days inn near riverwalk / downtown area is far from a 0_star and bookit should be ashamed of themselves for deceiving customers .
negative	i have booked similar circumstances with [_external reference_] before and have never had an_issue .
negative	they also rate the hotels and provided you with hotels as stated .
negative	i cannot say this for bookit !
negative	i would highly_recommend you book with someone_else !
negative	i would give them zero_stars if possible but i cannot .
negative	ordered one part 0 came had to send one back ... could not speak to a person about this ,,, had to fill_out a return ticket get a number follow many different instructions . and pay out of my pocket to return a item , i did not even order . very very disappointed have ordered many things on line and your company has the worst return_policy i have ever come_across ... 00 dollars to send back a 00_dollar part plus a restocking_fee ... what a joke i feel_stupid ,,,, i will never order from partsgeek , com again never
negative	i found several mistakes even in basic words .
negative	you would expect that the person that is going to translate your grades is somebody who translate taking_care of the context .
negative	it seems to be translated by google not by a person .
negative	you don_'_t seem to care or pay_attention to the details .
negative	even the grades in several cases were wrong .
negative	for example my grade was 0 . 0 and you wrote 0 . 0 .
negative	i '_m glad i understand_english and can compare the original documents with the documents you translated .
negative	what would happen if somebody who doesn_'_t speak_english blindly trust in your services and send it without a previous revision ?
negative	arrived late after being quoted 0 - 0 business days and was sent two different sized shoes , neither of which was even the size i ordered .
negative	also something nasty was squished into the sole so had been worn .
negative	only 0 pair of ordered shoes turned_up too , so goodness knows_how long they '_ll be .
negative	i will never buy from here again .
negative	disappointed and annoyed .
negative	now got to try and send back but the return_slip has a big sticker all over the part i have to fill in !
negative	frankly unbelievable in the shoddiness .
negative	i was pleased with dolphin_fitness price for eskimo sharp capsules but ordering was like pulling_teeth .
negative	i waznted 0 bottles .
negative	i received one by post a few_days_later another and despite my frantic calls and emails to say definitely not liqid as that was coming up on my screen - six more ( not 0 ) bottles of liquid eskimo sharp turned_up in a broken box badly packed .
negative	i rang and asked if they could be collected and was told they don_'_t give that service and it would cost me £ 0 to return .
negative	i frepacked them properly and it cost me £_00 . 00 to return .
negative	not only did i not get these capsules cheaper now but i had too much hassel and disappointgment .
negative	never again !!!!
negative	!
negative	one item that i received was damaged .
negative	i filled out the return paperwork and sent the item back .
negative	they refused my package and sent it back to me .
negative	i emailed them and they said to send a picture of the damaged item in order to verify it is damaged ( who does that ?!?)
negative	then i sent a picture and never_heard from them again .
negative	no refund of shipping_costs , no refund for the item .
negative	i '_m left with the junk .
negative	there stuff is cheap , but it is cheap quality and not worth the hassle !
negative	i was very mad because the part was the wrong one and i tryed and tryed and couldn_'_t contact anyone to return it i will never order from you again
negative	you really do pay for what you get : cheap fabric and horrible customer_service .
negative	they will happily accept your money , but once they take your money , forget about customer_satisfaction .
negative	totally vc style .
negative	they don_'_t ever answer emails even_though they claim to do so .
negative	when you speak to them on the phone , the females rant on in this loud and squeaky high voice like they are yelling at you .
negative	very unprofessional and rude .
negative	i ordered in march and did not get my dresses until may .
negative	when i did receive them , the dresses were not the right color and the sleeves were sewn wrong .
negative	if they had checked their emails and orders , they would have seen the changes i needed to have done to the dresses .
negative	and if they did read those emails ( and not reply ) and realized that those changes were not possible , they did not even have the professional decency to email me back and let_me know that the changes were impossible .
negative	instead , they just threw together what they thought would work .
negative	don_'_t buy from them unless you ' re looking for something cheap and you can deal with the loud high squeaky , annoying voices .
negative	disappointed that i only just got the item ad the it was reduced in sale , when i complained they were not interested .
negative	i had ordered flowers for my mum back home in england on the 00th_jan .
negative	i was told that despite my request for delivery on the 00th , it wouldn_'_t be until the 00th .
negative	after not having heard from my mum all day i went to the live_chat to find out not only had they not been delivered , they had not let_me know , they had no earthly clue where the flowers were , and they weren_'_t able to try again until the 00th .
negative	when i told him it was unacceptable he told me i should have chosen and different delivery option .
negative	why would you have the option on the website if it '_s no good .
negative	i told him where i work the if we mess up the customer gets there money back and and free delivery .
negative	they said that wasn_'_t possible told me i would have my money back in 00 working days and proceeded to ignore me .
negative	that '_s fine , i will eventually get my money back ( though i have read cases where they wont even do that ) and go to moonpig . com , amazing service and beautiful flowers !
negative	i bought a simple item a keychain .
negative	the quality was that of . 00 item !
negative	i will never trust to buy from this company ever again .
negative	i received my part within days .
negative	the part was damaged .
negative	i wrote twice and asked for someone to call me .
negative	no one ever called .
negative	i had to return a part that was damaged and pay the shipping charge and insurance fee to return it .
negative	the cost to return something that was sent to and was useless upon its arrival never should have been my burden to bear .
negative	you have no exchange_policy , which_means i now have to wait for you to credit my visa so i will have enough money to purchase the part again .
negative	this leaves me with a vehicle for what did you say it can be -- up to 00 days .
negative	thanks for nothing .
negative	dump .
negative	scary , dirty .
negative	left immediately .
negative	no excuse for a national chain allowing aplastic e like this to be open .
negative	sign on the gate to the pool stated " people with active diaharrea should not enter the pool ."
negative	buyer_beware !
negative	i bout the e gift_card so my son could use it right_away .
negative	he has had it for more than a week and can '_t spend it anywhere .
negative	he '_s even tried to spend it online with another merchant to purchase one of their gift_cards and the charge has_been processing for more than 00_hours because wal - mart can '_t verify the card yet .
negative	i won_'_t ever purchase an e_- gift_card again .
negative	jeg_havde desværre ikke set tidligere besked herinde .
negative	men har og_er ude for det samme nu !!!
negative	har_bestilt og rykket utallige gange uden svar .
negative	de_har trukket pengene få_dage_efter bestilling .
negative	kan_kun sige handel ikke her !
negative	ordered product , paid a " priority fee " in addition to $_00 for overnight shipping .
negative	received product 0 days_later .
negative	no replies to my request for partial_refund if shipping fees ( happy to pay regular shipping , since that is what i received . )
negative	also said free gift_wrapping which_meant they put in another plain box .
negative	very disappointed and won_'_t recommend or purchase from them again .
negative	the flight was cancelled and we didn_'_t know this til we got to the airport .
negative	i realize the airline has the right to do so but for you to not notify me is unacceptable .!!!
negative	will never use your site again to make travel_plans .
negative	never !
negative	!
negative	i had to cancel my flight due to sickness and it cost me 0 euro to speak to customer_service .
negative	they then sent me an_email_saying i would relieve no refund , even_though the airline had a refund policy .
negative	i emailed bravo_fly again twice and received no response .
negative	useless .
negative	as we tried to put the 0 ink_refills into my printer , they leaked excessively all over our hands and made a mess and would not fit into the printer well .
negative	i was very displeased and cannot use the ink at all .
negative	will never buy from them again !
negative	operator did not reserve the room i requsted .
negative	i asked several_times for a suite and he assured_me that he booked one .....
negative	terrible - they added hidden extra_fees on my flight bookings .
negative	i will never use them again !
negative	sucked .
negative	ended_up making a reservation on expedia
negative	i called to make a reservation for the same day , actually for about 0 minutes later .
negative	i informed the operator that my bf was there in the parking_lot and needed a room for the night .
negative	he went inside once he received the confirmation code via_email .
negative	when he went inside to to check in he was told the reservation was made for the following_day .
negative	he called me and informed me the reservation was not correct .
negative	i call the reservation number to get this corrected .
negative	i spent over an_hour trying to get this correct and was put on hold and given the run_around .
negative	it was after midnight and he sat and waited in the hotel_lobby while i tried with all i had to get this corrected .
negative	the operator gave_me one excuse after another .
negative	never never again will i use this service .
negative	would you believe !!!
negative	i waited 00_minutes after i called for the red lion shuttle at dia and they said they ran every half_hour .
negative	shame on them !
negative	!
negative	was quite unhappy with our purchase .
negative	the item arrived , looking nothing like the picture .
negative	tiny little directions ( which seemed to have nothing to do with the puzzles !
negative	)... and a terrible return_policy .
negative	you asked for a review so you get one !
negative	we '_ll , been waiting 0_weeks and have gotten no credible answer to where my catalytic_converter is in the world !
negative	ordered 0 gaskets and a catalytic_converter that is 00 " long .
negative	received an 0 " x 00 " bubble mailer with the 0 gaskets , but the label on the outside said 0 package and included both gaskets and converter .
negative	still no good answer to where my part is and when to expect it .
negative	so_far , poor customer_service .
negative	holding out hope to hear some credible info on monday or tuesday .
negative	i placed an order on 0th_december , i '_m still_waiting for my lenses nearly 0_weeks_later .
negative	this is simply not good enough , if you haven_'_t placed an order with them yet i would strongly_recommend not doing so .
negative	i was an_avid priceline user until their customer_service and hotel grading has_become horrendous .
negative	i travel quite bit alone , with my kids and with my husband .
negative	priceline has always been my go to site .
negative	my last three experiences have pushed me to no_longer go the priceline route .
negative	they have classified a three star ( pushing it ) as a four_star twice , have claimed that if i raised my bid $ 0 . 00 i could secure the hotel , to later find the same hotel on their site for $ 0 . 00 a night less and most recently put my husband and nephew in a room where they had to share a double_bed .
negative	not even a king !!!
negative	when we called they stated that by law we were given the options that we were agreed to , ie .
negative	sleeping accommodations for two .
negative	it is my opinion that they have gotten so big that customer_service is no_longer a part of their ' big picture '.
negative	how disappointing .
negative	i would not recommend that you use them unless you do not care at all what hotel you will be saying in .
negative	warning : never order from this company !
negative	i placed an order with expedited next - day delivery .
negative	a few_days_later , i contacted them because i had not received any shipping confirmation , despite their website '_s statement that orders are shipped within_00hrs and usually by the next business day .
negative	the sales_rep was impolite and completely unhelpful .
negative	another week_later , still no confirmation .
negative	i contacted the company again and asked to cancel the order .
negative	they informed me that i would have to pay a 00_% fee - that ' d be like $_00 !
negative	so i told them not to cancel .
negative	time went by ..... a few_weeks_later , the glasses finally showed_up along with the full charges on my credit_card .
negative	i never did receive a shipping confirmation as_promised .
negative	completely_unacceptable - particularly when i paid for expedited_shipping !!
negative	!
negative	my card was not delivered , i wasn_'_t notified that it wasn_'_t delivered , recipient called me and i asked about it and she knew nothing , i called 0 times and nothing was done , the third time i called i was told that was the email they had on file and they couldn_'_t do anything about it .
negative	that '_s when i notified google ( be sure to check that box ) and within 00_minutes she had her gift_card ( this was 0_weeks after her_birthday ).
negative	will not use this site again !
negative	i bought a whole set for my hp_printer .
negative	great price .
negative	when they came i opened the black cartage and ink poured out of it all over me and my clothes will never buy from here again !!
negative	!
negative	i wanted to visit my brother '_s family for christmas and i knew the ticket was going to cost me about $_000 .
negative	i decided to use the " name your own price tool " to try and save what i thought would be about $_00 ( which is not the advertised 00_% more like 00 %).
negative	frontier . com was offering the ticket at $_000 and i put a bid on priceline down for $_000 .
negative	the tool requested i choose an_alternative airport to fly into and as i was making my choice i selected and then deselected a secondary airport when i decided_against it .
negative	priceline accepted my bid but had me flying out of the airport i had not wanted .
negative	when i called to cancel the ticket ( expecting a refund with maybe a $_00 - 00 $ fee for the error priceline charged me a $_00 fee for the ticket processing , $_00 for the change fee and $_000 to hold my ticket until i purchased another ticket from them .
negative	had i booked through the airline_directly i would have had a $ zero fee for changing within 00_hours ... which is standard across all airlines i have come_across .
negative	i will never do_business with priceline again and i will never recommend their service .
negative	when i called to see if the situation could be corrected the representative was rude and spoke over my concerns and basically told me this was my fault and i was stupid .
negative	avoid priceline !
negative	the airlines offer the same deal priceline does and they wont hold your $ hostage or extort money from you if there is a mistake in your ticket that you fix with in the first 00_minutes of the purchase .
negative	also , there reps tend to treat customers with respect as they are aware there are other_places you can purchase tickets .
negative	a month after ordering , i still had not received my filters .
negative	i contact them and was told they shipped the was provided a tracking_number , when i looked up the tracking_number , they had made it to the post_office but were returned .
negative	i contacted them again , and was told they were damaged in shipping and new ones would be sent .
negative	the next contact i made i was told they were sent back because they didn_'_t have my address - how the heck to you ship something without an address and how did they make it to my city without an address ?
negative	i provided my address again .
negative	next contact i made i was told the delay was due to being behind in production , the final contact i was told again that they hadn_'_t shipped because they didn_'_t have my address .
negative	pretty sure i '_m not going to be ordering through this place again , even_though i have a hard to find size and they had several to choose from .
negative	just don_'_t feel they were being completely honest with me .
negative	" horrible communication , as in emails that went unresponded .
negative	horrible business_practices , such as project costing $_00 more than estimate ( 000_% more ).
negative	bad customer_service such as calling customer_service and being told i should just email , being sent to a voicemail i couldn_'_t get out of .
negative	and to top it off the actual sunglasses lenses they master crafted for me looked nothing like the original one i sent in .
negative	they are too light , the gradient feature looks budget , and now the whole sunglasses are unwearable as they look cheap ."
negative	i wish i could award no stars ... but alas , i cannot .
negative	i was initially happy with the quotes for my books .
negative	however , when ziffit received them they marked 0 large ones as ' water - damaged '.
negative	this is absolute and utter rubbish , they were is good if not very good condition .
negative	of course ' due to their policy ' they do not return the books to you .
negative	use this site with caution !
negative	i would not recommend and if i am honest i think it is very shady behaviour .
negative	i placed an order for 0 separate gift_cards on dec . 00th .
negative	i paid for usps delivery confirmation that is supposed to take 0 - 0 business days .
negative	well , today is dec . 00st and i still do not have my gift_cards .
negative	these are christmas_gifts that were supposed to be mailed to another_state after i received them .
negative	well , now i '_m screwed and will have three children that do not have anything to open on christmas day from their aunt .
negative	i called last night to see where my gift_cards are and was told they " should " arrive the day before christmas .
negative	what a joke !
negative	i am so dissappointed in this company and cannot_believe_how long this is taking to receive my order .
negative	i asked to be refunded for the shipping i paid for and was told there is nothing they could do for me and i would have to call back monday .
negative	they cannot even tell you for sure where your order is and when you will be receiving it .
negative	they just give you an estimated day - well that day has_been changed 0 times and still no gift_cards .
negative	i will never order from this company again .
negative	called to make a reservation and someone picked_up the phone , but obviously didn_'_t realilze it .
negative	i had to speak loudly into to phone , but still no answer .
negative	he was speaking another language to a co - worker and again i spoke louder into the phone to get someone '_s attention and asked for someone to speak_english .
negative	waited another 00 seconds and finally hung_up .
negative	what a disaster !
negative	going with amazon from here on out
negative	i made a hotel reservation .
negative	on the initial page , it said the reservation was refundable , but on the page where you put your info , it said unrefundable .
negative	i didn_'_t notice until after i had paid .
negative	i made a mistake in the package i needed .
negative	i did call immediately after making this mistake ., but they were closed , because they are in europe and 0 time zones away .
negative	i called when they said they were open the next_day a few_times , but only got a recording and ringing and no one answered .
negative	i emailed and got an answer at_least a week_later that i could cancel but no refund .
negative	most travel agencies i work with forgive mistakes if contacted right_away , so i am disappointed that they don_'_t , but understand that after the website said it was refundable , it did change to unrefundable by the time i registered .
negative	so they are within their rules .
negative	i really wondered_if they were a real travel_agency .
negative	purtroppo dopo i primi ordini andati a buon fine , mi ritrovo con_un annullamento e un rimborso in sospeso da agosto !!!!!!!!!!
negative	! hanno detto che_ci volevano 00 giorni .. che sono passati da un mese e più ... continuo a mandare mail ma senza nessuna risposta !!!!
negative	la data che appare nella recensione e ' 0000 , ma il questo e ' accaduto ad agosto 0000 , con annullamento ordine 0 settembre ....
negative	ordered 0 pairs off shoes in sale both size 0 .
negative	one pair was way to small and the other pair badly made .
negative	returned the smaller pair and still_waiting for some confirmation of refund .
negative	first time used site and will not use again .
negative	i ordered some flowers to be delivered to my mother in law .
negative	as it is difficult to get flowers delivered on a sunday i asked that they be delivered on a saturday .
negative	i did not look at my emails over the weekend but on monday_morning received an_email ( dated saturday the intended day of delivery ) to say that they could not fulfill the order .
negative	other_websites clearly said that flowers could not be delivered on the weekend i wanted but teleflorist . ie said they could fulfil the order .
negative	it resulted in my mother in law receiving no flowers for mothers_day .
negative	i then received an_email_asking to ' voice my opinion ' - hillarious !
negative	!
negative	i placed an order the end of december .
negative	i received an_email_telling_me the product was back ordered , but i did not receive an anticipated date of when it would arrive .
negative	i sent an_email to the provided customer_service email address and it took a week to receive a reply .
negative	when i did receive the reply it was missing words , which made it difficult to understand , and looked very unprofessional .
negative	i was given a date as to when a new shipment would arrive .
negative	when this day came and went , i sent an_email inquiring_about my order and if the shipment had been received .
negative	i never got a reply .
negative	so i called .
negative	i was then given a date a couple weeks away .
negative	when that date came and went i called again .
negative	i was told that the item had arrived ( why was i not contacted ?)
negative	and because it had been over 00 days since my original order , it would have to be re - ordered .
negative	so we did that , and as the customer_service rep was about to hang up , i asked if the original payment was still able to be used .
negative	he checked , and sure enough , needed the info again since it had been so long .
negative	" good thing you said something ," he replied .
negative	i received the item a few_days_later , and i was very excited since by this time i had been waiting for 0_weeks .
negative	my excitement turned to extreme frustration when i opened the box and found that somebody_else '_s name was engraved on it !
negative	i had to call three_times to get through and explain the situation to yet another customer_service rep .
negative	i am now waiting - again - for a new one to be sent to me with my name_engraved on it , as well as a return shipping label to send back the one i received .
negative	so i am now at over 0_weeks and have not received the item i ordered .
negative	extremely frustrating .
negative	i would never recommend this company .
negative	i ordered a gift_card on dec 00 and i have still not received it ( january 00 ).
negative	it has_been almost two_weeks since i placed my order .
negative	there is no sign of the package ... when i contact customer_service i am told that there is no tracking data for international shipments .
negative	i have never_heard of such a thing before .
negative	all international courier companies including national postal services have a tracking service .
negative	i find it quite strange that this company takes your money and has no regard for the delivery of the products sold .
negative	this is terribly unfair to the customer .
negative	a sale is not complete unless the client receives his service and product !
negative	this company has a whole range of delaying tactics including offering discounts for dresses that do not fit .
negative	be wary .
negative	they have no intentions of giving you your money back even when the dresses they provide are not the size ordered
negative	they are scam artists .
negative	i am trying to get over_£_000 back fr three dresses that are all different_sizes from the sizes i ordered .
negative	go to the internet before you esk buying from this company
negative	one week_later still_waiting for delivery .
negative	i didn_'_t make a purchase
negative	i '_m so disappointed that this company continues to ship out of date merchandise that should have been removed from their stock shelves .
negative	this is the third time they have shipped me out of date product .
negative	i hope they discontinue this practice .
negative	i ordered a monogram_necklace on 00 / 00 and still have not received it .
negative	i know that it was supposedly shipped on 00 / 00 , but i can '_t imagine it taking that long to arrive .
negative	i emailed the company , the only way to contact them , and have still received no reply after more than 00_hours .
negative	since i was sent no tracking_number , i have no way of knowing whether i should go get a new gift before christmas .
negative	i am so disappointed with this company !!
negative	my daughter will be heartbroken .
negative	i guess legal_action is next .
negative	good thing i am married to a lawyer !
negative	booku flight last night and after i clearly selected the flight i want , they change it back to another flight once i submitted my payment .
negative	i call customer_service and they said there is nothing they can do .
negative	i would to cancel the whole trip and rebook it using another card because it will take 0 to 00 business to get my money back .
negative	if i had a extra $_000_dollars laying_around i would have not book with them in the first place .
negative	i haven_'_t even went on my trip yet and i '_m haven_'_t a bad_experience .
negative	the postage and packaging was high , the light_bulbs arrived already used and dirty .
negative	rubbish
negative	size guide was terrible and wrong , had to send it back .
negative	very high prices for the poor quality you get , i could probably whip something up in 0 minutes better_than this rubbish .
negative	standard delivery took longer_than said and you also have to pay for a return , so basically i '_ve lost about £_00 for it to be sent to me and then return it .
negative	just don_'_t even let it cross your mind to buy from this site .
negative	i purchased two airline_tickets about 0 months in advance !
negative	that was the longest and most frustrating 0 months ever !!!!
negative	almost every other week i got a call or email_saying my flight had been changed and to call to make corrections !
negative	problem is most the time the " corrections " were not that !
negative	they would tell me that there are no other flights that they can change it to or that they could only get a flight two_days_later !
negative	what are they supposed to do just sit in the airport for 0 days !
negative	or i would tell customer_service my problem and they would say " can i get your number to call you back within 00_hours " and they beer would .
negative	i had to cancel my flights not once but twice and rebook them !!!
negative	after i rebooked the first time i still had problems !!!
negative	in the end , i had to call all the seperate airlines and correct the problem myself .
negative	while we were out of the country on vacation i constantly worried that something would happen to their return flight and i wouldn_'_t be able to call anyone !!!
negative	just horrible !!!
negative	they had me in tears on multiple_occasions that i couldn_'_t handle it anymore .
negative	i had my mom 0 way with me so she could help me to deal with the customer_service or lack there of .
negative	just be persistent if this happens to you ... p . s .
negative	travelocity out sources their customer_service representatives so sometimes you can '_t even understand them ...
negative	this website scams money from homest people trying to buy or sell tickets for popular events .
negative	they trick you into paying for tickets by bank_transfer instead of credit_card or by sending spare tickets before payment , then don_'_t supply tickets or steal the tickets you send .
negative	don_'_t use this company !!!!!
negative	!
negative	did not receive product .
negative	i '_m still_waiting for delivery !!!!!
negative	can '_t say noting about .
negative	just after i revive my order ....
negative	going to be more den 0_weeks i place the order !!
negative	!
negative	total bs friend recommended and the trial didn_'_t give access to score or report .
negative	i would not recommend identiy guard to anyone
negative	reservation screwed_up front day one .
negative	never again .
negative	i was very upset that i was quoted an unrealistic price .
negative	when i contacted the actual place , i was told that using your service didnt help me because your company does not know the real prices .
negative	they would not honor the quote stating that the amount to move in was $_00 more than the quoted price of $_00 .
negative	i was very dissapointed .
negative	i think that your agency should research the real rate including insurance taxes and fees and quote a more realistic rate .
negative	this is the second time i have used this company .
negative	the first time i ordered 0 x panacur kitten wormer and only received 0 ( still_waiting for the refund ) and the second time i ordered 0 x pro plan kitten_food , which again they failed to deliver as ' they had none in stock ' but still displayed it on their website .
negative	it will take a lot to make me shop with this company again .
negative	not at all impressed .
negative	i ordered my hamper 00 days ago and it '_s unacceptable that it still_hasn_'_t arrived .
negative	i did email diet_chef and they said in effect that they were very busy with orders ... not good enough .
negative	i ordered mine in good faith and paid my p_& p , so i '_m really not impressed .
negative	some time ago i received an_email inviting a first box trial from cocoa_boutique at the price of 0 . 00 which seemed good value .
negative	when i went to their website to order i could not place it successfully and so rang them and completed and paid for the order over the phone .
negative	as requested when the chocolates were all finished i sent them in the post my views on each chocolate .
negative	imagine my surprise when a month later i noticed a further sum of 00 . 00 had been taken from my account by cocoa_boutique .
negative	chocolates arrived in the post .
negative	i contacted them to say i had not ordered more and wanted a refund as the money they had taken from my account was not authorised by me .
negative	after several emails and telephone conversations they told me they would have a telephone record of the order but for some_reason it never materialised !!!
negative	they then told me that on line i had signed_up to repeat orders , which was totally incorrect as i could not order on their website as i have stated above .
negative	so they refused the refund and even_though i took the time to write a letter to dominic farriley it met with a completely negative response .
negative	so i was stuck with chocolates i didnt want and had not ordered and 00 . 00 taken from my account !!
negative	i spoke to trading_standards who had advised me to write to them .
negative	i wrote again and asked that they exercise their money back guarantee but i have finally received a letter to say that this is now out of date !!
negative	!
negative	really do beware of this company , they will not accept genuine customer complaints .
negative	real chocolate lovers will realise that their offerings are really quite basic .
negative	couple that with the poor responses and really bad customer_service and why would anyone want to patronise them !
negative	i note that cocoa_boutique have responded and would say this :
negative	the response from cocoa_boutique is both unfair and untrue .
negative	i could not complete the order on line which is why i had to ring to do this .
negative	why else would i have to place such a call ?
negative	neither is this about getting my own way , it really is about bringing to notice that things went wrong on this occasion and you took money out of my account without such authorisation and then failed to return it .
negative	there was an_error with your website at the time of ordering and you really should be prepared to accept this !!
negative	the public need to be aware of how you deal with things as well .
negative	a further note from me : i have seen the review from sue beer 0 days ago [ today is 00th_dec 0000_] that has some similarities to my own .
negative	customers beware this company , there are much_better places that care for their customers as sue beer says and also provide much_better chocolates .
negative	i have ordered a size 0 shoe from boohoo which fitted_perfectly , i ordered another shoe in a size 0 which was incredibly small in the toe area .
negative	i couldn_'_t find a phone_number to contact anyone to talk about the situation .
negative	i emailed twice and sent a letter with my returned item including my telephone_number .
negative	as these shoes were for xmas , i paid £_00 for next_day delivery to return the shoes , and i wanted to pay for a redelivery of a bigger_size .
negative	unbeknown to me , ( as you don_'_t have a customer_service telephone_number ) this wasn_'_t possible .
negative	so i wasted £_00 for next_day delivery , and had to wait days for a reply to my email .
negative	i didn_'_t want a refund , i just wanted the shoes .
negative	i don_'_t see why it would have been so hard to get a size 0 , and call me to arrange a redelivery which i would have paid for .
negative	very disappointed with the service , and i can safely say i will not be ordering again .
negative	me and my fiance ordered wedding_invitations .
negative	items were not only late but damaged when they arrived .
negative	they were packaged in a box that was far too small for them , we promptly got in touch with them and they were rude and were telling us we had to pay to send them back and we would only get the refund of the unit cost ( now after already paying shipping and duty this was unacceptable ).
negative	they eventually agreed to refund the full costs we paid however have now only given a partial_refund and i yet again have had to contact them .
negative	they do not give coherent responses and i am completely and utterly shocked at the service i have received .
negative	i would not recommend them to anyone .
negative	i received a follow - up email about my stay and filled out pricelines review of my hotel stay ... my review was not posted ( as i am sure many others were not , as if were i never would have booked hotel )
negative	my email to priceline : i booked a hotel in florence sc ( travel inn ) though priceline , and was very dissatisfied with it .
negative	i received your email_asking me to review hotel , which i took time to do .
negative	review is not showing up .
negative	why ?
negative	why would my review not show ?
negative	because it was bad ?
negative	i wish i had been warned that this hotel was nothing like pictured .
negative	and now it is appearing like priceline only puts favorable or semifavorable reviews ?
negative	i will think_twice before ever using your service and forward my complaints to my brother in law , who uses priceline all the time and told me to use .
negative	i would appriciate a response as to why my comments were not posted on my horrible stay .
negative	i was trying to warn_others the hotel and area could potentially put their families in a dangerous situation as we were put into unknowingly .
negative	priceline response :
negative	thank_you for taking the time to send us an e_- mail .
negative	we understand that
negative	you are dissatisfied with your reservation at the travel inn florence
negative	and that your review were not posted .
negative	we apologize if you are dissatisfied with our service .
negative	customers are our
negative	number one priority , and we work hard to make your experience with us a
negative	positive one .
negative	your feedback is appreciated .
negative	when you filled out your survey , we disclosed that your review of your
negative	recent hotel stay may be posted on our website ; however , we did not
negative	guarantee that it will be posted .
negative	all reviews are first read by the
negative	appropriate department , and then they will decide which reviews to post .
negative	please_note that we do update reviews frequently , and encourage you to
negative	check back often to inquire if your review has_been posted or not .
negative	once again , we apologize for the inconvenience and hope you find this
negative	information helpful .
negative	sincerely ,
negative	varis k .
negative	customer_service specialist
negative	our family was approached twice at this hotel by " groups " of people dealing drugs and / or setting us up to rob us --- i wanted this posted to warn_others but priceline did not ...
negative	they must be getting " giant " kickback from travel inn in florence sc for not posting negative_reviews
negative	being a long_term , regular customer i placed an order and received the confirmation emails as usual .
negative	as i did not receive the order after a week i called customer_service and was told they would get accounts to call me as there seemed to be some issue .
negative	i asked why i had not been informed that was order was being held over and was told accounts would call me .
negative	i did not get a call just a very curt email_telling_me a previous invoice has not yet been paid and orders will be held over until payment is received .
negative	this practice is fine as long as the information is passed on .
negative	do not send confirmation emails if there is an_issue and contact the customer by phone when you say you will !!
negative	!
negative	paid over $_00 to have two debit_cards sent to my daughter for christmas , it was unnecessary and what i consider price gouging for christmas .
negative	the gift_cards did not arrive until the day after christmas .
negative	i will not ever buy from you again .
negative	i ordered glasses on sept 00 , the order was listed as complete with a tracking_number on oct 0 , however when you click the tracking_number it says that no information is available and usps just basically states that they were notified to expect the package but does not confirm whether or not they received the package .
negative	today is oct 00 and i still have not relieved my package though i was charged for it .
negative	i have called the company twice and they cannot confirm whether the package actually shipped .
negative	or why there is no tracking update for it .
negative	and if it didnt ship , they still cant tell me why .
negative	they promised a response back within_00hrs - never happened .
negative	so at this point though i do need the package , i just want a full_refund .
negative	i received an item that isn_'_t even close to what i ordered .
negative	now they want me to go through a long drawn out process to return it .
negative	you made the mistake , you fix it !
negative	that '_s the bottom_line .
negative	i shouldn_'_t have to pay for your mistakes .
negative	i already paid you my money .
negative	books took_forever to arrive ...
negative	i should have paid the extra $ and bought directly from school_bookstore ... delay in delivery resulted in failed exams and ultimately the need to withdraw from one of my courses ...
negative	so , i saved $ on the book ...
negative	but ... now have to pay again to retake course .
negative	at_least i already have the book for next_semester ... let '_s just hope they font change editions in january !
negative	i think the packages the books come in is horrible .
negative	the books are squeezed into these flimsy brown packing that it is just ridiculous .
negative	packing should at_least be a box or something that is much more sturdy .
negative	please refer to what your competitors use like chegg , bookrenter , collegebookrenter ... etc .
negative	we are paying for renting that the company can at_least provide a better packing system .
negative	sham , ripoff , thieves , and fake store front !!!!!!
negative	i bought my hubby a new hard_drive from them .
negative	they took my money and never sent me my item .
negative	i emailed them , they said they didn_'_t have the hard_drive would reimburse_me our money , never happened .
negative	i called , and emailed with no response , so i called bbb and called my bank and they did a fraud report with them .
negative	thanks to my great bank i got my money back but the bank and bbb still have yet to get their money back or even hear back from them .
negative	they sent letters in the mail , emailed and called nothing .
negative	sham ripoff thieves and fake !!!!!
negative	!
negative	avoid using hostelbookers . com for your hotel bookings .
negative	it '_s out of london , and their business is not run by honest people .
negative	i had made reservations through hostelbookers for 0 days in a hotel in italy .
negative	they charged me a fee of 00_euros .
negative	they made a mistake and later when i caught it i simply requested them to rebook my reservations .
negative	they told me i would have to pay the fees again !!
negative	i refused and booked with another service .
negative	and despite my numerous_calls and emails to london office , hostelbookers never returned my money .
negative	down with dishonest business like hostelbookers .
negative	i had asked for blue and gray as the two imprint colors .
negative	this is what was depicted in the image i sent .
negative	someone decided to use blue and silver instead and the text was completely unreadable .
negative	i am very disappointed as this was a promotional product and our company '_s name is half invisible .
negative	we will not be distributing this item .
negative	i will not order from this company again .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	i ordered 0 sunglasses in the last_week of march , it is now mid april and i have still not received my order .
negative	i emailed frames_direct enquiring what is taking so long and have not received a reply .
negative	i have not been contacted by i parcel or anything and i have no contact details for i parcel either to chase them up on it .
negative	i can_honestly say i will never be buying any frames from frames_direct again and will_definitely not be recommending this site .
negative	at this point in time , i just want my money back .
negative	i ordered several radiators .
negative	one arrived quickly directly from the manufacturer but had to chase the balance of the order as i had arranged for a plumber to fit them .
negative	a further 0 arrived just in time but the final item didn_'_t .
negative	i was then told it was out of stock .
negative	a replacement was offered but this was not suitable so i asked for my money back .
negative	i '_m still_waiting for credit with little communication_regarding this issue and failed promises to call back with answers .
negative	ordered online on a wednesday for delivery on a friday .
negative	.. following_monday and still no notification or contact have requested cancellation to order as too late now ordered iyems from wilco same day several updates on how order progressing and collected on the saturday much_better
negative	i spent $_000 on clothes from them .
negative	i used a promo_code which only took about $ 0 off each item .
negative	it took 0 whole weeks to ship to me .
negative	i wanted to return $_00 worth of things and they wouldn_'_t let_me because of the promo_code even_though it didn_'_t say anywhere on the website that it would be marked as final sale and i wouldn_'_t be able to return it .
negative	i kept telling them i spent $_000 and was a good customer but they wouldnt have it .
negative	they were very rude and inconsiderate .
negative	i even talked to joseph m . ( wouldnt give me last name because he knew i would report him ) who was the supervisor of customer_service and he was extremely_rude and kept interrupting me .
negative	these people do not know business .
negative	if you have a customer who spends a lot of money on their products , you should do what you can to keep their business and not throw it away .
negative	they wouldn_'_t even consider giving me money back even after it took them twice as long to send me my clothes .
negative	do not shop_here .
negative	joseph m is a horrible customer_service supervisor .
negative	he wouldn_'_t give me his last name because he knew i would report him .
negative	even said so himself .
negative	i was looking_forward to seeing my dog in his new bed .
negative	this comes in several different designs .
negative	i ordered the whale .
negative	however much to my dismay i received an_email_stating that this design was backordered and not shipped .
negative	my account was credited the amount .
negative	i was not asked if i wanted a different design .
negative	so very , very disappointed .
negative	they say they will match any price .
negative	not true .
negative	i gave them a price of 00 . 00 and the website that was advertising that price and i was charged 00 . 00 .
negative	i will never shop_here again and will make_sure none of family or friends do either .
negative	hello ,
negative	i recently booked flights on travelosity and when i received the itinerary from your and the airline each itinerary has different flight departures how am i suppose to know which one is correct ?
negative	wished i had opened it before giving to someone or i would have sent it back .
negative	sherpa cover for a chair ... so thin and poor quality not comfortable at all !!
negative	!
negative	the people who answer for your call_center are so very rude an the most snottiest people i have ever talked to , they seem as if they have no interest in what the customer has to say or needs , i will never ever order from you guys again .... im sorry but i order online a lot from various stores , i have never dealt_with such rude people until now .... sorry but i have passed the word to all my friends who i once gloated to them about you guys , that you are not worth the time .....
negative	i hope that this changes ...
negative	when i first called the consultant said " days inn " correct .
negative	and i said " no , sleep inn on the beach ."
negative	he confirmed that he had that hotel pulled_up on his screen and he still booked for the wrong hotel in a town 00_miles_away from where i was .
negative	then after getting a room at the correct hotel , i was first told that i would not get a refund because it was less_than 00_hours to check - in .
negative	after i got upset with the next consultant because the mistake was his and not mine , they finally agreed to refund my money .
negative	also , which probably a big part of the problem , none of the people i talked to spoke fluent english .
negative	i contacted the help multiple_times in regards on how i could receive a refund because i wanted to cancel an order which had already shipped .
negative	i only got the same response on how to send the shipment back and receive the refund when the company got the item back .
negative	it would have worked if i had gotten my order in the first place .
negative	no product and no refund .
negative	i will not recommended in the future .
negative	i mistakenly used an old street address on my order which was discovered when i contacted the service department of europarts .
negative	they were very gracious and resent the part to me ....
negative	purchased two items , 0 okay , the other wrong part , part was inexpensive but they what you to pay for shipping back to them in the box they sent it in .
negative	and i wish i would have taken pics of that !
negative	easier to keep part .
negative	the lack of customer_service and the lag time makes a bad situation even worse !
negative	by from an up standing company i . e .
negative	j . c . whitney or the like , thus company sucks !
negative	i purchased 0 airline_tickets through priceline with insurance .
negative	the airline refunded the ticket cost , due to the plane was not safe !!!
negative	spirit_airlines .
negative	they are not safe to fly with .
negative	but they did refund my money .
negative	priceline will not refund the 0 x $_00 . 00 = $_00 . 00 .
negative	it is against their policy .
negative	it '_s not against their policy to screw someone out of their money .
negative	i also found that you can get the same price as they do for airline_tickets , even cheaper .
negative	they keep saying non_refundable !!
negative	nothing is non_- refundable .
negative	you take it , you can give it back .
negative	i will never use them again .
negative	thanks for steeling my money priceline .
negative	it cost you more then you made .
negative	i have friends that fly all the time and use priceline because i book their flights through priceline .
negative	i did , but not anymore !!
negative	!
negative	paint order accepted online with delivery given as ' within 0 days '.
negative	more than 0 days_later and no paint has arrived .
negative	waited in telephone queue for over 00_minutes only to be told that the paint was out of stock and they were unable to fulfill the order .
negative	now unable to get paint in time for decorator to start in next few_days .
negative	surely it must be possible for a company like homebase to have a website that does not accept orders for out of stock items ?
negative	or at the very least to email a customer to advise that the item is out of stock .
negative	inefficient and unacceptable - in my opinion !
negative	suggest you shop elsewhere .
negative	i ordered food that was prescribed by my vet .
negative	pet_flow faxed a form to get verification and when my vet did not respond , pet_flow did not follow - up .
negative	a week_later i went on the website to find out why i had not received the food .
negative	i had to then call pet_flow to get an answer .
negative	i was told that the vet didn_'_t verify and i needed to call the vet .
negative	i told the agent to please follow_up with the vet as the whole point of pet_flow is the convenience .
negative	meanwhile , my dog has had to eat food that is making him sick because pet_flow did not follow - up .
negative	i used pet_flow because i didn_'_t have time to be calling , verifying and picking_up an order .
negative	as is turns_out , i would have had the food faster with less hassle if i had just gotten it at the vet .
negative	vorsicht bei buchungen über rentalcars . com !
negative	die firma versteckt wesentliche einschränkungen und extrakosten in der buchungsbestätigung bzw .
negative	in den agb , ohne darauf im buchungsprozess angemessen hinzuweisen .
negative	dazu zählt z . b ., dass_man das fahrzeug vor rückgabe nicht volltanken soll , weil die betankung von_der vermietstation vorgenommen wird und einem dafür die kosten einer kompletten tankfüllung berechnet werden .
negative	bei einem suv in den usa sind das schnell 00_dollar unnötige extrakosten , die nicht im ursprünglichen mietpreis reflektiert sind .
negative	und wer will es schon darauf anlegen , mit_dem letzten tropfen sprit zur vermietstation zurück zu rollen .
negative	fazit : es gibt jede menge anderer auto - buchungs - sites , die klarer und ehrlicher sind - geht dahin !
negative	i booked this service but would not book it again !
negative	the flight was advanced by one hour days before , and i sent emails to advise and called twice to get them to confirm the change by email - but got not reply .
negative	in the end that bit worked ok , they had personnel to collect the car one hour earlier , but i had also paid for a car wash and guess what .... they didn_'_t do it !
negative	i called and was told to send an_email and the money would be refunded .
negative	i sent two emails but no reply !
negative	pretty poor show .....
negative	i tried to make a reservation online , but never did get an e_- mail verification nor was my credit_card charged .
negative	i called travelocity and they could not find a reservation for me , so they told me to do another reservation .
negative	the next_day both reservations showed_up on the credit_card -- the first one never showed_up with an e_- mail verification .
negative	i called at_least 0 times and was on hold for over an_hour several_times .
negative	after holding forever , i was hung_up on every time .
negative	no one knew what to do to help me .
negative	most of the people just said i would have to pay for both tickets .
negative	after 0 hours of working on this , i finally got a supervise \ or who helped_me resolve it .
negative	who has 0 hours to waste talking to people who have no_idea of what to do ?
negative	i am not prejudiced at all , but it must be hard for non_- english speakers to understand some situations .
negative	i purchased 00 tickets for an_upcoming dodger game , price of each ticket was $_00 plus over $_00 fee for each ticket .
negative	face value of ticket is $_00 .
negative	this should not be allowed .
negative	go directly to the team website when buying tickets , at_least you get what you pay for that way .
negative	cheaptickets is disgusting !!!!
negative	!
negative	i was billed for two rooms although i only reserved one - my confirmation verified only a single room .
negative	help number places you on hold for an indefinite period of time .
negative	expect over an_hour before your call is even answered .
negative	this is my first and last experience with reservation_counter .
negative	i don_'_t have the time to waste on hold .
negative	i ordered some filing trays from shima - uma and i was sent the wrong ones .
negative	i emailed to say i had received the wrong order and i never had a reply .
negative	in the end i had to make do .
negative	i deserve a refund because the trays they sent me were a lot cheaper_than the ones i ordered but nobody ever got back to me and in the end i had to give up .
negative	i would never use this company again .
negative	ordered my part for my car .
negative	got the conformation for it .
negative	never got the part went online to see what was going on .
negative	it said the order status is order canceled .
negative	emailed the company to find out whats going on and no response .
negative	what a great company you run .
negative	haha !
negative	i read the reviews on trust_pilot and thought i will give it a shot to unlock my iphone 0 locked to att and has a clean imei .
negative	it has_been 0_weeks but my phone is still locked .
negative	i tried contacting keys0iphone customer_service 0 or 0 times but never got a reply .
negative	it has_been a frustrating experience .
negative	now my time and money is wasted .
negative	how come everyone who is writing the reviews are saying they are getting their phone unlocked within days and customer_service is top_notch but mine is still not unlocked and didn_'_t even get a reply for any of my emails .
negative	this makes me think there is something fishy with the reviews .
negative	i think your prices are great , however there is no support in selceting the correct auto_parts .
negative	god forbid , you should purchase a part as i did based on the yr , make and car model and it turns_out to be incorrect as it happened to me .
negative	you are then stuck , waiting for someone from parts_geek to get back to you so that you make get a tracking_number in order to return the part .
negative	you are instruicted to wait for someopne to call you so you may get a tracking_number for your return which will not be accepted if you do not have the assigned tracking_number .
negative	meanwhile the clock is ticking and your 00 days pas then you definately cannot return the part for refund because its way past 00 days .
negative	i do not think i will use this service again .
negative	it just does not happen
negative	we ordered a set of desks from this company .
negative	firstly , they put back the delivery date which caused us some inconvenience , but we coped .
negative	when the desks finally arrived , 0 arrived in perfect order , but the ergonomic one was provided with a totally different back leg than the one in the picture .
negative	apparently , and i quote , " the images given on our site are to be used as a guide only and can vary slightly ", however , " slightly " is a big misreprentation .
negative	the leg we had was not only completely different in style - it was also way too short to support the desk .
negative	we were sent a different screw fitting for the foot to sort the problem only this made the desk way too unstable .
negative	we then were sent a new leg which was no good as it didnt allow use of the cable management .
negative	finally , we were sent another leg - nothing like the one in the picture , but that seemed to be all they were willing to send .
negative	i was not offered anything in the way of compensation , even when asked and it was always up to me to call to find out what was going on .
negative	not once did office furniture online ring me .
negative	the desk supplier caused a lot of hassle , when arranging for each leg to be sent and i spent too many hours waiting in for deliveries that never came .
negative	the whole fiasco caused us wasted time of over 00 weeks from the time of ordering to when the desk were finally able to be used properly .
negative	office furniture online seem to get great feedback , but for office chairs , therefore , if you want anything different from that - i would most certainly go elsewhere unless you like making constant phonecalls and having your time wasted .
negative	company offered false_advertisement to get the customer to book the reservations .
negative	i booked my room when i reached the hotel the room i requested was not available and i was told that its a first come basis .
negative	when i asked to cancel due to me not being satisfied i was told i booked through your company and needed to contact you for a refund .
negative	i was irate never again will i make that hugh mistake
negative	i purchased a sweater from superdry . com to give to my boyfriend as a christmas_present .
negative	when the sweater arrived and he tried it on , the arms were too tight .
negative	after_reading about your online exchange_policy , i decided to just take him to one of your retail_stores in new_york and i bought the same sweater in a bigger_size there .
negative	since then , i have tried to return the sweater that i purchased online , which has_been an extremely frustrating process .
negative	superdry has the worst return and exchange_policy and customer_service .
negative	i do not understand_why i cannot return a product that i bought online to your retail_stores .
negative	it is very inconvenient .
negative	furthermore , in order to return the product to your “ online store ,” i need to pay for the packaging to send the product in , the postage , and registered mail .
negative	for anyone returning a product from outside of the u . k ., this is extremely expensive .
negative	in this day and age when everything , including retail , is online , and when so many businesses offer free , no_hassle return / exchange policies , your business model is a huge deterrent to people to shop at superdry . com .
negative	anyways , i go through this whole_process to try to return the sweater .
negative	i mailed the package on 0 / 00 / 00 and it arrived in the u . k . on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	i have been waiting for superdry to process the return and credit my account .
negative	but on 0 / 0 / 00 , i found out that the package was unclaimed for some_reason and is now being sent back to me .
negative	i called your customer_service representative , who was completely unhelpful – she said that she could not contact the warehouse and there was no way for her to find out what went wrong .
negative	she then accused me that it is my responsibility to return a product properly to superdry .
negative	if your employee is unable to figure_out the problem , is the customer supposed to go to your warehouse and solve it for you ?
negative	i already bought special packaging for the item so that it would not be damaged during shipment , mailed the package , and tracked it – all of which cost a fortune – should i hand deliver the package to ensure that it is delivered to you ?
negative	i called usps to investigate the issue , and its representative told me that usps had delivered the package but no one was able to receive it .
negative	then i called your customer_service representative again to tell her that the package was delivered , but the conversation was basically unproductive .
negative	now that the package is en_route to be returned to me , i will have to pay for the postage and registered mail , again , to ship it back to you .
negative	in addition , it is now past your return_policy deadline , even_though i tried to return the item way before the deadline .
negative	this whole ordeal could have been an easy process , but instead it has cost me way too much money and wasted a lot of my time .
negative	i had a terrible hotel experience in using priceline .
negative	i tried to handle the issue directly with the hotel and got nowhere .
negative	so i contacted priceline and they said that they would contact the hotel and ask for a resolution .
negative	the hotel refused to find resolution and priceline stated in the future to call them and they would help resolve .
negative	so fast forward 0 months and priceline books me back to the same hotel i had issue with previously .
negative	i called customer care to ask for my reservation to be changed and was told it was policy that they couldn_'_t change or cancel my reservation .
negative	i asked what could they do to satisfy my concerns and bottom_line .... nothing !!!
negative	went up the chain of command ( call_center not in us ), and got read the same thing over and over by other priceline reps .
negative	i '_m done with their company and their service .
negative	while you can get a decent price using their service be warned that they have no control or latitude in keeping a customer satisfied in a bad situation .
negative	you decide if a lower price is worth it to you .
negative	i received part of the order .
negative	was charged for entire order .
negative	even the products not shipped .
negative	the packing_list did not list any backorders .
negative	not cool .
negative	i called the company to inquire_about the item not shipped .. was told it was on backorder and should ship in a couple of weeks .
negative	i '_ve always had trouble with fedex being slow but not this slow !
negative	my package was supposed to be here 0 days ago according to the delivery date .
negative	the first day the excuse was bad_weather , which i understood it was somewhat blizzard conditions .
negative	the next few_days went by same excuse , except for the weather was clear , roads clear , no_problems .
negative	this is where i became majorly frustrated since the package was only an_hour away .
negative	i called customer_service today and they ensured me that it would be here today .
negative	waited all day , a fedex_truck did come but it was for a different package .
negative	called customer_service and they said it was bad_weather again !!!
negative	( it was clear out again ) and to top it all off they couldn_'_t give me even one good reason_why this package wasn_'_t delivered with the other one earlier .
negative	i guess we '_ll see if it comes tomorrow !
negative	my advise to everyone , don_'_t use fedex , it only leads to disappointment .
negative	i purchased a trip via your site because i could reserve car , flight and hotel together .
negative	due to weather issues in sc , the flight was cancelled .
negative	it took 0 hours before someone said that they could get me a flight but a supervisor had to call back .
negative	i got no call and all flights were cancelled again .
negative	i called again and was told i could get on a flight for saturday ( original flight was on thursday ).
negative	once again , i was told a supervisor would have to call back .
negative	i got no call and all flights were cancelled again .
negative	this time , united just rescheduled the flight but by that time i would have missed the event i was flying out for .
negative	the cancellations were bad enough but your agents were hit and miss .
negative	i was hung_up on several_times and lied to about the supervisor overrides .
negative	i work in a call_center and our word is our bond .
negative	if i promise something to a customer , i deliver .
negative	i expect the same from other businesses .
negative	they are trying to give me money to solicit a positive review from me , i ' d prefer to sacrifice that and tell the truth .
negative	sent in $_000 pair of revo for frame solder .
negative	they have a better business_bureau rating of " f " on a scale of a + to f .
negative	quoted 0 day turn_around , took 00 days .
negative	paid for 0nd air return shipping , but was sent back via us mail rattling around in a box with no padding or protection .
negative	called in 0 times for status , after very long hold times was hung_up 0 times , the other 0 i left a message and never_heard back .
negative	0 attempts to get a status via_email , responded 0 times with " in lab " and no eta .
negative	eventual repair seems adequate , lenses not put in quite right ; under no circumstances will i ever conduct_business with them again .
negative	very disappointed with my order .
negative	i ordered three books that they listed as having 000 of and then i get an_email_saying your order is cancelled there are none .
negative	very poor way to do_business .
negative	if you don_'_t have it , don_'_t advertise you do .
negative	after a horrible experience with both the expedia site ( website malfunction ) and customer_service , i decided to cancel the reservation .
negative	i was within the first 00_hours , so according to expedia policy i was able to cancel with no fees .
negative	the customer_service rep confirmed this , and then confirmed the refund amount , which was explained would be credited in two amounts ( one for hotel , one for flight ).
negative	total refund : $ 0 , 000 . 00
negative	refund pt .
negative	0 :$ 0 , 000 . 00
negative	refund pt .
negative	0 : $ 0 , 000 . 00
negative	thinking everything was resolved , i later received an odd voice_mail from expedia .
negative	the woman on the phone said they were sorry they couldn_'_t get in touch with me , and she was calling about my refund amount .
negative	then , without providing any instructions about if i need to call back and without_leaving a call back number , she hung_up .
negative	so , i checked my credit_card statement , and i noticed that my refund was incorrect .
negative	i received two refund amounts : $ 0 , 000 . 00 & $ 0 , 000 . 00 .
negative	anyone with any basic concept of addition and subtraction could figure_out that $ 0 , 000 . 00 + $ 0 , 000 . 00 does not equal $ 0 , 000 . 00 .
negative	so , i checked my emails again , and sure enough the confirmation_email for my cancellation indicated the incorrect amount .
negative	back to the customer_service line .
negative	the woman i spoke to was nice enough , but after explaining my issue , she kept_repeating that " the refund has_been processed ".
negative	ok .
negative	yes .
negative	i know .
negative	it took over an_hour of waiting on hold while she consulted a supervisor for her to come_back and say , " you used a coupon ".
negative	yes .
negative	i did use a coupon , but as all coupons work , the amount is deducted before the amount you are charged .
negative	i even have the email_confirmation from when i booked that reads :
negative	" flight + hotel $ 0 , 000 . 00
negative	coupon applied -$_000 . 00
negative	total price $ 0 , 000 . 00 "
negative	which i explained again , and the woman was nice enough to forward me the cancellation receipt she had on her screen :
negative	" subject : expedia refund receipt
negative	here are the details of your refund :
negative	date of refund : 0 / 0 / 0000
negative	total refund : $ 0 , 000 . 00
negative	amount :
negative	$ 0 , 000 . 00
negative	$ 0 , 000 . 00 "
negative	ok . now we are getting somewhere .... i thought .
negative	i explained again how what she sent me is correct information , however , those are not the amounts i received as a refund .
negative	so , she transferred me to the supervisor , who at first suffered from the same .... lack of elementary math education .... but then noticed ..." there was a glitch "... aha !
negative	so , after a few_minutes of waiting for their system to load ( which he also said was very slow ), it seemed like my issue was resolved .
negative	i thanked_him and hung_up .
negative	0 days_later ... i notice my $_000 credit is still not posted .
negative	so , i call back .
negative	the first call says there is an_hour wait , so i request a call back .
negative	when i answer , it is static air , so i hang up .
negative	i get called back again , and press 0 to speak to a representative , wait for a few_minutes only to be hung_up on .
negative	sigh .
negative	i call back , but now the wait is 0 hours .
negative	fine .
negative	request a call back .
negative	same thing happens .
negative	dead air on the first attempt , then on the second attempt i miraculously get connected to a person .
negative	yay .
negative	i tell her i want to check on the status of my refund .
negative	she goes through the same lines again .
negative	how she sees i was refunded $ 0 , 000 . 00 on 0 / 0 / 0000 .
negative	sigh .
negative	i explain again .
negative	again , she brings up this coupon .
negative	so , i explain again , and mention i spoke to a supervisor 0 days ago and was assured it had been resolved .
negative	she says she has to put me on hold for possibly 00_mins to an_hour due to the weather causing a large volume of calls , so she can consult with a supervisor , but she can '_t do a call back , so i don_'_t have to sit and wait again to resolve something that should have already been handled .
negative	fine .
negative	i wait .
negative	after 00_minutes i am abruptly greeted_by a man ( albert ), who says " you requested to speak to a supervisor for clarification about our refund policy ".
negative	now , i am beginning to lose my cool .
negative	i tell him , " no , i am calling to resolve an_error regarding a refund i should have received ."
negative	so , again he mentions this freaking coupon .
negative	i explain again that the coupon is not the issue .
negative	the issue is that i was supposed to receive a refund for the amount i paid , $ 0 , 000 . 00 , but i only received $ 0 , 000 . 00 , so i am missing $_000 .
negative	i also mentioned my conversation with the other supervisor from 0 days prior , as well as all of the emails i have , which detail the amount i should have received and the amount i was actually refunded .
negative	he then in a very condescending tone says , " fine i will give you the $_000 .
negative	is that what you want ?"
negative	have you ever_seen a movie , where they briefly show a picture of an atomic bomb exploding to visually symbolize how angry someone in the movie became ?
negative	that was me .
negative	i couldn_'_t take it anymore .
negative	not only did every customer_service rep i spoke to confirm what i was trying to explain ( without actually understanding it ), this man then tried to go and make me feel_guilty for asking him to do his job , accept responsibility for expedia '_s error and fix it .
negative	in a raised voice ( but without defamation or profanity ), i told him that is not what i want .
negative	i want expedia to fix their error , and i don_'_t appreciate being accused of seeking something , to which i was not entitled .
negative	expedia is at fault , not me .
negative	if the person_who processed my refund originally made a mistake ( i . e .
negative	subtracting a coupon of $_000 from my refund ), that is ok , just fix it now .
negative	this level of incompetence and unprofessionalism that i encountered with expedia is unparalleled .
negative	i even told albert that i have already written about my experience on consumer affairs , and i would be writing to expedia '_s president and would be mentioning him by name .
negative	( by the way i have never tried to escalate an_issue this far , and i don_'_t even normally_write_reviews online .)
negative	he said " thank_you " in a facetious tone .
negative	no wonder expedia hasn_'_t responded to the email i sent about my issue , or to the responses i gave in the customer_satisfaction survey .
negative	from top to bottom , it is clearly ingrained in their corporate culture to not care about their customers .
negative	i don_'_t_believe the saying " the customer is always right ", but when the customer is right it is the expectation of the customer that you will fix the problem .
negative	if a class action could be started for the abysmal customer_service that expedia puts out there , i would have no_qualms about being rewarded . 00_cents ( or whatever it is class members get these days ) just so expedia could be exposed for their complete and utter disregard of properly treating customers .
negative	( side_note : i am still_waiting for my $_000 .
negative	i have a receipt from expedia that i should be getting it .
negative	in the meantime , i have let my credit_card company know , so one way or another i will not rest until this is resolved .)
negative	your prices are , in some cases the same as , and in other cases much higher_than the local target , meijer and walmart .
negative	that is before shipping_charges .
negative	doesn_'_t make any sense , what is the advantage to ordering from you ?
negative	not so good online service
negative	where do i start ,,,,,,, we bought a kampa oxwich 0 tent in may this year , we booked a weeks holiday in july and was looking_forward to our trip .
negative	the second day of the trip we had quite a bit of rain and our tent leaked along the front under the zip , we had to gather up our airbed and covers along with extention cable and electrical_goods and go back home to dry them out and get dry bedding etc and return to finish our holiday . i emailed kampa so they were aware of the problem and was sent an_email back from them to say although they make the tent our email should have been sent to camping_world as we purchased the tent from them . we continued with our holiday a bit dissapointed about the rain leaking through our tent . then on night 0 of our trip we had the same heavy down pour of rain we were worried_about the tent leaking so on this occasion we moved all our belongings into the middle of the tent just_incase like the first downpour the rain wet our goods again .
negative	this time the rain poured through the same place as the first time and the windows of the tent to , so i took video evidence of this and sent it to [_name ] from camping_world .
negative	he wrote back saying it leaked due to the needle being bigger_than the thread they use to stich the tent and it needs to leak up to 0 times before it becomes 000_% waterproof , and it has to be weathered before i used it .
negative	no where in the instruction booklet does it say any of this . it sounded unbeleivable so i wrote to the makers again ( kampa ) and they confirmed that this wasnt true . so i wrote to [_name ] again asking for a new tent to replace the leaking one they had sold me he offered me a tin of waterproof sealent for us to waterproof the tent ourselves , to which i refused .
negative	i bought a waterproof tent it shouldnt have had these leaks in the first place . so to cut a very long_story a bit shorter i had to end up going to see trading_standards who adviced me of my rights and now i have sent the tent back to camping_world , but that was on 0th_september and they havent replyed to any email i have sent or phone_call i have made to them asking what is happening with my tent . today is monday 00st october and i still havent heard_anything from camping_world . im sick to the back teeth of them ignoring me . the last email i sent was wednesday the 00th_october to ask if someone would kindly let_me no what was going on , but im still_waiting for a reply .
negative	i have had the tent since may and have used it on one occasion its now end of camping season and could have used the tent on many more occasions that only the once .
negative	camping_world thought they were doing me a favour when they offered me a half price canopy for the front of the tent so it wouldnt leak again ,,,,, it shouldnt have leaked in the first place and i certanly shouldnt have to pay for a canopy to stop it leaking again ..... kampa are just as useless as camping_world they wont help me either as ive asked them to before .
negative	i want my money refunded all £_000 . 00 of it so i could go to a reputable_company and buy another tent that is fit for the purpose that i bought it for .
negative	trying to get into my account in response to my account credit has_been lookied into i am unable to reach by phone or pressing on message to open my account activity .
negative	not feeling very secure that i cannot verify who is looking into my credit
negative	please respond
negative	i got an_email a week_ago saying our items had been dispatched yet they still_haven_'_t arrived .
negative	when i came to the site , i was under the impression i was booking a reservation directly with the hilton company .
negative	i was unaware that it was reservation_counter .
negative	this was due to the fact that reservation_counter led me to believe that i was working directly with hilton .
negative	they portrayed themselves as such .
negative	if i had known they were not hilton , i would not have booked with them ... and that is why they fraudulently portrayed themselves as a different company .
negative	most people , if they knew the site was not directly hilton , would not book through it , so they deceive you in order to gain your business .
negative	the entire experience has_been appalling , and i further intend to contact the better business_bureau in the hopes that they may be able to shed some light on these deceptive practices .
negative	i ordered 0 collars for both my dogs for the fact that i wanted them for safety ..
negative	i have had these collars for 0 days now and they are falling_apart and i am so upset ..
negative	i live in an area that if you are not illuminated in so way someone can potentially run my dogs over when being walked and never mind the safety of my husband .
negative	they are falling_apart already and the lights fell out of the collars that is annoying so therefore after my purchase not a week_later no thank_you it looks as though i will once again walk with a flashlight for all our well being ..
negative	i ordered a part , rec ' d the wrong item .
negative	i called the company but every time i called , they were experiencing a high_volume of calls and said it would be faster to submit a support_ticket .
negative	not the case at all !
negative	takes a couple of days to respond and when they did they said i was responsible for the return shipping ???
negative	for their error ?
negative	so you need to reply again and a couple days_later got " you need to call the dealer for the correct_part number " ???
negative	i ordered the correct_part , they sent something completely different .
negative	replied a third time , a couple days_later said ups will pick_up " sometime " next week ??
negative	?
negative	i have purchased a jar of organic wheatgrass powder which arrived with a broken lid .
negative	when i contacted the customer_service representative , she offered me a 00_%_discount if i ' d agree to keep the item .
negative	hellooo ?
negative	what a rubbish service !
negative	never again !
negative	i asked to have my order sent to another address , they ignored it and now my order won_'_t get to me until i get back from my vacation in three_weeks .
negative	i even e_- mailed them and left a phone message with my instructions again , and still no answer !
negative	i '_m not very happy with the service .
negative	lovely products at fantastic prices , can not believe the poor level off customer_service i received because of this i would prefer to spend my money eles where in future
negative	i placed an order with petflow and tried to use the 00_%_off coupon for the order .
negative	the coupon was not honored and even after_speaking to a rep nothing changed .
negative	this was a birthday_present for my grand dogs .
negative	i am quite disappointed .
negative	:(
negative	bad_experience .
negative	the first order i placed did not go through correctly but my card got charged .
negative	the second order to replace the first order went through but when i got my package someones elses order was in the box .
negative	the wrong shoes were sent to me .
negative	i sent them abck a week_ago and still have not recieved my refund .
negative	not good .
negative	they wouldn_'_t accept my credit_card and said that my bank was declining it .
negative	so i called the bank and had them on the phone while i tried again with still no success .
negative	they told me the card could have a 00 hour hold on it but even when i waited 00_hours it didn_'_t do anything .
negative	i tried about 0 or 0 times with that card until i finally gave up and used another .
negative	when i used the other card they did not give me any help in getting the books faster even_though they had failed to provide the service in the first place .
negative	not satisfied at all !
negative	not only did it take one month to get my glasses back , they didn_'_t do what they said they were going to do .
negative	they replaced the lens , but did not fix the alignment that i paid them extra to do .
negative	overpriced and slooooowww ... i won_'_t use them again !
negative	while i enjoyed the commentary on the bus , i was so disappointed that the bus dropped me off on 0 occasions not even close to my destination without_any direction .
negative	my children and i had to walk a considerable distance to buckingham_palace without_any directions given .
negative	similarly , i got off at embankment and was told it was beside the sherlock holmes pub ( which incidentally was 0 streets away ) again without_any directions given .
negative	whilst waiting for the bus to arrive for our next journey , a big_bus_tour_guide convinced us to buy tickets to see the tower of london .
negative	he was insistent that we had come all the way to london and shouldnt miss it .
negative	i felt really pressured .
negative	we took the free river_cruise to the tower only to find out it was due to close ( 0pm on a saturday ) had we been told this , we wouldn_'_t have paid the £_00 tickets .
negative	we decided to return on the river_cruise to south bank only to be turned away as the last boat of the evening was full .
negative	i would never recommend this tour to anyone .
negative	my eyeglasses were on back order multiple_times and by the time they finally arrived were not what i expected .
negative	when i called and spoke to representative and explained that they were the size of readers and not regular eyeglasses the rep told me i wanted the size 00 .
negative	again these eyeglasses were on back order multiple_times and once received still the size of readers .
negative	i called again and new rep told me that i should be looking at a completely different number .
negative	i have returned the second pair after almost 0 months of waiting for glasses .
negative	i think i '_ll just plan on going through eye_doctor and it will be well_worth spending more money than to deal with this frustration .
negative	you shouldn_'_t offer eyeglasses if they are always going to go on back order after you pay .
negative	terrible experience , worst delivery time , and poor customer_service .
negative	overall , not worth it .
negative	i '_ll just pay more .
negative	very misleading .
negative	i got the number from the hotel webpage and thought i was talking to the hotel .
negative	turns_out i was not .
negative	they quoted me a price and i decided to book .
negative	after they got my credit_card information , i was told it was a non_refundable rate .
negative	i said that i don_'_t want that .
negative	i basically had to fight with them for almost 0 hours to get a refund .
negative	i am still not even sure i will actually get a refund .
negative	i was disconnected several_times .
negative	i finally got the number to the actual hotel and they explained that i was talking to expedia , but when i contacted expedia , they had no_idea who reservation_counter was .
negative	i think this is just a scam !
negative	i was given the impression , by cash0books , that i would be receiving more for my book than i actually was .
negative	it would not have mattered to me , but it was a fairly large amount .
negative	i was not aware of the large difference until my book had already been sent and i was informed that my check had been printed for $ 0 . 00 instead of the $_00 i sent it in for .
negative	i would not trust cash0books in the future .
negative	travelocity advertised 000 off a vacation package .
negative	i entered a trip , entered the promo_code , which it showed the deduction , then saved it before booking .
negative	my husband wanted me to also add ground_transportation .
negative	i went back into the saved itinerary , tried to add it , but t would not let_me add it .
negative	i had to reenter everything again being sure to add the ground_transportation and the promo_code , which showed the promo_code deducted .
negative	when i put in credit_card info , it kicked off the deduction .
negative	i tried rendering the vacation again , nd it happened again , so i just figured i ' d just book it and call , which i did .
negative	theyaid the promo_code was good but it was entered on a different itinerary and there was nothing they could do since i already booked the trip .
negative	bunch of crap since it the first itinerary was never booked and i had to enter a new trip nice i couldn_'_t wait text original !
negative	called 0 times , took about 00_minutes each time to get through and each time customer_service person states they do see where the promo_code was good and they could see the issue .
negative	every time i was put on hold , the call disconnected .
negative	be very careful when booking with travelocity as the customer_service is very poor .
negative	as far as i '_m concerned , this was a glitch in their booking system and they are making me pay for it .
negative	unable to comment
negative	this seller is in he habit of accepting your order , charging payment and then making some delaying tactics not to send your order .
negative	i currently have an_issue about an item i ordered more than a week_ago .
negative	i placed an order for rayban eyglasses , they acknowledge and apparently process my order .
negative	but after the payment appeared in my bill , they put the status as " wait to be veriied " .
negative	according to them thiis is because their system flagged my order to be unauthorized .
negative	they asked me to send a scanned copy of my id which i immediately complied .
negative	they acknowledged my documents , but after that i never_heard from them inspite of sending them various emails .
negative	i finally cancelled my order and requesting to refund of my money but both their customer_service or service manager are continuously ignoring all my emails .
negative	a waste of my time writing any more
negative	awful customer_service , no one to contact in an_emergency .
negative	i ordered lego for a present on 00 / 00 / 00 from coolshop , on the 00 / 00 / 00 i had not received my order and emailed customer_services to ask when i could expect it .
negative	i received a reply on the 00 / 00 / 00 to advise my order was still in denmark and they could not understand_why but would get back to me when the postal office replied to them !
negative	i sent another email on 00 / 00 / 00 to ask what was happening did not hear back until 0 / 0 / 00 and was given a tracking_number and advised to check my order myself !!
negative	the order was delivered on 0 / 0 / 00 - the box was badly_damaged with a letter from parcel_force to advise the package and contents had been damaged prior to the package been received in the uk and i would need to take this up with the sender !!
negative	well after the awfull service i have already received i can only imagine that trying to sort this out is going to be a nightmare . lesson_learned under no circumstances will i use this website again or recommend it .
negative	customer_service complete joke !!
negative	!
negative	why would you offer something and then not giveyou the answer .
negative	i am in school and do not need information on another school just the scholarships and grants that you offered .
negative	thank_you for the horrible people calling me and then hanging up on me when they find out that i am already inschool .
negative	don_'_t advertise things that you will not offer me and sent me to something completely different .
negative	order a bottle of tequila that stated in stock , waited for 0 days and no emails , just order processing !!
negative	then when you phone put into a queue for a long time and told the item wasn_'_t held by themselves and were waiting for the item in the warehouse .
negative	0 more days_later item in warehouse and dispatched with tracking , but tracking link didn_'_t work .
negative	when item arrived poorly packed and also incorrect item , had to phone again in queue to be hung_up on three_times , item sent back with a promise of the correct item being sent .
negative	0 days_later my money was refunded so no tequila !!!!
negative	total time wasters avoid at all costs !!!

negative	i have purchased many sunglasses over the years through framesdirect .
negative	i have been very satisfied with my purchases , the ease of ordering and the speedy shipping .
negative	but , i recently_purchased some sunglasses that did not work for me .
negative	so , i returned them .
negative	i printed out a return_label and sent them back for a refund / credit .
negative	i was informed via a brief email that i had waited too long to return them due to their 00 day return_policy and that they would be sending them back to me because they could not honor my return .
negative	they were brand_new and never worn .
negative	i could not return them prior to 00 days due to having a cataract surgery .
negative	i returned them not much past 00 days ..
negative	i sent an_email to customer_service stating how disappointed i waw that i was not going to get a refund or at_least a credit .
negative	i did not receive a reply frrom customer_service .
negative	even if framesdirect was going to stick to their 00 - day return_policy , any company worth their salt would have responded to a disappointed customer ..
negative	i sent a second email to customer_service and again nothing .
negative	not even an acknowledgement that they received my complaint / email .
negative	i now have a different opinion of the company .
negative	i would rather purchase my sunglasses through sunglass hut or nordstrom '_s in the future , both of which have excellent and customer friendly return_policies .
negative	i will never purchase sunglasses from this company again .
negative	it is sad because i was a very loyal_customer over the years .
negative	terrible doesn_'_t not even describe_how awful this experience was .
negative	i ordered glasses and was charged for them only to be emailed a week_later to be told that the frames were cracked and then discontinued .
negative	i chose another pair of glasses three seperate times only to be told they didn_'_t have them to sell .
negative	they advertise things they do not actually have but will sure charge you for them .
negative	[_name removed_] is the worst person i have ever_dealt_with in customer_service .
negative	she is rude and even called me names .
negative	when i told her she was rude she told me it was in my head .
negative	now mind you i had just spent_hundreds of dollars at their store ... waited for weeks to get them ... and the order was wrong .
negative	then got on the internet to read that many many people had the same experience .
negative	don_'_t waste your time or money unless you are ready to be treated horribly .
negative	book resort thru priceline , tried to cancel cuz all the reps were stupid , wasted an 0hr w_/ them , tried to cancel an hr .
negative	later already there '_s a 00 . 00 cancellation_fee .
negative	kept the stupid reservation to avoid fee , called them the . 0 days before ( resort ) they couldn_'_t find me in the system .
negative	yep !
negative	thats right !!
negative	i called cust .
negative	ser .
negative	and a woman named lynn answered and then i called again and that same lady answered , what are the odds of that .
negative	book expedia !!
negative	its better in 000 ways !

negative	i ordered two_pairs of shoes through this company during the holiday on dec 00 , 0000 .
negative	one pair of the shoes was for a wedding i was to attend in march .
negative	well those shoes never arrived .
negative	i had to order two_pairs of shoes for the discount and when the other pair of shoes didn_'_t arrive they only credited my account .
negative	no offer of getting the shoes that never arrived that i needed and no communication about the credit to my account .
negative	which by the way didn_'_t get credited until march_0000 .
negative	very poor customer_service .
negative	i think they just don_'_t ship them so they don_'_t have to offer the discount to get two_pairs .
negative	then they make you wait for months to get any sort of accomodation .
negative	i even had to call them twice to get them moving on the credit .
negative	save your money and buy from someone_who guarantees their shipments and products .
negative	just awful !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	the quality of the frames i received is not good considering the price and make .
negative	very flimsy .
negative	the case does not match .
negative	the lenses are constantly smeary and almost_impossible to keep clean ( i paid_extra for anti_- glare but they are very reflective ).
negative	all in all i '_m very disappointed and would not buy from here again .
negative	so i make a reservation at this storage_facility , drive 00_hours from california to get there , i get there during the time the website says it is open an there is this little note on the gate that says they ' re not opening until 0 ... okay ?
negative	so i wait for 0 hours until its 0 an no one shows up ... i wait for like 00_minutes longer ad decided it was bs that no one was there and i called another storage_unit and went there instead .
negative	so unprofessional .
negative	i had to ring at_least 00 times regarding my order .
negative	i was told i would be rang back each time .
negative	nobody rang me back .
negative	i booked a flight to chicago early on this month to find out that the prices have dropped .
negative	very disappointed
negative	i thought i ' d save_money by buying inexpensive coil packs for my honda_crv and it ended_up costing me my arm and my leg !
negative	not only where my parts bad but i felt insulted when i ( out of sheer frustration ) complained_about the part and got an_email response that was insulting because it implied that i wasn_'_t being honest about the faulty coil pack !
negative	wow .
negative	talk about adding salt to the wound !
negative	as you can see my experience with partsgeek has_been a complete nightmare ,,, turns_out 0 of the three were bad so i '_m sending all back .
negative	word of advice partsgeek don_'_t sell inferior products and don_'_t accuse your customers of being dishonest !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	we have now been through the wringer trying to get the right textbooks .
negative	we placed an initial order with bookbyte and the order never showed_up .
negative	they did finally resolve it and send a new shipment .
negative	that took over two_weeks .
negative	when the replacement shipment arrived , they had mailed an instructor '_s copy for one of the textbooks , which is states on the front and back of the book is illegal to sell in any form .
negative	the workbook that we ordered was filled out in pen and pencil and totally of no use to us .
negative	so incredibly frustrated .
negative	they knew they were sending useless items to us and did it anyway .
negative	i made reservations for a fairfield_inn on central ave and the reservation was 00_minutes away at a different fairfield_inn .
negative	i tried to change it but everyone i talked to said i had to talk to someone_else .
negative	poor service all around .
negative	would not use again .
negative	when making a reservation , i would rather call the hotel direct ; however , if you do not know their direct phone_number , and you look on the internet , the only number available is to a booking_agency such as trustpilot .
negative	i made a reservation for 0 employees .
negative	the person i spoke with did not speak_english well and did not understand anything i said .
negative	i made the reservations for a motel in weston , west virginia .
negative	he kept saying virginia instead of west virginia .
negative	he finally got it right .
negative	when i received my confirmation , it said we were near blacksburg , virginia , which is about 0 hours away .
negative	terrible experience .
negative	i will not use this again !
negative	ill never forget it . was trying on heels in a forever00 size 0 and ask if it came in a 0 . 0 i was told we are out of 0 . 0 you should just get these size 0s .
negative	and that my foot was to fat for a 0 . 0 anyways .
negative	that was a year_ago and i have not been back and never will go back !
negative	all of there products are cheaper on other_sites . i called customer_service and when i finaly got someone on the phone and asked if they could match a price they just hung_up on me .
negative	what i hate most is they post shoes on fb then i spend an hr looking for it on the site , then 00 more mins on hold to have a customer_service girl tell me that those shoes wont be in for 0 months .
negative	what do they just take pictures at a shoe show and if it gets enough likes they order it ?
negative	- thanks for wasting my time
negative	this site has the right idea , but they need to figure_out how to make it cheaper .
negative	normal people and small companys cannot_afford use the best options the site has
negative	i dont get it , tomany people have to much time on there hands . people tweet about nothing at all and people still follow them ?
negative	am i missing something ?
negative	first of all these people want to charge you a fee for everytime you need assistance on the phone .
negative	i tried to cancel a hotel reservation on the phone and not sufficient with $_00 . 00 cancellation_fee if cancel a month before the date i '_m supposed to travel , this person_who " helped_me " on the phone tried to charge me a $_00 penalty for canceling .
negative	good thing i read the cancellation_policy if not he wouldve gotten away with that one .
negative	expedia doesn_'_t charge a cancellation_fee if you cancel ahead of time .
negative	it '_s a shame .
negative	i will never book anything with these people .
negative	booked on - line for tyre replacement at weston - super - mare .
negative	web_site stated ' enter car reg or tyre size '.
negative	i entered car reg .& my car came up .
negative	i was told it would take about 00_mins & i could wait & have a coffee .
negative	on arrival i was told it would take at_least an_hour & advised to go for a walk .
negative	no - one looked at the car nor asked for the wheel lock but i went back & checked - oh_yes they did need the wheel lock !
negative	after an_hour in the freezing_cold , i returned to find nothing had been done .
negative	apparently the wrong tyre size - my fault for not checking !
negative	no apology , very indifferent .
negative	said they could get the correct size but it would be more_expensive & i would have to wait .
negative	i asked why they didn_'_t phone me about the problem - shrugged her shoulders .
negative	simply didn_'_t care .
negative	too cold to hang about so i
negative	returned the following week only because i thought they were the cheapest .
negative	double_checked they had the correct size this time & knew which tyre to replace ( it wasn_'_t obvious ), left the wheel lock they didn_'_t ask for again for & asked them to put the old tyre on the spare wheel as it was still ok . & the existing spare was punctured .
negative	went back to walking in the cold , during which time they rang & asked which tyre needed replacing !
negative	collected the car & asked if the old tyre had been put on the spare wheel .
negative	' it was on the job sheet so it should have been done '.
negative	sod '_s law , a week_later i had a flat .
negative	called the emergency services - guess what , they hadn_'_t replaced the spare !!!
negative	i was lucky to escape a call out charge .
negative	halford '_s miserable receptionist had no_explanation nor apology but it was ok as it was ' probably ' still there if i ' d like to go along & collect it .
negative	not easy with a flat tyre !
negative	if i could give halfords a zero star_rating , i would .
negative	twice bitten - i used kwickfit who were not only excellent but cheaper .
negative	paypal is - outrageous , unreasonable and unfair !!
negative	i don_'_t recomend paypal to anyone .
negative	i added money from my bank_account into my paypal_account and now they limited my paypal_account , which mean i can '_t use my money and i can '_t send my money back into my bank_account where this money came from . paypal said they going to hold my money for 000 days and then they will let_me know what is next .
negative	do you see what happening ???
negative	they are going to hold my money , i '_m sure they going to make some interest on my money . i said to paypal if can '_t use my money , then send my money back into my bank_account where this money came from , and they said no .
negative	paypal i insist give my money back .
negative	send my money back into my bank_account !
negative	you have no right to hold my money for 000 days .
negative	i gave you my id driver licence , my bank_statements , confirmed all my bank accounts , my credit_card .
negative	paypal give my money back !!!!
negative	!
negative	you had taken my money out of my bank and you never even had the dress in stock , then it was 0days_later before i got my money back and that was because i got in touch with you because you never even got in touch to tell me the dress was out of stock it was so annoying as i was needing the dress also left me no time to shop for another one .

negative	i ordered from them .
negative	they use the us postal service .
negative	my package did not arrive .
negative	they show that it was delivered and just left_outside by the postman .
negative	i was not home the day it was allegedly delivered .
negative	either it never was left or someone took it .
negative	i called and they told me that there was nothing they could do since i did not opt to pay $ 0 . 00 for signature delivery !
negative	i honestly did not know this .
negative	i use mail order all the time and never have had to sign_up and pay for signature delivery , in fact just the opposite .
negative	you usually have to specifically waive signature delivery .
negative	ups insures packages up to $_000 for free .
negative	the idiots at this company do not insure their sent packages and have told that there is nothing they can do .
negative	do not patronize these crooks !
negative	!
negative	the rate on this site was $_00 / more per_night than the lowest rate available at the hotel .
negative	the hotel could not reverse the charges .
negative	this is the second ( and last ) bad_experience i '_ve had with online hotel booking services .
negative	i now use these_types of services to search for hotels in an area and then book direct with the hotel .... either by phone ( the horror - actually talking to somebody ) or online .
negative	i received my order from petflow in record_time , but the order was either from stale products or something happened in shipping .
negative	the two bones were rancid and the dogs wouldn_'_t even chew them until i cleaned the meat off them , and they eat any kind of bones they can get .
negative	the greenies were so flexible , i could bend them in half , and the only good thing was the bully_stick which was gone in a matter of 0 / 0 hour .
negative	i was so disappointed after what i paid and there was no paperwork in the box with the products .
negative	i will not be shopping at pet_flow again .
negative	unfortunately i cannot give your company a high rating .
negative	after_spending a great deal of time finding the best price on the motorola h000 bluetooth , your company was the one i decided to purchase it from .
negative	after taking the time to register with your company and fill_out all the financial and shipping details , i anxiously awaited the arrival of the 0 bluetooths i ordered .
negative	i even had a friend take the time and go through the same long process .
negative	much to my dismay , i received an_email_telling_me that you did not have these in stock .
negative	the cost was debited out of my account .
negative	the entire situation left a really bad feeling in me .
negative	i see " n0_wireless " and i get a sick feeling in me .
negative	" trust " pilot is not a good name to associate with your company .
negative	your company cannot be trusted to come through with what they state they have for sale .
negative	i was called 0 times by e0save in order to sell me an upgrade .
negative	the operator asked me what model i had : ' a samsung_galaxy ' i replied ... ' would you like an upgrade to a samsung fame ?
negative	with a free samsung 0 tablet ?'
negative	she asked ...
negative	it sounded_like a good idea , so for £ 0 extra a month , 000mb less data , and a tablet , i signed_up .
negative	the phone arrived the next_day .
negative	it was a samsung_galaxy fame - almost exactly_what i already had , but , not being under 00 years old i had no_idea that a fame was a galaxy .
negative	the problem then began as i tried to organise the return - no one available on web chat .
negative	e_- mails not replied to .
negative	drove into town and paid parking to return phone and tablet to carphone warehouse ( it was implied on the phone it was carphone warehouse selling me the upgrade ).
negative	the store wouldn_'_t take it , saying they had nothing to do with e0save .
negative	they were an independently trading company .
negative	i then spent 00_minutes waiting on the phone ( 00p_per min ) 00minutes in total .
negative	at first the operator was going to give me an address to return the products to .
negative	i must have sounded almost hysterical , as now i have to wait in from 0 . 00am - 0pm next tuesday to have a courier collect .
negative	i was also assured it wouldn_'_t affect my o0 account ....
negative	they have started billing me for every call i make since the upgrade .
negative	they are pants ..... and my life is too busy to be sorting out this rubbish .
negative	i was told i would not be charged until i got to the hotel and the payment was taken out of my banking account .
negative	i thought i was reserving a room .
negative	i was trying to order the creamy lotion and instead got 0 small bottles of liquid lotion for $_00 . 00 definitely not worth ordering here !
negative	!
negative	once i arrived to my global_airport_parking_lot , i decided not to park my car there , even_though i had made a reservation online and already pre_- paid .
negative	it felt too much like a scam as the lot was a driveway for a " backpacker '_s paradise " -- aka a cheap hotel or youth hostel .
negative	the two driveway '_s were so packed with cars that i could not pull in to either driveway to check my car , and i drove around the block , came back around and still couldn_'_t pull my car in .
negative	the back lot , were i am guessing the cars were to be parked , was jammed pack with cars were parked every which way to get as many cars back there as possible .
negative	i ended_up not parking my car here -- drove back to lax and parked my car at a ligament car lot .
negative	i will never use global_airport_parking .
negative	i am only giving them one star because i had to give them a star .
negative	because i was in need if the rental_car for 00 days and there computers were down , but i was told they were going to listen to the callls where there employees told me they would be able to allow this and they did not !!!!!
negative	shame on you for lying to people in there time of need , i spoke with 0 or 0 different ppl there 0 said yes we can !
negative	a supervisor told me no they would not do it .
negative	i rate them less then 0 my sister will die with out this surgery and needs 00 / 0 care for a month and they lied .
negative	i don_'_t have any respect for liars or thiefs , and right now that '_s what i feel they have done to me !!!!!!!!
negative	not nice to be treated like this from any business , very very poor customer retaliations indeed !!!!!
negative	yes we will confirm the calls , and you call us back in an_hour and we will take_care of you !
negative	ha !
negative	not shame on you !!!
negative	very po ' d customer right now , after 0 people telling_me they would listen to the phone conversations they refused to do as they promised .
negative	i have nothing nice to say about them at all .
negative	very poor service , very pissed off customer !!!!!!!!!

negative	i bought 0voucher from v cash and one from ukash to use on poker web dites non of them was approved for deposit
negative	booked a hotel stay for one night in new_orleans two rooms reasonable rate for the french_quarter .
negative	there was a box in red on the top right of the hotel info .
negative	that stated they only had three rooms left .
negative	i booked as fast as possible because we were staying there the next_day .
negative	after booking i read_reviews of the hotel and the complaints of the hidden_fees such as the 00 . 00 / night for parking in the hotel '_s parking_garage and a 0 . 00 / room fee for phone service even if we don_'_t use the phone .
negative	i called priceline immediately and tried to cancel and was told i would have to go through the hotel .
negative	called the hotel & was told to call back in the morning when a manager would be working .
negative	called in the a . m . & manager said i would have to go through pl to cancel .
negative	called pl and was told i would still be charged 000 . 00 for both rooms because i did not cancel by 0 / 0 .
negative	i booked the rooms on the night of 0 / 0 needing to stay on 0 / 0 .
negative	what crock of sh ** are they dishing out to customers ??
negative	asked to speak to a manager at pl and was given to a customer diservice rep and she read a script repeatedly , talked over me , cut me off , and would not negotiate at all telling_me we would be charged in full for the first night 000 . 00 ( we were only staying one night !)
negative	and that i already knew all of these details when i agreed to the reservation .
negative	i told her that i was previously told it would only be 000 . 00 for both rooms and she said that it was 000 . 00 per room even if i was quoted wrong with the first rep .
negative	asked to speak to a manager and she said they do not have managers .
negative	now we have to stay and pay 000 . 00 plus the extra_fees of 00 . 00 to park and 00 . 00 to not use the phone .
negative	i would give negative stars if possible .
negative	priceline sucks !
negative	!
negative	i had left the purchase of a birthday_gift a little late and had one week before i required my item .
negative	exceptional av came up with the keenest price for a set of bose mie0i earphones for an iphone 0 - i even rang and spoke to customer_services to discuss delivery options as i couldn_'_t decide_whether to pay the premium for next_day delivery - the guy i spoke to assured_me that the standard service would be with me within 0 working days .......
negative	i ordered .
negative	0 days_later my item still hadn_'_t been dispatched - i rang and was informed that my order wasn_'_t a ' stock item ' and exceptional av were awaiting delivery from a 0rd_party supplier - really ???
negative	another 0 days passed and i received my parcel - hoorah !!
negative	sadly wrong item - i got the bose mie0 for android phones .....
negative	i rang to cancel the order and customer_services tried to talk me into re - ordering - i declined their kind offer and they agreed to send a courier to collect the goods .
negative	meanwhile i did what i should have done in the first place and ordered from bose directly and paid £_00 for next_day delivery .
negative	the next_day dawned and my parcel arrived from bose before 00am - happy days .
negative	exceptional av courier arrived and i handed_over my return parcel and he handed me one back ???
negative	exceptional av had sent out the correct item and instructed the courier to ' exchange only ' forcing me to accept the replacement .
negative	customer_services again received a call - useless is an_understatement ......
negative	the result was i ended_up with 0 sets of earphones and ££££ out of pocket without so much as an_apology from this excuse of a company .
negative	in conclusion i wouldn_'_t touch exceptional av with a very long barge pole .
negative	they advertise items as being available on a next_day delivery when they quite clearly are not even kept in stock and then ' force ' customers to accept replacement items rather_than issue refunds ......
negative	i '_ll stick to the reputable suppliers next time and not try to save £_00 - i strongly_suggest you do the same .

negative	i placed my order three_weeks_ago and did not realize that supplement_warehouse did not honor prices from amazon . com , since they are " not a vitamin competitor ."

negative	i am very disappointed .

negative	ordered a necklace for a christmas_present , chose express shipping to guarantee arrival before christmas .
negative	0 days after ordering online , get an_email_saying that my order is pending b /_c i forgot to give them a phone_number ( which i dont remember being a requirement or even a question on the online order form ).
negative	called them 0 times that day , each time leaving a message .
negative	also sent an_email back to them with my phone_number information .
negative	took them 0 days to call me back , but only 00_hours to answer an_email .
negative	they sent me a follow_up email with a tracking_number for the usps .
negative	tracking_number did not work when they initially sent it to me !
negative	everyday for 0 days i emailed them asking them why my tracking_number isn_'_t working , where is my package etc .
negative	and within a 00hr period i would get a vague email from them saying , " we ' re sorry yada yada yada , if you haven_'_t received your package by yada yada yada ".. no actual answer to my question , just a generic email !
negative	it took me emailing them threatening to file grievances with paypal ( whom i paid with ) and the bbb before i got any real email_saying that they checked with the post_office and it '_s in transit ready for delivery by christmas .
negative	once i received that email , 0 days_later , my tracking_number miraculously worked !
negative	ridiculous .
negative	i did receive my package in time , and the necklace looks fine , but the customer_service is soooo horrible that it just tainted the whole_experience .
negative	they also charge your card an international service fee which they dont tell you about up front .
negative	terrible , terrible , terrible experience .
negative	i will never purchase with them again , i encourage everyone else to go another website other than this one if you are looking for a personalized necklace .
negative	i have stayed in my villa for 0 days as i was told i would receive the lights between 00th - 00th_march and i have not yet received them !!!!!

negative	tis is the 0st time i have ordered online for something to be sent to spain and i am not happy with the service .

negative	i wanted flowers sent to my grandaughter on the occasion of her first communion and ordered them to be delivered on saturday .
negative	i recieved an_email a few hours before they were to be delivered saying that you were sorry but they couldnt make the delivery and what did i want to do ... putting the ball in my hands again .
negative	by that time it was quite late in the uk and i was not able to get flowers to her .
negative	i send flowers to the uk all the time ( i live in the us ) but i will never use this service again .
negative	the item ordered with a guaranteed saturday delivery failed to arrive until monday , by which time it was too late .
negative	i have emailed menkind three_times for ado ice but have still not received a reply .
negative	i recently_purchased a ticket for robbie williams for tomorrow night .
negative	this was so my son could come with my daughter and myself for a special night out .
negative	despite purchasing in good time the ticket still hadn_'_t arrived yesterday , i called viagogo and was told they would look into into and call me back .
negative	no call back .
negative	today i received an_email_advising me i could collect my ticket between 00 and 0 tomorrow ( the day of the concert !)
negative	at a location 00_miles from my home .
negative	i then called viagogo to request they email me a ticket or send one special delivery so i would receive on the day of the concert , they assured_me they would look into this and call me back before 0 . 00 today .
negative	no call back .
negative	i rang back and after 00_mins of waiting to speak to someone i gave up .
negative	as it '_s an 0000 number i would like a refund for the 00_mins i have spent on the phone this week chasing a ticket that has still not arrived .
negative	so i am now faced with telling one of my children they can '_t come tomorrow .
negative	viagogo my ref is 0000000 - so there is no excuse for you fobbing me off and not contacting me first thing tomorrow to tell me how to get my ticket and to let_me know how i can get a refund for my phone_calls and the stress caused .
negative	you have my phone_number .
negative	i would not use your website again .
negative	i will never refer this company to my friends , the items didn_'_t fit and i had to pay to send it back !
negative	that '_s ridiculous !
negative	you should have a prepaid_label !
negative	also , you should be able to order over the phone for the people who don_'_t have the internet !
negative	i will never use this site again .
negative	sooooo sketchy !
negative	paid 000_dollars only to get dropped from there insurance a month later went weeks without hearing from them .
negative	out of 000_dollars only got back 00 dollars .
negative	complete scam .
negative	they took my money only to have no coverage .
negative	having spent a few thousand pounds over the last two years with abbey , to be advised that the warranty on a sit on mower would not be honoured as it expired on a sunday this being monday simply means i will not be buying anything_else from abbey and will be telling all my friends the same
negative	very poor customer_service , still_waiting to hear back from someone
negative	this is suppose to be some protection for a full year but i don_'_t see where you are protecting anything at all ...... to be protected you have to pay for everything but yet i feel suckered , once again , into giving my personal information plus my credit_card info ..... i would like you to close my account here at identity_guard and not one dime had better be charged to my card .
negative	you are no better_than the people you are suppose to be protecting us from ..... just another con to get our credit_card info and manipulating us into giving you money .
negative	what protection are we getting for one year , free ???!!!

negative	i placed an order for flowers to be delivered to my mother - in -_law in france .
negative	on the requested delivery date ( dec . 00th ) i received an_email_saying that they needed the phone_number at the facility where she_lives before they could deliver .
negative	i sent them the number within an_hour .
negative	no flowers on that day , no flowers by christmas , as of january 0 , 0000 still no flowers .
negative	i cannot get a response to my support inquiry .
negative	nothing .
negative	it '_s not even about the money now - it is about my mother in law and the fact that we had nothing there for her for christmas .
negative	i dont_know why you ask about customer_service and still give sh *** y service .
negative	i am upset with bookit . com and the hotel i booked with them .
negative	it has_been a hassle to stay at the hotel and one of a hassle to get a refund ( which i still have not received ).
negative	i checked out of my hotel one night early due to issues i was having and other reasons .
negative	after_contacting bookit . com to inform them of my experience they agreed to give me my money back but that they need the approval of the hotel manager at the hotel .
negative	well , these blood suckers in costa_rica have been giving bookit . com the run_around or so i am being told .
negative	i feel if i did not stay at their hotel , i should not have to pay to stay there !!!
negative	so , as i am leaving the hotel ( allegro papagayo on 0 / 00 / 00 ) they informed me that my refund is approved and that bookit . com is issuing my refund .
negative	i call bookit . com ( 0 / 00 / 00 ) in regards to my refund and the service rep does not know what i am talking_about .
negative	and just informs me that they are still trying to get_ahold of the hotel '_s manager to get approval for my refund .
negative	which i just feel bookit , either has some lazy employees that say they are trying to get in touch with the hotel or bookit is incahoots with money blood sucking hotels they have the guest stay at .
negative	i really feel this society is approaching an era that is out to get your money but does not provide you with the service they promised .
negative	but , still want you to uphold your end of the deal as they fail to do for you .
negative	so .... as the service rep gives me the , " oh , i am sorry , but we are still_waiting approval ... and i understand your frustrations bullshi * t . unfortunately , that is all we can do " well , i will_definitely keep that in mind when it comes to my family and friends booking anything further with this company , if i paid you as a travel_agency and you have not other services you can offer me after i have been ripped_off .
negative	when i asked for a manager , the rep had me on hold for 00_mins and then i just hung_up .
negative	so , bookit . com asks me how as my service it is still horrible !!!
negative	if i could give you zero star , i would .
negative	i am super disappointed , the colour does not match at all that one of the picture , its photoshopped , its not yellow at all but greenish .
negative	0 professionalism , cannot return it back .
negative	i would never shop_here again .
negative	i booked a trip through cheapoair on july_0000 , and due to political tensions in turkey , i
negative	cancelled it .
negative	my flight left on 0 / 0 / 00 .
negative	i had insurance , and now apparently , they tell me that i won_'_t get my $ back ( 0000 ).
negative	cheapoair claims that my case is in resolution , and that they would contact me by the 00th of may .
negative	it is now the 0 of june , and no contact .
negative	this is a dishonest company , and i will never use them again .
negative	i have reported them to consumer affairs , pissed off consumer , abc tv and others .
negative	run away and hopefully , they will go out of business .
negative	a company with 0000 complaints should not be allowed to continue serving customers worldwide .

negative	long wait times on phone .
negative	if you need to cancel it will cost more than two_days of parking after service fees are added .
negative	i recently bought a sectional with ottoman and the couch seems to be broke in one spot .
negative	also the ottoman wheels will not stay in the bottom .
negative	the delivery man actually told me that i needed to flip it over and take out the staples and push them in better , and replace the staples .
negative	that is not my job .
negative	i paid $ 0000 . 00 plus & 00 . 00 shipping and handling for a sofa .
negative	i have contacted the company and they have told me that i have to write them on the computer and send pictures , and they will get back with me in a week .
negative	they have yet to contact me .
negative	very disappointed !
negative	if i had to count on your company for my dogs food she would have starved .
negative	i ordered in plenty of time and kept getting emails it was on backorder .
negative	then when it said it was shipped it still took me a week to receive my product .
negative	i will not be shopping with you anymore .
negative	i would never recommend a storage_unit to anyone now not specifically public_storage .
negative	my unit was broken into .
negative	thousands of dollars worth of possessions were taken .
negative	the staff couldn_'_t even tell us when the break - in occurred .
negative	they gave_us all the info for the police that we needed but it still doesn_'_t justify that its supposed to be a secured facility but people can come and go without knowledge of the staff .
negative	00 to 00 units in out area were broken into .
negative	now sure how someone could simply walk off with that much stuff and not be seen .
negative	they sent a cluless young_girl who used furniture polish to clean kitchen work surfaces .
negative	missed all glass doors , patio doors and cleaned one mirror with a dirty cloth and left smears .
negative	i called 0 times to complain and was ignore
negative	useless , unfriendly , expensive would never ever use them again and do not recommend !
negative	!
negative	wish i had not bought the wool futons .
negative	so uncomfortable .
negative	:-(
negative	i ordered a part for my car .
negative	you guys sent me an_email_saying that you could not send it to a different address than my credit_card .
negative	i wrote back within 00_minutes and you guys told me that i took too long .
negative	so therefore i do not have the part for my car
negative	i recently_purchased a dress from this company , that they apparently ran_out of .
negative	instead of letting_me know they didn_'_t have the dress in stock , they sent me a completely different , cheap dress and never refunded me the difference .
negative	do not buy from this company .
negative	very dishonest business_practices .
negative	the coffee packing was so much like nespresso .
negative	unfortunately i do not think it is as good .
negative	the pods do not fit_perfectly so i am concerned_about my machine as i force them into place .
negative	however , i must_say that when i did register a complaint , i did receive a rapid and satisfactory response , most courteous .
negative	had an_unexpected family funeral .
negative	viator refused to refund and blamed tour_operator .
negative	tour_operator that was totally not true since we pd viator .
negative	on site , place order and they pop_up .
negative	first , they cover info from order placement which you cannot read or copy .
negative	if you close survey you lose your order page .
negative	second , their survey consists of questions from how satisfied are you from merchandise to receiving shipment .
negative	if i just placed an order how would i possibly know ?
negative	i can now see how inaccurate any reviews would be from this site .
negative	booked 0 $_000 return trips dallas to houston thru_travelocity .
negative	we were delayed on our connecting_flights and missed the outgoing flight .
negative	travelocity advised us that it would cost $_000 each to re - schedule .
negative	we told him that was ridiculous for a $_000 flight .
negative	the operator was adamant that that was the airlines policy .
negative	we went to expedia and booked two new return flights for $_000 each .
negative	travelocity advisor should have known that it was cheaper to book new flights than to change existing flights ( then again maybe he did know that , i assume the are paid a percentage of what they can con you in to paying )
negative	full expense wait half a pair of shoes make it right no they did not i got ripped_off
negative	i don_'_t think this company actually has a customer_service .
negative	every time i called i was out on hold for up to ten_minutes then hung_up on .
negative	i ordered a wheel , a " new wheel " and of course it was not new and was very badly bent .
negative	i '_m a so disappointed with this so called company .
negative	spend the extra money and go somewhere_else .
negative	cause this place is a rip_off .
negative	i made a purchase on 00th_march worth £_00 .
negative	in this order were 0 albizia julibrissin rosea trees in 00cm pots .
negative	having just planted these very small saplings i discovered the actual root balls were only 0cm square at most - and we ' re packed in with compost - the crowns of both had at_least 0 / 0cm of compost covering them !
negative	i also ordered lavender in a pretty ornate plant pot but received an ugly cheap pot instead - gardens 0 you said the illustrated picture did not nescessarily match the supplied item but at_least offered me 00_%_off .
negative	as for the camellias i ordered they were small sticks with 0 / 0 poorly looking leaves on them .
negative	i wish i had not used these people now and would certainly not recommend them to anyone .
negative	ordered some curtains , they were exactly_what i had been looking for to hang in the lounge of my new flat & they were showing as in stock .
negative	so , i paid in full and waited_until after the estimated delivery date , then went online to check the status & was disappointed to find a message_saying out of stock and money returned to my card .
negative	i then looked for a suitable replacement and while looking i saw that the same curtains were still saying in stock , so i decided to telephone my order in so that i could speak to someone .
negative	that person told me that yes , they were in stock , took my payment and to expect them in a few_days .
negative	a few_days_later i checked online again , only to see the same message_saying they were out of stock !!
negative	!
negative	in the end i purchased some curtains from ebay , yes an auction site was better_than ismi
negative	i didn_'_t even receive an_apology latter from ismi or anything , that '_s me finished with them from now on !
negative	this is the worst quality shoes i have ever purchased !!!!!!!!
negative	the backs are missing fabric as if they had been rubbed on concrete before being sent to me . also , the color on the bottom of the shoe is peeling before even being worn .
negative	not worth the cheap price !
negative	i changed my flight to 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	the flight status remained " on time " even_though the airport where i was going was closed .
negative	after many , many delays , the airline finally cancelled my flight .
negative	i was told that i will be getting a refund but that it will take a couple of weeks .
negative	none of the has to do with travelocity .
negative	i never got the order .
negative	post_office lost it .
negative	i had a bad_experience with newyorkdress regarding a return .
negative	i received a wrong order and when i contacted them they tried very hard to make it my mistake .
negative	i contacted the company via the chat online .
negative	the woman was very rude and mean during the chat .
negative	she completely treated me with disrespect .
negative	she did not believe me that i received the wrong order and ask me for a photo as a proof to process my return .
negative	however after i send her the image she told me that further investigations are needed to be done with the photo .
negative	she did not apologize for their mistake or for her rudeness .
negative	i wonder_if this is the way newyorkdress treats their customers after they place their orders and ask for a replacement or return ?
negative	sorry newyorkdress , although the dress is gorgeous am not going to buy or recommend you to others .
negative	before placing my order , i had a great customer_service with both tiffany w and maria .
negative	they were very professional and respectful .
negative	both of them email me with the chat transcript , but the rude lady did not !
negative	i asked that my order be delayed , i left note after my purchase for it to be delayed .
negative	while away i received a notice that it had been delivered saturday , i did not get home till this morning , we took a extra day getting back because of bad_weather .
negative	i also e_- mailed you to complain that it was sent already .
negative	i got no response from you
negative	i received the wrong item and sent it back , sent an_email to see if i could order the top again without_having to pay postage fees but all i received was a computerised response which did not answer my question at all .
negative	i was really dissapointed as i liked the top but due to lack of communication i did not order again .
negative	we rented two units over a 0 month window with the public_storage in lake union .
negative	while the facilities were new , the staff cared only about eking out every_penny they could out of the rental .
negative	for the high monthly rent , i would have expected a better facility experience .
negative	the manager was not personable and would park his vehicle obtrusively in the path of where people needed access to move their items .
negative	the floors were unbearably hot in the summer and bitingly cold in the winter .
negative	climate_controlled unit was what we paid for not and not what we got .
negative	don_'_t be_fooled by the shiny exterior .
negative	rent elsewhere .
negative	i have recently encountered a situation that brought to my attention the lack of protection for those who sell products on amazon .
negative	i recently sold a product on amazon where the buyer claims it was not the appropriate product .
negative	i authorized a return and refund , but the buyer opened up an a to z claim against me anyway .
negative	the buyer was very rude and aggresive .
negative	it has_been a nightmare of a few_days .
negative	the claims has just been closed and amazon has given the buyer his money back and state that they are not responsible for the seller returning the product to me .
negative	that means the buyer is 000_% protected and the seller is 0 % protected .
negative	this seems like it could become a very easy fraud scheme since you have no proof that the product you shipped was or was not the product you posted it under , and it appears the buyer does not need to provide any solid proof of the merchandise they received .
negative	in addition , the buyer does not have to return the product to you even after receiving a full_refund .
negative	this experience has made me want to let others know of amazon '_s policies , and i know i will not be supporting amazon any longer .
negative	even after i went through my books to check for writing they claimed one book that was worth $_00 was worthless because of non_- existent writing .
negative	they also accepted one book then claimed it wasn_'_t the version i agreed to send them , which is whatever , i filled out the isbn exactly as i saw it .
negative	i would never deal with this company again , they ' re a bunch of crooks
negative	i placed this order and it did not appear on my receipt the way i ordered it so i call ed right_away to change it ...
negative	they said they had to cancel it and i had to reorder it ... i received the email cancellation from the first order but after 0 phone_calls and an hr or more wait on the phone i still have no refund ...
negative	they said that they never drafted from my account and only put a hold on it but i assure you my bank_statement shows they drafted it .... now i am waiting for a confirmation number from them that they didnt ever draft it and they want me to deal with my bank because they cant do more ... so much crap i never recomment this site to any one !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	they don_'_t tell you the name of the hotel because if they did , you would not book .
negative	we are greatly disappointed in the assistance given by the customer_service representative and their supervisor .
negative	as a us business traveler , you would assumed the travelocity would be more mindful travel and weather_conditions in the us .
negative	the travelocity supervisor directed my assistant to make our own flight schedules changes and hotel reservation by contacting the airlines and hotels directly after being on hold for one hour .
negative	the original flight booked through_travelocity ended_up being cancelled by the airlines due to weather_conditions .
negative	i spent £_00 + and they left it in a safe location also known as the pavement
negative	i ordered for the first time and will be the last .
negative	my items where left_outside my house next to the bins in the rain .
negative	everything is damaged .
negative	dolphin are doing nothing about this so i will be taking this further .
negative	when i called to see whether the hotel accepted and charged for pets , the agent outright lied to me and said "$ 0 or $_00 ... don_'_t worry_about it ".
negative	after making the reservation and then checking the hotel '_s website , i learned they charged $_00 per day for a pet !
negative	i also learned that the hotel '_s pool was closed during the time i would be staying there !
negative	$_000_per_night !
negative	needless to say , i canceled but then learned they had already charged my credit_card and i would not be getting a credit for a number of days !
negative	never again will i use this service !
negative	it '_s poor service cos i paid for next_day service but till now i have never got my order .
negative	when rang your offices i was told the dal verily was done and that i wasn_'_t home but no note was left for me to show that they hard tried to deliver my order .
negative	i am very up set .
negative	diana .
negative	i have purchased every plan ticket for work and social travel through_travelocity for a decade .
negative	it has_been tens of thousands of dollars of travel .
negative	i recently booked tickets and somehow got them on the wrong dates ( i needed feb 0 / 0 and they came through as march 0 / 0 .)
negative	i realized it a few_days_later and called travelocity and couldn_'_t have been treated worse by their team .
negative	i was not allowed to speak with a manager .
negative	they wouldn_'_t refund the march tickets even thought there is plenty of time to re - sell them .
negative	i ended_up being out $_000 .
negative	and on top of it they said they would need to do " a technology audit " just to see if they can give me back $_00 that they charge as a fee for changing tickets .
negative	this technology audit takes a week and they don_'_t follow - up wiht you on it , you have to make another set of phone_calls to talk with a series of peole who also try not to give you your money back .
negative	really terrible way to treat customers .
negative	it '_s sad that new_jersey state officials don_'_t do something about a company ( parts_geek ) that intentionally rips off customers .
negative	i bought 0 items - 0 headlamps and 0 side turning lamps for a 0000 cadillac deville from these jerks .
negative	was missing 0 turninglamp when recieved and the other turning lamp was broke .
negative	i also paid_extra for shipping but for what ?
negative	they first said they would ship out 0 more sidelamps to me -- never received .
negative	then i asked again where they where and they sent back an_email for a return of both side turning lamps -- which i only got 0 -- how does this work ?
negative	please do not buy from this jerkwater company .
negative	purchased 0 airline_tickets and accidentally put sisters maiden name instead of married name and i called to change but they wouldnt let_me do it ... had to cancel both tickets and this company charged 000 . 00 per_ticket to cancel .
negative	000 . 00 down the drain for nothing !!!!!
negative	will never use this company again !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i would not recommend this site outside of the price .
negative	this is the first time in many many years i flew united .
negative	never again !!
negative	first i had to stand in a long line to check in my bags , while one reservation specialist had to help another one with almost every person_who was unfortunate enough to be in her line , trying to do his job & hers too .
negative	when i got to my first connection , when we landed , the wheelchair i requested was not there .
negative	as i only had 00minutes , not enough time for them to get one for me , i got to hurry as much as possible , as i had 00 + gates , to make my connection .
negative	so the next 0 hrs were spent with pain in my legs .
negative	when i got to my final_destination , my checked luggage didn_'_t .
negative	it took a full 00hrs for my bag to get to the destination airport , and a half_hour drive to go get it .
negative	// forward ahead one week ..... when i got to the airport to check in , i was told my flight was cancelled , but !
negative	they said , they would put all the plane passengers in taxi '_s , drive us over the 000mile trip , and we would make our connection to denver .
negative	so after cramming 0 of us in a taxi , with a not so good driver , we got to the airport , to find out we had missed our connection .
negative	the airline had to give us 0 meal vouchers , and a hotel voucher , as many of us couldn_'_t get our needed flights until the next_day .
negative	a work day , that i missed .
negative	i finally made it back to my home airport , after over 0 0 / 0 hour layovers .
negative	needless to say , i will never fly united again .
negative	i '_m trying to change my flight booking to this coming thursday and despite calling the australia number and " all lines being busy " for the first hundred times i call , i then get diverted to switzerland where i am told they cannot help me until 0am in the morning , switzerland time .
negative	i need to urgently change my flights and start planning my trip to the uk which is potentially in 0 days time and despite_being 0am in the morning in australia , i can '_t actually do anything today and i have to wait .
negative	i tried_calling the number a couple of times to address this urgent issue that has arised and both_times i was spoken to in a very rude way and told to " wait for an_email ".
negative	this is absolutely_ridiculous and i have never_experienced customer_service quite like it .
negative	the customer_service numbers states that the operators are 00 / 0 but this just means you can put in your requests 00 / 0 but you will only get responses between_0am - 0pm switzerland time ...... not entirely useful when you live in australia .
negative	not happy at all and now just left feeling anxious and concerned rather_than excited and organised !
negative	!
negative	so , i booked our hawaii trip through_expedia and once we got to oahu ( connecting to maui ) we started looking for the airline , go !
negative	... a guy from alaska tells_me they went out of business april 0st !!
negative	i booked the flight 0_weeks before that !
negative	you ' re telling_me expedia couldn_'_t contact me to tell me ??
negative	so , it happened to be graduation weekend and there were no flights to maui for 0 days !
negative	i was on the phone with expedia for 0 hours trying to get help and they kept hanging up on me and i would get a new person every time i called ...
negative	they would never have record of who i talked to and didn_'_t have any names that the " supervisors " gave_me .
negative	finally i ended_up re - booking my flight on my own and found a condo in oahu ..$ 0000 . 00 later !
negative	and i lost my car in maui ... dollar wouldn_'_t hold it for me .
negative	so , this cost me clots to $ 0000 . 00 .
negative	plus the money for the first flight i '_m out .
negative	expedia didn_'_t help me at all ...
negative	they said if i send in my flight receipt via fax they will reimburse_me , but that '_s it .
negative	and i won_'_t hold my breath !
negative	this ruined our vacation as we were so stressed_out and afraid for what would happen on our trip home we couldn_'_t even relax .
negative	thanks expedia .
negative	absolutely terrible , my sons game didnt turn up , ive emailed , ive left msg on the customer site , ive talked to two so called customer_service people , ive asked for a customer_service number which is in denmark , all i want is for it to be tracked to find out where it has gone , ive paid for it and my son is so dissapoiunted that all his friends got theres , we were recommended this site , but the service is terrible i want my money bk as soon as possible this is not fair , you should have a english phone line for problems , the customer chat line was so slow have taken pictures how long it got to get a reply , i will never recommened this company . and if i dont here soon im taking it to consumer trading_standards .
negative	i had ordered roses and a bottle of dom perignon to be delivered to my parents on their 00th_wedding_anniversary which was yesterday .
negative	they received the roses .
negative	i emailed iflorist immediately to allow them to address their error .
negative	today i received a tracking_number in an_email_telling_me that it was " at the service station ".
negative	as far as i can see this appears to be the extent of their customer_service really ?
negative	i paid $_000 . 00 and a foreign_transaction fee of $_00 because iflorist made a promise to fulfill their part of the deal .
negative	they didn_'_t .
negative	i want my money back .
negative	probably the most frustrating thing about dealing_with this company is that they will not speak to you in person and that you have only an online " chat " to sort things out with them .
negative	this is the second time an order has_been delayed .
negative	i will never use this company again .
negative	i have entered into a contract with them twice_now and once they are paid which is upfront they have no concern about keeping their side of it and their customer_service is appalling .
negative	the experience i have had booking our trip to new_york has_been a nightmare since the day i booked the trip in february .
negative	i was trying to book a flight and hotel " package " for 0 women online .
negative	one of the travelers wanted insurance and 0 didn_'_t .
negative	i couldn_'_t figure_out if i could add the insurance for the one person , so i decided to call and ask .
negative	i was told i could not purchase insurance for one person in group because it was a " package " and either all women would need to take the insurance or none .
negative	i told the customer_service gentleman , " thanks and i will_continue to book online ".
negative	i should have hung_up right at that time , because , this is where all the trouble starts !
negative	the gentleman told me if i booked over the phone he would be able to get me a " better deal ".
negative	the price he gave_me over the phone was $_000 less_than what was listed online .
negative	i had decided to book my trip without the insurance and complete the booking over the phone .
negative	i gave my credit_card number along with the required deposit .
negative	the next_morning i received an_email summary of the trip and noticed the total package price was off by $_000 and a second email_stating i still owed $_000 and this payment was overdue !
negative	i just gave them $ 0000 the night before !
negative	now is where i can relate to several others who have had similar complaints .
negative	i must have spent at_least 00_hours in total over several days trying to get my simple question answered about the overdue payment and why the price was off from what i was quoted the night before .
negative	i would be on hold for 00 + min before i would even get on the line with someone , then put on hold to be transferred to a supervisor where i would be on hold for another 00 - 00_minutes only for my call to get disconnected during the transferring of the call .
negative	every time i would call in the automatic recording would ask me the same information , itinerary_number , my phone_number , etc .
negative	no one would ever call me back after getting disconnected .
negative	i would be on my landline also - so can '_t blame a " dropped call "!!
negative	at one point i told one of the customer_service persons i would have to cancel my trip if i couldn_'_t get my issues resolved .
negative	again getting know where , the next_morning i had an_email that my hotel portion of the trip was cancelled !
negative	remember this was a " package " so i am not sure how they could have cancelled part of the package .
negative	had to get back on the phone , after several hours again , and being told the supervisor had to listen in on the phone recordings , they admitted their mistake .
negative	my hotel was rebooked ; however , they told me because it was no_longer a " package " i couldn_'_t get insurance , and i said no problem , we never asked for insurance in the first place .
negative	the difference price was from the insurance which i never agreed to !
negative	i received an_email_saying my trip was paid in full and i would not get charged anymore to my credit_card .
negative	well , just a few_days ago i received an_email of urgent matter that my account was not paid in full and changes were made to my trip without being paid in full .
negative	hummm , who made the changes - they did !
negative	the balance of $_000 was for the insurance .
negative	first of all i didn_'_t ask for the insurance and secondly , i was told we couldn_'_t have insurance for this trip because it wasn_'_t a package !!
negative	more wasted hours on hold , getting disconnected ( 0 times within a 0 hour_period ), i finally just paid the $_000 so i can go on the trip without_any worries ... after_reading some of these other complaints , i am getting nervous again - will we have a seat on the flight and / or will we have a room ??
negative	never , ever again will i book through_expedia and neither should you !
negative	jeg_har_aldrig oplevet en så uprofessionel og urimelig behandling som kunde , som hos callme !
negative	da_jeg i januar skulle rejse til usa i et semester ringede jeg 0 gange til kundeservice for at være sikker på at jeg_kunne beholde mit nummer og sætte mit mobil telefon abonnement på pause .
negative	jeg_fik af vide af to forskellige folk at det sagtens kunne lade sig gøre , at det koster 0 kr .
negative	pr .
negative	måned og at det nok skulle ske automatisk - at de nok skulle ordne det så_jeg_ikke skulle stresse over det mens jeg_var udenlands .
negative	de regninger jeg siden hen har fået , eller rettere sagt ikke_har fået fordi de er_blevet sendt_til_min gamle adresse som min gamle sambo har scannet og sendt mig , har_været uden forklaring !
negative	at jeg så nu får en regning fra et inkassofirma på 0000 kr .
negative	er fuldstændig uacceptabel !!
negative	den er slet_ikke blevet sendt_til mig , men igen til_min gamle adresse med postvæsen på_trods af at jeg flere_gange har sagt at det skal sendes til mig på mail , og at jeg_blev lovet af to kundeservice folk at betalingen nok skulle ske automatisk !
negative	denne regning er callmes fejl , ikke min !
negative	som sagt har_jeg fortalt dem flere_gange at jeg_ikke bor i danmark i et halvt år .
negative	det_har de fuldstændig ignoreret og alligevel sendt regninger og rykkere med_posten til_min gamle adresse .
negative	det_kan simpelthen ikke være rigtigt at jeg skal høre om både regninger og rykkere fra en gammel sambo med_en scanner !
negative	!
negative	det_er også uacceptabelt at jeg ligepludselig får papirsregninger uden forklaring , når_jeg_er altid har betalt via pbs og når_jeg_er_blevet lovet at callme nok skulle ændre pbs beløbet så_jeg_ikke skulle tænke over det imens jeg_er væk .
negative	callme har gjort mig så utrolig stresset og vred imens jeg_har_været i usa ( som i sig selv er stressende nok ) og_jeg_er_så utilfreds at jeg_vil ud_af dette telefirma hurtigst mulig !
negative	i havent receive my bag over a month and a half the fashionqueen tols me that it was fault from the courier but they couldnt give me the name of the courier or a phone i stil havent receive my bag and they dont give my money back honestly is the worst e shopping that i had .
negative	i made a reservation for a trip to canada and after completing the process i got a trip number with the notation that a confirming e_- mail would follow .
negative	i never got the e_- mail and when i called customer_service the next_day they told me my trip didn_'_t exist .
negative	i called my bank just to make_sure that was correct and my bank had received a transaction for the cost of the trip .
negative	i called travelocity customer_service back the next_day and after waiting on hold for over 00_minutes and several transfers of the call , i was told that my bank would have to resolve the issue .
negative	they could not .
negative	when i asked to speak with a manager , i was put on hold while the call was being transferred and wonder of wonders , the call got disconnected .
negative	i then sent an e_- mail to scott quigley who i believe is the head of nw customer_relations for travelocity explaining the situation and asking for assistance .
negative	it has_been a full month and i have not received the courtesy of a response nor has the issue been resolved .
negative	how many calls do i have to make and how many e_- mails do i have to write before someone actually does something to help me get this issue_resolved .
negative	travelocity - is anyone listening ?
negative	?
negative	i needed to modify my reservation , from staying two_nights to one .
negative	after was all said and done i was only credited_back approximately_$_00 from my reservation .
negative	so , bookit charged about $_00 in fees to modify my reservation .
negative	i will not use this site again to make reservations and do not recommend it .
negative	after purchasing a kitchen electrical_appliance from amazon last_year .
negative	i was very disappointed to find it impossible to get help to return the product when it failed to work properly .
negative	i also find their website too messy and complicated ..... not an online shop for me .
negative	this is the second jeep i '_ve had from drivetime because the first had a faulty engine .
negative	i took second jeep into a shop , picked by drivetime and recommended by averex who made me sit for 0 hours waiting before they explained nothing was wrong with it .
negative	however , took it to a second shop who knew_exactly_what was wrong and now i '_m out of pocket over $_000 because the previous mechanic failed to report the diagnostic within the first 00 days .
negative	upon calling the warranty company to find out why i was connected three_times to a supervisor who never answer and transferred mid sentence by the idiot workers .
negative	the supervisor showed no care or desire to help but kept telling_me it '_s drivetime , not their fault .
negative	i regretfully have to deal with drivetime and their warranty that covers nothing for the next few_years .... a bunch of bull ... worst_experience and customer_service i have ever_dealt_with ... paying for a warranty that won_'_t cover anything and won_'_t take_responsibility for their mechanics faults and don_'_t give a rats butt about anyone but themselves .
negative	wish i could take the jeep back , cancel my contract and take my money to buy a new one somewhere_else that actually cares .
negative	if everything goes well , the company is good in finding lower prices .
negative	but when something goes bad , don_'_t expect any help .
negative	today i reserved a hotel room which had two types of rooms with 0 different rates .
negative	i chose the lower_rate .
negative	after the reservation was complete , i noticed that they had applied the higher_rate to my bill .
negative	i sent an_email to the customer_service the answer was that they can '_t help with cancellation and refund through email , asking to call them .
negative	i called and their staff checked the website and admitted that there was a bug in the system and the error happened again .
negative	but said that he can '_t refund me here !
negative	and that i needed to go to the website in best price guarantee and file there .
negative	i explained that i didn_'_t find a lower price from another place , this is their website .
negative	he said the only_thing he can do is to cancel the whole reservation altogether .
negative	after wasting 00_minutes of my time there i asked to connect me to his supervisor who introduced_himself as tyler .
negative	first it held me on the line for00 minutes just to connect me to him .
negative	then the supervisor said he needs to check the site , although i explained that the other person had already checked the site .
negative	he put me on hold for 00_minutes and never showed_up !
negative	and finally disappointed i hung_up the phone .
negative	so basically about 0 hour waste of time for nothing .
negative	i couldn_'_t_believe it .
negative	i was wondering_if he was taking a nap while i was walking and waiting for him to answer .
negative	i should add that this bad customer_service had happened before too .
negative	it seems nowadays there are many companies that their growth has outpaced their training and customer_service quality .
negative	this is very disappointing .
negative	the condition of the roses were very bad when it arrived .
negative	the plants were small and some of the roots were exposed .
negative	the blooms were diseased .
negative	it was totally not worth 000_bucks for 0 petite roses
negative	very disappointed about the deposited request at check in time at both hotels .
negative	we were not informed when we originally made the booking online .
negative	one was for $_00 and the other was for $_00 .
negative	we have to see either of the deposited returned so_far .
negative	we will not be using bookit . com again .
negative	each hotel clerk told us is was because we booked it through bookit . com that a deposited is required .
negative	ordered 0 ink_cartridges from them .
negative	they each lasted approx .
negative	00 prints , before they quit_working .
negative	there is no contact phone_number for this company .
negative	they claim to respond to email problem reports within 0 business day .
negative	it has_been 0 business days , with no response and no other way to talk to them .
negative	stay away from this rip - off company !
negative	i ordered 0 of the 0 gallon size gardenia '_s before mother '_s day and they are beautiful and big .
negative	i ordered 0 more and just got them today .
negative	the pot they were in is the same size as the last gardenia '_s but the plants are only 0 / 0 the size .
negative	i bought them on a reduced price offer but they were advertised as the same plant .
negative	i won_'_t be ordering anything from you again .
negative	i had a bad_experience with this company .
negative	they advertise great offers , when i ask how far the hotel was from manhattan she said 00 to 00_minutes .
negative	i took a taxi , not only 00_minutes past but 00_minutes with traffic and i had to go back and forth .
negative	the lie cost me more than the trip itself and don_'_t rely_on confirmation # it doesn_'_t mean anything .
negative	when finally arrived to the hotel they had no record the confirmation # it '_s just a number .
negative	at 0 :_00am the hotel was full i had to wait for the nice front_desk personnel to find me a room .
negative	how do i call them , dishonest !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered pens for my daughters_wedding with a delivery date that came and gone .... still no pens !
negative	horrilbe sesrvice !
negative	on 00 . 00 . 00 i bought an apple i - pod nano 0th generation 00gb through e_- bay , price 00 . 00 .
negative	0 days_later a received an apple i - pod shuffle , price 00_pounds .
negative	when i e_- mailed the company they made out like they didn_'_t understand what i was saying .
negative	after a week and several e_- mails i opened a case with pay_pal .
negative	over a month later i still have not received a refund or the goods i originally ordered .
negative	i have been requested by pay_pal t return the goods to photo direct and i will them be given a refund .
negative	i believe that when i return the shuffle this seller will claim that i have not returned the goods he originally despatched therefore i cannot have a full_refund .
negative	i believe this is how he works making money out of sending byers the wrong goods .
negative	will take this matter further and post reviews on as many sites like this as possible to alert others .
negative	wish i had seen these reviews and those on other_sites before ordering .
negative	you live and learn , at_least i will not make this mistake again and nor will anyone i know .
negative	could not use hampton reward card for points & charged if had to cancel after .
negative	0 pm the day before .
negative	price was not better for the room .
negative	bad_experience from booking on phone to the actual hotel , rooms doors not too safe could push open too easily when locked .
negative	i had an autoship_program set_up for ( 0 ) 00 - lb_bags of a particular cat_food to be shipped every 0_weeks .
negative	when my last shipment was due , i logged online the day after it was scheduled to ship and the status said " in processing_".
negative	i called customer_service and was told it was out of stock and would be delayed 0 or 0 days .
negative	apparently , they dont send emails when an autoship order is not able to ship .
negative	this was a problem because the cat_food my cats are on is not sold at any of my local_pet_stores and one of them cant eat anything_else without vommiting .
negative	i drove a 0 hour round_trip to get a small bag to hold me over until the delivery came from petflow - which i was told would be 0 or 0 extra days .
negative	on that 0th day , i was called by petflow and told that the 00_pound_bags did not come in , but they were willing to ship me ( 0 ) 0 pound_bags and ( 0 ) 0 pound_bag which would equal the 00_pounds on my auto_ship order for the same price as the 00_pound_bags .
negative	0 days_later i received ( 0 ) 0 lb_bag - but none of the 0 pound_bags , so instead of 00_pounds , i had 0 pounds .
negative	with 0 cats - that doesn_'_t go far .
negative	i called and was told that they could not ship the 0 pound_bags as promiced because when they checked the shelves , there was none - the inventory was wrong in the system .
negative	again - no email or contact from them , it took me to inquire to find out there was a problem .
negative	so again , i made a 0 hour trip for another bag of cat_food .
negative	this latest event was on a friday .
negative	i called customer_service that friday and spoke with a supervisor and needed to know if and when i would be getting the ( 0 ) 00_pound_bags .
negative	i was told it was coming in on that following_monday ( 0 days ) and it would be sent out to me that same day .
negative	well , monday came and much to my suprise i recieved an_email that my order shipped fedex and was given a tracking_number .
negative	i tracked it and it said " electronic shipping info transmitted to fedex " - which_means , fedex was called for the package pickup , but hadn_'_t taken posession of the package yet .
negative	next_day - same thing - " electronic shipping info received ".
negative	i called fedex and was told that they never took posession of the package .
negative	i called petflow and was told that fedex in fact did pick the package up and somehow lost it or failed to scan it in - but it was lost somewhere .
negative	petflow called me back several hours_later and said after a detailed trace with fedex it was determined that the package was lost and would not be delivered and that the ( 0 ) bags that were lost were the only 0 bags they got in stock so they could not ship out a replacement order .
negative	at that point , i searched the web and found another source to buy the food and ordered the ( 0 ) 00_pound_bags for overnight delivery and got them the next_day without_any_issues .
negative	i immediately contacted customer_service at petflow and told them to cancel my backorder because i purchased the food elsewhere ; i couldn_'_t wait for their inventory to come in or a lost package to be found .
negative	despite my cancellation request , to which i received a confirmation , the following_wednesday , they shipped me ( 0 ) 00_pound_bags !!!
negative	the 00_pounds owed to me from nearly 0_weeks earlier and that i cancelled when i was forced to go elsewhere .
negative	since i have 0 cats , i chose to keep the extra 0 bags vs . return them and i thought the ordeal was over until i was contacted by customer_service because they realized that the single ( 0 ) pound_bag they shipped me , which was supposed to be ( 0 ) 0 pound_bags and a single ( 0 ) pound_bag - was never billed to me .
negative	they wanted me to pay a ridiculous amount for it - over half of what i pay for the 00_pound_bag because the smaller bags are much more costly .
negative	i let them know just how much_trouble i '_ve been through trying to get my order straight and how much time and gas i spent in my 0 hours of driving to buy food from retail and none of that mattered - they wanted a cc # to pay for the 0 pound_bag .
negative	i refused , but despite that they put the charge through on the cc # on file for my auto - ship order and then had the nerve to charge me a ridiculous shipping fee for that single 0 pound_bag because it was rushed .
negative	as for the ( 0 ) 00_pound_bags shipped via_fedex and lost , well it '_s been a month and it still shows as " electronic shipping info received " so who only knows_how that will end up .
negative	this was just a nightmare .
negative	terrible service !
negative	i had never received my box for the month of may and i wrote and asked for a tracking_number well it seems the box was suppose to be delivered the week before , but i had never received it !
negative	i called saffron_rouge and they said they would call me back later that afternoon .
negative	well , later that afternoon came and went and now three_days_later i still_haven_'_t heard from the company .
negative	then i get this review .
negative	well , here it is and if i could rate you a zero i would !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i don ; t want to use this way of paying and don_'_t like how you force it on people remove me pl
negative	i was trippled charged for my stay and was repeatedly told that it was my bank '_s error .
negative	i pleaded to speak with a manager and was refused and had someone tell me they were a manager when in fact they were not .
negative	when they finally admitted to overcharging me , nothing was done to correct the issue and they insinuated that they did me a courtesy by not charging me an_additional_$_00 for incidentals .
negative	when i asked when a manager would be available they said they did not know and that a general_manager would not be available for several days .
negative	the issue is still not resolved .
negative	i have stayed in the past with ok service .
negative	this is terrible and irresponsible and marriott should be a more responsible company .
negative	poor service .
negative	ignorant staff .
negative	will never spent money or patronage this business again .
negative	i am an_avid traveller and will share my experience to keep it from happening to others .
negative	stayed at hotel lamon in barcelona in october_0000 .
negative	first 0 days of living in the great room to a terrace on the 0th_floor .
negative	its windows overlook a quiet courtyard in the morning and nothing and no one will disturb my sleep .
negative	a week_later , i '_m back to live there , but on the 0th_floor .
negative	terraces were not , but were unbearable smell of sewerage from the bathroom and terrible noise in the morning from the street , as the hotel located in the same building with the local lyceum and students under his windows were shouting from morning to evening .
negative	it was really terrible noise .
negative	i am very unhappy with the time spent in the hotel , although the staff no_complaints i have .

negative	i ordered my items late november ; christmas delivery was guaranteed ; i got a confirmation that my order was shipped december_0th .
negative	it is now december_00th and i do not have the items .
negative	what kind of delivery takes over 0_weeks ???
negative	i cannot get tracking_info and now i do not have my gifts for christmas morning ... i would never have ordered from this site if i knew it would take so long .
negative	there were other_places i could have ordered from .
negative	next time i will .
negative	disappointed ,
negative	allyson
negative	i will never order from here again .
negative	a good 0 / 0 of the canned goods i ordered were incredibly damaged .
negative	i felt_like i was sent seconds .
negative	these cans were not necessarily on the outer side of the case ; alot were right in the middle of the case with undamaged cans around the damaged ones .
negative	tell me this was not done on purpose !!
negative	also , the cardboard cases holding the cans were not at all damaged , just the cans .
negative	i did receive a credit for the damaged goods , but from now on , i '_ll take my money elsewhere .
negative	do not play it .
negative	i redeem 0 eur voucher .
negative	as soon i won 000 eur and request payment , they blocked my account .
negative	your website said my part was in stock , guess what it wasn_'_t !
negative	i placed an order for prescription_sunglasses at visiondirect . com . au and spectacles at [_link ] on the same day , as i wanted different products .
negative	[_link ] were awesome .. and coming from texas which was clearly adverted on their website , i received them 0 - 0_weeks after ordering and had no_issues whatsoever .
negative	visiondirect . com . au - i expected a more prompt service as they were an australian company ... which now i know from a whirlpool forum are based in hong_kong .
negative	unfortunately this is not the case .
negative	i ordered my glasses on the 0th of march
negative	( 00th_march )
negative	i was notified that my item was on backorder and was given another choice .
negative	so i made the choice and quizzed the customer_service agency what would come quicker .
negative	i changed my order and received a 0 %_discount .
negative	( 00th_march )
negative	i received an_email_saying my ' item confirmed ' and my order was updated to the new pair .
negative	and an ' item confirmation ' email was sent following .
negative	( 00th_april )
negative	some time later i received an_email_saying the stock was backordered and was given the same choice / discount as before .
negative	i chose to continue waiting .
negative	( 0rd may )
negative	i somehow found time within waiting for my order and researched the manufacturer [_link ] and it seems they no_longer advertise that product .
negative	neither does any other optical store online has it in stock .
negative	i gave up and have since sent multiple_emails to customer_service , searched for some_sort of contact number ( nowhere !!!)
negative	with no reply , no refund and have decided to take action further by making a dispute with my bank .
negative	this is totally_unacceptable .
negative	no star last order still have not received since ist of month
negative	you charged my credit_card and i assumed it would not be charged until i checked in .
negative	this order was place on sept . 00 , 00
negative	i '_m glad i got my refund , but if the part was not in stock , it shouldn_'_t have be confirmed as an order .
negative	i got an_email detailing the refund , but no_explanation why i did not get the part i ordered .
negative	it delayed my car being fixed for 0 days or more because i was waiting for this part , then had to order another and wait for that too .
negative	ordered two_weeks_ago .
negative	have not received .
negative	am out of lenses .
negative	not happy !
negative	my items have not been delivered , so i have no review .
negative	the website used to alllow for 0 depature and arrival dates and it does not now .
negative	i wrote to ask why this feature was taken_away and received 0 junk_mail responses .
negative	i am now using other_sites .
negative	i was being charged for goods sent back via the wrong collection company , it took me ages to get kandco to clear my balance ive always paid on time & never lapsed once all i got was an_apology in an_email
negative	very rude people the service was horrible .
negative	they had a warehouse man walking around giving out advice that wasn_'_t true and there ' are overpriced .
negative	i found the same mattress for half that price .
negative	it was ridiculous and they only have two sales_reps that can barley speak_english .
negative	they ' re very sneaky when it comes to their ads .
negative	the flyer said $_000 with a picture of the full set so we went there .
negative	here it was $_000 for each peace so i showed her that theflyer didn_'_t say $_000 each item after the price or in small_print .
negative	she got real rude and nasty .
negative	i haye that place .

negative	i ordered 0 tankards as a wedding gifts for some friends , i was on a timescale so ordered them recorded delivery .
negative	i received email_confirmation that they had been dispatched .
negative	this was not true .
negative	only one tankard was dispatched and it was not sent recorded delivery it was just lying on the doorstep when i got home .
negative	the tankard was also badly scratched , for a new product which was quite expensive this was unacceptable .
negative	i phoned the company to try and resolve this issue ( had to wait_till after the weekend as there was no one answering the phones over the weekend ).
negative	this was becoming a time critical situation , i was guaranteed that the tankards would be dispatched the next_day so with me within 0 days - this would have allowed me enough time to engrave and wrap for a friends wedding .
negative	i sent a follow_up email the day they were supposed to arrive just to ensure that they would arrive .
negative	i got an_email response saying it would be a further 0 days before the tankards would be dispatched .
negative	had i not inquired_about this they would not have informed me of this by which time it would have been too late for me to source something .
negative	i feel_like i was deliberately lied to to ensure the sale ; despite me repeatedly telling the customer_service team that they were needed for a specific day .
negative	i was reassured both verbally and via_email that this was the case !
negative	which it clearly wasn_'_t and the fact that they did not initiate contact with me to tell me of these changes in my mind shows a malicious intent .
negative	it would be my recommendation not to use this company as they postage which you pay for you do not receive ( i was lead to believe this is a frequent mistake !
negative	), the goods are damaged if they arrive at all and the customer_service is the worst i have ever come_across where they willfully lie in order to make a sale .
negative	i would never use this company again .
negative	it is unbeliveble . they put on a sentence : have a nice day !
negative	on flowers to a lady whom husband just died .

negative	tried to purchase 0 times they could not complete it tried to call customer_service on hold for hours ?????????????????????
negative	?, i used another company cheeper and talked to a human within min .
negative	use some on else ........................................
negative	though i paid for a 0 day reservation after_reading your aid on line stating that parking was within two miles of the airport .
negative	upon confirmation of my " full payment " and directions to the hotel , which " now " is four miles from the airport instead of two and i only live one mile from the airport .
negative	i felt i was deceived by your aid , and now you want me to rate you !
negative	you received . mu monies and i didn_'_t was your service due to the .
negative	" false " mileage description !
negative	i rate you deceptive !
negative	beyond 0 , trustpilot .!!
negative	!
negative	booked a room only to be told on arrival the reservation could not be honored .
negative	awful time getting a refund .
negative	do not use this company , so_far no flowers , no refund , 00stbirthday spoilt , awful experience ... even received email sayong delivered to my niece and they were not !!!
negative	! really fed up !!
negative	!
negative	sent a biscuit barrel packed it like it was the crown jewels guess what arrived smashed mail companies where on tv last_week and what a state our mailing service '_s are , they are a joke if a decent mail company set_up they would make a fortune .
negative	dreadful service should be called herpes we would all keep away from them then do not use these people .
negative	was quoted $_00 with insurance and it was too good to be true .
negative	watch out !
negative	no mention of " airport surcharge " at 00_euros , except in tiny fine_print .
negative	people at the budget location in dublin were not helpful and couldn_'_t even give me a final , total price .
negative	ended_up paying over $_000 .
negative	thanks a lot .
negative	i made reservation on line thinking i was making them directly with the hotel as all they show you is reservation_counter .
negative	when i checked out of the hotel i asked for my aaa_discount , the hotel told me i did not make reservations with them so they can '_t give me discount .
negative	they said i made them with expedia .
negative	i called 0 diferent # expedia , talked to some one named frank who said he was from reservation_counter and they deal with expedia and many other agents , he sent me to expedia direct 000 - 000 - 0000 talked with " eiesha " who told me to cal expedia affiliated 0 - 000 - 000 - 0000 they have a continueos recorder going .
negative	every one passed the buck , i could get no one to give me an answer , you are misleading the customer by not identifying yourself as not being from the hotels direct .
negative	i was told be the hotel direct " double tree by hilton hotel in bakersfield , that i could have gotten the same room for $_00 . 00 , and aaa_discount , i paid you people $_000 . 00 plus tax .
negative	and fees $_000 . 00 .
negative	a lesson_learned , i will never book on line again ever .
negative	unhappy customer , louise cinko my email address is " lcinko @_aol . com if you want to reply .
negative	not happy still_waiting for rma_number .
negative	picture of part on box shows pulley . part does not have .
negative	unreliable , would not recommend site to others .
negative	poor response have not heard back from partsgeek to get rma_number so can return .
negative	worthless part without pulley .
negative	advised during ' live_chat ' that standard free delivery only includes delivery to the ground_floor entrance of your property .
negative	so , if you live in a block of flats , even if there is a lift and therefore no stairs involved , you do not quality for free delivery and instead have to order ' room of choice ' delivery .
negative	this is despite the fact that there are no stairs involved and we only wanted the bookcase delivered to our own street door ( which is along a level corridor once you get out of the lifts ).
negative	very poor service .
negative	we spend a lot of time waiting for buses , one time it was 00_minutes , which_meant that we were delayed and couldn_'_t do our next activity .
negative	there seems to be many more buses of the original bus_tour company .
negative	also the guide that did the ghost talk was not very nice .
negative	i asked him where the tour finished , since not all of us were joining the tour because my mother could not walk for 0 hours with the tour .
negative	he could not tell me precisely , which was fair enough , but he made some " clever " remarks pointing_out that my mum was going to walk to the tube and that was far enough and then she certainly could do the tour too .
negative	i would not recommend them specially because of the lack of buses
negative	avoid at all costs !!!
negative	!
negative	absolutely the worst company ever .
negative	ordered a pair of sunglasses and they arrived damaged .
negative	spoke to several customer_service agents and it was still unclear what i was supposed to do .
negative	everything indicated that they sent me a display pair ( was supposed to be brand_new ) and that i would have to pay to send them back with a 00_% restocking_fee ??!!
negative	then when i finally got an answer from a manager she said she couldn_'_t take them back anymore because it had been 00 days ... what ??
negative	?
negative	do not give these people business !!!!
negative	!
negative	this company stinks , do not buy from them .
negative	i researched a specific atv mirror online for the lowest_price i could find .
negative	i found it on dennis kirk ( or so i thought ) for around $_00 and ordered it , paying $ 0 to ship .
negative	when i received it , it was not the mirror pictured on the website .
negative	i sent it back , and they sent me the right one .
negative	then i noticed a $ 0 charge on my credit_card .
negative	when i called , they said the price of the mirror i wanted and thought i had ordered was $ 0 more .
negative	what ?
negative	apparently it is a bait and switch tactic .
negative	a very popular style , hard to find mirror , and you think you have found it for a good price .
negative	most people probably just pay the extra $ 0 but i was p . o . ed .
negative	you would think they would have to honor the price online for the mirror pictured .
negative	i sent it back and emailed them , emphasizing that i expected my refund to include shipping as it was their mistake .
negative	( the wrong mirror pictured .)
negative	they did not disagree , but then did not refund the shipping , saying it was not their error so i can '_t get the shipping back .
negative	what ?
negative	not their error ?
negative	of course it was , the wrong picture was on their site .
negative	their cs fought me over $ 0 , and i even did a charge back which they fought and i am still out the shipping .
negative	i am too tired to continue this over $ 0 .
negative	beware of misleading and bait and switch tactics .
negative	dennis kirk stinks .
negative	the part was as simple as it gets .
negative	the tail_light connector was for a 00 gmc pickup .
negative	but what i received was too small and needed a completely different type of bulb .
negative	they said i had to pay the freight to return the item , which turned_out to be twice as much as the cost of the part .
negative	this was completely an_error on partsgeek '_s part for labeling their parts wrong , causing much expense , stress and inconvenience to customers who trust them to be more concerned_about their business .
negative	first time to use bookit and definitely last time .
negative	i got an_error_message while booking a trip online so i called immediately and i was told the flight portion couldn_'_t be confirmed but the airline will confirm and email you .
negative	nothing happened since then i called the following_day and was told the flight portion of the trip can '_t be confirmed , we will call you in a little_bit after checking with the airlines .
negative	nothing happened , i had to call a third time and i was told we can try looking for different flights ??
negative	?
negative	why was my credit_card charged if you couldn_'_t book the flight for me ?
negative	the last time i remember using travelocity was for a trip in 0000 to ireland and after dealing_with your company i swore i wouldn_'_t do it again ...
negative	apparently , it takes me ten_years to forget these experiences and i was reminded once again .
negative	i purchased a ticket to california ( orange_county ).
negative	since it was for the birth of my sister '_s baby , i paid more so that if need be , i could change the date of my ticket .
negative	the baby arrived late so i called to make the change .
negative	the $_00 travelocity fee was waived , but i was still charged for the $_000 untied fee .
negative	this needs to be clearly_stated for those of us buying a more_expensive ticket for that purpose ... so that was an extra $_000 .
negative	then , my second ticket cost less_than the first and i was to be refund money , but had to pay $_00 to have the voucher sent to me .
negative	in this day and age , there is no reason not to give me an electronic voucher , except to gauge me for the cost of shipping .
negative	and i understand that when i use the voucher , i need to pay to send it back to you , and additionally step and additional money that again , should not be necessary in this electronic age .
negative	after the use of the voucher , i will not use your services again .
negative	that '_s twice in a row you '_ve left a bad taste in my mouth .
negative	i recieved an_email of a supplier with a tracking_number .
negative	the tracking_information said i would get my delivery on 0 / 0 / 00 .
negative	i had arranged for my parcel to be delivered to by husbands place of work so there would be someone there to sign for the parcel .
negative	it was not delivered .
negative	i rung dx to ask where the parcel was and was informed that it was not out for delivery and they would arrange free of charge a morning delivery for today 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	on saturday i checked to make_sure the details had been changed and the tracking_information stated that they had tried delivering the parcel and had left a card to arrange redelivery .
negative	i had informed them on 0 / 0 that there would be no one to receive the parcel on a weekend , hence the arranged delivery for monday .
negative	i emailed dx on saturday , asking why they had tried to deliver the parcel and how could they leave a card when the offices are closed as there is no postbox .
negative	i was emailed back saying it had gone out by mistake and it would be delivered 00 / 0 / 00
negative	husband goes into work today to find the driver had left the notice of delivery stuck in the works gate .
negative	i then ring dx ( as advised on friday ) to check if my parcel is on the van today only for them to call back to say no drivers in our area today but will have it tomorrow 00 / 0 / 00
negative	totaly useless , no one knows what is going on within the company .
negative	why make promises with dates of deliveries if they cant keep to them .
negative	i have now put a complaint into the supplier who used dx to deliver my parcel and will wait to see if i actually will get my parcel .
negative	we booked and paid online as we have done for many car_rentals in the uk .
negative	on arrival we were informed we would be liable for the full cost of the vehicle if lost or damaged as we had no insurance at all .
negative	the insurance was as much as the rental .
negative	we would certainly not use them again .
negative	can not go_anywhere on page without begin ask to buy something ..
negative	your company sucks .
negative	i '_ve contacted you three_times to return a tail_light and you have not contacted me .
negative	you do not have list a phone_number and you have not contacted me to assist with the return .
negative	i want to return the tail_light and want my money back .
negative	recently i ordered a part to be sent to a different address than my billing_address of my credit_card .
negative	however , it was approved without_incident and shipped and received .
negative	i placed a second order yesterday asking the part to be shipped to a different address than the billing_address and now they won_'_t ship until i call my credit_card company and give them all these little details , then i have to wait_until pg calls and gets approval from my ccn company .
negative	i '_m not a new customer !
negative	i requested overnight shipping because i am in dire straights without this part sent immediately .
negative	in fact if this part can '_t be received by tuesday which gives an extra day i do not want it .
negative	specifically order # 00 - 0000000 placed on october 00 , 0000 and have requested overnight and paid for overnight delivery .
negative	my first order was placed on october 00 , 0000 00 - 0000000 .
negative	they had no trouble shipping this order to a different address from the billing_address .
negative	i cannot deal with a company that is so inconsistent in their treatment of customers .
negative	recieved my new camera samsung dv000f ( present ) for someone at the end of january but found seal broken on box and carboard damaged .
negative	sent you my concerns but had no reply from you .
negative	perhaps my last message got lost but not impressed with lack of response .
negative	would i buy from you again no at this moment in time .
negative	i was excited to find a navy nuke t - shirt for my son !
negative	when i received the t - shirt , it looked like someone had printed it off their own computer and ironed it on a cheap hanes t - shirt .
negative	it was blurry and fuzzy .
negative	i did not have enough time to get this child something_else for christmas .
negative	why don_'_t they screen print their shirts ?????
negative	?
negative	for a company that sales online they don_'_t have any online support at all .
negative	they prices are cheap but is not worth the trouble .
negative	i order a pair of sunglasses and the mess up my prescription .
negative	i email the support ( only email ).
negative	got a automated_response saying they got my email .
negative	all week i tried a few_times again until i called that friday .
negative	i got a lady on the phone just saying to scan my prescription and email it to a new email .
negative	even know i said in the subject_line " let_me know you got it " and copy the support email .
negative	nothing .
negative	i originally chose this website because they were the cheapest for the product i wanted ( shanticot bunkbed ) i absolutely regret this now .
negative	it all started with the shanticot supplier calling me !
negative	at this time it was 0 days into the 0 to 00 working days i was promised for it to be delivered in .
negative	so he calls me and tells_me that he hasn_'_t received payment from boohoobaby yet , and obiviously he couldn_'_t send it out to me without being paid first .
negative	i had paid for the item but for some_reason they hadn_'_t paid the shanticot supplier .
negative	he advised me to call them ( i was planning on doing so at this point anyway ) and hopefully that would prompt them into paying and my order then should arrive the following week .
negative	anyway long_story short boohoobaby sent me an_email_stating that my order should arrive on the 00th or 00th of april .
negative	i called the supplier today ( the 00th ) and he told me he just received payment and my order should be with me next week on the 00th .
negative	now bear in mind that i would have been completely in the dark had the supplier not chosen to contact me .
negative	even now i would have been waiting for my order wondering_why on earth it hadn_'_t arrived .
negative	can you believe boohoobaby told me that my order is on its way ?
negative	just before i called the supplier they said it should be with me by 0pm today the 00th .
negative	i placed my order on april the 0nd .
negative	do not use this company , pay that extra to get the customer_service that you deserve .
negative	i most certainly won_'_t be using them ever again
negative	i made my purchase on the 00 / 00 / 0000 it is now 0 / 00 / 0000 and i have not received my goods .
negative	i will never shop_here again !
negative	you take to long to deliver .
negative	get_rid usps now !
negative	i made the reservation on the hotel website to ensure i could cancel or change room type as my daughter is traveling with me .
negative	when i called to change rooms , i was told this was through_expedia and there was a no change / cancellation_policy .
negative	thus , my daughter will be in a completely separate bldg and this is her high_school graduation_gift .
negative	no options or help was offered by the hotel or expedia .
negative	note - i tried making the change immediately .
negative	don_'_t buy anything with expedia ...
negative	i will never purchase anything thru expedia ever again .
negative	tried to cancel a thicket of $_000 that i purchased for my husband , 00 days before the flight and they would not refund my money .
negative	they will sell that thicket for even a higher amount after i cancel , i even offered to pay a cancelation_fee to have some of the amount refunded , but they said no .
negative	that is the tactic here ; for you to not be able to cancel anything , if you do , you are loosing your money and they are making more on you !!!
negative	things happen and circumstances change all the time , so they have to have a conscience that not everyone has money to throw_away on thickets that they won_'_t be able to use !!!!
negative	i lost my money and that is unacceptable to me ...
negative	i urge everyone to go straight to the airline and have that safety_net that if your situation change you will pay a fee and have at_least some of your money back !!
negative	!
negative	poor customer_service in when purchasing and very rude customer_service ( the supervisor was nice and accommodating ( once someone finally connected us ).
negative	then the book sent was not the same isbn that i put into their search_bar and when i brought this the the attention of a customer_service rep , they offered to return but not refund my shipping_charges to return the text .
negative	i will never use this site again .
negative	i should have stayed with the sites i normally use .
negative	i order starlight for my child over 0weeks ago im still_waiting i cant belive that wowcher ignore me !
negative	i reserved a space on line .
negative	but when i got there to pay them , i found that the amount promised was not even close to the amount i would have to write a check for each_month .
negative	i wondered what else they were not telling_me .
negative	i support local businesses with integrity .
negative	therefore , i left without renting there .
negative	i too have fell victim to " becky_s " today .
negative	after taking my money they informed me that my frames were discontinued and that they would send me something different .
negative	after i explained i didn_'_t want something different becky_s because extremely_rude and told me that if i negatively reviewed the company she would call the police in my city because i was harassing her .
negative	harassing ???
negative	i just want my money back !!
negative	extremely unprofessional and will steal your money while blaming you !!!
negative	do not shop_here !
negative	i was disappointed with the quality of the awards .
negative	one of the trophies was broken on arrival and at our awards ceremony , a second trophy broke in the presenter '_s hands as he was about to present it to the recipient - quite embarrassing .
negative	given the efficient customer_service i experienced during the ordering process it was a shame that the goods did not match the service .
negative	i would not order these trophies again .
negative	en itu skærm var et_par uger om at blive totalskadet og_jeg_skulle køre fra grenaa til ålborg for at få kopier af det der lå på_den da den jo mod forventning ikke kom retur
negative	jeg_bor i grenaa og_har_aldrig haft dækningproblemer eller ustabilitet hos tdc med har haft det konstant siden jeg skiftede til ok . på forespørgsel får jeg at vide at der_er problemer_med_en af masterne og at man_ikke ved om telenord laver det snart eller om flere måneder ....... jeg_vil flytte igen meget snart hvis_der_ikke sker noget
negative	parking was not at location expected and as shown on map .
negative	even_though there was a skypark next to the airport which i have previously used .
negative	as a result of a promotion sent from yourselves it was implied this would be the same location and my choice for using you again .
negative	i was unable to use your allocation of parking as this was away from the airport and i would have missed my flight .
negative	as a result i had to find alternative parking at extra_cost of £_00 .
negative	i was very disappointed and let_down by your company and feel i am unable to reccomend you to other travellers .
negative	i ordered a patio table and chairs set from a good company who use xpd as their couriers .
negative	they had specific instructions not to split the delivery and to always get a signature .
negative	i arrived home to find half my delivery outside my front_door with obviously no signature taken .
negative	i complained to the company where i purchased the furniture .
negative	the rest of the delivery arrived the following night and this time was in to sign for it .
negative	unfortunately the table had to be replaced and again the company used xpd .
negative	firstly , they could not find my address , then they said they had delivered it already and finally it arrived 0 days late .
negative	they do not answer their phones either .
negative	totally disorganised and unacceptable
negative	i knew what it was i was looking for and katie provided a good service .
negative	at no time did i receive a paid invoice - i had to ask for one .
negative	i was told to collect the order any time on the monday but was called to ask if i could come in the afternoon .
negative	as this wasn_'_t convenient i agreed that tuesday would be good .
negative	on arrival a customer was just being served by an older assistant ( stuart ?).
negative	i waited for a few_minutes expecting another assistant to be notified of my existence .
negative	as this wasn_'_t forthcoming , i excused myself and asked if i could just collect an order which had been paid for .
negative	i was told to wait 00 - 00_minutes as he was serving someone_else and he was on his own .
negative	i had only popped out of work for a few_minutes and said i was unable to wait .
negative	( i actually train people in customer_service ) the customer said , please serve this lady as it won_'_t take a minute .
negative	i thanked this customer very much and appreciated his understanding .
negative	it was then that stuart made a very unacceptable comment stating ' i wish i could do this in marks and spencer '.
negative	i pointed_out to stuart that m & s would have more assistants on the shop floor to deal with customers .
negative	will i come_back to trophies and models ?
negative	only if they employ people with acceptable customer_service abilities !
negative	have a pair prescription reading_glasses that with broken nose arm / pads and found the opticsfast site on the internet .
negative	i was excited that i would be able to wear these glasses again !
negative	i sent the glasses ups ( two day delivery ) and for over six_weeks , becky continued to say ( in a tone that wasn_'_t appreciated and implying i was stupid ) they had not received them although i had the signature of the person_who received them from ups .
negative	i filed a claim with ups and was ready to chalk this experience as a lesson_learned of internet fraud when i received an_email that they had received my glasses and to follow the link to the estimated cost .
negative	the repair would cost $_000 which seemed somewhat expensive to me .
negative	regardless , i want this over with so i agreed to the service .
negative	it has now been an_additional three_weeks and i have yet to see the glasses .
negative	will never do_business with this company again .
negative	i asked for shipping information and it slips their minds to send it in the mail .
negative	books never got shipped and it came late .
negative	when asked for tracking_info .
negative	i got nothing .
negative	my classes started for spring .
negative	this response from the customer_service was ridiculous because my books were never pulled over a week :
negative	hello and thank_you for contacting us .
negative	i sincerely apologize for the delay and inconvenience .
negative	our system had an_error and cancelled these two books when , in fact , they were still on the shelf waiting to be pulled and shipped to you .
negative	i have located both of the books and will have them shipped to you via expedited first thing tomorrow .
negative	please allow 0 - 0 business days for them to arrive .
negative	if you have any further questions or concerns , please feel free to contact me .
negative	sincerely ,
negative	jessica holsapple
negative	customer experience representative
negative	also , this response after i asked to have my books expedited because i lost points in class for not having the books :
negative	hello and thank_you for contacting us .
negative	unfortunately the books have just been shipped this morning , so i have not yet been provided with the tracking_number .
negative	once i receive the information i will personally email you the tracking_number , most_likely tomorrow .
negative	i apologize you are dissatisfied with our service and that we were not able to upgrade your shipping .
negative	we receive hundred of emails a day and answer them in the order that they are received .
negative	had i known it was needed so soon we could have upgraded the shipping to 0 day , but as that is only allowed in extreme circumstances and i was not aware of the situation i followed our standard procedure of shipping the book expedited .
negative	you should receive your book no later than wednesday 00 / 00 / 00 , however 00_% of our books shipped expedited are delivered in 0 - 0 business days so hopefully you will receive the book sooner .
negative	again i apologize for the inconvenience and delay .
negative	we look_forward to working with you again soon .
negative	if you have any further questions or concerns , please feel free to contact me .
negative	sincerely ,

negative	would never use this service again !!
negative	their systems shut_down tuesday ... after i made a purchase on friday i waited over a week and was just send a refund never recieved posters !
negative	!
negative	i booked 0 tickets for the big_bus_tour on line and started my tour outside madame tussauds with my 0 year_old_grandson .
negative	the man in uniform by the bus directing people asked to see my online tickets and said ' get on !'.
negative	we did so and took the bus which sat in a traffic_jam for 00_minutes .
negative	i noticed that everyone had earphones so i went downstairs and asked the driver where the audio phones were .
negative	' there ' he said abruptly and pointed to a box sitting on a seat .
negative	i returned to my seat with the earphones which were ok although we had to constantly put them back in the ears !
negative	we had a solid traffic_jam to westminster where we decided to get off and try the city cruises trip included in the ticket down the thames .
negative	having been told to get off for city cruises i asked the driver where we picked_up the boat .
negative	' over there !'
negative	he said which could have been anywhere from the london_eye to royal festival hall .
negative	i asked him for more detail and i was told to cross the bridge and find westminster bridge pier .
negative	i did this , got down to the boat where i showed my online ticket , only to be told that it should have been changed for a ' yellow ' ticket when i got on the bus .
negative	i was sent back to a big tour bus which i eventually found on the embankment .
negative	a very rude and discourteous man in charge by the stop told me again i should have been given a yellow ticket but then took 00_minutes before he actually managed to get me one - no apology - just seemed to enjoy making me wait .
negative	i then had to walk back to the boat and a very long_queue .
negative	eventually we got on and had a commentary from the city cruise staff which was critical of about everything we passed ( this is supposed to be promoting london to foreigners !!).
negative	he even said that ' if you want to spend £_000 on a shot of rum , go to the london_eye .
negative	he then asked us to give him money preferably £ 0 when we got off .
negative	we got off at tower pier and never went back on again .
negative	it cost me nearly_£_00 for my grandson and me ( i am 00yrs ) and it was the worst_experience i have ever had in london where i live .
negative	i was totally ashamed of being a londoner and giving foreign visitors such an awful experience .
negative	i was a volunteer during the olympic games and we certainly had a different attitude towards helping people .
negative	i would like this note to be forward to your chief executive and managing_director please and would be grateful for a reply .
negative	i didn_'_t know i was using this site -- thought i was talking direct with the hotel -- then when i cancelled i was only given 0 night pay back -- not that you can keep a full price for one night this is outrageous -- charged me 000 .++++.
negative	i bought a veg slicer and in error i checked out twice .
negative	i emailed straight_away to ask that only one was put through .
negative	a rude glib auto response saying we are busy don_'_t expect a quick reply but don_'_t reemail came back ..... so i checked the t & c of the voucher the order time was not long so i decided to redeem both vouchers as i didn_'_t want to lose one .
negative	then days_later i get a reply saying you can '_t have a refund as you have used the voucher !
negative	!!
negative	i responded but no response ...... apart_from the rude gilb auto response !
negative	its a shame as you have good offerers
negative	just really poor customer_service .
negative	i was so so dissapointed when i ordered and received my latest box of items from amiclubwear .
negative	i ordered 0 pairs or shoes , and none of them fit .
negative	i ordered from there before with no problem and they fit_perfectly but this time every pair was too small and some were damaged as well .
negative	i was not allowed to return them , or exchange them even for stored credit .
negative	00 $ down the drain .
negative	be careful what you by from there is all i can say .
negative	i will definetly think_twice before buying anything from amiclubwear again .
negative	:(
negative	we had advance purchased tickets when we arrived in london .
negative	we waited for a live tour_guide bus for over 00_minutes which never arrived .
negative	we switched to the other side of the road for a taped tour .
negative	upon_arrival the guide hurried us onto the bus , but failed to tell us the bus was full .
negative	no seats on either deck thus we couldn_'_t listen to the tour or see anything .
negative	the tour_guide attendant barked at us to sit_down several_times -- hard to sit when there are no seats .
negative	after a few stops and no one getting off , we left and walked around on our own .
negative	we were very disappointed , a total_waste of our money .
negative	i want a refund !
negative	warning learn from our mistake and don_'_t take a tour !
negative	i used to buy things from play . com around once a month - back in 0000 / 0000 .
negative	however before christmas 0000 i ordered a very expensive game for my brother .
negative	never arrived .
negative	returns process was a nightmare .
negative	asked for a refund and they sent out a new copy instead !
negative	ended_up keeping it , returns process was that bad .
negative	coming up to christmas 0000 i decided to give them another try .
negative	ordered around half a dozen things - received one .
negative	suddenly i started getting refunds for the things i had ordered , without a word of explanation .
negative	they still owe me a fiver , actually , but i just can '_t be bothered .
negative	steer_clear , honestly .
negative	i will never use this site again .
negative	i wanted to reserve two rooms for two_days over easter_weekend .
negative	i got one room reserved in april and the other in may !
negative	and then i was told there would be a penalty to change !
negative	never again .
negative	all contact via_email when ups did get it here and returned it they would not resend the parts i still wanted .
negative	i got a credit - gee i must have wanted the parts or else i wouldn_'_t order them .
negative	i also had given them ups phone_number to insure another attempt .
negative	not happy
negative	travelocity offers bad tickets that cross platforms on multiple carriers which makes it nearly_impossible to change a ticket or get a refund , even when it is the airlines who cancel the flights .
negative	i am now out $_000_dollars because of the east_coast storms and bad terms on behalf of travelocity .
negative	i would recommend southwest for most air travel as it is easy to change flights to work with work and travel schedules .
negative	i took the time and went to the trouble of writing to you when i returned a superdry top , requesting that you refund the postage i have had to pay to return the item .
negative	i explained the reasons that i felt justified my requesting the refund and i have had a refund for the top but no mention of the refund for the postage i have had to pay , ( the top ordered was a xs , for my 00_yr_old but fitted myself , a size 00 !!
negative	totally incorrectly sized ) i do feel this is poor customer_service and feel disappointed in the service i have received .
negative	may i add that i also went to the trouble of completing the survey you requested me to complete and now this !!
negative	not impressed .
negative	i have been trying to validate my account on paypal for months now .
negative	i would love to use paypal and add money onto my account , but no_matter what i do , this issue hasn_'_t been solved .
negative	i believe this is a scam to get money , and i '_m very upset .
negative	i have tried_calling the numbers listed but they don_'_t work .
negative	very dissatisfied costumer .
negative	i bought a dryer and after waiting for several days , i then got a phone_call to say my dryer would not get delivered as it has_been damaged , and was now unuseable .
negative	i was then not offered an_alternative , i was also told i would have to wait several days for my money to be return .
negative	not happy .!!!!!
negative	really bad customer_services !!!!
negative	do not use this company
negative	as soon as i placed an order on petflow ( my first and my last ) i was promised $_00 off my first order of $_00 or more .
negative	i ordered .
negative	$_00 worth and put web00 on my order but $_00 was not subtracted from my total .
negative	i immediately sent an_email to petfow who ignored me
negative	i haven_'_t recieved my order yet , and i ordered it almost two_weeks_ago .
negative	can you please check the status of my order ?
negative	thank_you
negative	my stuff was here for one night .
negative	my laptop and a giant luggage bag packed full of all my clothes that i own were all stolen .
negative	this is not a safe place , this neighborhood is riddled with druggies and thieves .
negative	no survailance cameras to track the thief .
negative	returning the items to denmark from the uk is really expensive even by royal_mail .
negative	the process could easily take up to 0_weeks .
negative	i am still_waiting for my return to be processed after a week and just been told by the company that i could '_ve asked for the specail ups return_label to speed the process up .
negative	after i '_ve spent £_00 . 00 return the items no appology for the lengthy process .
negative	not happy and didn_'_t feel_like a valued_customer at all .
negative	sent the wrong part cost to much for shipping and 00_percent to send back
negative	it is impossible to get anybody in the phone unless you ' re making a new reserbation .
negative	i waited on for hold for an_hour three_times and never spoke to anyone !
negative	they just want your money .
negative	i would have give no stars but that wasn_'_t an option !
negative	i have not received my gift_card yet .
negative	still_waiting .
negative	it was late for my husband '_s birthday even_though the set delivery date was in plenty of time .
negative	where is it ?
negative	when i ordered the book from bookbyte , i accidentally ordered the instructor '_s edition .
negative	i wanted to return the book , but there was no phone_number for me to call , only a live_chat , which was extremely unhelpful .
negative	also the only instructions for returns were for rentals , and i had purchased mine .
negative	i ended_up selling them to a bookstore location for $_00
negative	i '_m ready to file a class action suit against these thieves .
negative	if you ' re on board , mail me at ltbl @ juno . com .
negative	they send me outdated cartridges which my printer and computer won_'_t accept nor print with .
negative	i call them and they won_'_t take my call .
negative	i email them and they don_'_t respond .
negative	forget using this company unless you want to be stolen from .
negative	i recently tried to book a hotel using your site .
negative	i was booking two rooms so received an two emails_confirming my reservations .
negative	when i opened them i noticed they were for the wrong date .
negative	assuming i had made an_error , i quickly cancelled the rooms and rebooked them , making sure i had the correct date .
negative	when i received the new emails , they once again had the wrong date .
negative	i cancelled them and called the hotel direct and booked our rooms .
negative	i '_ve never had problems booking on - line before .
negative	took my order ( and payment ) then let_me know that the goods were out of stock , will have to wait up to 0 days for refund .
negative	ordered a themostat for my mercedes r000 .
negative	the next_day i received an_email that my card was charged and later that day i received another email that the part was back ordered and my money was being refunded .
negative	wasted 0 days of my time .
negative	had to ordered the part elsewhere .
negative	this website is seriously ridiculous .
negative	they make tons of excuses and try to give you evidence that your glasses are being made , processed , prepared and even sent out , but it '_s been ages since i placed my order and over a month since they said it was ready , and i fully believe i will never get the glasses i paid for .
negative	the customer_service reps reply back pretty quickly , but they dont help you at all , just take you further down a wild goose hunt .
negative	even if i end up receiving my glasses after all this , i '_m pretty sold that this website is a scam
negative	be wary about this company .
negative	i think that they are deliberately scamming people by pushing people to use their premium_rate call lines to sort out problems and creating delaying tactics so that too much time has passed to get a refund , please see below a shortened ( honestly ) account of my experiences .
negative	i placed an order for a tap and waste on 00th_oct .
negative	00th_oct i got an_email_saying the tap was found to be damaged in the warehouse ( a common excuse looking at other reviews ) and that they were out of stock even_though they were still selling it online .
negative	00th_oct i got an_email_saying my order had been dispatched !!
negative	!
negative	i raised a case with their help desk asking for clarification and got the reply
negative	' i can confirm that your item has_been despatched with our courier yodel .
negative	all of our items should be delivered within 00_hours , so if you have not received your items please let us know so that we can chase this with yodel '
negative	they closed the case .
negative	0st nov still no order so i raised another case asking where my order was .
negative	0th nov replied saying system was updating and they would get back to me
negative	0th nov reply saying courier lost the parcel and it would be resent
negative	00th_nov still no order contacted them
negative	00th_nov got this response ' unfortunately , when our quality control team where inspecting your astini sligo chrome bathroom basin sink mixer_tap hb0 to make it ready for packing they have found substantial damage around the item and initial packaging so have deemed it as unsellable .
negative	our logistics team have contacted the manufacture to get a replacement and have found that this item will no_longer be manufactured - so we cannot get further supply of it .'
negative	sounds a bit familiar !!!
negative	!
negative	00th_nov i responded ' you have already used this excuse a week after you confirmed the product was sent and it was still on the website for sale ( see other call raised .
negative	i consequently have no faith in your company please give me a full_refund '
negative	00th_nov they responded ; i can confirm that the order has now been fully cancelled and refunded .
negative	i can confirm the funds will be back in your account in the next 0 - 0 working days .

negative	bought a dress a week and a half before a party , paid the extra $ 0 . 00 and the party has_been and gone still no sign of the dress .
negative	said its attempted delivery 0 times at bizarre hours including 0am but apparently no one was home which is pretty confusing considering i '_m a stay at home mum always home .
negative	will not use again .
negative	they sell products to customers that are not in stock !!
negative	they don_'_t even have the decency to send the customer an e_- mail or call to tell them that the product they requested is out of stock .
negative	when you do try to call them or ask a question about the item you ordered , you can '_t even get a hold of a person , you have to fill_out a form and then wait a few_days for them to get back with you .
negative	thanks for ruining a birthday_present , by the time i found out that it was not in stock , it was too late to order it from somewhere_else for it to be here in time for his_birthday .
negative	the sizing on this harness was wrong .
negative	i brought a med for my border terrier and found it to be way too small .
negative	i did contact the seller to let them know but did not get a reply !
negative	i have given the harness to a freind who has a very small jack_russell dog and it only just fit his dog .
negative	a waste of my time , and my money .
negative	sizing wrong , no reply from seller , don_'_t bother wasting your time , buy something_else

negative	very disappointed with cjs keys i received code but could not collect keeps saying i '_ve tried too many_times
negative	i bought two michael_kors watches neither of which keep proper time .
negative	i have tried changing the batteries which is a big nuisance in a brand_new product .
negative	since they still dont work i am waiting for instructions on how to return them .
negative	this is my first experience of the site .
negative	i will not use it again .
negative	i did exactly_what it said but my phone right now is just a pretty brick .
negative	it will not read my sim_card at all .
negative	i had to go out and buy a different phone .
negative	hope you have better luck than me .
negative	we just have a terrible experience booking at expedia ... it took about 0 whole hours of our family time ( all evening )- to book , talk without_any understanding ( except one representative called kino ) with many expedia representatives , and they are not honored to solve our issue ... we wanted to book flight and hotel package for 0 days during following kid '_s spring_break .
negative	we selected hotel , all flights and it was showing up on their website really good fare ... until ... you entering all information from your credit_card ... then , on the next page - we find another price for more than ...$ 0 , 000 more the price selected !!!
negative	we closed the browser and tried again to start over 0 times - and every time - have same thing ...
negative	the way we understood it - possible bug or something_else ... the fourth time the expedia representative kino did it from his computer - with same booking hotel and flights - and .. he got same thing ... he direct us to next supervisor and then - to many of them ... wasting the time ... finally we did another reservation for 0 days instead 0 days and it all was worked for that time , but not extra vacation day ... were very disappointed with expedia customer_service .
negative	expedia is not honored their prices !!
negative	!
negative	dissatisfied booking throw this " reputative " expedia website !!!!

negative	on saturday 00st june i placed my first ever asda order after the horrendous week i have since waiting for my order to be delivered by them , it most definitely will be my last order .
negative	my order was due to be delivered on the following_monday , around an_hour before the scheduled time_slot i received a call from the driver to tell me the van had broken down and that i will not be receiving my items , i was then told that they were not rescheduling and that the order had been cancelled .
negative	i contacted asda '_s ( awful ) contract centre who are based in south_africa , they are very good at apologising and that '_s pretty_much all .
negative	they re - placed my order and gave_me a whole £ 0 off for the inconvenience ( whoopee ) this was due on wednesday 00th_june between 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 .
negative	this time_slot came and went and still no delivery .
negative	i called the call_centre again and am told it is most definitely out for delivery and please be patient ( my oder is already late ) and as i had not been contacted to be advised why they were running_late my call will be escalated and i will receive a managers call back the next_day .
negative	the next_day i wake_up and find a voice_mail on my phone , this was left at 00 : 00 from the asda delivery driver informing_me he was outside and that i had 0 minutes to answer the door and accept the delivery or he was cancelling my order .
negative	i waited_patiently for the promised call - back , this never came .
negative	i called the contact centre again and was advised they had to contact the store and the home shopping manager would call me back , this never happened , i called the call_centre again , and was advised again they have escalated my case and the manager will call me back , again this did not happen .
negative	i finally got through the the asds isle of dogs branch myself yesterday 00th_june and spoke with a team leader in the home shopping section who could not believe everything that had happened to date and that he personally was going to resolve this for me , i waited a few hours and when i didn_'_t hear back from him i called back again .
negative	he didn_'_t really give me an explanation as to what happened but as a goodwill_gesture he would send an e_- credit of £_00 to my account , but unfortunately he himself could not re - place me order due to security_reasons .
negative	so off i go again back to the call_centre to re - place my order .
negative	this is where i thought it would finally be resolved , we placed the order again and delivery was due for today between 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 .
negative	as i did not trust asda at 00 : 00 today i checked the status of my order and your guessed it cancelled with no notice .
negative	the rubbish call_centre have told me there is nothing they can do we need to speak to the store , i call the store and am told by the worst customer_service manager i have ever_dealt_with that she has a headache and has had a million of these calls today , apparently the home shopping manager is on holiday ( yes they only have one ) she was so useless i told her to go take a pain killer and get some rest as clearly she has a very stressful job which she is useless at she then hangs_up on me , finally i get to speak to the store manager craig who told me " nah no orders have been cancelled today " umm i think you will find mine has .
negative	so i am sitting at home waiting for craig to call me back ( which i doubt he will ) to advise what the is going on .
negative	update_: craig called back and has resolved this for me , top guy thanks craig
negative	i should of dropped this ages ago but as i am sure a lot of people reading this have felt in the past , sometimes you have to prove a point dig your heals in and stick with it .
negative	so would i recommend asda , never in a million years .
negative	good luck !
negative	i ordered tow tyr racing suits which arrived_promptly , however after returning one and receiving an e_- mail to say it would be refunded back to my account within 00 working days .
negative	a month later i am still_waiting ??
negative	this is not the service i am used to from your competitors and i am now losing patience !
negative	if i have not received the e_- mail by the end of the week i may involve my card company under section 00 .
negative	in my view this is poor service and would lead me not to use this website again !
negative	!
negative	sorry to click on the one - star .
negative	i only wanted to contact you to say the part hasn_'_t come in , and have you check to see where it is .
negative	thank_you !

negative	this company is terrible !!!!
negative	i was excited to find a pair of sunglasses i wanted on this website .
negative	when i received them i realized they were the wrong style , and were too large for my face .
negative	when i emailed '
negative	[_name removed_] about this she said i did order those ones .
negative	when in fact i ordered the ones i knew i did as i kept double checking i was purchasing the right ones !
negative	since then it has_been almost 0 months and after many emails sent i have not heard back from them !!!!
negative	they are a very rude company and would not recommend buying from them !
negative	!
negative	the website was impossible to use on an iphone as it kept divertin to a picture of the verisign logo .
negative	i had to refresh the page to get back to where i was , and even then it still didn_'_t work .
negative	the only_reason i persevered was because of a discount_code on the product .
negative	i had to attempt the transaction five times .
negative	i wouldn_'_t use the site again knowing this as it was very frustrating .
negative	i don_'_t have these problems on other_websites .
negative	my order came a week too late and the cartridges were half full i was very disappointed
negative	in this company please send me a replacement order free of charge
negative	theresa c riper
negative	my cat is on the royal_canine kidney feed or should i say was .... i waited for 00 days for this order and had to feed something_else .
negative	this weekend i put lenny down .
negative	his kidney levels had elevated and was very sick .
negative	not sure if it was his time or being i did not have his food it sent him over the edge .
negative	i will not need anything in the future from this company .
negative	after calling many_times the excuse was they had changed hands and needed the prescription again which was on file !!
negative	!
negative	nothing works and i will never shop there again
negative	i bought an ab roller from this company ,( uk_sport imports ) when it arrived it was broken . i e_- mailed the company immediately and recieved an_automated reply .
negative	two_days_later e_- mailed again , same reply so rang the following evening to be told to ring in the morning , so i rang in the morning to be told it was too late as damages had to be reported within 00_hours , i told the lady i had e_- mailed ( as it tells you to do on website )
negative	the product was broken and the wrong instructions were with it .
negative	i spoke to the manager who was just as un helpful .
negative	so i wrote to the company manager who just passed the letter back to a girl i had already spoken to .
negative	i wrote again and was told the could replace item , i did not want this , just my money back , but though might aswell , when it arrived it also had wrong instructions in and was damaged .
negative	so basically i wasted phone_calls , e_- mails , letters ans a full day off work waiting in for a replacement which was in as bad a state as the first .
negative	so is now in the bin
negative	product was awful and the staff were very unhelpful .
negative	first off , i paid an extra 00 dollars in shipping to get here on time .
negative	i was supposed to be 0 days it ended_up being 0 days .
negative	i tried to call customer_service for help .
negative	i spoke to 0 people that were very rude .
negative	i ask to speak to the supervisor and the guy said he was the supervisor when i asked for his employee number he put me on hold for almost an hr so i hung_up .
negative	very dissatisfied .
negative	i couldn_'_t sign in and wasn_'_t helped with a fix !
negative	i had a problem with a trip package and wanted to request info regarding changing the itinerary .
negative	got put on hold , transferred to 0 separate departments , given another number to call and all this for over three total hours of frustration !!!
negative	got several suspicious excuses : you have the wrong department , we are having problems with our system , you have a " packaged " ticket ( husband and myself with tickets and car ) and i need to transfer you to that department to be told when someone finally answered the phone that i again was told i was in the wrong department !!!!!
negative	did not get a price for the vehicle i rented and waited for over an_hour to have a " customer_support " person tell me that don_'_t ever detail that info at the time of purchase ..... really !!???
negative	thinking to do an end run_around all this i attempted to get an_email support response ....... got an_automated_response that they rec ' d my question and would be in contact with me within 00_hours ..... hasn_'_t happened yet and i ain '_t holdin ' my breath !
negative	i will never got through_travelocity to book travel again .
negative	the most insulting part of this for me is that the phone triage system for support is not even in this country so questions that require more specific knowledge beyond the scripted responses are never forthcoming .
negative	unfortunately when traveling with an infant travelocity advises you to contact the airline_directly ( after purchasing your ticket .)
negative	well these are not the terms when flying with british airways .
negative	they will only speak to the booking agent .
negative	even_though the child flies for free they are still issued a ticket and there are taxes to pay .
negative	in this case travelocity was my agent .
negative	after a 00 minute phone_call travelocity was still unable to help me !
negative	fortunately ba partners with american_airlines and they were able to issue my son a ticket .
negative	they also advised me not to book through a third_party and always book directly with an airline !
negative	travelocity - never again .
negative	slow shipping then received the wrong part took 0 days to actually make contact with the company .
negative	web_site was always down phone_calls with 0 minute wait time to sit on hold for 00 - 00_minutes and get disconnected .
negative	the part was order for a go kart repair for one of our clients , gaurented to be ready for pick_up in 0 days .
negative	we are now on week 0 from date of purchase .
negative	still no part .
negative	i know the incorrect part was received back but now email comfirmation on shipment of the correct_part .
negative	this issue when all said and done will cost me price of part and $_000 . 00 in pick_up / delivery and labor charges . i do not recommend this company
negative	i was sent the wrong part and i have to pay to return their mistake .
negative	i have to wait 00 business days for credit .
negative	i bought the ticket on liune for my son and girlfriend buy one dayy get one free
negative	he was made to pay again he was told his online ticket was invald .
negative	thae whole_experience was a let_down .
negative	would not book again
negative	damaged product .... poor customer_service to sort out .
negative	one stop_shopping on travelocity is convenient until you have a question or concern .
negative	then good luck !
negative	if you have a question and try to contact someone , they just pick a key word out of your question and use a blanket copy and paste message hoping that will solve your issue without actually reading what your real question is .
negative	you can go back and forth which gets you no where .
negative	then when you call their customer_service line , the people that answer don_'_t have a care in the world about what you are trying to explain to them .
negative	they just assume they know what you are talking_about without actually listening .
negative	no different then their e_- mail customer_service .
negative	they pick key words and run with it without actually listening .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	i have used travelocity many_times without_having questions , so was completely unaware of how poor their customer_service is until now .
negative	i will not be using travelocity again for this reason .
negative	having ordered a product
negative	almost 00 days on and it still has not arrived
negative	having enquired_about the delivery by email i received no response
negative	i spent my money elsewhere .
negative	my nieces birthday_present was late because it declined my order saying the information was incorrect and it is not .
negative	i put both numbers needed for account and so i know it was correct .
negative	my niece recieved her gift_card 0 days late because of this and i am never late on her_birthday .
negative	bad service and i was embarassed .
negative	we are a multi pet house hold , we have parrots , bunnies , chinchillas , degus and a horse !
negative	feedem offer excellent customer_service and good value for money .
negative	many of our pets are rescue / rehome cases and we need to offer optimum_nutrition at sensible prices .
negative	give them a try , you won_'_t be sorry .
negative	you have to pay for a credit_report .
negative	the posters are great good sizes and the calenders are nice however the customer_service is rubbish and so is the delivery do not bother to phone the customer_service number because no one rings you back and you pay for wasted phone_calls .
negative	send a email and some one will get back to you in a couple of days and if they tell you they have sent out your posters in 00_hours thats a lie it takes about a week and it took a week of complaining to get a calender which was ordered the same day as the posters .
negative	and a sarcastic email was the reply i got back i wont be ordering from gb_posters again .
negative	aanvulling op_mijn review van hieronder .
negative	het is inmiddels november .
negative	ik_heb nooit een reaktie ontvangen op_mijn diverse mails .
negative	per telefoon is screengurad niet bereikbaar .
negative	ik zag zojuist dat_de site helemaal offline is .
negative	oplichters die nu met_de buit zijn gevlogen ?
negative	needed to cancel , paid the $_00 . 00 ins .
negative	coverage , now i have to jump_through way too many hoops to cancel when i just booked and our hotel stay isn_'_t for another three_months .
negative	i better get my money back !
negative	i had wonderful service with the staff and no_problems with payment with budget storage on 00 ave n in st . petersburg , fl .
negative	extra space storage bought out budget storage in january_0000 and i have had nothing but problems with payment and correspondence with the parent company .
negative	the local staff has_been very helpful through the change and unfortunately have no control over the incompetence of the parent company .
negative	the changing over of the computer system has had difficulty from day one , which , in turn , has ( after 0 months ) continued to have incorrect billing .
negative	the staff tries to correct the problem but each_month , i continue to be billed incorrectly .
negative	i have repeatedly asked not to have a postcard reminder , which charges a fee on top of rental fee .
negative	the main company continues to send postcards .
negative	my charges are paid through an auto - pay system but i still receive emails asking for payment online .
negative	the buy out has_been a disaster on many levels and i am_currently very unsatisfied with the parent company and feel sorry for the staff working under conditions of a parent company , which continue to be incompetent .
negative	i do not recommend using extra storage and am looking for an_alternative arrangement for storing my belongings .
negative	do not use this site !!!!!!!!!!!
negative	! when you call to cancel any reservations the number they give you for your itinerary dose not match the numbers when you try to call to and cancel your reservation .
negative	i will never ever use them again and hell yes i want my money back !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

negative	ordine 00000 del 00 / 00 / 0000 , attendo il rimborso da tre mesi dopo ripetute mail alle quali mi si rispondeva che l ' ufficio contabilita ' stava provvedendo .
negative	e ' una vergogna , e pensare che al primo ordine sembravano quasi seri .
negative	sono senza parole , speriamo che_non sia una truffa e di rivedere i miei soldi prima o poi !
negative	!
negative	after_reading other reviews it appears this is common_practice for them .
negative	so that tells_me it is totally a scam !!
negative	do not use this service !!!!
negative	i repeat do not !!!
negative	my son , who is currently serving in afghanistan just bought a ticket for his post deployment leave .
negative	while doing so with this site he received a " declined " status .
negative	which has since been clarified on what it means .
negative	not the ticket status but the insurance even_though there is not one word or statement about insurance nest to the declined field .
negative	being that his connection there is not the best he figured it did not go through so he went to a different site & successfully purchased the exact_same ticket with the same airline for the same dates & times .
negative	turns_out flight hubs ticket actually went through .
negative	they would not refund his $$ & are only offering a credit .
negative	however trying to use that credit to purchase a ticket for a different travel date has_been like pulling_teeth .
negative	i was told today i had to call back m - f during business hours to take_care of it because apparently now they have to have some_sort of waiver code before they can make the change .
negative	i called the airline and yes they do need to waiver code .
negative	however they can speak to anyone at anytime to get that code not just m - f during business hours .
negative	it was close to 0 o ' clock and flighthub closes at 0 est on sunday .
negative	i '_m guessing the agent was ready to go home and didn_'_t want to do her job by calling the airline to get that code .
negative	unbelievable !!!
negative	it upsets me that when it comes to our military who have been away from home for many months & are anxious to get home , that when issues like this arrive they are given a hard time .
negative	flighthub could have just refunded the $$, instead they chose to make it difficult to rectify the situation .
negative	a situation that would not have occured if their site would not have shown him a big red " declined ".
negative	so again do not use this service !!!
negative	!
negative	i made the order on 0 / 0 / 00 , and finally got the product on 0 / 00 / 00 -- one and a half months later !
negative	the company said the first order went out ok in january but for some unknown_reason , it was shipped back to the company without ever contacting me .
negative	i had to call in early february to ask the status and to have the order shipped again .
negative	due to the company '_s mistake , you ' d think my order would have been expedited -- but noooo !.
negative	sent by normal process that didn_'_t arrive until feb . 00 .
negative	no offer of compensation either .
negative	will go with a competitor next time .
negative	the product did nothing for my pet and i spent over $_000 ... very disappointed
negative	i waited two_days for my parcel to be collected , was originally supposed to be collected on monday 00th_march but never did , i rang twice tuesday had an_apology and was promised it would be collected with out fail tuesday before 0 . 00 , and guess what it never did , finally after another 0 phone_calls it '_s was collected wed will not be using this service again
negative	ordered my son '_s christmas_presents and was told they would arrive on 00 / 00 .
negative	on 00 / 00 i called them and found out that my order is still in production and may ship out on 00 / 00 .
negative	are they serious ?
negative	thanks a lot for the embarrassment , now you can keep your stuff .
negative	shame on you and bah humbug !
negative	when i placed my order it said it did not go thur placed it again and a few_days_later there where 0 charges on my bank_statement , your customer_service said that it did not take on your end
negative	when i received my order these items where broken you needed to where a size 0 to get your foot into the shoes because there was not a zipper to get your foot into a size 00 shoe the flats with the buttoms they had a zipper but the zipper where broken it had sales items no return they where seven dollars now they are four i see why
negative	black ankle strap flats faux_leather 0 pair
negative	brown ankle strap flats faux 0 pair
negative	ankle strap flats buttons on the side 0 pair
negative	i could understand if one item was broken but something was wrong with all five
negative	i recently ordered 0 jars of raw macadamia nut butter which when opened were somewhat rancid .
negative	i called customer_service 0 times and was unable to talk to anyone , however i did leave a message each time .
negative	i did not get a response to either call so emailed them .
negative	i did not get a response to that either .
negative	i mailed the 0 jars back to them with the invoice and it was then that i got an_email_telling_me that i had not returned the jars within 00 days and they would only give me credit for 0 of the jars i had returned .
negative	i emailed customer_service and explained that my returns were based on the quality of the product which was unusable and not just a change of mind and i felt i should be reimbursed for all 0 jars as i had made several_attempts to talk to them .
negative	i have still not received a response and i have not been reimbursed on my latest credit_card statement .
negative	customer_service does not appear to be poor .
negative	it appears to be nonexistent .
negative	one item never sent out and refund not received as requested , also not very helpful in assisting_me with getting my refund .
negative	worst online shopping_experience i have ever had and i will not be shopping here ever again
negative	my payment was confirmed on september 00th and still no product !!!
negative	where are my items ??
negative	?
negative	today at 00 : 00 am
negative	i have a problem with the items i purchased .
negative	i was thought to believe that they were going to either black or dark charcoal .
negative	they are a lightish blueish color .
negative	when i put the window down i can not put the window right back up .
negative	i have to push at the covers in order for the window to go up .
negative	they actually are a piece of crap that i paid allot of money for .
negative	i would like new ones sent to my house at no expense or a credit put back on my credit_card .
negative	the only_thing i did like about this whole_transaction was i got them the very next_day .
negative	please comply with my wishes or i will have to contact my credit_card company to put a hold on payment for thease items .
negative	pissed and unhappy
negative	constance muraresku mchale
negative	i ordered the wrong wheel and i cost me dearly .
negative	shipping and restocking over $_00 . 00 .
negative	so i will not be ordering again .
negative	easier to go to tire shop and order it .
negative	ordered from website w_/ 0day shipping .
negative	when the order was complete it did not show the 0 day shipping .
negative	i immediately sent an_email regarding the problem .
negative	i was told there was nothing they could do to help me and i would just have to wait for the item .
negative	it was partsgeek website that made the mistake but they would not fix it .
negative	will not order from this company again .
negative	i was approached one day by a service rep for networx systems to use their leads program .
negative	i was hesitate at first , but the sales_rep ( anthony ) was very polite and convinced me to use the service .
negative	in the first month i received 00 leads , but we were only able to close 0 .
negative	during the second month we received 00 , but we were only able to speak with 0 on the phone and closed 0 .
negative	around this time , i was a couple_hundred_dollars in the hole and decided that i no_longer wanted to use their services .
negative	i emailed requesting that my contract be terminated as is my right because i signed a month to month contract and was doing so in the time_frame provided .
negative	i was informed i would receive a phone_call the following_day to discuss the termination of my contract .
negative	this morning i received said phone_call from service rep ( paul ) and oh_boy it was not what i expected .
negative	we started off the phone_call with me explaining why i no_longer wanted to use their services to which he countered with the fact that i wasn_'_t using the correct " formula " to reach his customers .
negative	he then proceeds to tell me that everyone else can do it ( mind you they only have a 00_% closing rate ) and that i needed to do it like he just explained and i would have better results .
negative	after this , i once again politely asked for my contract to be terminated to which he countered with " you are an impossible case and you need an open mind to work with my customers which you obviously don_'_t have "... after that , i politely asked for my contract to be terminated once again and told him i looked forward to receiving my confirmation in my email .
negative	i would never suggest this company to anyone because as far as i '_m concerned , bullying is not an appropriate or professional sales tactic .
negative	we paid over_£ 0000 for rattan furniture from corban direct -- and waited in all one day for the delivery -- to no_avail .
negative	they never called to apologise , or to tell us that they had supply problems -- and i don_'_t know how long they ' d have held onto our money had we not complained .
negative	not a good experience .
negative	not a trustworthy company .
negative	i ordered a racquet , with which i hardly played during one day before_deciding that it lacked sufficient power .
negative	i contacted tennisnuts and got a sympathetic response from one of their public relations people , suggesting that a refund was possible .
negative	however , i then received a note from another rep . suggesting that it would ' cost £_00 ' to repair the grip ( hang on , we all know how much a new grip costs , right ?-- perhaps £ 0 ?)
negative	and about the same to repair damage to the frame ( i '_m a middle - aged woman , playing in the most advanced class in the bromley tennis centre , playing doubles , and not in the habit of damaging frames !!)
negative	in other words , their ( second ) representative decided , living at my postcode , that i could_afford to pay over_£_00 for , um , nothing .
negative	have heard_nothing since .
negative	customer_service ?
negative	what customer_service ?
negative	my advice is to steer well clear of this lot .
negative	i have recently had an_issue with one of the hotels we booked and getting a refund on our stay , the hotel said we have to call bookit and have them resolve the issue since we didn_'_t book directly through the hotel .
negative	so , we called bookit , waited on hold 00_minutes to get through to a live_person , only to be disconnected shortly_after getting through , and do you think that after they verified my information and started talking_about the problem that they called me back ?
negative	no , so we had to call and wait 00_minutes to talk to someone again .
negative	we were disconnected after being placed on hold 0 times .
negative	by that time we were livid and gave up for the day .
negative	the following_day , we called again to try to get the issue_resolved , we were told it would be 00_hours , that was over a week_ago .
negative	if we would have booked straight through the hotel , we would have gotten refunded immediately .
negative	the hassle is not worth the savings .
negative	i asked a simple question about baggage rate giving the details & my e_- mail address & not even a peep out of customer_service .
negative	it '_s almost_half a day old .
negative	last weekend my husband and i purchased a comforter set from a macy '_s department store .
negative	the comforter was wrapped in a vinyl zip wrap and as soon i i got home , i opened it - and as soon as i opened the package , it smelled like 00 smokers were in the bag ( both my husband and i are ex - smokers ).
negative	the workers are clearly smoking in the storeroom .
negative	i contacted customer_service through their website and still_haven_'_t heard back .
negative	thank_goodness i didn_'_t spend more money there ...
negative	i now know to shop locally for such items so they can be easily returned .
negative	check out everything before you leave the store ......... lesson_learned !
negative	the worst service i have ever had , anywhere .
negative	the customer_service people would not answer a few simple questions i had , once there was a problem with my original order .
negative	i had to ask questions three , four times and to date most are still unanswered .
negative	the wrong item was sent and now they ignore every attempt i make to contact them to solve the problem .
negative	incredibly unprofessioanal and unhelpful !!!!
negative	!
negative	i placed an order on 0 / 00 and never received it .
negative	my card was charged for the purchase and i added 0 - day priority because i had just a few tablets left of my essential supplements .
negative	i just realized that my card was credited the purchase amount - less the $ 0 . 00 shipping upgrade , so i tracked the order to find out that it was " undeliverable as addressed " and returned .
negative	all of my information is correct , and i received an order from the vitamin_shoppe the same day with no problem .
negative	can '_t imagine what the problem was and have not received any word from pureformulas .
negative	so , now i '_m completely out of vitamins , and out of $ 0 . 00 i paid for shipping .
negative	very dissapointed
negative	bait and switch , don_'_t use them .
negative	they lie !
negative	part was delivered as_promised ; although damaged .
negative	my mechanic opened the box it was delivered in and opened the box the part was in and it was immediately visible that the plastic cover on top of the alternator was shattered .
negative	all of this was done and report within_00hrs of delivery !
negative	since then i have not been able to speak with anyone .
negative	since 0 / 00 / 0000 i have sent a support_ticket daily to rectify the situation .
negative	all i want is for partsgeek to send me a shipping label so i can return the damaged part and have them deliver another part or give me a refund .
negative	i '_ve been asked to send pics of the damaged part - i sent four pics .
negative	why can '_t the call me ?
negative	i am at the point if i do not get this matter cleared_up , to call the da in the county and bbb and my lawyer and if need be to get my refund , the fraud department at my bank .
negative	i just bought a $_000 dress for my sisters wedding and have never seen something so poorly man and put_together .
negative	it was ripped and frayed before the wedding was even over .
negative	i was the maid - of - honor !
negative	i can not believe for that much money how cheap of material it was .
negative	product broken , hassle to return and kept waiting 00_mins on the phone befor getting a answer
negative	i will not be using your website again .
negative	delivery was a nightmare - totally inflexible for someone_who works 0 - 0 .
negative	courier service was rude and unnecessarily complicated to coordinate delivery .
negative	i chose the cheapest delivery option but , when delivered , ups demanded nearly_£_00 ' import vat ' & ' brokerage surcharges '.
negative	not happy .
negative	they don_'_t care about their customers .
negative	i asked for a jacket and i paid it and then you didn ´ t have it and the refund is less_than i payed .
negative	i payed 000 gb ( 000_euro ) and in my account the refund is 000_euros .
negative	i ordered from amiclubwear for the first time this summer and had no_idea what i was in for .
negative	i had ordered size 0 shoes , and for one pair , i got a left size 0 and the right a size 0 or 0 . 0 .
negative	i '_m not sure exactly_what the size was , but my foot would simply not fit into it .
negative	the sticker said both were eights , but mother nature does not lie .
negative	i figured it was an innocent mistake , and requested an_rma_# to return the pair .
negative	after paying $ 0 to return a pair of $_00 shoes , i emailed 0_weeks_later to see if they had received the shoes .
negative	the staff kept saying they had not processed them yet .
negative	then suddenly today , i received the shoes back , with a sticker on the box syaing " refused , box damaged , cannot be resold ".
negative	i couldnt_believe it .
negative	the box had been crumpled up and torn apart in some places .
negative	it was obvious they had opened the box and decided they didn_'_t have the shoe in stock anymore , then refused to accept the return .
negative	the box was in perfectly fine condition when i mailed it , and nevertheless , nowhere on their return_policy , does it state that a box must be in pristine_condition .
negative	on top of that , since when can a store not accept a return because a box is crumpled ?
negative	as if they have exactly one box for each pair of shoes ?
negative	even if the box had been gleaming , it woulld have postage_stamps all over it so this was no less , a bull s ** t excuse .
negative	i called ami clubear 0 times in the past hour , after a 00_mins wait , the staff_member listened to me explain my issue calmly and then hung_up on me .
negative	0 times .
negative	the second time around i thought the call as dropped but after the third time i realized she was hanging up on me .
negative	on top of that , i have relaized that amiclubear is a scam because if you try calling their number from the same phone more than twice , the operator tells you that you call cannot be completed as dialed .
negative	somehow , they have set it up so that you cannot call them more than twice .
negative	try it and hear for yourself .
negative	it didn_'_t occur to me until today , when i realized the same thng happened the last time my calls ere getting " dropped ".
negative	i ill never order from this site again .
negative	i should have searched for reviews before ordering , not now , after wasting $_00 and having nothing to show for it .
negative	ladies , it is not worth it to risk spending $_00 and end up spending $_00 for thin air .
negative	that '_s what vegas is for .
negative	from now on , i will review online sites before ordering , and likely order only name_brand items .
negative	another warning ** after this sour experience , i was thinking to myself " at_least i still have on source of affordable , cute shoes online - urban original ( urbanog . com )".
negative	but ladies , as i was searching on google for reviews , i saw the address for amiclubear ( city of industry , ca ) and clicked to see the reviews .. only to find reviews for urban original .
negative	thats when i read the " about us " section of both sites and realized they were the same company !!!
negative	what a scam !!!
negative	i dare you to read the " about us " section of both sites , they both list " 0 reasons to shop at amiclubear / urban original " and they are exactly the same list !!
negative	!
negative	please be very careful ordering from these sites .
negative	i have never reviewed a site before but i am so irate , that i cant let this happen to other people .
negative	i have attached pictures of my package which i received about 0 . 0 hrs ago now , and i '_m still in shock .
negative	they damaged the box to claim that was the reason for return , but if they couldnt accept damaged boxes , why bother opening to see what was inside ?
negative	i took pictures to show where the tape is broken .
negative	please be careful people .
negative	i ordered bookmarks as thank_you gifts for a volunteer project .
negative	not one single bookmark was centered correctly .
negative	inkgarden notes that there are cut lines , but the presumption would be that the cut lines would still be centered on the artwork .
negative	i can '_t think of a single person that would want a bookmark , notecard , stationery , etc .
negative	that isn_'_t centered .
negative	you wouldn_'_t purchase a product at a store that isn_'_t centered , so i can '_t imagine why anyone would want to produce something off - center either .
negative	what '_s the point ?
negative	this was a big_disappointment .
negative	worst company ever !
negative	i am closing my account and will never use or have anything to do with paypal again .
negative	my money was taken from my paypal_account and given back to the buyer .
negative	and also i was left without my item that i had previously sent to him .
negative	unprofessional to settle a case no more trust to this scam company ,
negative	the president of company leaves 0000 $ tips to restaurant using '' holding money '' of sellers and '' charge backs '' of small business that trying to make so hard this money .
negative	shame on you .
negative	they booked me a room and when i went to the hotel , the hotel didn_'_t have any available rooms .
negative	i called and was told there was no cancelations .
negative	i did talk to a supervisor .
negative	they .
negative	did make it right .
negative	i would not use this service again .
negative	quite_frankly i am nit pleased in your delivery service at all .
negative	i ordered a tri - color copper magnetic bracelet in march .
negative	it was placed on back order .
negative	you promised that it would arrive on 0 ? 00 / 00 and it is still not here the order # is so000000000 item number 000000 .
negative	either ship it or refund my money for item and shipping .
negative	if this is not corrected i will not buy from you again .

negative	this was my first online book buy and two and a half weeks_later i still have not received my book !!!
negative	i failed my first exam due to not having a book .... yay for bookbyte not !!!
negative	i tried to track the book and i got a message_saying that it has_been shipped but does not yet have a tracking_number ??
negative	so i then did an online_chat with book_byte they said they would contact the seller and have them email me the information but yet still no response ...
negative	ugh !!!!
negative	!
negative	purchased voucher via living_social for my dad at xmas to get his windows & guttering cleaned .
negative	voucher cost £_00 and expires on 00th_march .
negative	only way of contacting them is via_email ( no phone_number ).
negative	have emailed them several_times but had no reply .
negative	emailed again today and email now comes back as undeliverable !
negative	it seems to me that they just took the money via living_social without ever intending to fulfil the vouchers .
negative	avoid at all costs !!
negative	!
negative	left 00 people with the wrong hotel accomodations after being in cedar point all day .
negative	we ended_up having to drive home five hours with many children .
negative	thanks expedia for nothing .
negative	i will never book through them again !!!!
negative	nice way to make money .
negative	book false accomadations and then run with the money .
negative	if i could do negative stars i would !
negative	what a waste of time and clicks .
negative	deceiving and not trustworthy .
negative	kept hundreds of my money blaming merchants for not posting and buying time .
negative	report those scumbags to attorney general , bbb , and other authorites , otherwise they will keep eating caviar at your expense .
negative	on september 00 , 0000 , i placed an order with 00dollarmall . com .
negative	it is october 00 , 0000 and i still have not received my package .
negative	on october 0 , 0000 , i called to ask the status of my package and was told it had been delivered to my residence .
negative	i never received it .
negative	customer_service submitted a claim to the post_office .
negative	i called on october 00 , 0000 to get the status of the claim .
negative	customer_service stated that the post_office delivered the package .
negative	i still have not received my package .
negative	customer_service told me they will not refund my money or send me a new shipment .
negative	basically , i lost $_00 . 00 .
negative	this is the worst service that i have ever received and will not ever shop with this website again !
negative	i want a refund
negative	i placed an order on the 00th , after which i got a confirmation_email_saying that my order was processing .
negative	three_days_later my status changed to " backordered " and it said that it might take up to ten days to be finished .
negative	now it has gone back to " processing " and still , three_days_later , nothing has happened .
negative	i have sent one email and one online support form .
negative	no reply .
negative	i '_m not sure what to do to get a refund .
negative	we accidentally lost our tickets even_though we had the receit and we lost our money because you didn_'_t want to print us out another one .
negative	thanks , i know what tour bus i won_'_t be going on next month .
negative	i love amiclubwear .
negative	i have been ordering from them for years .
negative	i honestly never know what to expect .
negative	sometimes they ship the order .
negative	sometimes they don_'_t .
negative	the most frustrating is when i try to place an order and it does not go through , it will say your cart is empty .
negative	then when i go back to look for the items , they are gone .
negative	or the size i wanted is gone .
negative	this has happened to me over 0 times the past few_days .
negative	i am a designer and i spend hundreds of dollars on their shoes .
negative	no order has gone_through .
negative	when i call i wait for hours .
negative	the girl that picks_up is nice .
negative	but i '_m not stupid .
negative	i know how to place a order .
negative	no , lady it '_s not my internet .
negative	no , it doesn_'_t just work if i refresh the page .
negative	she gave_me dumb a ** suggestions .
negative	and seemed like she did not care or did not want to help .
negative	do you not want my money ?
negative	it pisses me off to spend hours looking for shoes and commit to buying all of them and it doesn_'_t work .
negative	then the shoes are gone !
negative	how can you expect to have long_term customers if you have low quality items and horrible service .
negative	everyone will go somewhere_else .
negative	and all of the responses i see you giving people back is just fake as hell .
negative	your call wait is not 0 minutes .
negative	you don_'_t try to help customers .
negative	you are not professional .
negative	you just lost a customer who was trying to be loyal .
negative	i '_m done wasting my time and everyone should reconsider ordering from ami .
negative	thankyou .
negative	i sent two gift_cards to my friend '_s children for christmas and they alerted me last evening that they did not work .
negative	i am not happy about this right now and i don_'_t think that i will use the service again .
negative	bought 0 onsies for my daughters for christmas , when they opened them they had several holes along the seams !!!!
negative	spent a while sewing them up as it would have been far too much hassle to return and wait for replacements to be delivered !!!
negative	very poor quality !!!
negative	!
negative	good and easy to use ...
negative	however , after several_times of trying to book combination ... was informed that i should hear in 00_mins ...
negative	if no response , try again ...
negative	this is totally inefficient and lacking in confidence in the system .
negative	i am now worried to book again in case i double book or again get refused !
negative	i work for a customer_service call_center , and i '_m a representative myself .
negative	i dont like being one of those customers that complain_about things but this is my first purchase with them and i must i was not pleased .
negative	it took them 0 days to verify my account , it cost me $_00 for shipping to ship to boston , it was ups_ground and it '_s crazy that i paid this amount and received my packages 0 days_later from the day i placed my order .
negative	asked about the cost for shipping and customer_service gave_me some bs information that i didnt already know .
negative	i '_m sorry , but i never shopping on this site again .
negative	make_sure you guys read every policy twice before asking a question because the customer serivce team pretty_much answers your questions with their policy as if we didn_'_t already know .
negative	tire place was unable to get my tire off my car , waiting over an_hour before saying anything while i waited with my 0 children .
negative	0 hours after getting there had to have it towed across the street to firestone to have the job_done .
negative	ordered three items to the tune of 000 . 00 received order with one item i ordered and two items i did not order called them the customer_service agent was very rude her reply was ( oh i guess someone_else got your items ) imagine that so asked could i return the items to store ( which is an_hour and half drive from where i live ) returned to store would not take them offered to refund money for items they sent $_00 . 00 ( items i purchased cost $_00 . 00 ) so i shipped them back to target they said they did not receive so i tracked package tole them who signed for them and what time still have not got my money refunded will never buy from target . com again
negative	the first bus of the day due to arrive at our bus_stop at 00 . 00 never arrived .
negative	we had to wait 00_minutes for the next one which arrived with the commentary out of order and therefore after a few bus_stops journey in a crowded bus - without spare seats , we had to change it and wait 00_minutes again .
negative	when we asked the member of staff for the reason_why the first bus never arrived , he answered that it did ( we were at the bus_stop 00_minutes before the due time together with the other passangers so we knew it never arrived ).
negative	to our reply that it was not correct as the bus never arrived the big_bus employee with an attitude became very rude and unhelpful .
negative	every time during our wait for the big_bus , the other company '_s original tours ' bus was passing at_least once or twice .
negative	often there were no spare seats on the bus or the earphones didn_'_t work properly .
negative	i would discourage tourists from using this company
negative	missguided has a great selection of reasonably_priced clothes however do not order anything if there is even a slight chance you will return it ( which is most of us because we can '_t tell exact fit through online shopping ).
negative	the returns take_forever and even after a month of my order being at the us return warehouse , they still cannot say it has_been received at the uk warehouse and i have yet to receive a refund .
negative	i am starting to feel_like this is a scam and i am never going to see my money back .
negative	also buyer_beware - if your order is over $_000 and you live in the us , you have to pay customs_fees ( something that should be notified in bold when you checkout , but instead is in fine_print on the policy page ).
negative	this means i had to pay $_00 in fees for clothes that i kept $_00 worth .
negative	missguided should take a note from other reputable_companies such as asos .
negative	we wanted to book a room for a family of 0 with 0 young_children both under 0 years of age .
negative	they booked us in a hotel were children under 00 years are not accepted .
negative	the confirmation they sent us was only for 0_adults and when it was mentioned to the agent she contacted the front_desk of the hotel and said that it would be ok . she informed them about this mistake and said no other charges will occur .
negative	00_minutes after the front_desk manager has called and said that they will charge 00 $ for each child that they will make an exception to accommodate our children since their policy does not allow children of this age .
negative	terrible service ....!
negative	my online profile was locked so i couldn_'_t make meal choices ( which was a driving factor for choosing bistromd ).
negative	customer_service agent was condescending and dismissive and would not help resolve the issue so my only option was to cancel and select another company .
negative	technical errors are forgivable , rude service is not .
negative	i don_'_t have to spend money to be treated poorly , i can get that for free !
negative	purchased cancellation insurance , but to cancel you have to pay 000 . 00 per person plus the difference in airline price .
negative	it took 00_minutes on hold for them to tell me this !
negative	ridiculous !
negative	i returned my books as i thought was supposed to .
negative	to find out i had not done the right return and was still being charged for the books i rented because i put them through the buyback program instead .
negative	it was a big hassle getting the money transferred around .
negative	i also never received two books i ordered after this incident .
negative	which i need these books for class .
negative	the overall experience was stressful .
negative	however one plus was the email system used to help communicate .
negative	which is how i found out all of the information needed .
negative	this company allows their website to make up charges and fees to turn a simple transaction like buying a few airline_tickets into highway robbery .
negative	i was charged $ 0 , 000 . 00 usd for 0 airline_tickets that should have costed me $_000 . 00 .
negative	they did not meet the advertised price and somehow tacked on hidden_fees amounting to 00 times the original ticket price .
negative	how is this legal ?
negative	why does customer_service say they are non_- refundable .
negative	you better have a good lawyer if you plan to deal with them .
negative	better yet , leave your credit_card in your wallet .
negative	they will max out your limit in one transaction .
negative	we as consumers should never allow this to happen .
negative	i will keep my american money in america next time .
negative	i ordered a pair of brown boots .
negative	first off , there was no mention of a zipper , and no picture showing it .
negative	it looked very tacky and was poorly attached .
negative	then 0 days after wearing my boots the back split_open , and the threads came apart on the front seam of the boot , creating another hole .
negative	the toe of the boot looked worn down after about a week , and the zipper on the side became very frayed after about 0 days .
negative	terrible product .
negative	such a waste of money .
negative	never will buy from this place again .
negative	big_disappointment !
negative	i bought a pair of stretch capri colored pants at the bay in a size small .
negative	they were great but size selection was poor .
negative	i needed a small .
negative	so i went on line and purchased 0 pairs for more than what the bay was selling them for and when they arrived a week_later the differences in sizing was ridiculous .
negative	i returned them to the nygard store downtown , pay for parking , and instead of a refund on the spot i have to wait for the return to be processed .... and it will eventually go back on my visa .
negative	poor product and poor service ..
negative	purchased 0 pair of jumbo , over - sized sunglasses .
negative	for the price of $ 0 a pair , i wasn_'_t expecting high_quality but certainly not expecting what showed_up in the box .
negative	all arrived with scratches all over frames and the fronts of every_single lens had major rubs and scratches on them .
negative	for someone to have even packed this junk into anyone '_s order is unbelievable .
negative	this damage did not take place in transit .
negative	when i called and asked for replacements , was told that they " could not guarantee that replacements would be any better ."
negative	that statement just confirmed that they know they are selling worthless , damaged junk to begin with .
negative	was told i could either package all up and return for refund or they would give me a 00_%_discount .
negative	i got a total of $ 0 . 00 off of $_00 of garbage merchandise .
negative	my entire order came to $_00 .
negative	i would have thought that they may have wanted a repeat_customer .
negative	apparently not .
negative	just keep in mind prior to ordering that you are not ordering anything of quality here .
negative	they sell under several names , each having their own website .
negative	what are they trying to hide ?
negative	beställde en bukett till en 00 - årig god vän i sverige att levereras idag den 00 juni 0000 .
negative	när_jag ringde honom sent , efter 0 på kvällen så hade han varken fått min bukett eller chokladen som skulle ha levererats under dagen .
negative	order nummer 0000000 .
negative	för inte länge sedan beställde jag en bukett genom en euroflorist i sverige och fick räkning två gånger för samma bukett !
negative	jag_har redan beställt en blomma till en annan god vän på hans 00 - årsdag i slutet av juni och om jag_har problem med_den också så kommer jag inte att beställa flera blommor i framtiden utan skicka pengar istället .
negative	i would not recommend using giftcard . com to anyone .
negative	i recently orders an amc gift_card .
negative	what i received is a used card that i cannot use as a gift as planned .
negative	it '_s very tacky and very disappointing .
negative	furthermore , i called the customer_service number as was told they couldn_'_t help me .
negative	i have to call back tomorrow at a different time .
negative	i sent an_email right_away to see what i do to get a refund .
negative	this is extremely poor business .
negative	i '_ve used this site before , but probably_won_'_t again after this experience .
negative	i would recommend my friends and family stay away .
negative	if i don_'_t receive a refund , i '_m going to post a comment on my facebook_page to that affect .
negative	my booking experience was a nightmare .
negative	the first room i booked ended_up being at the wrong hotel .
negative	i ultimately kept the reservation because i needed a room .
negative	then the second room i booked got booked for the wrong dates .
negative	when i finally realized the error , it was too late and the hotel was booked up and i couldn_'_t get a room .
negative	however , i still got charged and now have to wait for a refund .
negative	this whole ordeal took me over an_hour to deal with .
negative	overall it was a mess and i will never use this service again .
negative	our printer would not accept these cartridges and it has not worked since trying them !
negative	they were a total_waste of money and ruined our printer .
negative	zero_stars .
negative	the review would not be posted without clicking a star , but in actuality they get " 0 " stars .
negative	do not purchase these .
negative	i ordered a wheel for my volvo ... it was a 00 inch rim and they sent the wrong part .
negative	they sent an 00 inch rim .
negative	they part number they sent is not the part number i ordered .
negative	they will not allow me to call to speak to anyone about it .
negative	they make me respond to emails and they want me to pay shipping to return the part that they sent .
negative	in order to return an 00 inch rim it is going to cost me over $_00 .
negative	not to mention the fact that i had been waiting for the part because my daughter '_s car was inoperable without it .
negative	it has_been nothing but an inconvenience .
negative	ordered a motor mount for my beetle and got a used part that worse than the bad one i took out .
negative	called to get a replacement and a recording answered without the ability to leave a message .
negative	submitted a claim via their online form ....
negative	nothing !
negative	i '_m out 00_bucks .
negative	never again !
negative	i ordered flowers as a thank_you gift to friends in italy .
negative	the delivery person called my friends and asked them to come and pick the flowers up in a town several miles_away .
negative	they declined to do so and the delivery person agreed to deliver them , but never did .
negative	i reversed the charge to my credit_card and won_'_t use floraqueen again .
negative	i ordered a swimming_costume for a holiday that '_s been and gone .
negative	returned it and when i emailed asking about my refund i just got an_email back saying they had received it .
negative	they didn_'_t tell me how to claim for lost return or offer any other advice .
negative	very poor service .
negative	ordered my sunglasses on march_0th .
negative	first i got a call that frames_direct are waiting to recieve the glasses from the manufacture .
negative	it took like 0 business days .
negative	then finally my glasses were shipped on march_00th .
negative	today , march_00th , has made 0 business days but no sunglasses yet .
negative	no info when i track the package .
negative	it only says that it left texas .
negative	worst service ever .
negative	i love buying new sunglasses but not ordering from frames_direct ever again
negative	i had 0 problems , both on 0 order :
negative	my first problem was that i ordered 0 pairs of boots / heels and they only sent me 0 pairs while , the order slip said that all 0 were shipped , bullsh * t . i contact them via_email and then call their number .
negative	it '_s always busy busy busy ... you can never get through .
negative	finally , you get a hold of someone and they tell you there is nothing they can do " you have to do everything online " and then they hang up on you .
negative	you mean to tell me i just wasted 00_minutes waiting to speak to somebody , explain my enitire issue and then get hung_up on ... what kind of service is this .
negative	they never sent me my boots that were missing nor the $_00 . 00 i spent on them .
negative	my second problem was that out of the 0 i received , one pair was too big so i wanted a smaller_size .
negative	i send them express delivery and spend $_00 on shipping with a package #, ( make_sure you put a tracking_# on everything you return bc thats another scam within itself ) anyway they send me an_email_stating they have received my package and have enclosed a credit of $_00 for the shoes that i wanted an even exchange for .
negative	i didn_'_t want a $_00 credit .
negative	i specifically filled out the exchange form stating that i needed a smaller_size and they go_ahead and give me a credit and never ship me my smaller_size .
negative	why am i pist off ?
negative	hmmmm let_me see i paid $_00 . 00 for the shoes plus shipping ($ 0 ) then return shipping of $_00 and i get a $_00 credit .
negative	i will never order from them again !
negative	don_'_t bother to go on 00dollar_mall . com .
negative	their product descriptions have nothing to do with reality .... i bought two_pairs of " suede " boots that turned_out to be velveteen !
negative	( returning today ).
negative	they were cheap fabric , not the suede that shoes are usually made of .
negative	made in china , of course .
negative	also there was a floppy hat that
negative	might have been ok except it was all squished by the packers .
negative	and they left off one pair of shoes that i ordered completely .
negative	don_'_t know how i '_m going to convince them of that .
negative	there are better places to shop online
negative	my taillight was broken when i got it
negative	the entire experience with this company was a nightmare .
negative	when we arrived to the hotel to leave the car , the person_who was in charge was angry , and she started to scream and she was really rude with my family and me .
negative	when i came back after 0_weeks , the car did not turn on and the worst part of this nightmare was the right back tire was deflated because somebady cut it with a knife or something like this .
negative	additionaly , i found a clothes hook bent close to the car ( it looked like if it was used to open the car ).
negative	by suggestion of the hotel , the car was parked next to the pool where " they have a camera and they could to see better the car "... but they did not say nothing about the flat_tire or the responsible .
negative	i had to call my insurance to solve this problem , i only received help from the hotel to turn on the car .
negative	the hotel is located in a dangerous and isolate zone .
negative	i dont recomend this hotel and this services .
negative	i placed a small order , but then got an e_- mail they needed verification before the order could be processed .
negative	i had to send them a copy of my passport and creditcard .
negative	there is no way i am sending those details to a random company .
negative	but when i checked my credit_card account , they did take the money !
negative	they say it takes 0 - 00 days to refund , which is just wrong as it took them less_than a day to take the money .
negative	i '_ll never order here again .
negative	long_story short : the hostel i booked was deserted and i was left alone in the dark , in the middle of the rainforest .
negative	it was a horrible , stressful experience that really wasted my day .
negative	it '_s been three_months and i '_ve gotten nowhere with hostelworld .
negative	after many , many e_- mails and tweets i '_ve finally got my deposit back ( first time ever a refund on my cc took more than two_weeks ).
negative	no apologies , no compensation for the fact that i wasted half a day of my vacation , wasted gas , and ended_up sleeping in a parking_lot .
negative	as long as you don_'_t have an_issue this website works , but what is the benefit of booking with hostelworld if they are not there for you when you encounter a problem ?
negative	i hold hostelworld responsible for what happened .
negative	they deleted my review and left the hostel on the website despite the fact that more people encountered these problems ( who_knows_how many if hostelworld continues to delete these reviews ).
negative	from now on i only book with hostels directly .
negative	it also saves_me hostelworld '_s ' service fee '.
negative	beats me why they even charge it , i '_ve gotten no service from them .
negative	my holiday tradition has_been to buy pj '_s for my daughters and now their husbands as well as myself and my husband .
negative	each item i ordered through cafe press truly was a reflection of their personality ; unfortunately the quality was horrible .
negative	i bought my daughter a believe t - shirt and her hand went right through it when she went to put it over her head .
negative	i bought my son - in -_law a bmw shirt which was completely ruined after the first wash .
negative	they actually got all of the sizes wrong to boot but it was too late and i ended_up giving everyone the wrong_size .
negative	that wouldn_'_t have been horrible if the items were worth it .
negative	$_00 + for a set of pj '_s each person and it '_s crap .
negative	i have ordered from cafe press in the past but am officially done .
negative	not worth the expense of disposable items .
negative	garbage .
negative	wrong part and no apparent way to return
negative	i ordered a part on march_0th .
negative	it was scheduled to come in a few_days .
negative	i followed it on ups . com with the provided tracking_number .
negative	once it had reached secaucus , overnight after the " arrival scan ", this happened : " merchandise is missing .
negative	ups will notify the sender with additional details .
negative	/ all merchandise missing , empty carton was discarded .
negative	ups will notify the sender with details of the damage ."
negative	i understand these things happen .
negative	i wasn_'_t upset because of this .
negative	what happened after is the compeltely unacceptable part .
negative	not only was i not contacted about this problem , it took four days for a claim to be filed ( it is now april 0st and nothing has come of the claim .)
negative	i waited two_weeks to hear from parts_geek , but to no_avail .
negative	i finally contacted them wondering when i would receive a replacement part , which was stopping a long series of desperately_needed repairs .
negative	days_later ( there were at_least 0 days in between every .
negative	step .
negative	of this agonizingly slow process ), they sent me an_email with the tracking_number .
negative	which i already had .
negative	i seriously doubt anyone is reading these emails .
negative	i sent another email explaining again that i knew the tracking_number , i just want the part .
negative	they sent an_email_saying they would give a refund for the return , there '_s nothing to return !
negative	i received nothing !
negative	i emailed them saying i didn_'_t want a refund , i just wanted the part .
negative	i called " customer_service " to speak to an actual human_being who would understand this situation only to be put on hold indefinitely .
negative	today they gave_me a refund for much less_than what i paid and said that would be all i would get .
negative	i will never deal with parts_geek again .
negative	i am now screwed out of money and i still don_'_t have the part i need .
negative	completely_unacceptable company and customer_service .
negative	i booked our first hotel stay through bookit . com after receiving a coupon_code , making the reservation cheaper_than i could '_ve gotten on my own .
negative	after reserving the room , i quickly realized that i forgot to put in the coupon_code .
negative	i immediately called bookit . com , with the hopes that they could easily apply the $_00 coupon afterwards .
negative	however , they told me there was nothing they could do .
negative	we spent over $_000 on the reservation , and will not use bookit . com again , due to their poor service .
negative	have not received product - but did receive a request to fill_out a review
negative	not a good company will not use them again !
negative	very didsatisfied .
negative	sold my mobile to them it ended_up on ebay
negative	i booked a storage_unit based on price and reviews .
negative	when i got there , the place was gross and the price was almost double .
negative	thanks but no thanks .
negative	visited another facility that was supposedly out of my price range , it was awesome and the price was about half what was listed on sparefoot .
negative	parts are cheap ...
negative	brake sensor broke in half when it was installed .
negative	flowers arrived , wrapped in a wad of cotton wool not the little pods as_advertised .
negative	complaint not dealt_with and strangeley now i requested a response i cannot acces the mail , any of them !!!
negative	beware ....... beginning to think that fake fake fake reviews .....
negative	manufactured comments
negative	may bees were shipped on friday memorial_day weekend .
negative	may bees have been caged for 0 day and i don_'_t have them .
negative	how well this effect there health if the are caged up for 0 to 0 days and how do i tell if the queen serviced the extra day with out excepting the package ?
negative	you might say i am unhappy and unsure if i will get a health queen .
negative	i did order and pay in full at the time i order .
negative	i order in early april for delivery in the last_week of april .
negative	please tell me why you mailed my bee on a friday when i already expressed my concerns of a weekend mailing date .
negative	and to make it a holiday make me wonder about the logic and the carrying of the health of these bees , as well as the customer_service you have given me .
negative	i feel_like i have been fare in waiting and would have rather you shipped my bees after the holidays where they did not have to be in a cage as long as they have .
negative	now the question is do i accept the shipment of bee or not .
negative	to bee or not to bee
negative	wanda danley
negative	may 00 , 0000
negative	it is thursday and the bees are not here .
negative	this is week one of being cage in a box with not much for air holes .
negative	dead bees inside and they are having to live in there poop .
negative	no water hope they have enough honey to service the road_trip .
negative	well the queen make it and how do i tell .
negative	i have tried_calling an asking question today , but i seem to be getting the run_around on advice on what to do at this last a date in shipping .
negative	what would be the ti - a - tail signs that the queen is alive or dead .
negative	i am new and wanted some advice from the lady that shipped the bees and explained why she did not wait_until after the holidays to ship my bees .
negative	moral of this story is find a place closer to home to buy your bees .
negative	so not sure if i get to be a beekeeper this year or not .
negative	i just applied for an auto loan to purchase a more reliable car and to build my credit back up .
negative	however , the equifax number they pulled was 00 points lower , the transunion number was 00 points higher and the experian number was unknown than what this site said it was , why is that ?
negative	i expect my score to be my score always and across the board !?
negative	i have not borrowed nor had my credit tapped for 0 years !
negative	this difference has cost me in a higher interest_rate !
negative	what is the secret ?
negative	have i been paying
negative	$_00 a month to you for no reason ?
negative	or is this credit_score game subjective and manipulated by those whom have a profit in mind ?
negative	first , i was not informed that i was not speaking to the hotel desk at the hampton_inn .
negative	second , the reservation was entered for the wrong date so when i got to my hotel i did not have a room .
negative	third , when i called back to receive clarification , nobody knew anything about my reservation and nobody would clearly answer my questions about what had happened .
negative	fourth , you spelled my name wrong .
negative	the townhouse at regal palms had the dirtiest carpet , sofas that i didn_'_t want my kids to sit on , they are so dirty , and the bed blankets and comforters were gross .
negative	and to top it off , they had bed_bugs !
negative	my husband is full of bites !
negative	he had to go to the doctor , and we had to have pest_control come to our house to make_sure they didn_'_t come with us ... grosssssss !!!!!!!
negative	don_'_t stay in calibri 000 !
negative	i have ordered 0 times from your company , have spent quite a sum of money .
negative	the first two orders came in perfect plants wet healthy very pleased .
negative	third order all plants were crammed into one box , all plants were dry dry dry , stems broken off of every plant , i took pictures and sent an_email that same day and apparently no one really cares because no one has contacted me .
negative	in getting the glasses they were very helpful and kind .. when you recieve them it '_s quite another .
negative	customer_service never responded to my email - big shocker .
negative	i called to say that the left eye seems " off " and it hurts as compared to my normal ray_bans i bought in a store ... . since that '_s not " their defect " they would take a re - stocking_fee .
negative	in my opinion that is a defect , they should be exactly like normal glasses without pain the rx is the same .
negative	i ' d never order again that '_s crap .
negative	placed an order on thursday was advised my order would not go through until the friday as it was past 00 clock , arranged for someone to be there to take delivery of my order on the monday and guess what still no table received - 0 days_later ... contacted them to be told the reason item hadn_'_t been delivered was because the persons name i had given wasn_'_t registered at my address .... that '_s because they don_'_t live there , if i had been told this at time of ordering ( by telephone ) this could have easily been rectified instead of me having to contact company to ask why i hadn_'_t received my order - absolutely_ridiculous !!
negative	order is now cancelled and order placed with a different company , will see if they refund my money as quickly as they took it .
negative	i would never shop_here again because i ordered two swimsuits and never got them , then when i talked to customer_service they said i put the wrong_address and it was shipped to someone in another_state , but when i checked the address i put the right one .
negative	now i can '_t get anyone from customer_service to respond to my emails .
negative	never again .
negative	the site sucks .
negative	the people answering the phone are complete idiots .
negative	booked a trip .
negative	tried to modify the dates literally 0 minutes later .
negative	web_site would not work to allow me the modification .
negative	called to modify .
negative	couldn_'_t help me , so i cancelled .
negative	now mind you the cancellation was 00_minutes after the booking .
negative	charged me a $_00 . 00 fee .
negative	would not wave it .
negative	we ordered a yellow hibiscus tree from brighter_blooms and when it arrived , it had yellow leaves infected with black spot disease and aphid bugs all over .
negative	i called and complained twice and sent pictures to brighter_blooms .
negative	they emailed me back and said they had sent a tree with fungus and we should treat it immediately or the diseases could spread to other plants in our beautiful landscaped yard and gardens .
negative	we have ordered other plants from amazon and the plants were beautiful and thriving when the arrived .
negative	my husband and i are appalled at brighter_blooms ' reaction !
negative	the total of our order was between $_00 . 00 and $_000 . 00 , which included the tree , potting mix to promote blooms and a $ 0 . 00 guarantee on the tree .
negative	they never offered to replace the tree and one person made the comment , " how do you think you would look if you got shipped in a box ?"
negative	the guarentee is certainly a joke !!!
negative	we say , " hogwash , cheater , cheater !!!
negative	beware of this company !!!
negative	they are no better_than common thieves !!
negative	!
negative	everyone who thinks of paris , thinks of the eiffel_tower .
negative	we forgot to order tickets ahead and used this tour service .
negative	we found the eiffel_tower to be crowded and just couldn_'_t wait to leave .
negative	take your pictures from the bottom and spend your euros on something that matters like the louvre !
negative	reseller ratings is a scam and should be taken off google asap .
negative	the way they make money , they leave a single bad review then they force your company to sign_up for their service .
negative	if customers post good reviews , they are automatically removed .
negative	the price per year is $_000 .
negative	what exactly are we paying for ?
negative	to unlock the good positive_reviews we need to pay them money ?
negative	are you kidding me .
negative	i cannot_believe google uses this company to supply them with reviews .
negative	google is starting to slip as well .
negative	online , ordered the full side_mirror assembly .
negative	website was having issues ( adding to cart items i had no interest in , including items for totally different car ).
negative	now , i have to return what was sent to me at my expense and reorder ( this time via phone ) for the correct_part .
negative	website needs a little maintenance .
negative	customer_service line could use some help too .
negative	just waited 00_minutes on hold , only for a recording to come on , tell me to use the online support system and hung_up .
negative	after posting my problem , northshore_care promtly responded with a phone_call to me from a very nice woman from the office who settled everything .
negative	i would now order again from them in the future , and would recommend them with outstanding customer_service .
negative	we were sent the wrong product .
negative	however according to their policy we must pay return shipping , get our original part returned minus shipping .
negative	then we have to reorder the part and pay shipping again .
negative	not a very good practice .
negative	they say no_matter who is at fault we do not reimburse shipping_costs .
negative	that is the last time we will ever order from them .
negative	whatever you do , don_'_t ever use priceline !
negative	i had to cancel my reservations because my conference was cancelled and they absolutely refused .
negative	i even ask for a credit to use in the future and they refused .
negative	i asked to speak with a manager and the sent me to customer_relations and they refused .
negative	then i asked to speak to someone above them and they said i would have to email corporate or write a letter .
negative	you can '_t even pick_up the phone to speak with someone .
negative	absolutely horrible and will never use again !!!!
negative	pretty sad since i used to use them all the time .
negative	i am thinking you should change from ups to fed_ex ....
negative	i have yet to receive my tire rim ....
negative	i contacted this company and spoke with a man named ken who was very friendly .
negative	he told me to submit a sample request via their website which i did .
negative	i called to follow_up and spoke with a woman_who said to email my sample request so i did that as well .
negative	i never_heard back so i guess my business wasn_'_t important to them .
negative	very disappointing and a waste of time .
negative	i ordered the correct_part the wrong part was sent .
negative	after many emails and times that my emails were not answered although i sent to them everything they asked for .
negative	i finally received an_email that i was getting my refund with a restocking_fee .
negative	really ???
negative	they sent the wrong part with the proof and they still charged me a restocking_fee .
negative	oh well i guess that is the way they do_business .
negative	i have no problem paying for the shipping and restocking_fee to return a part if i made the mistake .
negative	i will never use this company again and will tell every one i can not to use them .
negative	i received the skin and tried it on the device .
negative	it didn_'_t fit .
negative	alas , simply trying it on counts as use and so they won_'_t refund or exchange for me .
negative	they won_'_t even let_me speak to anyone about it - only offer online support .
negative	there are so many other skin stores - shop elsewhere .
negative	i called you to ask for help regarding an order that i had not received the staff did seem at all interested , they told me to call the company myself which i had ordered from however , i insisted and after me feeling shocked at them not giving a dam .
negative	furthermore , they told me within 00_hrs i will hear back from someone .... over a week no parcel and no email or phone_call ....
negative	disappointing and i do hope that my order turns or my payment .
negative	i hope you will contact me regarding this matter .
negative	fiona smith
negative	bought 0 separate visa_gift_cards for $_000 total the saturday_morning before christmas .
negative	on monday i called everyone to find out if they got my email / gift .
negative	no one received their emails .
negative	i called giftcards . com to find out why and they told me the cards / emails had not gone out yet !
negative	it is now new year '_s eve , 0 calls to gitscards . com and 0 out of 0 got their gift_cards .
negative	i should have gone down to the grocery_store and mailed them !
negative	!!!!
negative	never again !
negative	!
negative	!
negative	based on this experience , most_likely i will not call reservations again .
negative	i will make reservations thru the internet - it would be faster .
negative	i was at the point of either hanging up or asking for a supervisor .
negative	0 .
negative	the person needed additional training
negative	0 .
negative	too much background_noise , maybe there was a party at the center
negative	0 .
negative	i had to repeat myself so many_times , it was frustrating
negative	0 .
negative	because i had no confidence in the person handling the call i had to spell out and repeat my name , my address , my e_- mail , etc ...................................
negative	0 .
negative	our credit_card was charged without our permission , this information was given to hold the room only .
negative	will never order again .
negative	processing days are not listed until order is complete .
negative	then they change from calendar days to business days .
negative	ordered on a monday , paid for two day shipping , did not receive until following_monday .
negative	liked product - totally distrust company !
negative	the website isn_'_t that great to navigate through and they have awesome prices for most products but the shipping rate is one set rate and when that was included i didn_'_t get that great of a deal .
negative	mucho te prometen cuando haces el_pedido , pero después de pagado el encargo poco se comprometen a finalizar con éxito el encargo .
negative	un fraude .
negative	i was notified almost 0_weeks after the fact that my order had been returned undeliverable , no one bothered to tell me anything .
negative	i only found out after i reread the email , so i '_m thinking ok , someone will contact me to make arrangements to get my order to me .
negative	well , it never happened .
negative	their automated service is a crock .
negative	after inputting your selection , it says that it doesn_'_t understand your selection .
negative	seriously !!!
negative	at this point , i want a complete refund and forget i ever ordered anything from this company .
negative	on backorder forever .
negative	still don_'_t have it .
negative	0weeks ?
negative	didn_'_t order anything unusual .
negative	now i wonder_how fresh product will be .
negative	how long can you use sandy as an excuse ?
negative	wish i had read the reviews first .
negative	received a " shipping notification " on january_00th , it is now february_00th and have heard_nothing , they will not answer , e_- mails , and they have no other contact information .
negative	this company is completely fraudulent , i don_'_t care if it was less_than $_00 .. we will be taking legal_action ... somebody has to .
negative	ordered two items ten_minutes apart and was charged overnight shipping twice .
negative	purchased $ 0 hose clamp and charged 00 shipping
negative	i '_m really disappointed in the service i received with this site
negative	i booked two rooms separately .
negative	i paid in full for one room and opted to pay later for the other .
negative	upon_arrival to the hotel they had no record of my booking and refused to look at my confirmation .
negative	they
negative	informed me that they could offer me a room at their current rate not the rate i booked .
negative	but funny the room that was paid in full they did get the reservation for .
negative	i am writing their company as well .
negative	i wish i had read the reviews here before using them .
negative	it took four weeks to get the money - they claim they haven_'_t received it for ages ( but they know it '_s on the way !)
negative	and then take ages to process and authorize payment .
negative	i would never use them again .
negative	i had arranged for rental pick_up at durham tees valley airport in the u . k . after traveling from the u . s .
negative	i was given the keys to the rental_car and told that the car was out in the airport_parking_lot .
negative	i asked where in the parking_lot it was located , and the color of the car .
negative	i was told that it was thought to be pale blue - it turned_out to be navy .
negative	i asked if they had maps of the local area and was told that they ' d run_out of them .
negative	the car_rental location in the parking_lot was a very long walk to the most remote part of the parking_lot .
negative	the lot was snowy and very icy .
negative	the temperature was - 0 centigrade .
negative	i had my 00 year_old_mother with me .
negative	i had to hold on to her in the very icy / snowy conditions for the long walk as well as trying to pull our_luggage through the snow .
negative	i was instructed that when i returned the car on the day i was scheduled to fly back to the u . s ., just to park the car and drop the keys in a key box inside the airport - consequently i have never received a final rental_agreement nor the final rental charges .
negative	i ordered from here twice .
negative	the first time was ok , just really slow shipping .
negative	but i qualified for free_shipping so i didn_'_t complain much .
negative	however , the second time i ordered it was a nightmare !
negative	once again slow shipping .
negative	i tried_calling to obtain my tracking_number and literally waited on the phone for an_hour !
negative	they didn_'_t respond to prior emails so i had no choice .
negative	then the " lady " was rude and just ghetto !
negative	no help at all .
negative	she seriously needs an attitude adjustment !
negative	then fast forwarding to when i got my stuff ... one pair of shoes was dirty .
negative	it was not worth the return shipping and dealing_with the attude - y bitches that work there .
negative	i understand mistakes_happen and i could overlook the fact that the shoes were unsatisfactory .
negative	however , the poor customer_service and wait times are horrible .
negative	if they are doing that much volume in business , they need to be sure they have the manpower !
negative	this is unacceptable .
negative	i would rather shop on ebay .
negative	actually , i found out amiclubwear used to sell on ebay and was kicked off for poor service .
negative	go figure .
negative	my order was drum sticks and one was missing !!
negative	the jiffy_bag they were sent in was burst open at one end .. not happy ..
negative	when i called to get internet installed from at & t , after being
negative	on the phone for 00_minutes i was told they could not give me
negative	an install date ( due to them not being_able to " identify " me which
negative	is why the phone_call was 00_minutes long .
negative	they said they
negative	would email me .
negative	i explained my phone doesn_'_t received email and i have
negative	no internet .
negative	at & t said they would text me .
negative	then while at work the installation guy called me and said
negative	he be at my house in 00_minutes .
negative	i explained to him i was at
negative	work and never received the " text ", i cancelled the install for
negative	that day .
negative	right after we hung_up i got the " text " that the
negative	install was for that morning .
negative	checked my email ( used
negative	my work '_s internet ) as sure enough they emailed me previously
negative	advising of the install date .
negative	another call to at & t . i set the install date up for saturday .
negative	explained what had happened previously , and said you have
negative	to text me .
negative	saturday mooring , after setting my alarm so i made sure
negative	i was up between the 0 : 00 - noon time range , nothing .
negative	another call to at & t ( and yes it was long ).
negative	she said we
negative	emailed you , we changed the install date .
negative	they pushed it
negative	back 0_weeks !!!!
negative	i '_ve been without internet for 0_weeks
negative	at this point , feels_like i am living in a 0rd world country .
negative	it isn_'_t installed yet , the new date is this coming saturday .
negative	we '_ll see how this one goes .
negative	ordered an outback bbq_cover .
negative	at the time of ordering it showed it was in stock .
negative	0 days_later i was advised by e_- mail that it would be 0_weeks as out of stock .
negative	finally arrived nearly 0_weeks after_placing the order .
negative	poor !
negative	i booked a room for myrtle_beach for a hotel from ocean_view .
negative	as i was told my price and granted that i did get the front ocean veiw several time .
negative	i later got my email_stating that i have side ocean veiw .
negative	i called and complained that is not what i asked for as the lady saw that is what i required she then stated that is would be this much extra for that .
negative	i am not satisfied about my booking with you .
negative	i will not use your business again .
negative	nothing was fixed and taken_care of .
negative	ok should not get charged extra for my request when i was garented about my request was what i got .
negative	and did not get .
negative	i will not refer any one for your help .
negative	i called them to tell them that we did not make our second flight on our way home from our trip .
negative	the first customer_service rep monica told me that she would have her supervisor call us_airways and gave_me a case number and would call me back in 00_hours .
negative	i did not receive the call and placed another call and spoke with another customer_service rep and the call was lost .
negative	called back and spoke with william who said there was no case number on there computer .
negative	once again i had to explain everything and he was going to have a supervisor call me back .
negative	believe it or not the supervisor did call me back and went on to explain that expedia could not refund us the partial flight that we missed to get home because of weather delays .
negative	during the conversation once again lost call right after i said i could not understand her english .
negative	i really think she hung_up on me .
negative	what a way to run a business !!!!!!!
negative	i would strongly_suggest you book your travels with someone_else other than expedia !!!!!!!
negative	they really do not care about the customer after they have received there portion of the money .....
negative	they lost another customer tonight !!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered around november_00th
negative	most of the items are in and " ready to ship " with the exception of one which is now , apparently out of stock on the item description .
negative	i emailed customer_service but i haven_'_t received a reply .
negative	i do understand that some of the ordered items have a 0 - 00 day shipping range , however if one item is out of stock , the entire order shouldnt have to be delayed .
negative	please correct this mistake soon , or i may have to cancel the order , which i do not want to do because i absolutely love the clothes on this site .
negative	i waited over a week for my books because i got a confirmation_email of my order .
negative	after a week i went to check the status of shipping and find out my order was cancelled .
negative	i was not notified and wasted a week in my classes without the book and had to order from somewhere_else .
negative	there '_s no way i reach them by phone and no quick email service .
negative	i order my book in january i receive the wrong book and so i email about the problem and no response so i went_ahead and ship back the wrong book that receive to fed_ex for 00 dollars at the end of january and i also put a note asking them to please ship the right book to me .
negative	i haven_'_t heard_anything back yet from the company and i am upset because i have to get my assignments done and it '_s february and i still don_'_t have a response or the book .
negative	in only my second delivery you cheat me of my money and supply to me used activation codes of ukash .. shame on you . absolutely disgusting .
negative	ref ( 0kjm000000000000 )
negative	i wish i had checked if i had known it was yodel i would not have bothered , phone allegedly delivered 0th november first words from yodel rep its took you this long to call , here we go as per usual with yodel lets find a way to blame the customer , are you sure the address is correct , the site has autofill so yes the address is right , i am the receptionist here and there is someone here from 0 . 00am until 0 . 00pm there is no way that delivery was missed i actually have a pavlovian response when i see yodel as the amount of hassle you have to deal with to get anything delivered makes me feel sick .
negative	purchased 0 best buy gift_cards .
negative	0 worked , and one did not .
negative	i needed to purchase a product for work and had to go_ahead and use the 0 that worked .
negative	two_days_later , the company responded saying the last one worked , but at that point , i couldn_'_t use it and they would not give me a refund .
negative	so now i have an extra $_00 that i have no use for .
negative	very poor business_practice .
negative	do not buy a warranty from this company .
negative	they have the absolute_worst customer_service i have ever_experienced .
negative	if you can ever get a customer_service supervisor on the phone , they just lie and tell you whatever they have to get you off the phone .
negative	no stars would be a more appropriate rating as far as i '_m concerned .
negative	i also plan to write to sams club about how square_trade treats sams club members .
negative	the manager jason was just going to let us walk out and go to another dealership , the entire staff is very unfriendly , unprofessional and don_'_t care about your .
negative	definitely would not go there !
negative	viagogo kept promising me that i would receive my tickets that i had paid for weeks earlier for a musical in london 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	they kept reassuring me and the hotel staff that called for me that my tickets would arrive but they never did .
negative	they finally refunded me without an explanation of why i didn_'_t receive my tickets .
negative	that didn_'_t help since i missed out on my time in london and they kept saying up until an_hour before the show that i would get them and it was too late to book anything_else for that night .
negative	disappointing customer_service .
negative	don_'_t trust or use them !
negative	i '_m never ordering from them again they were so rude .
negative	i called to try to return the shoes i bought .
negative	they said they would give me store credit after i shipped the shoes back .
negative	when it was their fault in the first place that the shoes were too small ..
negative	the shoes i purchased sizes ran really small , so they ' re size 0 is really a 0 .
negative	they didn_'_t put on their website that the sizes of this certain brand of shoe_size ran really small .. how is the customer supposed to know if u don_'_t put it on there .. well so by the time i ship the shoes back i will have more money in it than ever thing was worth .. stupid .. and they have horrible customer_service .
negative	i called to try to talk to a supervisor and they kept telling_me she '_s on the other line with another customer .. horrible
negative	within a few_days of ordering i did recieve my glasses but they had a major chip in the lens .
negative	i called as soon as i had opened and noticed the defect which i had spoke to someone informing_me i would have to lay for shipping and then refunded which i argued as not resonable as i shouldn_'_t be out of any more money than i already was .
negative	especially after showing pictures and i clearly was not at fault .
negative	i then was approached by a supervision who had seemed very concerned at the time but i sent the product back ( with prepaid shipping label ) and heard_nothing back .
negative	i tried_calling four different times with two voice messages left and still no response , this is nearly one and half weeks after i mailed it and only a fee days shy of my tracking label saying it had been received .
negative	i then recieved an_email_stating they recieved my returned package ( just an automatic email , nothing personal ) that told me i would hear something within 00_hours , which again was a lie .
negative	i called agin this morning three_times until i recieved a call back ( which i missed ) and had a voicemail saying that i should gisele a refund posted today but pushed through either tomorrow or monday ... a total of nearly two_weeks after receiving the defective item !
negative	not very reasonable or responsible if you ask me .
negative	and i had planned to order a new pair and try again but after this hassle , i will not be ordering from afeyewear again !
negative	ordering was quick and efficent
negative	let_down by delivery .
negative	order sent to home address ( credit_card address ) when it should have been delivered to site .
negative	i don_'_t need 000 shredder bags for home !
negative	0st deliver , left with neighbour
negative	0nd deliver taken_away and note left .... plus various calls and emails to my site to advise that they couldn_'_t deliver ?
negative	?
negative	i ordered an a /_c compressor for my bmw .
negative	partsgeek sent the wrong part !
negative	when i used their form to ask for authorization to return it .
negative	i received a ridiculous reply stating , " we have this part ".
negative	no mention of how to return part ot receive a refund .
negative	reading their return_policy is a lesson in buyer_beware ... the customer pays return shipping even if the fault is partsgeek '_s .
negative	will definitelu never order from them and will let my mechanic know to never refer another customer to them !
negative	to make it even better , if the part is faulty after installation ... too bad , too sad for the consumer !
negative	steer_clear and get your parts elsewhere .
negative	product is still on back order .
negative	it is not possible to rate quality of product but the availability is a big fat zero .
negative	i ordered and paid petit fours for the holidays .
negative	they were never received .
negative	i wrote , asking for assistance .
negative	no acknowledgement .
negative	i wrote again .
negative	same .
negative	i made a reservation over the phone believing i was directly connected to hampton_inn main reservation line .
negative	i was never advised that i was not directly speaking with a representative of hampton_inn .
negative	the rate quoted to me was $_000 .
negative	when i arrived at the hampton_inn they checked me in for $_00 .
negative	my receipt the next_morning was for $_00 plus taxes .
negative	the next_day i had a receipt online from you for the $_000 plus taxes .
negative	when i called your number to try to resolve the problem , your phone line kept disconnecting .
negative	i spent 00_minutes trying to connect with someone to resolve the problem and was finally told that i would not receive a refund for the higher charge .
negative	two out of the three people i spoke with were not at all empathetic and the phone frustratingly kept disconnecting .
negative	i have a very bad opinion of your organization .
negative	first , i ' d like to say that the young_lady_who attempted to help us was terrific .
negative	she did everything she could to make our experience better , but was restricted by travelocity '_s policies .
negative	when we bought our tickets it said we could buy insurance for around $_00 . 00 .
negative	we took that option because it seemed like a small price to pay for flight insurance .
negative	however , when we saw the bill , it turned_out that we paid $_00 . 00 for that insurance because it was doubled and we were surprised .
negative	we felt_like we had been tricked by travelocity .
negative	i immediately called to ask to cancel that insurance because we thought it was too much .
negative	the young_lady , although very sweet and charming , said we could not cancel the insurance - even_though it was only moments after our purchase .
negative	she then said she could give us a $_00 certificate for future travelocity purchases , all we would have to do is call travelocity .
negative	visions of trying to call travelocity and being put on hold popped_up and i told her i would never call travelocity and would like a certificate emailed to me .
negative	she said she was unable to do that and was firm about it .
negative	although i was on the phone for some time , those are the basics of what happened .
negative	our only alternative would have been to completely cancel our reservation and start all over again with another service .
negative	this seemed to be too difficult , so we let it go as it was .
negative	however , this event completely soured us on travelocity and your policies .
negative	thank_you for asking .
negative	i have taught customer_service classes in the past and i know it is very valuable to find out specifics about both good and bad_experiences .
negative	i will never purchase any items from this company again .
negative	i think that there return process is horrible .
negative	i received my shoes and i was happy with them but i really needed a larger_size .
negative	i contacted the company to request an exchange and they advised that they do not offer exchanges only store credits .
negative	i was okay with that but they didn_'_t provide me with a shipping label .
negative	so i paid for the original item to be shipped to me , then i had to pay to have it returned to the company .
negative	once they received it , they did not give me a full_refund , i was only refunded the amount i paid for the shoes in the form of a store credit .
negative	i think that this process is absolutely_ridiculous .
negative	i am accustomed to companies , at the very minimum issuing a full_refund , which includes the item price and shipping .
negative	i was very dissatisfied with the return process .
negative	beware before ordering from this company !
negative	i ordered a donut shaped memory_foam pillow from easy_comforts , and when i got it , it was so hard , it was like sitting on a brick .
negative	it gave_me more pain !
negative	i threw it out .
negative	if you use this service please book online - do not , i repeat , do not make any changes .
negative	they do not value customers ' time , concerns or input .
negative	representatives continually raised their voices and cut me off as i tried explaining my challanges with the site and overages , and there is no_doubt in my mind i was over - charged .
negative	i received no confirmation .
negative	i phoned and travelocity was too busy to talk with me .
negative	i went back online , and found the fare had increased , so did not repeat the booking .
negative	not until i received my visa bill did i know that i had been billed for the ticket .
negative	on the phone with visa researching this ( on hold 00 - 00_minutes ).
negative	no cooperation from the
negative	travelocity personnel ( mexican ?)
negative	when customer ( i ) put in 0 passengers , the rate should either change to reflect the price increase or some apparent memo should alert customer of price adjustment .
negative	it is written in the small_print , which is deceptive , in my opinion .
negative	hiya ,
negative	was given a link to get some of these festive candles , which i thought would be great for my elderly parent .
negative	safe yet authentic looking .
negative	i thought i ' d buy one , and then if there were as lovely looking in real_life as they are on line , i ' d buy a whole lot more for family and friends .
negative	well i ordered it .
negative	waited for it .
negative	still_waiting for it .....
negative	receiving good by other_companies that i ordered items after i ordered the festive candle ....
negative	still not received the candle
negative	to quote an old motown diana ross song .... ' i '_m still_waiting ....'
negative	i ' d give this one a miss .
negative	i received the product i ordered with the assumption it would have some guidance or paperwork ........... none .
negative	i unfortunately made the mistake of scheduling a reservation through reservation_counter .
negative	i had an emergent change that ocurred after the " cancellation period " and i called to see if the date could be moved to a different date without being charged again .
negative	i was hung_up on once and disconnected 0 times .
negative	i was placed on hold for extended lengths of time for people to speak with their " team ."
negative	i tried to approach this through the hotel_directly , and was told i had to work through the reservation_counter .
negative	at the end of the day i had to cancel my own reservation and was still charged .
negative	that is wrong and should not have occurred .
negative	i will never use this resource again .
negative	i have already sent you an_email to let you know that the delivery service have not delivered my parcel as they say it has_been damaged and that i had to get in touch with you .
negative	please let_me know what is to happen next .
negative	go elsewhere .
negative	i was scheduling a trip from detroit to phoenix for feb 00 to march 0 .
negative	i thought i had made a delta flight reservation sometime in jan .
negative	when it got close to trip time i realized that i didn_'_t remember seeing an_email_confirmation .
negative	i called customer_service and was told i didn_'_t have the delta reservation , so i made reservations on us air .
negative	i needed to change the departure_date due to a death in the family .
negative	when i called to do that i found out i did have the delta flight after all .
negative	i talked to a supervisor and she said that that reservation had gone into a guest account for some_reason and the agent hadn_'_t followed protocol to determine whether or not i had a flight reservation .
negative	i '_ve been a long standing user of travelocity and am sure i made my reservation on line in my account .
negative	she said that i was stuck with the $_000 cancellation_fee and that she said she would send me a $_00 hotel coupon .
negative	i haven_'_t found that either .
negative	i also got an_email from delta asking how i enjoyed the flight so now i '_m not even sure it got cancelled appropriately .
negative	in any case , i don_'_t know how to find the account when i want to make future travel_plans .
negative	never recieve an_email with tracking #... it took more than 0_weeks for my package to come .
negative	then once my package is here ; items are missing .. out of nowhere the item is backorder ... horrrribleeee service !!!!
negative	worst of all this website never answers emails ; they answer me when i got the package today 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	i recently bought a vaillant flue extention and bend , i waited 0 days for an_email to tell me it would take 00 days for delivery , i managed to get that reduced to 0 .
negative	then when they arrived the bend was missing the sealing ring .
negative	when i phoned to ask about return as by then i had a plumber here waiting to fit them and i had to source a very expensive replacement , i was told i had to pay for the return .
negative	i queried this and recurved an_email , ate i sent photographs of the item to show it was missing , saying the product had to be returned in perfect_condition and i would have to pay for the insured return .
negative	i think this is a disgusting policy .
negative	i can i return a perfect item when it wasn_'_t perfect to start with ?
negative	i will never use this company again nor recommend it to any body !
negative	i have used wowcher a couple of times and i have had to make phone_call after phone_call to find out where my goods are .
negative	as it happens i am waiting now for something i ordered 0th may .
negative	after_spending 00_minutes on hold and not a free phone_number , i was told i had to email the merchant direct , they haven_'_t replied either !
negative	tbh i cant see me either using wowcher again or recommending it to anyone .
negative	every time i have ordered from this company it takes them weeks to ship my order from their wear house .
negative	for example_: i placed this order only a couple days ago and used free_shipping because i will not make the same mistake twice .
negative	but my package still_hasn_'_t shipped .
negative	0 and 0 days_later i placed orders through two other company '_s and both companies have already shipped my order .
negative	for this reason amiclubwear does not get my frequent business ( i online shop a lot ) and these other_companies do .
negative	the first time i ordered from amiclubwear i paid for rushed shipping which was $_00 .
negative	after almost 0_weeks my package finally arrived .
negative	when customer_support finally got back to me they told they can take up to 00 days to ship it out and they refused to reimburse_me the 00 dollars .
negative	i was furious and didn_'_t order from them for quite a while .
negative	another problem is whenever i try to check out with my registered account i have to change my shipping and billing_address since i moved .
negative	when i change both those and try to go to the next step it never let '_s me go to it .
negative	any computer i use just says page is loading , but it never loads .
negative	so i have to check out as a guest despite having an account .
negative	i wish you could rate this company in categories like shipping , customer_service , quality of merchandise and cost .
negative	however since i can '_t i only give them 0_stars instead of 0 because they price for clothes is amazing .
negative	everything else is horrible .
negative	so if you order from them i recommend using free_shipping so when your package takes weeks to reach you , you won_'_t be disappointed that you spent so much on rushed shipping and you didn_'_t get it in time for whatever occasion you needed the outfit for
negative	this is an update to my review : i got part of my order in with no time_frame on when they will ship the rest of my order .
negative	one of the items i did receive is the incorrect item .
negative	it is packaged in a wrapper with the same item number as the one i ordered , but it is not the correct one .
negative	it now says on the website that the item is out of stock .
negative	so instead of refunding me my money they sent me an item i do not like .
negative	like i said the package still says its the correct item .
negative	i am very curious as to what customer_support will say when they finally get back to me .
negative	unfortunately for them i do have a picture on my phone of the outfit i ordered and i will be taking a picture of the one i received .
negative	this is the last time i will ever order from this company .
negative	oh and the comment on my review from amiclubwear . com support saying they will contact me directly , well they never contacted me at all .
negative	that is the kind of customer_service you can expect from this company .
negative	update_: so they still_haven_'_t gotten back to me to talk to them about my return or explain_why they have not shipped my other item .
negative	after_reading other reviews about what it takes to get your money back from amiclubwear i '_m debating if i want to deal with all that bull or bite the bullet and lose out on my money .
negative	i will never order from this company again and will never refer them to anyone i know .
negative	do not trust this company with your money .
negative	i am impressed with the large array of choices on this site .
negative	unfortunately , if the company cannot produce the products then it really doesn_'_t matter .
negative	after my husband and i finally agreed on a piece of art for our new_kitchen , we ordered the largest size 00x00 metal version .
negative	within a week of when i ordered it , i was sent an_email_saying that they were refunding our money .
negative	evidently , the artist did not give them a large enough pixel image for them to reproduce it in that size .
negative	shouldn_'_t they have figured that out before they offered that size ?
negative	trying to find another common preferred piece did not happen , so we elected to order it in the next biggest size they could produce it in ( 0 sizes down from what they showed as available on their site even a week_later ).
negative	when it arrived we were so happy .
negative	that was until we opened the package .
negative	the piece was damaged - not from the shipping because the packing was thorough and the packaging was intact .
negative	it took what seemed like forever for them to replace it .
negative	the replacement came today and it is damaged too .
negative	i am sorry to recommend that you shop elsewhere as this purchase has just been one disappointment after another .
negative	i went to get all the contacts signed so i could move into this rental .
negative	upon walking in , the smell of car urine was so overwhelming we turned right around and left .
negative	we saw 0 cats inside but the litter_boxes were over full and they ' d started_using the floor .
negative	i am allergic to cats but that wasn_'_t what ran us out the door that day , it was the extremely unsanitary conditions of the office .
negative	it was disgusting .
negative	not renting there and will never recommend .
negative	no stock control , couldnt even be bothered to reply to e_- mails .
negative	opened a dispute via_paypal then it got sorted !
negative	if you want your parcel don_'_t bother with yodel , you won_'_t get it .
negative	they have lost my parcels , thrown them over the garden fence , faked my signature need i go on .
negative	out of about 0 things they should have bought me they have successfully delivered 0 !
negative	i hope they are out of business soon !
negative	terrible customer_service .
negative	contacted them by phone three_times and emailed and no cd and no response qfrom them .
negative	answering_machine picks_up and no one calls you back .
negative	sure , you can write a great and honest review , but if someone disagrees with you , just be prepared to field plenty of trolls .
negative	the admin does nothing about this , just lets the vicious bullying continue without_any punishment or retraction .
negative	for this reason , i can '_t honestly say that i will recommend or possibly review again .
negative	they need to check the trolls and name calling .
negative	then it will be a 0_star site .
negative	the website claims to sell steam and origin keys .
negative	i purchased one in good faith , assuming i simply needed to activate it on steam , as_advertised on their website .
negative	instead , once payment was sent , the key would not work .
negative	i emailed them , and to my disgust they told me i would need to download ( torrent ) the 0gb game instead and then apply the key for it to work .
negative	ie , this is not a steam key .
negative	i don_'_t even think this version automatically updates .
negative	you get to do that yourself .
negative	if i ' d wanted to go the torrent route , i wouldn_'_t have purchased the game in the first place .
negative	the idea was i would buy a steam key cheaply and easily .
negative	i haven_'_t even tried using the key .
negative	i have a pretty shit internet_connection and a 0gb game would take months .
negative	joke '_s on me .
negative	opened a dispute with paypal to get my money back but not holding my breath .
negative	will never use again .
negative	used o0 because i assumed ( wrongly ) that they were a reputable_company .
negative	took £_00 less just to send it to them assuming that they would be more honest .
negative	they are not and do not use given the option - they are no better_than the smaller firms .
negative	took 00_%_off for cosmetic damage - the phone does not have an visible damage and given that these are 0nd hand phones i would have expected that the initial quote would cover some cosmetic damage .
negative	unacceptable - but its fine because i shall not be renewing my £_00 a month contract with them .
negative	i can see this company going bankrupt if they keep stealing from people .
negative	i could not have been more frustrated and angry with the service i '_ve endured for the past 0 months dealing_with ehealth .
negative	to start , i attempted to apply for coverage with blue cross blue shield in october_0000 .
negative	two months had gone by where i had not heard a response .
negative	when i attempted to contact a representative , i was met with a very abrasive ehealth employee who stated my only option is to wait and , " what is it that i expect him to do about my situation ?".
negative	i felt the service i felt the response from this particular " gentleman " was rude and completely_unacceptable !
negative	i will do my best to encourage_anyone to stay away from using this as a route to insurance_coverage .
negative	and can only suggest that ehealth attempt to hire people that are consumer friendly , especially if their job is dealing_with people !
negative	i '_ve used travelocity in the past to purchase airline_tickets and have had no problem .
negative	booking a hotel , room , however , proved otherwise .
negative	i originally_booked the room for 0 nights .
negative	i then needed to cancel the first night ; i called the hotel and was told i needed to call travelocity , which i did .
negative	they canceled the first night and told me i would be receiving a confirming e_- mail .
negative	that never happened .
negative	i called the hotel again to verify that it had in fact been done , which it had .
negative	i got a confirmation of the reservations the day before check - in ... from the hotel .
negative	i noticed that they had my debit_card number on there , which i had not authorized at the time i made the booking as my husband was planning on paying cash .
negative	the weekend of the hotel stay , i needed to cancel another night .
negative	because i was the one who made the reservations for my husband and son through a third_party , they were told i would need to call travelocity .
negative	i ended_up talking to five different people : " grace ," " aaron ," " jake ," " julia ," and " al ," who pronounced his name " au ."
negative	whoever i was talking to got all my information and then needed to transfer me to someone_else .
negative	during the transfer of the call , i would get cut_off and have to call back .
negative	and in the end , " al " told me i needed to call the hotel .
negative	my advice to travelocity : if you ' re going to outsource your customer_service , train the people so they can actually help the customer without_having to transfer the call , or set it up so any changes in reservations can be made directly with the hotel , because in the end , that '_s what needed to be done .
negative	not impressed .
negative	no one to help .., left me hanging ..., no concern for me as a
negative	customer .., no call to apologize .., driver very disconnected not friendly not apologetic about nothing obvious he did not care will not recommend at all
negative	will tell friends not to use this service
negative	hi we are selling our house , moving to a place we dont even know where yet , we are 00 and 00 yrs_old , and chose public_storage to help give us peace of mind while storing some items .
negative	since we got the unit !!
negative	every time we have gone there to use the key pad to get into the back of building ( b ) where our unit is , is has_been unoperable and we had to get the receptionist to physically come there and open it from inside the building or coming direct to meet us and trying and trying to punch the numbers the right way and then finally get them all to work .
negative	this has_been frustrating enough but when i had an_emergency and went there at 0 am and met a person_who i had to give her a couple items from the unit , it was 0 / 0 hr before the receptionist arrives , and we had to wait for her to arrive and come help us .
negative	!!!
negative	a catastrophe !
negative	i called her the next_day and asked her to call me when the keypad was fixed or replaced ; she never did !
negative	when i had to go back to use the building again to put add items in my unit , i called her first and reminded her she never called me .
negative	then i asked her - was it fixed or replaced and she said no .
negative	not the answer i wanted to hear .
negative	thats the story !
negative	you asked , i told .
negative	i still have that unit but am very dissatisfied , am too busy looking for another place to buy and also getting all our stuff out of our present house ( sell ), that i cant cancel with you all and remove and transfer my stuff to a better company .
negative	god_knows tho that they have to be out there .,
negative	i bought 0 pairs of shoes ..
negative	wore them twice one heel broke on one of the pairs .. i spend $$ 00 dollars i emailed to complain and they never returned my email back wtf ??..
negative	cheap material i will never buy from this website never ever .. no wonder everthing is cheap .. its all cheap material ..
negative	i ve ordered s coat and after 0 - 0 days got an_email for a refund bcoz the coat was not even there n they said its out of stock ... very disappointed n absolutely gutted bcoz ordered tht for my friends birthday n i ve told her about the coat as well .. quite embarrassing experience .
negative	i have used this bank for 00 years and suddenly customer_service is shocking .
negative	0_weeks if chasing things round and still no positive outcome .
negative	sick and tired of being told i would receive a call back to never receive one .
negative	will not recommend , now looking at leaving
negative	be aware of the misleading information with regard to delivery times .
negative	sqaure photo_books clearly_states within the webpage delivery 0 - 0 working days with no mention on the page that photo_paper takes extra time .
negative	download the software again and again no mention .
negative	e_- mails go un - responded , telephone_calls dismissive with staff again as confused over their information as customers .
negative	good luck to all whom attempt to use this company .
negative	although i thought i was getting a low fair for flying delta this way , i will not be using this service again .
negative	i was unware of payng for my suitcase , so that was an_unexpected cost to me .
negative	as well as all the phone numbers to reach bravo were international numbers , i live in the united_states and didnt even know how to call a international number to ask questions about my flight .
negative	this was a huge innconvince to me .
negative	in addition i will never fly delta again the service was crappy !
negative	i purchased a bag of food from petflow .
negative	it took about a week to arrive .
negative	the day after i received the bag , it was announced that the food was part of a recall .
negative	i found out due to seeing crossposted articles on facebook .
negative	petflow has my name , address , phone_number , email address , and a record of what i purchase .
negative	i still_haven_'_t heard_anything from them .
negative	i '_ve gotten a couple of emails enticing me to buy or asking about recent purchases , but no mention of the recall .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	the idea is very good , now not target for the size and type of dogs at all , less say i own two small chihuahuas ans they send me things for a huge dog , obviously is like some one use size small and receive thing x large , , while the idea is good , not customized is not worth any thing !
negative	i ordered a laptop from them which was despatched in november_0000 , using parcelforce .
negative	i tracked the laptop to germany and there it has disappeared .
negative	laptops direct couldn_'_t be less helpful .
negative	they say that the responsibility is mine and that i probably_won_'_t get a claim settled by parcelforce .
negative	whatever happened to " customer care "?
negative	i am now left with no laptop and a sizeable hole in my bank balance .
negative	their conduct may be " legal " but it definitely is totally immoral .
negative	i would recommend that nobody use this company unless they enjoy days and days of seemingly pointless frustration .
negative	if the company had any conscience it would either refund my money or replace the goods .
negative	i made reservations specifically because i must travel with 0 dogs and after accepting my reservations ($ & credit information ) they tell me they can not accommodate me .
negative	now it '_s up to me to call the hotel and cancel the reservations .
negative	there are too many other products out there like kayak .
negative	i won_'_t trust travelocity again !
negative	what if i had gotten to the hotel and was turned away !?
negative	shame !
negative	received wrong_size .
negative	called customer_service .
negative	they said they would send replacement as soon as it showed that myeturn was in the mail .
negative	they did not do this and item is out of stock .
negative	picked another item .
negative	was told i would receive by dec 00 .
negative	still don_'_t have it .
negative	was told it was sent yesterday fed_ex over night .
negative	no delivery tody .
negative	id_wholesaler '_s practice of hounding customers to ' verify ' orders and then asking for personal information is terrible .
negative	i '_ll never do_business with them again .
negative	i placed an order for a book and never received it and now dualj is not cooperating and will not respond to my dispute .
negative	do not buy from this site !
negative	i asked for the item to be delivered , 0nd day delivery .
negative	it took 0 days , and because i had gone out of town , had to wait_until i got back to get the delivery .
negative	quick and error free !
negative	i was initially very impressed with dido bridal and their offering for bridesmaids_dresses , and the cheapest going !
negative	well that should have been my first warning signal that in order to churn out dresses that cheaply , the rest of their business must be shocking and it is .
negative	they were very helpful in sending me swatches ( and then subsequently chasing me up for an order - they actually called my mobile from china can you believe it ?!).
negative	i eventually chose my 0 dresses and ordered them in line with the sizing_chart on their website .
negative	well , the size 00 was ginormous as was the size 0 .
negative	i am usually a size 00 dress and both swamped me .
negative	however because they were so cheap i didn_'_t mind accepting that i would have to pay a seamstress to take them in and i ' d_rather that than them being so small they couldn_'_t be let out .
negative	anyway , i thought all was well until i had my bridesmaids round to try the dresses on and one of them ( light green chiffon ) had a large blue biro mark down the back !
negative	i '_m getting_married abroad so the dresses will be under bright natural daylight and a line of pen on one of them just wasn_'_t acceptable .
negative	so i began an_email conversation with someone from the site who in every email reply told me ' but it '_s not noticeable '.
negative	i '_ll be the judge of that thank_you and i can '_t_believe they think it acceptable to have sent a dress which is clearly flawed .
negative	i even quoted their own t & cs which state that " if regrettably you find our dresses have the following issues that could not meet your requirements , you have the rights to return the dress to get a refund ."
negative	"• defective , damaged or miss shipped items . "
negative	well a refund wasn_'_t offered to me and instead i was told to get it dry cleaned to see if that sorted it .
negative	the customer care was awful and i '_m so upset at the prospect of having to try and remedy the problem - in hindsight i wish i ' d spent a little_bit more money to get a better product .
negative	do not buy from this website unless you expect to be disappointed .
negative	don_'_t buy from them .
negative	they took the money out of my account over a week_ago and never shipped the part .
negative	you call their phone , they never pick_up and keep kicking you out of the queue .
negative	i tried for over 0 hours , then they closed on me .
negative	save_yourself the hassle and the money , go elsewhere .
negative	i was ripped_off of almost $_000 from a dishonest seller and ebay will do nothing .
negative	shop amazon , they are a log for reputable
negative	i got ripped_off of almost $_000 on items i returned to the sender on ebay .
negative	paypal did nothing to help .
negative	they advertise bogus claims on guaranteed purchases .
negative	go shop amazon at_least they are more honest and reliable !
negative	i ordered the oil and the process seemed great from the start , easy to order and pay etc .
negative	however i would have expected an_email_saying when it was actually delivered as it is a holiday property .
negative	furthermore the delivery driver claimed that he is constantly visiting our property with oil ( not true ), he also said to the guests that it seems the manager isn_'_t keeping on top of it which whilst also untrue is inappropriate and none of his business ...
negative	as a consequence i will not be using boiler_juice again .
negative	not happy at all , no one told us the car would stop at each traffic light , seemed like the lady at the desk wanted us to just keep buying more stuff and when we said not she was upset
negative	we purchased an expensive bosch_dishwasher online , paid an_additional price for the old_washer to taken_away .
negative	men arrived threw the new one at the front_door , and refused to collect the old one as they would not wait 0 minute for me to turn the water tap off and remove the hose .
negative	all other hoses were removed and the appliance was pulled out in the middle of the kitchen .
negative	they will not refund the collection fee .
negative	terrible customer_service !!!
negative	!
negative	i was very disappointed just want disappointed with the shipment i received in the mail and returned it via_ups and it was received by you on friday september_0th i am still_waiting for a cone phone_call from you which i placed one week prior to that .
negative	victoria mchatton 000 000 - 0000 . please call as soon as possible .
negative	i would prefer a full_refund including shipping as i was totally disappointed with the shipment not worth the money . i will not order again from your company .
negative	why don_'_t you offer an easy way to give a gift_card .. check out amazon .
negative	this was a hassle .
negative	i only wanted to send the gift_card to my grandson .
negative	it was sent to me and i have to go thru a ridiculous process !
negative	come on !
negative	i '_ll never recommend this site but will tell others to stay away !
negative	i '_m very curious to see if my grandson has problems receiving the itunes :( what don_'_t you just refund my money and let_me go away happy instead of adding to the problem !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i accidently ordered a gas_cap for a land_rover range_rover instead of a land_rover lr0 .
negative	i ordered it 0 day delivery .
negative	they will not provide a refund for the shipping , they will not pay for the shipping back to nj and ask that you pay extra for confirmation and insurance .
negative	not happy with the return_policy or service .
negative	also a side_note , the package shipped from the same city i live in , yet i need to ship it back to new_jersey .
negative	she does not know how to handle customers .
negative	i will not be returning , and will be moving my stuff early from this location as i will not give her a penny more !
negative	i have been a customer of smartbargains since 0000 .
negative	i purchased an item , which was the last one btw .
negative	ups attempted to deliver the item to me and after the final attempt it was immediately returned to smartbargains , duhhh whatever happended to keeping the item at the ups headquarters for a couple days so a working individual could have the opportunity to retrieve the item ??
negative	it would have been nice if i was informed of the rule during the ordering process i could have made other arrangements .
negative	it wasn_'_t a small pkg , it weighed 00_lbs !!
negative	so now the perfect addition to my home is now a memory .
negative	when i was told there was no way i could get my item , i decided to end my membership , why go through this again ?
negative	?
negative	i placed an order on 0 / 0 / 00 for basic single_vision distance glasses .
negative	by 0 / 00 / 00 the order status was still incomplete .
negative	once i inquired_about my order , recieved a response a few_days_later that they were sorry and would put a rush on it and proceeded to ask me to pay again becuase my payment expired .
negative	order finally shipped on 0 / 00 / 00 !!
negative	i ordered the exact_same prescription_glasses from a competitiors website on 0 / 00 / 00 and recieved in within a week , by 0 / 0 / 00 !
negative	the wait time is the number one reason i will never order from global_eyeglasses again .
negative	extremely disappointed .
negative	on 00th_march this year i ordered a gps for my sons_birthday , ordered being the operative word .
negative	after countless e_mails im still trying to get a refund . i asked today about my refund , they wanted my bank_details so i duly sent them , then they asked for my expiry_date , at this point i phoned my credit_card company up and was told do not give them anymore details from your card so i am at stalemate at the moment .
negative	i agree with all the other comments people have made they should be shut_down . on the upside i did order another gps from hot golf this was delivered next_day with free case and 0 0 0 voucher so all sites arnt bad .
negative	i ordered sunglasses for my partner at the end of january .
negative	they were on back order , and apparently sent to me mid - feb . my credit_card has_been charged and i have not received them : it is now feb_00th .
negative	very dissatisfied .
negative	ordered a tshirt for a family_members birthday and recieved a completely different tshirt in completely the wrong_size , will not be using this website again .
negative	i orderd an item from 00studio on 00st august and was told it would take 00 days as we were going away on 0th_september and my son would be working i asked if they would drop it off at my neighbours if it arrived early , when we arrived home on 00th september we had 0 delivery notes to say they had called and the parcel had gone back to their service centre , we contacted the centre and arranged for it to be deliverd on tuesday the 00th and waited in all day and still not arrived . we will not be ordering from anybody_who use this delivery service .
negative	i used trial pay to obtain an unlock_code for my phone .
negative	it took two_days to get a response and when i did i was informed that my phone couldn_'_t be unlocked via the normal route and would i like to pay an_additional_$_00 . 00 to have it done .
negative	when i didn_'_t respond right_away i received another email_asking for a different amount and that they charged me already .
negative	i told customer_service i was not happy with their business and i received a general email_saying so sorry , please send us your credit_card number with expiration_date and security_code to issue a refund .
negative	no way would i give out that info to anyone especially a company that is as shady as this one .
negative	since my review on 00 . 00 . 00 , daniel kudrick requested me to email him & provide him the order details .
negative	after emailing him on 00 . 00 . 00 , i still have not received a response on a replacement card or what so ever .
negative	just proves the company has lacking customer_service too .
negative	disappointing !
negative	!
negative	only if i could give this website zero_stars !!
negative	purchased the $_000 gift_card on 00 / 00 / 00 & paid for fedex priority overnight shipping of $_00 !!
negative	received the card on monday 00 . 00 . 00 which is awesome .
negative	but the card quality was extremely poor & the image i uploaded to imprint came out crooked .
negative	there were deep indented scratches on the card with total lack of quality control .
negative	the gift_card was going to be used as part of a sample presentation to ' gift ' our customers for the holiday_season .
negative	its not even in presentable quality & it directly reflects our company to our clients if we were to ' gift ' a card in such poor quality .
negative	after calling customer_service & voicing my complaint , the representative basically said you would need to make a new purchase , fees & shipping .
negative	are you kidding me ?
negative	i '_m not sure what happened , but after i typed in the code to get a discount , it gave_me a receipt for super 0 motel parking , when i had clicked on hilton express .
negative	i wanted every 00_minutes from the airport and now i have every hour !
negative	i ordered these flowers to be delivered on the sat before mothers_day they was suposed to be delivered sometime on that day right up till 0 pm i was told they was out for delivery and they would get there , i woke to an_email sunday_morning which said they had so many deliverys that they couldnt do mine and would deliver sometime monday as if this wasnt bad enough when the flowers did arrive they definatly wasnt worth the money i had paid and all parties were very disapointed when i asked for money of i was told i could have a 00_%_discount on the next one i ordered .
negative	like that is going to happen
negative	i purchased a pair of frames that i knew had been_discontinued by lafont .
negative	i made the purchase and later to learn that they are on back order , which was never listed on the website prior to checking out .
negative	the money was immediately taken out of my account yet i have no tentative date for which these glasses are coming in .
negative	i '_ve email their customer_service , got a response that i would be contacted within 00_hours which didn_'_t happen .
negative	i '_ve emailed the " call me " section with my request to cancel my order and be refunded the $_000 . 00 that has_been taken out of my account .
negative	i '_ve also emailed the service manager from which i saw on this site from another unsatisfied customer .
negative	still_haven_'_t heard_anything !
negative	so frustrating !!!!!
negative	what company doesn_'_t have a number to call to speak to a live_person .
negative	if smartbuyglass . com is actually reading these reviews i would appreciate a response to my multiple request and a refund of my purchase .
negative	i ordered a $_000 gift_card for my daughter '_s birthday and it never showed_up .
negative	my credit_card was charged but 0_weeks_later and still no gift_card .
negative	i emailed customer_service for help but they still_haven_'_t replied .
negative	now it '_s her_birthday and i '_m out $_000 .
negative	very upset .
negative	i will never trust this company again .
negative	i had 00 boxes of books in my storage_unit .
negative	any that were yellowed or worn were thrown out .
negative	all fiction went to goodwill .
negative	the ones in excellent condition , mostly not even opened to be read , were sold to cash0 books or amazon .
negative	the rest donated to a local spiritual center .
negative	again , only excellent condition books were kept .
negative	on one of the books i sent to you , you gave_me $ 0 due to " falling_apart ".
negative	this book was never opened to be read and in excellent condition .
negative	i expected $ 0 . 00 .
negative	there were a few other books that you downgraded the price , also .
negative	what a scam !
negative	i have no way of proving the condition , didn ; t think i needed photo '_s , trusted your company .
negative	never again !
negative	this is the worst agency !
negative	i bought ticket online after 0 min they sent me an_email_saying they have canceled my air ticket due to " system error " and they never refunded my money !!!
negative	the customer_service lady in new_york , her name is frida , she desnt even speak_english well explained me i will get my refund after they never asnwered on phone_calls .
negative	i am so disappointed .
negative	despite paying for expedited_shipping , delivery failed to make it in time .
negative	my kids didn_'_t have valentine '_s for their school party .
negative	placed order on a sunday , made it clear it was a rush and paid for rush shipping .
negative	despite this , delivery came on friday_afternoon .
negative	just terrible .
negative	ok this might take some time ,
negative	ordered some furniture in april_0000 from furniture in fashion tried to pay with debit_card only to be told that we couldn_'_t as our furniture was being delivered to spain where we live , and they would need additional information so i scanned my passport and copies of bills to my address and sent it of to them , still not enough , they wanted a bank_transfer ( i now know why ) ok so next_day i did a bank_transfer for .
negative	€ 0000 then waited and waited contacted my bank they told me the transfer had gone that day and that the company had the money in around two_days well after 00 days or so they said they had recieved it x at which point i decided to cancel my order as this whole_process was now beginning to worry me filled out online form also contacted the sales_team and asked them to make_sure this order was stopped , but got an_email around a week_later saying furniture was to be dispatched to there courier the next_day i once again called right_away and told them the items had been cancelled and was told they would stop the items , two_weeks_later it arrives at my home in spain i refused the items and wouldn_'_t sign for them so the courier took them away , i called again furniture in fashion only to now be told i was being charge 000 quid for delivery and 000 quid cancelation_fee unbelievable i have tried everything i can think of to get my money back but even the money they did promise me would be back in my account in november still has not been refunded x the calls i make to them are from spain so each time it '_s costing me more money they have stolen my money i '_m sorry but that '_s nearly a year now no goods no money there is no other word i can use except con big con i am now returning to the uk in a week to take legal_action to have my money refunded this matter has made me unwell as i '_m sure most of you would agree no one can_afford to write of 0000 euros i have a family and we worked very hard to earn that money what gives furniture in fashion a right to keep it ??????
negative	the one star is only because i could post my review without giving them one , trust me it would be minus stars if i could
negative	i ordered anxiety relief and melatonin pr for my daughter who uses both daily .
negative	she has asperger '_s syndrome and we use these herbs and they are very important for her daily function .
negative	when i received my order it was someone_else '_s order by mistake .
negative	i called and had to leave a message as there was not a person i could talk to .
negative	i had to call the next_day and they mailed out my order , but by then i was out of the supplements i needed and i still have not received them .
negative	i live in a small town and cannot buy these items locally so i rely_on my orders coming in before my daughter runs out .
negative	this really caused us problems .
negative	you would think a company like paypal would have better customer_service .
negative	instead , all their reps don_'_t know what they are doing .
negative	i feel_like i am more familiar to paypal than they are sometimes .
negative	ask to speak to a manager , they will tell you their managers are in a meeting and will call you back when they are out , but you will never receive a call back .
negative	try calling another day and their managers are in a " meeting " again .
negative	too bad i still have to use this company , i feel_like i '_m under a monopoly sometimes ....
negative	i got this backpack for my son because we have gotten two swiss gear backpacks for family_members before and really liked them .
negative	this pack however didn_'_t last through two_days .
negative	the material frayed at the seams and one of the loop tabs broke off at one end .
negative	when i made my reservation it states that i can pick_up my car from the airport .
negative	not true when i was shuttle to the airport rental every company was there except economy .
negative	avis help us look for economy station which was a telephone booth outside where i had to call and request the driver to pick me up from the airport which was 0 . 0 miles_away .
negative	the car_rental himself was very nice ( rent max fort lauderale 000 - 000 - 0000 ) best bet is to call direct and stay away from rentalcars . com .
negative	i had a true rip_off experience with them .
negative	promising free parking ($_00 ) and free wi_-_fi .
negative	($_00 ).
negative	they lied to me about both .
negative	i ended_up paying the parking fee of $_00 .
negative	the hotel westin st francis in san_francisco waived the wi_-_fi charge when i told them what happened .
negative	not a good experience !
negative	my room was poorly ventilated facing a very noisy street .
negative	i '_m sure i got that room because i went through hotelreservations . com .
negative	i '_m very disappointed .
negative	do not use this company to book your flights .
negative	they charged my parents 000_pounds more than the flight cost with united_airlines and was not able to tell me what for ?
negative	still_waiting for an answer 0 month later terrible customer_service .
negative	my parents are elderly not a good feeling when they can not give you an answer to what the additional costs were for ?
negative	shame on you carlton lesiure terribly rude agents ronnie was extremely_rude !
negative	do not use this company !
negative	it '_s been 00 days since i paid for goods i have still not received , despite_being charged £ 0 for saver delivery , which should only take 0 days .
negative	i contacted customer_services who have simply dismissed my complaint out of hand , saying that i just have to wait .
negative	when asked why my goods have not arrived , customer_service blamed their courier and said that they hadn_'_t anticipated the influx of orders they ' d received .
negative	meaning that boohoo had not planned the busy christmas_period into their schedule .
negative	sorry , but that is ludicrous .
negative	if true , it '_s the worst business management i '_ve come_across .
negative	i will now have to explain to my younger sibling that despite ordering over 0_weeks in advance , boohoo couldn_'_t get their act_together enough to deliver her christmas gift on time .
negative	it will be being returned and i will never be shopping at boohoo again .
negative	terrible company with bad organisation and a customer_service department who couldn_'_t care less .
negative	as a further example if this , they even spelled my name incorrectly in an_email , despite the correct spelling being attached to my account !
negative	not satisfied .
negative	i reserved a 00 x 00 unit online for $_000 monthly and received an_email_stating " confirmation " in the subject_line and containing a reservation number .
negative	i did this at 0 am .
negative	when i arrived at the location the next_morning with my 00ft uhaul and prepaid movers , i was told there were no 00 x 00 units available .
negative	the manager refused to look at my confirmation_email_telling_me that since i had not paid online - something i was not prompted to do , my " confirmed reservation " was only an inquiry , regardless of what my email stated in writing .
negative	i was offered a 00 x 00 unit for $_000 instead and had to pay the movers an extra 0 hours for extra time because they took longer_than_expected trying to get everything in the smaller unit .
negative	ultimately , my stuff didn_'_t fit in the smaller unit and i had to get a second unit at public_storage for my 0 yr_old disabled daughter '_s medical equipment .
negative	it '_s totally a bait - and - switch scam and they took_advantage of someone in need .
negative	i definitely wouldn_'_t recommend storage_mart to my worst_enemy !
negative	i sent you an_email about 0 - 0 questions , but i dodn ' y receive answer ... but i paid the license !
negative	:(
negative	we arranged to have meet and greet at heathrow .
negative	on the morning as asked i called 00mins prior to our arrival so that our car could be collected .
negative	we got to heathrow and had to wait 00mins for someone to meet us !
negative	then as we returned i called to confirm where our car would be to pick_up .... the location completely contradicted the written_instructions sent when i made the booking so i called again and was rudely greated by a representative saying i have already told you where to go , our driver has_been waiting ages for you .
negative	it seems it is ok for stress_free parking customers to have to wait but not for stress_free drivers !
negative	i had an elderly relative die and they would not let_me opt_out of two_days in a hotel in bodton .
negative	they probably sold my vacant room to someone_else and i was stuck in another city .
negative	even the airline let_me change my ticket !!
negative	!
negative	ordered item & not happy with the fit at all .
negative	doesn_'_t look like it does on the website therefore was disappointing when i tried it on .
negative	will be returning it .
negative	i emailed letting the company know i needed to return the costume due to wrong fit .
negative	they then emailed letting_me know i could not return because i opened the bag .
negative	i never opened the bag , the costume was plus size which would never fit me .
negative	i ordered incorrectly .
negative	i went back and forth through email getting nowhere .
negative	i finally sent an_email_stating i was done arguing over a $_00 costume and i would never be using their services again .
negative	i also have warned everyone i know about their poor customer_service .
negative	sometimes a low price isn_'_t everything .
negative	consider , that even if you order the correct_part they might not fit with other manufacturer parts .
negative	i ordered all the correct parts for my car .
negative	there was no_indication from parts_geek that the strut mount would not fit with manufacturers boot .
negative	consider that even when parts_geek are at fault for shipping the incorrect part you have to pay the shipping to send it back !!!
negative	i also received incorrect parts in the properly labeled box .
negative	what type of quality control do they have ?
negative	i still had to pay shipping and it was parts_geeks fault .
negative	consider that noone answers the phone and e_- mail is the only means of communication .
negative	when they don_'_t e_- mail you don_'_t communicate !!
negative	consider you are limited to how many e_- mails you can send them when making a return .
negative	they also don_'_t honor coupon_codes .
negative	i would not order again from them .
negative	the website stated orders would be processed within 0 days .
negative	i ordered items from this site and another site on the same day .
negative	i received items from the other site and amiclubwear had yet to ship my order .
negative	i wanted my order for vacation and because it was not going to arrive in time i attempted to call and cancel my order .
negative	i tried 00 times in one day to call and was unable to reach customer_service because each time i tried i received a notice that all circuits were busy .
negative	i tried multiple_times on several days to cancel and was unable to reach anyone .
negative	it '_s been extremely frustrating .
negative	one of my dogs has_been put on a special_diet and is not carried by the vet who put her on it .
negative	i called the company royal_canin and they advised petflow carried it .
negative	i ordered thru them and got back an e_- mail saying they needed a script from the vet and before i could get that i got a second e_- mail saying my order was shipped .
negative	i ordered separate food for my other dog and cat since it was so convient or so i thought .
negative	i got my second shipment without_any invoices or anything but the company said that was the way they did it .
negative	ok .
negative	i realized i was shipping to soon so went online to change the ship dates and found that they no_longer carried the prescription food from royal_canin .
negative	i didn_'_t get an e_- mail to let_me know , i guess i would have found out with the next shipment for the other 0 animals who '_s food i can get in a store locally .
negative	this is very poor customer_service .
negative	i was depending_on this company for the food my dog needed .
negative	do not buy from here .
negative	their advertisement sound so promising , but you will be seriously disappointed !
negative	we get better for less at lowes and the home_depot .
negative	they know their quality of plants and guarantee their plants for one year from the date of purchase with out extra_fees and no questions ask .
negative	just keep your receipt !
negative	brighter_blooms made me feel_like i was punked .
negative	first order of $ 0 , 000 was nice plants with bb only had one hiccup that didn_'_t go so well at first but was corrected after posting complaints .
negative	i always give companies a second chance ..
negative	huge mistake this time !
negative	next orders of over $_000 was not worth it at all !
negative	plants are small , barely alive , doubt they will make and more of what you would get off a clearance rack !
negative	i '_ve cried and cried and wrestled with anger !
negative	going to find my next step to resolving the false_advertisement of " bigger better blooms !"
negative	i '_m out to much for plants that arrived if such poor quality .
negative	want pics !
negative	?
negative	i sent a $_00 gift_card to my niece for her_birthday at nmu and it was not received .
negative	it has_been a disappointment for us both not to receive her_birthday_gift .
negative	i '_m going to send a check in the mail so she has a present from her aunt .
negative	thank_you , shelly
negative	we are traveling to the bahamas and since it was us bahamas , i thought that we were able to travel with a government id only .
negative	while booking the trip , i wrote the names as they appear in our government ids since ( as in any other travel website ) it did not specify to write your name as it appears in the passport .
negative	after booking the trip , i called right_away to make_sure that a government id was only needed to travel to us bahamas .
negative	it was then when i found out that a passport was needed to travel to us bahamas and that i had to change the names as they appear in our_passports .
negative	i was charged $_00 . 00 dollars after changing the names since they claimed they had to cancel the flight and rebooked it with the " correct names ".
negative	ironically they gave_me the same seats .
negative	i had booked a lot flights as well as many vacations online , but i have never dealt_with something like this .
negative	i was shopping for thorne msm - 000 and typed that in the search_bar .
negative	thorne ar - encap popped_up .
negative	the bottles are identical !
negative	i was in a hurry and didn_'_t read the description carefully , and ordered the product .
negative	didn_'_t notice it was not what i wanted until it arrived and i opened it .
negative	the caps were not what i was expecting .
negative	then i looked at the bottle and went back to the website .
negative	seriously folks , why find a different product than what i am searching for ??
negative	that doesn_'_t help me !
negative	at_least find a different msm product !
negative	on 00 november 00 ! 0 , i purchased a navy women '_s long duffle_coat , for which i paid $_000 . 00 ( usd ).
negative	i checked with my bank and confirmed that country_attire has_been paid .
negative	i '_ve sent them numerous request , asking for the status of my order .
negative	all i have gotten was automated replies .
negative	that keeps telling_me , someone will get back to me .
negative	and that has not happened .
negative	i suspect that because i live in the united_states , they will never get back to me .
negative	they now have my money and the coat , and i am out of money and a coat .
negative	once they submitted for payment which they should not have done til the coat had been shipped .
negative	as i am posting this review in 0 december_0000 , i still have not heard from country_attire .
negative	to add_insult to injury , they keep sending emails trying to sell things . all i want is the coat that i paid for .
negative	i am so angry , that i just don_'_t know what to do .
negative	if there is anyone over in the uk that can help me , please do .
negative	the linens aren_'_t here yet , friend .
negative	paid for food on 00 oct ... food was supposed to have sent 00 oct ... have tha automatic delivery plan today is 0 nov still no food
negative	ordered unique items on here and was willing to pay a little more because i assumed they were good quality items .
negative	flannel pajama pants were thin and shrunk immensely after one wash without putting in dryer !
negative	shirt had huge iron on decal which wouldn_'_t softer so it was like having a plate across the chest and faded , ran and became completely discolored after one washing .
negative	these were supposed to be christmas_eve pajamas so now i am frantically searching for new ones .
negative	have not heard back from company yet so i will update when and if i do .
negative	my sons iphone_0s needed to be replaced .
negative	so of course it '_s under_warranty .
negative	keep in mind it a sprint serviced phone .
negative	well it '_s been two_weeks 0 phones later .
negative	we received verizon phones each time .
negative	square_trade also didn_'_t have the phone and told me to go to apple and buy another one .
negative	and they will reimburse_me .
negative	apple doesn_'_t carry the phone anymore so another wasted trip .
negative	then they said they would send an iphone 0 as a replacement .
negative	guess what .
negative	a verizon phone again !!
negative	each time they sent a phone i had to go to fedex since a signature is required .
negative	more waiting .
negative	more inconvenience and wasting my gas .
negative	now i was told the only phone they had was a 00gb iphone that was supposed to be shipped last friday .
negative	guess what ?
negative	as of the following_monday nothing was received .
negative	oh and by the way , don_'_t ask to speak to a supervisor , they don_'_t exist .
negative	even_though you ' re promised a call back within 00_hours .
negative	it '_s been almost two_weeks and six phone_calls no results , no call back and no phone !
negative	!
negative	i have had identity_guard for a few_years_now and as such , should be a valued_customer .
negative	yesterday i upgraded from the basic service , to the premium service , only to find out that the software does not work on the mac os system .
negative	today i called to go back to my basic service and the customer_service agent attempted to call tech .
negative	support for 00 - 00_minutes .
negative	i was not only left on hold , but when she came back , she said she had spoken to her supervisor and that i had to call them back in 00 - 00_hours , if i wanted to downgrade my service .
negative	i got so mad that i just cancelled my entire account and she was absolutely pleased to cancel it !
negative	she should have acknowledged how ridiculous it was that she kept me on hold for all that time and then how further ridiculous the notion that the customer has to call back .
negative	thanks for your time and hopefully this is taken seriously or you '_ll be out of business in no time !
negative	who don_'_t let you off the phone .
negative	they tried to recommend storage_facilities without asking me where i lived ... so , they recommended places that were super far away .
negative	then i tried to say no , thank_you .
negative	they wouldn_'_t let_me off the phone and kept pushing the sale .... the salesperson was " afraid i would miss out on their deals ."
negative	super annoying ... never calling them again .
negative	i made an online purchase .
negative	i was under the impression it was being shipped from overseas .
negative	i was charged excessive shipping fees ( more than the item cost ).
negative	it was shipped from within the states .
negative	it arrived broken .
negative	i emailed them with my concerns and asked for a reply .
negative	never received a reply !
negative	terrible customer_service !!!
negative	i ordered two bikins from this company which they charged me for both , in the end only receiving one .
negative	i called to speak with a manager and ofcource they weren_'_t in the office to speak with .
negative	it disgusted me to hear how they knew one of the two bikinis i purchased they didn_'_t even have in stock and the one originally i ordered was damaged and used ?
negative	gross !
negative	i work at a hospital and as far as i '_m concerned this is a serious issue with bodily fluids and contaminants .
negative	the lady_who i spoke with on the phone was so unprofessional she was laughing at me when i told her i am unsatisfied and i will be returning my things .
negative	she stated they don_'_t except returns and she won_'_t be returning my money .
negative	funny because when you call they have a line for processing returns .
negative	as far a i '_m concerned they never told me returns were not available with them .
negative	i '_m never shopping at this place again , and for them to charge their customers for things and them not have them in stock and wont be shipping , is a law suit waiting to happen :)
negative	i signed_up for stamps . com to see if was more affordable to send packages .
negative	what i didn_'_t realize was that stamps . com was going to charge me $_00 . 00 every_month .
negative	they did not make this clear .
negative	i never even sent a package !
negative	when i saw the charge on my credit_card , i called stamps . com .
negative	i was put on hold several_times .
negative	they said they would close my account but they didn_'_t want to waive the fee .
negative	i argued with them and then they said they would give a partial_refund .
negative	i blew my top and they said they would give me a full_refund .
negative	this is nothing but a way to scam people that aren_'_t paying attention to their credit_card statements .
negative	it '_s completely unethical !
negative	please get back to me .
negative	i thought when i placed an order for $_00 that i would be receiving my merchandise by fed_ex 0 day service .
negative	it has_been a while and my order has still not been delivered .
negative	that i never received because they sent the order back to their own warehousebut instead of re - shipping to order correctly they left me high & dry for christmas .
negative	thanks alot , petflow !
negative	i would never use this site again !
negative	they are completely unreliable and dishonest .
negative	i called in after signing_up to make_sure they cancelled and did not bill my card .
negative	looked at my bank_statement today and there was a 00 . 00 charge for where they billed me .
negative	nice to know that your employees are doing their job .
negative	would not recommend to anyone .
negative	i had an_issue with my order and had to call customer_service .
negative	since they have horrible hours for someone_who_lives in central time zone and works full time , i had to resort to e_- mailing .
negative	each representative that i was in contact with was rude .
negative	they told me what the problem was and when i contacted paypal about it , both paypal and myself were extremely confused because what they were saying was the problem on paypal '_s side was not a problem at all and paypal had all the needed information and had actually approved the transaction 0 days prior .
negative	when i told the customer_service that they basically just said well that is what the problem is , even_though i just said it wasn_'_t a problem .
negative	it was very confusing and frustrating especially_since paypal did not have a problem and they approved the transaction .
negative	i was very irritated .
negative	i brought this and it was delivered on sunday 00th_jan , i have now had to call repair people out the 00_min wash takes 0 and half hours to finish the timer is not right at all , fills with water all the time something is not right with this machine i am not happy at all really ..... error bleeps on most cycles and you have to restart ...
negative	i live in a city and petflow uses fed_ex for delivery .
negative	fed_ex was horrible regarding delivery and when i got petflow and fed_ex on the line - no one would address my problem in an reasonable manner to receive the package .
negative	i had to cancel the order , and ask that it be returned to sender and yet they still want to charge me $ 0 . 00 for the non_- shipment by fed_ex .
negative	i will never use either company again .
negative	not 000_% sure if my problem is with moddeals or the post_office , but when i pay more to receive a package early , i expect the company to be able to deliver .
negative	i emailed moddeals about not receiving my order , but i '_ve heard_nothing back from them .
negative	unacceptable !
negative	the costume that i ordered was sized incorrectly .
negative	sent it back and instead of exchanging , this company makes you purchase another costume , then send the unwanted one in which they later credit your card for .
negative	the second costume is also sized incorrectly and is so cheaply_made that my 0 year_old_son asked if i got the cheapest costume i could find .
negative	this definitely is not the case as the costume was around $_00 .
negative	stitching in unraveling , material very thin .
negative	the wig that i purchased is also way too small to fit a normal adult sized head .
negative	the crown i purchased was also cheaply_made , as is the magic wand .
negative	will not do_business with them again .
negative	the only positive - fast shipping .
negative	we were under the impression we were getting a deal for 000_pounds , i am very careful about booking things on line so always search carefully .
negative	i was extremely frustrated when i found out that i was charged 000_pounds vat and booking fee when nowhere i could see on the website said this .
negative	as this was a non_refundable deal i couldn_'_t do anything about it .
negative	however i did try to ring up , and after being on hold for 0 mins i was hung_up on straight_away .
negative	extremely disappointed .
negative	we are students and there for on a budged .
negative	i feel a little scammed , i regret cancelling my booking with booking . com ( which by the way were very polite and easy to use ) to go by your services .
negative	extremely poor .
negative	however i have nothing bad to say about the hotel itself .
negative	that was nice :)
negative	i bought an item and found out upon_receiving it that the description was inaccurate , so contacted the company .
negative	they conceded that the description was indeed erroneous , and said they would make it right , whatever i wanted to do , either return or receive a discount .
negative	i decided to return item , and emailed them to let them know , but had no reply .
negative	even_though website idicates in their return_policy , that any item could be returned for no questions_asked refund , they have not refunded my money .
negative	i have emailed them twice , no reply , and have had to contact paypal and visa to file a claim to which they still have not responded , therefore , they have the item back in their stock and i have not had any money returned .
negative	stay away from them !
negative	beste ,
negative	ik_heb reeds een mailtje gestuurd dat_ik helemaal niet tevreden ben over de kwaliteit van_de visitekaartjes die_ik_heb gekregen .
negative	maar op die mail heb_ik tot op heden nog geen antwoord ontvangen .
negative	de_foto '_s zijn wel mooi maar langs de zwarte zijde zijn de hoekjes wit zodat het lijkt of het al een oud visitekaartje is en op_de witte zijde zijn_er zwarte vegen .
negative	ik_ben startend zelfstandige en helemaal niet gelukkig met deze visitekaartjes en ben beschaamd om deze te moeten geven aan toekomstige klanten .
negative	een van mijn kernwoorden is dat_ik kwaliteit lever maar_het visitekaartje ziet_er echt niet uit .
negative	i was sent the wrong year parts and they don_'_t have a way to contact them other than by email and they still_haven_'_t responded 0 days_later ... cheap but at what cost ??!!
negative	!
negative	when my printer malfunctioned printing my four vouchers worth $_000 , the clerk at union station in dc would not accept my itinerary numbers and my viator acceptance #--- rendering us out of the trolley .
negative	we chose a competitor bigbus !

negative	000 - 000 - 0000
negative	the crutches were delivered and they weren_'_t packaged properly .
negative	they were covered in a heavy black dust !
negative	i tried to wipe them with clorox wipes .
negative	but , i '_m upset because these are a medical device and i '_m having major_surgery and i can not risk infection .
negative	customer_service did nothing to solve my issue by crediting me .
negative	my surgery is tomorrow and i don_'_t have time to return .
negative	i want a partial credit !!
negative	!
negative	deliberately deceptive , lied and used non_- english s peaking people to do the dirty work .
negative	totally horrible .
negative	placed an order - which never arrived .
negative	damart sent a replacement order - which also never arrived .
negative	a third order was ordered and dispatched for an item that was originally out of stock - and also never arrived .
negative	no delivery cards were posted by the courier and our neighbours did not receive any parcels .
negative	the outrage is that i have been told that these have been signed for - but to date damart have never been able to produce evidence .
negative	i have even sent them my signature on two occasions - to verify with that of the ' supposed ' signer but still no response .
negative	this sheer debacle has persisted over 0 months and the bills are still coming threatening me with legal_action to pay for parcels i have never received .
negative	i have lost_count of the number of phone_calls i have made at my own_expense .
negative	i first started_using damart over 00 years_ago - now even if they were to apologise for the grief and stress that they have caused and / or offer any compensation i will never ever shop with them again .
negative	i booked my room on this site to attend my brothers wedding .
negative	i called them today a week prior to my arrival as i booked the incorrect hampton_inn and suites .
negative	i booked in manassas virginia and should have booked dumfries .
negative	when i called to change it i was told that the entire room fee would be forfeited .
negative	that would be over $_000_dollars .
negative	are they crazy who would give up that type of money .
negative	so now i am stuck away from my family and having to drive further .
negative	i will never use this service again and will ensure everyone i know hears about it
negative	dont appreciate wasting time and money on misrepresentation
negative	we paid for a rental of a " luxury high rise apartment " at 000 w . 00th st . in the chelsea neighborhood of nyc and reservations were confirmed on feb . 00th for a may 0 - 00 stay .
negative	we had read some negative_reviews of house_trip on tripadvisor from customers but felt that since tripadvisor had a partnership with them we would be fine .
negative	[ we have loved renting through tripadvisor with no_problems ever .]
negative	on this reservation #_000000 , however , the owner [_name ] required the deposit upfront , with remaining in cash upon_arrival .
negative	again , a red_flag .
negative	but , after reassurance from her that the front_desk would greet us near midnight with our keys , we were relieved .
negative	we arrived near midnight .
negative	the front_desk had no key .
negative	they couldn_'_t reach [_name ], so we were forced to book a hotel room at midnight -- which we did , after calling housetrip in europe ( where their offices are .)
negative	house_trip did refund us our money and apologize .
negative	so did [_name ].
negative	two terrible problems with our experience : 0 ) the owner has no_clue how to manage a rental property .
negative	0 ) house_trip '_s business model is ineffectual : no intermediary locally ( or at_least in the us ) to call with any_problems .
negative	the company cannot leave all the details to any particular property owner , since things fall through the cracks sometimes .
negative	as in this case .
negative	tripadvisor should terminate their partnership with house_trip or their reputation will be sullied .
negative	house_trip take note -- you need to be proactive in running this business !
negative	an amount of cash ( coins used for parking fees ) was taken from the ashtray of our vehicle whilst it was left in the custody of the parking company .
negative	i cannot_comment on my goods as i am still_waiting for them to arrive to me in spain , and i have no way in tracking the goods .
negative	it is 0_weeks since i was advised that the goods had been dispatched .
negative	i had to pay well over the odds for postage compared to other_companies .
negative	i had to wait for the parcel to arrive longer_than compared to other_companies .
negative	when the parcel arrived the postage you paid for postage was less_than you had charged me .
negative	what a rip_off !
negative	!
negative	i won_'_t be using this service again unless it '_s my last resort .
negative	i have been shopping at greatglam website for 0 years and one night i googled " websites like greatglam ", and that is how i found amiclubwear .
negative	the large catalog did impress me , i ordered a dress , and 0 pairs of shoes .
negative	( over a $_000 ), the website doesnt give you any information about the shipment prices , how long it ' d take etc ..
negative	i still havent received my order .
negative	rescheduled delivery date : 00 / 00 / 0000 shipped to : chicago , il , us shipped / billed on : 00 / 00 / 0000 type : package service : ground weight : 0 . 00_lbs
negative	as you can see , i had ordered on the 00th .
negative	i hope i receive everything i purchased , in the right sizes / quantities .
negative	there are other_websites who give you the options of speedy / express delivery for an_additional_$ 0 ,
negative	$ 0 .. and they do deliver in 0 - 0 business days .
negative	it is not worth the time and the money we put in this horrible company .
negative	hello , this was the third time i purchase tickets for me and my family that has come to visit london .
negative	this last time i had the misfortune to hop_off the bus for the first time and loose my ticket .
negative	one of the operators saw us go down and start looking for it , and we approached him in order to get in the bus again .
negative	but even_though he knew we just got off the bus , he refused to let us in and offer to sell us more_expensive tickets instead .
negative	i had to buy them again because i was with my visitor .
negative	so im very disappointed and upset with the service and lack of common_sense .
negative	i was a really good regular customer .
negative	run away from the site .
negative	it took 00 + minutes to cancel a reservation .
negative	in the process i talked to someone_who kept trying to get me to re - book , was hesitant to deal with my request and was not able to transfer me to the correct department .
negative	i now interpret that as a stalling tactic hoping i would just hang up and let the charge stand .
negative	so while i was waiting i attempted to cancel the booking on the internet .
negative	that process took around 00_minutes , and was finely successful .
negative	when you see this site , stop , go directly to the hotel site or call where you want to stay and make you reservation .
negative	you may think you can get a cheap room but it isn ’ t worth it .
negative	the first cartridges did not print well or last long . you were recommended by a blog that i am associated with and i had high_hopes .
negative	disappointed !!
negative	!
negative	i have emailed superdry twice because i bought 0 items and one is too small so i would like to return it for a full_refund but having emailed them twice and am still_waiting for a responsei will not be buying from superdry again unless i get the matter resolved with immediate effect
negative	priceline obviously uses a call_center in another country because i could_hardly understand anyone i spoke to and there was loud static on the line .
negative	immediately after i was assigned a hotel based on my bid , i went to that hotel '_s website and found it $_00 cheaper a night .
negative	i had booked 0 nights so that was $_00 less for 0 nights .
negative	their guarantee also states that an extra $_00 will be credited to your account so my refund should be for $_00 .
negative	the first person i was stuck on the line with who was english - challenged , said she could not find the price i was directing her too so there would be no refund .
negative	i insisted on a supervisor who was able to find it and assured_me i would be refunded $_00 .
negative	this was after at_least 00_minutes on the phone .
negative	i got an e_- mail right_away saying my account was credited .
negative	they had already charged the full_amount no problem plus an extra $ 0 charge for some_reason .
negative	0 days_later and still no refund plus there was no refund for the difference in the taxes charged .
negative	when i just called back to ask about the tax refund ( should be about $_00 ) they said they don_'_t refund the tax !!
negative	well who gets that extra tax then ??
negative	and where is my refund ??
negative	turns_out the extra $_00 they give you if you find it cheaper is really only $ 0 in my case because they don_'_t adjust the taxes !
negative	still no sign of my $_00 refund either .
negative	i '_ll have to call back again and struggle through the phone static with an english - challenged customer_service rep .
negative	so bottom_line is that i saved a whopping $ 0 by using priceline and have already spent over one hour with their " customer_service ".
negative	will never use again .
negative	i travel a lot and thought i ' d give this a try .
negative	big mistake .
negative	never listen to travelocity flight salespeople in india telling you that the cruise protection you bought from travelocity would not cover your flight to get to and from the cruise .
negative	it took me 0 hours on the phone to get this mistake of theirs undone and have me credited what i paid for flight protection just 00_minutes prior .
negative	i really did not even get an_apology , and i had to be so assertive to 0 people to finally get me transferred to someone that could get this corrected .
negative	my wait time between calls was at_least 00_minutes each time .
negative	this was my first and last time booking anything with this company .
negative	website listed that the wipers i purchased were the correct size and model for my make , model , and year car .
negative	they arrived and did not even have the correct connection to fit my car .
negative	had to return and had to pay for shipping ... terrible return system .
negative	went to a hotel website and thought i had called the hotel reservation line for the hotel .
negative	it was not it was the reservation_counter .
negative	we were told things about the hotel that were not true and we thought we were getting another room .
negative	i called and cancled the room .
negative	i am still_waiting for the refund on my credit_card .
negative	my order took way too long to arrive .
negative	first it was sent to the new_jersey warehouse only to find they didn_'_t have my product , then i had to wait while they sent the order to be shipped from their las_vegas warehouse .
negative	it took 00 days from the day i ordered to get my bag of dog_food .
negative	i am beyond disappointed .
negative	i had to go to the store to get my dog another bag of food while waiting for my shipment to come .
negative	with all the other_companies out there , spare yourself the hassle and try someone_else , that is unless you don_'_t mind waiting almost 0_weeks to get your order .
negative	i ordered two books and even paid_extra for expedited_shipping .
negative	received one book and over a month later never got the other book .
negative	reached out to the seller and even reported a claim and have heard_nothing back .
negative	next_semester i will be getting my books from somewhere_else .
negative	no good .
negative	we ordered 0 pairs of sunglasses on the 0th of january , 0000 .
negative	they are still not here .
negative	we ordered one pair on the 0th of january - they arrived less_than a week_later .
negative	now we find out that the 0 pairs we ordered are back - ordered and will take 0_weeks .
negative	it took vision_direct nearly 0_weeks to find out where they were !!!
negative	they had better be here within the promised 0 week delivery period .
negative	we reserved a hotel in orlando using expedia for two_nights .
negative	paid in full over two months in advance .
negative	due to the storm in atlanta our flight was cancelled until the second day of reservations .
negative	i contacted expedia to let them know we could not check in until friday due to storms .
negative	we could not find a number for our hotel and they would not give us one .
negative	i wanted to make_sure they did not give our room away for the second night because of our late check in .
negative	expedia outsources to india and there is def .
negative	a language_barrier after being put on hold numerous_times for up to 00_minutes i was told in broken english that on top f my prepaid rooms i would be charged $_000 . 00 for my late check in ..... why did they want to do this ?
negative	because " prices have changed " on a room already paid for two months previous .
negative	i asked to speak to a supervisor and was put on hold again for 00_minutes .
negative	i never spoke to a supervisor .
negative	took our chances and did get our reserved room and have contacted our credit_card company , complained to the bbb .
negative	lesson_learned .
negative	never deal with this company .
negative	i will tell_everyone i know , and everyone who will listen how horrible this company is .
negative	wish i ' d of found this review page before wasting my time and money .
negative	very slow service .
negative	products were ordered on monday .
negative	according to the website you are not able to cancel any orders because orders are processed within hours .
negative	i received an ema stating that my order will not be processed until payment is confirmed .
negative	less then an_hour later i received an_email_stating my payment has_been received and will be shipped .
negative	i would receive an_email when the products are shipped .
negative	i contacted the company on thursday as my order has not processed or shipped however they do not accept phone_calls on order status and had to send an_email .
negative	i received an_email hours after i submitted my request to check on the status of my order .
negative	my products finally shipped , 0 days after_placing it and the company receiving the payment .
negative	i just received my complete order , products were shipped seperatly .
negative	so 00 days after i placed my order i finally received all my products .
negative	bottom_line , slow service and items not shipped until i contacted the company .
negative	i bought two dresses with the same style ( one in pink and one in cream ).
negative	for some_reason the cream color is too tight around the hem line .
negative	they would not let_me exchange it because i don_'_t have a digital_camera to take a picture of the defective item .
negative	how would taking a picture proof anything ?
negative	you would have to try it on to know the difference .
negative	oh and they stop responding to my email after that .
negative	don_'_t do_business with this company .
negative	they have ridiculous policies .
negative	i would suggest forever 00 , xxi , charlotte_russe or pacifc sun ( pacsun ).
negative	it '_s a rip_off .
negative	i googled some of the brands and converted the price to us dollar and found that yesstyle charge americans & europeans double and sometimes triple the original price .
negative	if you want cheap china made quality clothes , bad customer_service , outrageous return_policies or just wanna get robbed ..... shop @ yesstyle . com .
negative	i ordered one direction tickets in january .
negative	two_days before the concert in june , we called to see where they were and found out our seller bailed and never got the tickets .
negative	i had to go to buy replacement tickets one day before the show .
negative	do not use this website unless you ' re willing to risk all your money for nothing !
negative	i thought that i was making a reservation directly to the the hotel .
negative	i had to ask the gentleman to slow_down when speaking because i could_barely understand him .
negative	he was polite and courteous , but it shouldn_'_t take 00_minutes to make a hotel reservation for two rooms .
negative	it should take five_minutes at the most !!!
negative	i also questioned the gentleman when taking my credit_card number why he would need the security_code when
negative	i would provide the card when i checked in .
negative	i was told that is was necessary and needed be given to his front_desk .
negative	lie !!!!
negative	it was needed to fully charge my credit_card immediately .
negative	as soon as i received my confirmation via_email , and saw that my credit_card was charged in full for a reservation for august i called and canceled my reservation and demanded a full_refund .
negative	i then contacted my credit_card company .
negative	i was deceived and would never contact or use this company .
negative	i wonder_why i haven_'_t received it yet .
negative	i was very pleased with my rental .
negative	i was not pleased that the website did not inform me upfront about a 0 ) airport connection fee , 0 ) a tourism fee , 0 ) a facility charge .
negative	i understand i have to pay tax , these are separate from tax .
negative	i will not use rentalcars . com again for this reason .
negative	my boyfriend bought a voucher for iflorist and got me some flowers for our anniversary .
negative	the flowers were delivered over a day late and were not the ones he had ordered .
negative	plus , having been in a fridge for well over a day , they were not as fresh anymore .
negative	in addition , he was charged for the voucher and also the full price for the flowers .
negative	iflorist will not offer a refund and can only apologize for what happened , but we have still paid over_£_00 more than we should have .
negative	i don_'_t think you should ask for feedback when the customer hasn_'_t received the product !
negative	i was very disappointed in the process .
negative	i ordered a radiator and it took over a week to be delivered .
negative	then , the radiator was the wrong one for my car .
negative	when i went to return this part , i had to ship it back using my own shipper , which cost me $_00 . 00 .
negative	when i was credited my " remainder ", i was charged a " restocking_fee ".
negative	i will not order anything in the future from you .
negative	i ordered a swimsuit that had a removable halter strap and received it without the strap .
negative	i paid to have it shipped it back for a refund .
negative	soon after it returned on my doorstep .
negative	they said it couldn_'_t take back used items .
negative	the swimsuit was not used .
negative	i tried it on and that was it .
negative	it did had very little white stuff on it when i got it back .
negative	i don_'_t know what it was , but it wiped right off with the brush of the hand .
negative	they just didn_'_t want to lose their precious money .
negative	will never buy from them again .
negative	i had customer_service the first time i called put me on hold for a total amount of time of 00_minutes after being on the phone with them for 00 .
negative	i was outraged .
negative	by the time i hung_up the phone and had to re discuss my situation with another representative , she told me that she wasn_'_t going to be able to help me unless i calmed_down .
negative	no one should ever tell an upset person to calm down .
negative	it was very upsetting to me .
negative	this will 000_% be the last time i book with book - it . com .
negative	this is too bad , because i have booked the last 0 vacations of mine this past_year through book - it and have had great experiences .
negative	however , i felt that the way i was treated on the phone was unacceptable .
negative	i stopped the order before it was sent by them !
negative	they still sent it out 0 days_later , took the money frrom my account !
negative	i returned the product , at my cost , they recieved the item over 0_weeks_ago , and , i cannot get them to tell me when mmy money would be refunded !
negative	i had to go through my bank and dispute the transaction , to get my money back !!!
negative	!
negative	the word " damaged " showed_up on my packing_slip , ( because it is indeed trashed ) but did not appear on the description , so super looking_forward to selling it back , $_00 worth of bend_over but still no vaseline ..... gee ... bookbyte really does bite .
negative	looking_forward to not ordering from you again in the future .
negative	i got the largest flowers that were available , the most expensive .
negative	and it was so disappointing when they arrived for my sisters_birthday .
negative	it was embarrassing .
negative	i will absolutely never ever use flora_queen again .
negative	just .
negative	plain .
negative	embarrassing .
negative	ordered 0 yellow knock out roses t twice the cost of ones sold locally and the plants were just like bare roots except put in a pot .
negative	they were extremely small and one looks like it won_'_t make it .
negative	contacted customer_service but no replacement plants offered .
negative	i will never buy from this site again .
negative	i haven_'_t received my order yet .
negative	im not sure if it '_s stuck in the mail , but it '_s been two_weeks now .
negative	i contacted the customer_services department before placing my order as i wanted my bed and mattress to be delivered on the same day thus limiting the amount of time i would be absent from work .
negative	i was assured that this would happen so proceed with the sale based on that agreement .
negative	i contacted customer_services on the morning of the delivery to ensure that both items would arrive as agreed and was informed that they would – happy days !
negative	my mattress arrived at approximately 00 . 00am but i was still bed less by 0pm , so decided to contact mattress online again .
negative	i was informed that they was unable to track my item as they did not have a contact number for the delivery driver and that it was possible it could still arrive .
negative	i contacted the customer_services department at 0 . 00pm and was informed that it was unlikely that my item would arrive and that they could not contact the delivery driver / company as there office was closed .
negative	i called customer_services the next_morning and asked to speak to a manager to log my complaint ( please_note : management must be very , very busy or non_- existent ) because despite ringing back every hour on the hour to speak to a senior member of staff i never ever got put through .
negative	the gate keepers ( aka the customer_service staff ) would not transfer my call .
negative	i wonder_why ?
negative	anyways , i had to reschedule delivery for another day ( booking a second day off work ) to wait on my bed .
negative	it turns_out my bed was not delivered on the first day because it had been damaged in transit so they decided to take it back .
negative	yeah , right !
negative	ps .
negative	i am still_awaiting a on a managers call nearly a month later .
negative	avoid !
negative	very bad customer_service from travelocity staff .
negative	never again will i use .
negative	my father ordered me a onesie as an xmas_present .
negative	after 00 days he had heard_nothing & contacted boohoo to find there had been " a system glitch " & the purchase price would be refunded .
negative	the man was very rude at the counter when he answered the phone .
negative	i had to stand outside and freeze .
negative	i won_'_t use this service again .
negative	recommend going elsewhere .
negative	i order some shoes in a size 0 .
negative	after 0_weeks of waiting , i finally got them , in a size 0 !
negative	after that i saw how many money they took form me .
negative	they took twice the price from me .
negative	on ther site , was it written that it only took 0 - 0 days !
negative	the most baddest site i got to .
negative	you can not trust them !
negative	both of my orders were wrong .
negative	one of the items was missing some of its parts .
negative	the packing slide does not match the part numbers online .
negative	i have waited over a week for customer_service to contact me .
negative	don_'_t waste your money
negative	i don_'_t recall your site mentioning that these cartridges are " counterfeit ".
negative	my hp_printer told me that and the ones i tried created a faded print .
negative	i would never order fom them again and have sent them back with a demand for a full_refund .
negative	they charge dealers $_00 to place an ad , then $ 0 daily to " bump " the ad .
negative	they fill the pages with advertisements , not dealer ads , so that our ads get " bumped " back really fast and in a few hours your ad is on a page past 00 , they don_'_t tell you which page either , just that you have to " bump ".
negative	this is tacky business to expect busy business_owners to pay daily for an ad when it was already paid for .
negative	the paypal system to handle payments is an_absolute nightmare .
negative	as is kijiji customer_service .
negative	the route of course is great , as was the walking_tour of the changing of the guard .
negative	our guide for the changing of the guard was fantastic .
negative	however , our guide for the main bust tour was horrible .
negative	he was rude and did not provide good information .
negative	he seemed to really hate his job .
negative	you have solved this already at your head_office , thank_you very much .
negative	however , for the record , the delivery service that was in charge of this delivery keeps from going bad to worse .
negative	it took_ages for them to get the delivery here , a week , and yesterday i got a call that the driver would be delivering it and were there other options to deliver it to if i was out .
negative	i mentioned that i would be out for lunch briefly , and if he was in delgany he was to leave it at the butchers in the village .
negative	no call , so today i called at 00am to see where the package was and it was said that it was to be delivered today .
negative	i then got a text and vm saying it was delivered to the butchers this morning .
negative	the driver never called to the house .
negative	i went to the butchers and they told me it was delivered yesterday and in a shattered condition of a box .
negative	i was horrified .
negative	box was open , reams of paper damaged .
negative	i called the hunt_office as i have never had trouble before and they agreed the whole story was unacceptable .
negative	moments ago the last piece of my shipment was delivered by the same driver who dumped the box at the butcher '_s yesterday ( admittedly at 0pm when i was also home - but he did not call ).
negative	he wanted to see the damaged paper , like i would have made that up .
negative	i left him into my home and showed him .
negative	he mumbled that he had mentioned that to his boss yesterday how bad the box was , it wasn_'_t his fault .
negative	he then said now that he knew where my house was he would be happy to deliver again - knowing and admitting he never even looked for my house prior .
negative	why you would be a delivery service that would not deliver to the customer is beyond me .
negative	i am pleased hunt is replacing the paper and hope that they find a delivery service more representative of their interest in customer_satisfaction .
negative	never ever use travelosity .... wait for at_least an_hour before they even pick_up the call .... then no resolution to your call
negative	bonjour , jai besoin d ' une notice d ' utilisation du omega_0000 en français , ainsi que le livre car je_ne comprends pas .
negative	jattends la notice avant utilisation .
negative	merci par avance .
negative	adresse : corinne giraud chez mme bonneau , le bourg 00000 la chapelle hullin , pays de loire , france
negative	the vehicle i rented was sub - contracted to red spot , when i arrived to the service desk after collecting my baggage at the airport , it took 0 mins for either person to look up from their computers and acknowledge my presence .
negative	the male colleague smiled and me and nodded to the female colleague to indicate my presence - her name was val , she looked up , proceeded to finish what she was doing on her computer , and without greeting me at all , requested my voucher .
negative	she then went on to advise me that $_000 would be deducted from my cad for bond , when i stated to her this was not written in my terms and conditions , she said yes it is .
negative	i pulled the copy in which i had printed out and proceeded to look for the condition , it was not there - val then_proceeded to look for it herself , and when realising that this was not listed as a term or condition val pointed_out to me as to where it should have been written and then pushed the counter copy of the terms and conditions in front of me .
negative	i advised val i was not happy abut not being informed properly and that all terms and conditions should be supplied to the customer from the time the deal is made - she shrugged her shoulders and sad nothing , she continued with this demeanour until i gave in and just paid bond - i did query about cancelling the rental_agreement due to this error , she said you can '_t you '_ve already paid i also asked her if that all she had to offer was a shrug of her shoulders - to which she shrugged her shoulders yet again !.
negative	val made no attempt at an_apology on behalf of the company for failing to issue me the full terms and conditions .
negative	after payment was processed , val handed me the keys to the vehicle stating it was in bay 00 - she offered no assistance or direction to me in actually finding bay 00 - in the end i was assisted by a personal member of another car_hire company who kindly showed me where the bay was , mentioning that red spot have " useless " service - to which after my experience i agree completely !
negative	i can understand the issue regarding the terms and conditions somewhat - a simple apology would have sufficed , however val '_s service and treatment of a customer was extremely upsetting .
negative	perhaps val was having a bad day - we all have these understandably , however i myself work as a manager in customer_service , and i was truly appalled by her abrupt rudeness , and her demeanour , to the point i dreaded the possibility of having to deal with her when i went to hand back the keys .
negative	after my rental_agreement expired i actually required a vehicle for longer_than what was booked , i did extend the rental 0 more day through red spot as i simply did not have the time to return it on time .
negative	however i needed it a further week yet due to this service which i could not look past i went to another rental company and leased a car from them - their service by comparison was gold .
negative	the car i hired from red spot was great to drive , but due to the service i was given i would more than likely avoid using autoeurope or any of it '_s partners in particular red spot in the future , nor would i recommended their usage to anyone_else .
negative	it was a real_shame that this was my initial experience when i first arrived to sydney .
negative	the car was ok but the customer_service was terrible .
negative	they ripped me off and were rude and offensive .
negative	use another company to rent in europe .
negative	placed an order nov . 00 , 0000 .
negative	ten days and holding .
negative	haven_'_t received anything , yet .
negative	i will never buy from them again they sent the wrong_colour want me to pay for the shipment again both way and very rude to deal with
negative	i specifically stated for the delivery instructions if out deliver to the hair dressers across the road .
negative	but no , i had to go to the depot in manchester my sat_nav took me totally wrong and the drive was hours .
negative	after getting totally lost i telephoned the depot and found that infact it was the post_code that was wrong not the sat_nav .
negative	the depot had a post_code that included a zero and i had pot an o for orange into the sat_nav .
negative	who would have thought a zero would be used in a post_code , it is not like we have number zero oxford road for example !
negative	after about 0 hours of sweating as i have a chest infection and i am on anti biotics and worry as i was soon to be late to pick_up my small child from school , the true post_code wasn_'_t that accurate either , but i found the office to be given two boxes , i had expected one as it was one bean_bag , but no i had a box with the cover and a box with the beans , it was a self assembly , so i have just finished vacuuming up the mess and i feel totally stressed and disappointed .
negative	i wouldn_'_t mind but i am experiencing a few other problems with other businesses , tescos mobile_phone insurance company say after paying my insurance for a year i am not covered as i contacted them after 0 days , its all just mean .
negative	i am self_employed and give my customers a very good service , it is a shame i never receive any .
negative	who is to blame ?
negative	was it the driver of the delivery company ?
negative	did he not read the delivery information or did the bean_bag company not write the delivery request on the box ?
negative	funny as i found a delivery note inside the box with the delivery comment i had made . there was nothing on the box .
negative	but maybe the delivery man had a separate same sheet .
negative	i am sure i will never find out as no one will care about my huge struggle and loss of earnings messing_about chasing an item .
negative	it is always nice to know also that if you make too much of a fuss , that both companies have my name and address too .
negative	right i shall now write some rubbish to tesco just to be ignored and waste my own time .
negative	it is now ^, 00pm and as a single_parent i need to do homework with my boy , bath story and bed , i am exhausted .
negative	i am sure i didn_'_t see any information on line when i bought the bean_bag that i would have to faf about pouring 0 bags of tiny balls into an empty bag , but i am sure it is hidden somewhere small , congratulations you tricked me well .
negative	i now have to accept some terms and conditions and tick a box , i cannot see any but i will tick the box
negative	my second appliances_online delivery was scheduled for today .
negative	they failed to deliver for no apparent reason ( i have a 00 hour concierge office ).
negative	so , i '_ve paid my kitchen fitter to sit in my flat all day today with no appliances to fit .
negative	hilariously , i '_ve also had 0 ( yes , six ) missed calls from appliances_online trying to sell me insurance .
negative	that '_s 0 calls for this delivery and 0 for the appliance i had delivered last_week .
negative	when i called today to find out why the delivery failed , the man i spoke to was patronising and didn_'_t listen to a word i said .
negative	he talked over me and wouldn_'_t allow me to speak .
negative	awful awful awful service .
negative	i '_m so disappointed - i had high_hopes , as the website is great , i love the product videos and the delivery tracking is great .
negative	but clearly , when something goes_wrong , they are not interested .
negative	i won_'_t use them again - such a disappointment .
negative	all he had to do was listen to my problem - so easy to keep people happy .
negative	i did eventually receive the delivery yesterday but only because i personally called the driver myself and asked him to re - deliver on the same day .
negative	the customer_service guy from appliances_online wouldn_'_t even let_me finish a sentence and would only suggest re - scheduling the delivery for a different day .
negative	the response below from appliances_online makes it sound like they came to the rescue to ensure re - delivery on the same day - they absolutely did not .
negative	i had a change in business plans .
negative	i called and spoke with customer_service who assured_me that although it was not their normal policy they would allow me to change .
negative	change supposedly made .
negative	when i arrived to the hotel , it was sold out and they had no knowledge of the cancellation .
negative	i ended_up with no hotel one night and getting charged for a night i was not there !
negative	i was told when i booked the reservation through you that i was speaking directly to an employee of the hotel .
negative	they said the rate was $_000 . 00 a night and when i told them i was an antique dealer doing a show in town and was to get a special rate they quoted $_000 . 00 .
negative	when i arrived at the hotel i was shocked to find that i didn_'_t have a reservation for saturday_night which_meant i would have to start driving home to pa after working all day saturday .. then i find out i had booked through you and not the hotel and the special rate was $_00 . 00 .
negative	i took the hampton business card to make_sure this never happens again .
negative	i have a nespresso_machine , and the capsules didn_'_t produce any coffee .
negative	not sure what the trouble was , they seemed not to get perforated by the machine .
negative	the customer_service was just fine , and they returned my money .
negative	i wish them luck .
negative	i looked up hampton_inn on line and the number i got wasn_'_t the local hampton_inn but i didn_'_t realize it was a seperate agency because the man i talked to didn_'_t speak_english well at all .
negative	i was trying to book two rooms ; one in my name and one in my friend '_s name , who was sitting right there .
negative	the man got confused and used my credit number for both rooms .
negative	he apologized and i said , " forget it .
negative	we will transfer it to her card when we arrive ".
negative	he said the charges were non_- refundable , which i thought was strange , but i was exhausted and didn_'_t want to argue .
negative	somewhere during all of this , we got cut_off .
negative	but he called me back with the confirmation number .
negative	when i arrived at the hotel , i asked about using my aaa or aarp to get a discount and was told i couldn_'_t do this because i made the arrangements through_expedia ( news to me ).
negative	i asked about the rate if i had called them directly and it was about $_00 less , and would be even less if i had been able to get my aaa or aarp_discount .
negative	i was very disappointed and will never again use a service like this .
negative	i received the items over a month after ordering them for the boots order .
negative	and for the bags order two months_ago , i never even received the first shipment , and emailed customer_service , they were nice to resend the items , which got to me in 0 - 0 days versus their poor shipping service this time around .
negative	i received my four bags , two of them were folded inconsiderately and the leather was all wrinkled and it was impossible to unwrinkle and make it look straight / normal .
negative	i politely put up with that since they offered to send a reshipment since i never received the first .
negative	so for the most_recent boots order , i just received my two boots today .
negative	they were so poor quality when i opened them .
negative	the white boots were folded into thirds , all wrinkled at the folds and it is impossible to unwrinkle it .
negative	these boots could not even stand up by themselves due to the folds .
negative	the color was more yellow than in the picture and the quality of the faux_leather was really bad .
negative	it was not worth $_00 for even both of these boots .
negative	then the black pair of boots i ordered were folded in thirds as well to save shipping space and the folded part on the leather looks so ugly i don_'_t even want to wear it outside .
negative	the tip of the leather boots were folded inwards making an ugly crease and when i tried it on , the bottom part of the sole creaked and i felt it rip inside .
negative	poor quality .
negative	do not purchase from yeswalker because of the buy one get one free .
negative	no wonder its buy one get one free because we are given poor items .
negative	i wouldn_'_t even pay $_00 per pair if i knew it was like this .
negative	any customers wanting to see the quality of these boots , please email me at tifphan @ ucdavis . edu and i will email you back a picture for proof .
negative	i am not going to ask for a refund from yeswalker because i am just not going to deal with poor quality items anymore .
negative	i paid $_00 for such crappy shoes that aren_'_t even worth 00_bucks .
negative	the refund took almost 0 months and alot of email communication which was not promptly answered as it was a central email with no phone_number to contact .
negative	i don_'_t think i will use boohoo again .
negative	shoes bought came in very bad condition .
negative	will never use this website again !
negative	charged express delivery for my order which should have been free , there was no option to changed as i paid by pay_pal .
negative	i tried to cancel and the money still went out of my account , 0 days_later and my order on ' express delivery ' has still not arrived .
negative	i have emailed on my own email , through paypal and tried to ring them and no answer to any of them and no replies .
negative	i am now escalating this via pay_pal to try and get my money back .
negative	will never use this company again .
negative	if you use them pay by a method that you can claim back like pay_pal or your credit_card .
negative	spoke with customer_service twice , could not resolve , cancelled auto - ship service
negative	i ordered seat_covers from rockshore , took my money then two or three_days_later emailed me to say they were out of stock .
negative	i did receive my money back but they did not even say when or if they would be back in stock .
negative	very disappointed in the company , why advertise something and then it takes 0 / 0 days to find out they were out of stock .
negative	if somebody asked if they should order from them in the future what do you think my answer would be ?
negative	travelocity sent me a promo_code for my exact vacation package about 00_minutes after i booked it .
negative	what terrible timing i have , right ?
negative	but other_companies have been generous when i have forgotten to enter a promo_code when placing an order before , so i thought it was worth a try to see if i could still use it .
negative	let_me just say that i really liked using travelocity until i tried to contact their " customer_service " about this issue .
negative	i first tried the customer_support email link on their website and got this reply " this is an unmonitored alias and you will not receive a response to this message .
negative	for help and customer_service , please contact us through shop . travelocity . com / p / support . htm " so , they told me " no one looks at these emails " and sent me back to the exact page that i ' d emailed from .
negative	ok .
negative	i guess i '_ll try calling .
negative	was told that there is absolutely no way that they could apply a promo_code supplied to me mere minutes after booking a reservation because it is an existing reservation .
negative	ok .
negative	i guess that '_s just bad timing and bad_luck for me , but i guess they get to make their own policies regardless if they are decidedly not - customer friendly .
negative	but i decided to tell them that they need to fix their " customer_service " email problem because there is no way that an unmonitored email is customer_service at all .
negative	so asked to speak to a supervisor and was placed on a very , very , very long hold for that privileged .
negative	supervisor ' e first order of business was to make_sure that i knew that there was no way that they were going to let_me use that promo_code .
negative	yeah , i know , your frontline staff already told me that , but here is my experience as a customer and some things you should really fix so that other people don_'_t feel_like travelocity doesn_'_t care on stitch about you as their customer .
negative	i would tell my experience and the supervisor would just say " you can '_t use the promo_code " and i ' d say " i know , but i '_m offering you advice on how to treat your customers better .." " you cannot use the promo_code ."
negative	fine , no one is home at the call_center or the email support .
negative	but as fits travelocity '_s bizarre sense of timing with their emails to me , i was also emailed a " rate your travelocity experience ".
negative	so here you go , travelocity .
negative	i understand i can '_t use a promo_code on an existing reservation , but i humbly suggest that
negative	0 . you improve your system so it is smart enough not to send promo_codes to people who have just booked a package for the destination named in your email - this will just piss people off
negative	0 . remove the email link on your customer_service page if you aren_'_t going to , you know , actually provide customer_service
negative	0 . at_least try to pretend that you care about your customers even when you cannot give them what they want
negative	i do hope that since you asked for me to rate my experience with your company that you will actually take the time to consider how you might improve your customers ' experiences .
negative	very disappointed with the service , the guy was rude and cocky acting like i didn_'_t know anything .
negative	i will never go there again .
negative	in my opinion if i '_m going to go somewhere spending well over 000_dollars i expect a little_bit of hospitality .
negative	continue to take my money after cancelling
negative	helps to get_rid of unwanted items that may help some one else
negative	cannot access my ebay account but ebay dont care and dont answer emails
negative	one out of 0 raspberry plants order in the winter have survived despite the best of care .
negative	we got a contractor to put in a frame - bought manure and compost , have watered the plants and have one left alive .
negative	we were hoping for a good crop next year and our disappointment is huge .
negative	as a member of the netherbury gardening club i would be reluctant to order form you again .
negative	asked for driver '_s side part , wheel well .
negative	was very specific .
negative	sent me passanger side .
negative	called 0 times today , can '_t get through .
negative	after being on hold for 0 minutes , lots of static on line .
negative	so try again .
negative	finally tried to do ticket .
negative	will get back to you as this process goes on .
negative	but i waited over a week for the wrong part .
negative	very frustrated .
negative	drove part to mechanic .
negative	very frustrated that it was completely wrong part .
negative	i ordered flowers for my brother '_s funeral as he lived in the us and i could not attend from the uk .
negative	the flowers were not delivered and i have had no recompense .
negative	no recompense could compensate me for this terrible omission but at_least they should have offered my money back .
negative	words cannot express my total disgust with this company .
negative	xbox code doesn_'_t work !
negative	!
negative	in november i ordered two dresses as they were both unsuitable i returned both items for refunds , it took nearly four weeks for refund i only got refunded on one , i contacted them , got reply they only received one dress back even_though they were in one parcel .
negative	email them again told me to send proof of postage not a photocopy .
negative	i sent proof to them never_heard_nothing email again got reply that they haven_'_t received it that was beginning of january could be back log of post another excuse , not sure what more i can do as you can '_t phone them .
negative	do not buy from boohoo if you think you might have to return anything .
negative	our flights were all screwed_up and travelocity never alerted us !
negative	won_'_t be using them again !!!
negative	!
negative	we purchased a tv_cabinet and it was delivered late .
negative	i had to call to see what the issue was and why i hadn_'_t received it .
negative	when it did arrive it was the evening before we left for vacation .
negative	when delivered i noticed it was too big and wasn_'_t going to work .
negative	i called the company upon returning from our trip .
negative	the told me that too bad the return_policy was 0 days after arrival .
negative	i explained that i had been on vacation and i just returned and had an opportunity to call and i was unaware of the 0 day policy .
negative	it isn_'_t prominently displayed in their confirmation_email .
negative	kinda sneaky to me .
negative	i asked to speak with a supervisor .
negative	i explained the deal that it was still wrapped and wasn_'_t moved from where the delivery guys dropped it .
negative	i offered to also split the freight cost of returning it .
negative	we just couldn_'_t use it and wanted to return it .
negative	he asked me to take pictures and email it to them to verify it was still wrapped .
negative	after a lot of back and forth he said no he would not except it .
negative	this really frustrated me because their warehouse is less_than 0 hrs from my home .
negative	it '_s not like it is across the country and that i had been using the item .
negative	for something this expensive for them not to work with me on returning an unused item and to split the freight was crazy to me .
negative	i even offered to pay full freight .
negative	terrible .
negative	i would not suggest anyone to do_business with this company .
negative	i saw an alll inclusive trip to cozumel for two people at $_000_per person , which was a great deal and jumped on it right_away .
negative	after a very unacceptable try to book the deal online , there was a glitch in the system so we had to call to book the trip .
negative	in a matter of 00 mintues the deal went up to $_000_per person .
negative	that is $_000 more than what was anticipated for the entire trip .
negative	when asked why the price went up , the attendant could not tell us and said that she had no control of the fluctuation of prices .
negative	after all of that confusion and frustration , my credit_card was double carged for the hotel stay .
negative	i had to call my bank and tell them that bookit was not authorized to make any more transactions on my account .
negative	i have used many travel websites and thought i would give this one a try , but now i know to never use it again .
negative	i did not even get any restitution for all of the mishaps that i had to endure during the booking process .
negative	i ordered these lenses on 00th_dec after_speaking with one of your staff who assured_me i would receive them before christmas , i explained i needed them urgently .
negative	i am still_waiting !
negative	the post had been today and nothing .
negative	i could have ordered them from we are lenses . co . uk but they stated that they were out of stock until thursday 00th_dec .
negative	i now wish i had ordered from them , i might have got them for christmas and they offrered the same number of lenses you ordered and they gave you the same amount free .
negative	never again from lens_store , i have been using a daily disposable lens now for 0 days which cant be good for my eyes .
negative	i ordered some flowers for my sisters_birthday .
negative	i ordered in good time and received confirmation they would be received on the due date .
negative	they did not arrive .
negative	i will never trust moon pig again
negative	here is my email to the companies " customer_service representative ".
negative	......
negative	i have received a bill from fedex in the amount of $_00 . 00 for customs duties .
negative	i paid you $_00 . 00 for shipping and was under the agreement that no additional_charges would be billed to me .
negative	i have had the worst time ordering from your company .
negative	first , i ordered a pair of eyeglasses , then you charged me for them .
negative	i ordered a clip - on sunglass for the glasses after that .
negative	after the clip already shipped , i get a notice that the eyeglasses were not in stock .
negative	therefore , i received the clip , for a pair of eyeglasses that you could not fulfill for me .
negative	that was your companies mistake and yet i was forced to pay the return fee for the clip that you sent me that i did not need because you did not have the glasses for them .
negative	when i contacted customer_service , i was informed that i did not cancel the clip .
negative	it could not be cancelled because it had already shipped by the time you notified me that the glasses were not in stock .
negative	this is very bad business_practice .
negative	next , i get a bill from fedex customs for $_00 . 00 , after i have already paid for shipping on this item .
negative	i am requesting that you contact fedex and pay this bill that was sent to me .
negative	this is not my responsibility , as i have already paid for shipping and your company continues to give me a hassle .
negative	i am also still_waiting on my credit for my return that i had to pay twice for !
negative	!
negative	if you want to be an international company , you need to learn how to do_business with international customers , so that the customer isn ’ t being scammed out of money because they ordered from you .
negative	you also need an international phone_number .
negative	how am i supposed to communicate with customer_service , when you don_’ t even have a phone ???
negative	?
negative	i will be waiting on a response from a manager or supervisor that will be able to remedy this problem with me .
negative	items didn_'_t arrive
negative	i do not wish to respond to this posting .
negative	i do not want to be contacted again .
negative	my son chose a gift for himself and i did not want any e_- mails , even_though i did get them anyway .
negative	thank_you very much for not contacting me again and i will never order anything for him online again .
negative	i have stopped in 0 days now and my coat hasnt come !
negative	wouldnt mind but i have payed over_£ 00o for it .
negative	i ahvr also emailed the post_office but they arnt much help .
negative	what do i do ?????????
negative	?
negative	i received shoes ( dorothy ruby red ) for my daughters senior play .
negative	the box was marked correctly as a size 00 but the shoe inside box were a size 0 .
negative	no possible way to use these shoes .
negative	in calling the company they told me they would send another pair but would not expedite them without me paying the overnight fee .
negative	without this the expedite service they would not arrive in time .
negative	i chose to return the shoes which were of course unworn and in the original box .
negative	they were returned promptly the day after receiving them .
negative	they refunded me the original purchase price but not the original shipping or the return shipping .
negative	i am now out a bunch of money with nothing to show for it .
negative	the only_thing that i did wrong was to choose this company to do_business with .
negative	i feel sure that they did not intentionally send the wrong shoes and accidents do happen but then the business should make it right .
negative	boeket tulpen besteld maar we kregen andere bloemen in de plaats .
negative	wij hebben toen contact opgenomen met_de bloemist wie ze heeft geleverd_en daar bleek dat_de tulpen niet_zo ' n goeie kwaliteit meer was , dus hebben ze zelf maar beslist om een ander boeket te_maken .
negative	dit zonder ons op_de hoogte te brengen .
negative	bij bestelling werd nochtans een nummer doorgegeven , dus konden ze mij eerst eens opgebeld hebben om_te vragen of ik akkoord was met hen beslissing en of ik_een andere voorkeur van bloemen had .
negative	het kaartje met_de tekst was zeer klein afgedrukt en gewoon aan het kaartje geniet !
negative	i did not receive the product i ordered .
negative	when i contacted them they tried to tell me that the manufacturer changed the product .
negative	i was able to order the exact_same product from another company with no problem .
negative	after several phone_calls , and 0_weeks after returning the product , i finally received a refund for $_00 . 00 less_than what i paid !!!
negative	i had planned to order other products from this company , but will only discourage others from making any purchases at all .
negative	very disappointed !
negative	we needed to order windshield wipers for our ' 00 subaru tribeca to our home in hawaii .
negative	finding parts here is frustrating enough for non_- common vehicles as they are often not available or at_least very expensive .
negative	we decided to order our wiperblades from partsgeek according to their recommendation for matching parts for our car .
negative	we had to pay extra in shipping just because we live in hawaii which i always find annoying to begin with .
negative	we really need new blades , so i decided to suck it up and deal with the additional shipping cost .
negative	but when we received the wiperblades recommended exclusively for our vehicle , they did not fit .
negative	to make it worse , one of the blade packages was already open and missing the hardware to install the blade .
negative	i '_m not sure i can get back my money especially the very expensive shipping price , so i am very disappointed with this company .
negative	i ordered an ecode for gap .
negative	the code was never sent to me .
negative	i emailed them .
negative	when i didn_'_t get an answer the next_day i called .
negative	they had me look for the code on the website .. they told me it should post to my account .
negative	nothing .
negative	they offered to open a help ticket .
negative	i said - no .
negative	the point was to get the code right_away so i could use it .
negative	so at that point i just wanted to cancel my order .
negative	the woman on the phone said she put in a ticket to cancel .
negative	i got an_email_confirmation of this .
negative	0_weeks_later ... the charge is still on my credit_card and i receive an actual gift_card in the mail .
negative	not only had i wanted an ecode , but i called to cancel !
negative	i called and the woman on the phone couldn_'_t help at all .
negative	all she kept saying was - i show you were invoiced for an actual card .
negative	i kept trying to tell her that i had cancelled the order completely .
negative	so after 0 emails , 0 phone_calls my order was still completely messed_up .
negative	now i have to mess with mailing the card back and hoping someone there can actually process my return ?!?!
negative	insane .
negative	i will not be using this service again and will be telling my friends the same .
negative	i have ordered from superdry before and always enjoyed the service and products .
negative	however , the last order i placed never came to me .
negative	i received another customers order .
negative	i was expected to do the work to correct superdry mistake .
negative	i never received my correct order and i hope the charge is not on my account .
negative	i plan on contesting any charge because i never received my order .
negative	any other company would have immediately corrected this mistake , especially_since it was their mistake !
negative	i am very disappointed in this service , that is to say , no service at all .
negative	i won_'_t order from superdry again , knowing that this service is what i will get if they screw it up .
negative	i '_ve used travelocity for years in large part due to their excellent service .
negative	any_problems were quickly resolved by calling the 00 hour number .
negative	a few_days ago i missed my flight due to a major highway accident ( a truck fire - yes it was on the news ) that closed the highway to the airport for over an_hour and a half .
negative	i spent 0 hour and 00_minutes on hold trying to make contact with travelocity .
negative	yes , it was in the middle of the snow delays - i understand and can forgive that .
negative	but when i finally got through i was told - sure - they could get me on a flight that evening or the next_day for $ 0000 additional dollars .
negative	i can not understand or forgive that .
negative	sadly - my vacation was ruined , my family was beyond disappointed .
negative	no more travelocity for me .
negative	i would never buy from this company again .
negative	we made the order on the 00th_december and paid , also paid express delivery to have the item delivered in 0 - 0 days .
negative	after three_days when the item had not arrived , we tried to contact by phone and email .
negative	just get recorded_message on the phone saying leave message .
negative	which we did .. four of them over a number of days .
negative	no - one ever returned our calls .
negative	we also emailed but again had no response .
negative	basically this company have just taken our money without receiving any goods .
negative	stay clear of them !
negative	!
negative	booked a room through_travelocity .
negative	there was an_error .
negative	i have not been able to reach anyone and my email has gone unanswered .
negative	this has_been the worst_experience ever .
negative	i ordered and paid for express delivery , never got my package and finally had to track it down and go pick it up .
negative	i have requested a refund for my shipping through email and have not heard_anything and also i have called numerous_times without anyone answering and i would remain on hold for over an_hour .
negative	i will never order from medisave again because of the terrible customer_service .
negative	placed several orders since the spring with no_issues .
negative	the last order i placed i received a confirmation e_- mail immediately and then a shipment e_- mail with tracking_number the next_day .
negative	0 business days_later i still wasn_'_t able to track my order so i sent an e_- mail to customer_service and was told that 0 of the 0 items i ordered were out of stock , there was an_error with fedex shipping my order , and i would receive a credit on my account for a future purchase .
negative	i asked which items were out of stock and received no reply .
negative	a few hours_later i received an e_- mail from another petflow customer_service rep telling_me that fedex made a mistake on their end and a couple of the items i ordered were out of stock so they will give me a $_00 credit on my account for a future purchase .
negative	it '_s been almost a week and i still have no credit on my account and haven_'_t heard back from petflow .
negative	next time i '_ll take my business elsewhere .
negative	storagemart is a fraud - i moved out on february 00 , 0000 .
negative	i am still owed $_000_+ for a full two month pre_- paid amount .
negative	it is now april 0 , 0000 .
negative	during the time of my rental my unit was broken into and vandalized .
negative	on top of this , the unit also leaked all over my belongings , causing irreparable damage to a 000 year - old handcarved rosewood couch , two arm chairs , mold and mildew to wood furniture and the water and mildew damage to many items that made it necessary to leave the items behind , since they were damaged beyond_repair .
negative	there is no corporate telephone_number to contact .
negative	the incurred loss is well over $ 0 , 000 !!!
negative	beware of this fraudulent company !!
negative	!
negative	i was really disappointed with viator because it was false_advertisement ( a night of country superstars ).
negative	the only show we went in las_vegas and it was a tribute band .
negative	they weren_'_t bad but it also advertised " tim mcgraw and brooks & dunn " whom weren_'_t there .
negative	also after waiting in line for an_hour , they didn_'_t want to let us in with our voucher which said " ticket ".
negative	they acted_like they never saw it before !
negative	after a time of convincing that it was a ticket they finally let us in and by then we didn_'_t get a good seat .. only lasted about 00 ".
negative	will never use this again .
negative	i was on auto_ship for about 00 months and four times , there were problems with the product not arriving on time or not at all or in the wrong quantity ( double ).
negative	they always charged me for each shipment even if it was messed_up .
negative	then they would take a week to issue a credit .
negative	i cancelled auto_ship a few_months_ago .
negative	against my better judgement , i recently ordered from them to take_advantage of a $_00 off promo .
negative	the discount was applied in the cart but when i placed the order i was charged the full_amount .
negative	they didn_'_t apply the discount .
negative	worst company ever , will never use them again .
negative	b_&_h
negative	my message is to express my dissatisfaction with the service provided .
negative	make two ( 0 ) purchases the july 0 , 0000 to come to miami .
negative	the place from peru for that country .
negative	not finding anyone returned packages .
negative	one stay at ups and the other returned to ny for no reason because both packages will be issued a " hold " to stay in miami .
negative	when contacting the call_center b_&_h , coordinate delivery with gabriel muñoz , who gave_me a lousy service to offer something that could never be .
negative	in addition , ordered the deployment of the package was in ny to miami with urgency would only be 0 days because in this country and being a mistake you ( b_&_h ) had the decency to charge low $_00 . 00 .
negative	that is , i charged to my credit_card an amount that you must assume .
negative	additionally , request to hear the call of july 00 , 0000 i had with gabriel muñoz who could not solve the impasse that had and that made me lose all day since i returned to my country ( peru ) the next_day ( 00 july_0000 ).
negative	because of this man , i lost all day and made me go 0 times proquad ups tells_me that he had made the arrangements to pick_up the package when ups knew nothing and the last call made at 0 : 00 about me change the version of the conversation during the day .
negative	request to be heard these flames as well as the one i had with david lopez ( between 0 : 00 and 0 : 00_pm ) because not only treated me badly but i cry on the phone .
negative	that is , a person should not be working in that area so if you treat people who have problems as i had .
negative	if not for the people of ups , had not been able to return to the things you buy in stores because its people could not fix anything , lost me the day and gave_me a lousy deal .
negative	if they check their records , in 0000 had already made a purchase of $ 0000 . 00 or so and not having any problem do another this year for a total of $ 0000 . 00 but after treatment they have given me , i do not want to rely more on their services that they provide a very poor quality of service .
negative	i hope you hear the call ringtone of july 00 , 0000 and take action on the matter .
negative	atte .

negative	can '_t find my boarding_pass in travelocity or by going to my airlines !
negative	do i have a reservation ?
negative	do i have a seat ?
negative	i have my credit_card receipt for my tickets and i have my itinerary email from travelocity but no where can i find my reservation so i can printout my boarding_pass .
negative	i am very upset with travelocity and do not ever plan
negative	to use them again .
negative	with orbitz i was notified regularly of my upcoming_trip , texted on each leg of my trip with gate numbers and easily printed out boarding_passes .
negative	right now i don_'_t know if i am catching my plane or not tomorrow ....... very unhappy traveler .
negative	i placed an order on 00 / 00 and have followed_up with e_- mails and tracking_information .
negative	i would have liked for your organization to help me locate the item that i purchase .
negative	unfortunately , the only response that i have received is that i should continously follow_up with the local post_office .
negative	this negatively impacted my academic experience because i did not have materials to support my class .
negative	i understand that mistakes_happen and packages get lost .
negative	as a customer i would have appreciated someone from your organization attempting to locate where the package got lost .
negative	i am awaiting a response to credit my account for the purchase since the item has yet to arrive .
negative	none of my orders would go through , each time i got a message that i need to call their customer_service - very frustrating
negative	won_'_t accept my credit_cards .
negative	i '_ve tried 0 different cards and none would work : (
negative	i ordered a driver_side_mirror from partsgeek . com .
negative	it arrived in a box that appeared as though it had been used in a game of hockey !
negative	several holes and slightly crushed !
negative	the mirror was " protected " inside the box with a measly plastic_bag .
negative	the mirror had plenty of room to flop all over inside the box and arrived on my doorstep broken in several pieces !
negative	i sent an_email about my concern and still have yet to get a response !
negative	not at all satisfied !
negative	while it '_s human nature to make mistakes , the customer_service people i dealt_with were nice enough but completely bungled my reservation cancellation .
negative	first the rep i spoke to struggled mightily with the english language so i spent way too much time spelling and respelling simple , common terms .
negative	the second one i spoke with tried to tell me that i was " outside the cancellation window " even_though i was 00_hours ahead of it .
negative	he wanted to read me the policy , even_though i was reading it online while we spoke .
negative	i will not be using the again !
negative	paid for next_day delivery and have not recieved my goods yet ( two_weeks_later ) as soon as i recieve them i will be sending them right back and shop elsewhere if my good ever get here !
negative	short story : i received the wrong order , my shipping time was awful , i was never told why my order took so long to ship in the first place , i found it completely_unacceptable that customer_service did not reply back to me within given time frames and never replied with more than generic messages , i was shocked that i wasn_'_t offered any sort of credit or discount for all the trouble their mismanagement and miscommunication caused , and i think it says a lot about a company that charging you only takes 0 days , but refunding me is now taking 0 and a half weeks ( and still ongoing ).
negative	long_story : placed my order on 00 / 00 and i was charged on 00 / 00 .
negative	their faq stated that after processing , ground shipping takes 0 - 0 business days .
negative	0 business days_later on 00 / 00 i not only had not received my package , but had also not received any tracking_information .
negative	i emailed customer_service on 00 / 00 and received an automatic reply that someone would contact me within 0 business days .
negative	on 00 / 00 a rep replied to my inquiry but provided me with no information , the email just stated they would forward my information to the shipping department and within another 00_hours i would receive an update .
negative	at the end of the 00 hour time_frame they had given me , i had not received any information so i emailed customer_service again on 00 / 00 .
negative	the next_day , i finally received an_automated_message with my tracking_information and found out my package didn_'_t even ship until 00 / 00 , 00 business days after the order had been placed !
negative	they made no effort to upgrade my shipping or offer anything more than a generic apology .
negative	i also didn_'_t receive a response to my second email to customer_service until 00 / 00 – 0 business days after i emailed them .
negative	they never even bothered to tell me why it took so long to ship in the first place .
negative	i was grateful to finally receive my order on 00 / 00 ... until i opened the box and realized they sent me the completely wrong order .
negative	i had ordered a pair of gloves , stockings , boots , and a top , but received 0 pairs of shoes instead .
negative	i called their customer_service number ( no way i was going to wait 0 business days again for a reply via_email ) and was told i had two options 0 ) ship the items back and then they would ship my correct order , or 0 ) ship the items back and then they would refund my money .
negative	i wasn_'_t offered a discount , free_shipping , a shipping upgrade , or anything_else in compensation for my trouble .
negative	of course i chose the refund , because there was no way i was going to wait another few_weeks and risk them sending me the wrong order again .
negative	i mailed the package back to them on 00 / 00 and via the tracking_information , i knew they received it on 00 / 00 .
negative	0 business days_later i had not received my refund so i called customer_service again on 00 / 00 and was told that processing takes 0 - 00 business days and i would receive an_email_confirmation when my refund was processed .
negative	on 00 / 00 , 00 business days after they received my return , i finally received a refund confirmation_email , but when i checked my bank_account , no refund was shown !
negative	i will be calling customer_service again if my refund still isn_'_t in my account by the end of this week .
negative	i think it '_s completely understandable why i will not be purchasing from them in the future and will have no_issues with advising others to do the same .
negative	absolutely appalling .
negative	update 0 / 00 : i have finally received my refund .
negative	after almost 0 months of bad customer_service , i am glad to finally be done dealing_with this company .
negative	update 0 / 00 : it has_been 00 days since somebody replied to my review on here and said a manager would contact me and i have not received a phone_call or an_email from anyone at this company .
negative	i most definitely do not appreciate being lied to on top of everything else they put me through .
negative	what a complete joke .
negative	my daughter found this website , so i made an order , the order arrived was not what she wanted so i sent them back , i was only refunded for one item , and as i had thrown my proof of postage away after i received an_email to say they had received my parcel , i couldn_'_t have my money refunded and had to have a credit note so forcing me to make another order so i did , when thus arrived one of my items was missing but they still took my money lucky for me it was a sale item and only a couple of pounds and i really can '_t do with all the stress u had last time for a couple of pounds !!
negative	!
negative	unable to understand representative , continually had to repeat myself and ask him to do the same .
negative	misrepresented the rules around cancellation_policy .
negative	overall just a terrible experience .
negative	will never use again
negative	i called customer sevice i waited for one hour on the phone still nobody pick_up the phone .
negative	also . dont_know what happen i been waiting for my package like00days they still didnt ship out until i check my bank i got refund balance ?????
negative	?” they didnt email me explain_why ????
negative	just feel weird .. and i spent 00_minutes on their website stuff .
negative	wasting my time .....
negative	i noticed immediately after making my reservation that i had input my payment information on the wrong tab and submitted a reservation that was completely incorrect in terms of room type and airline .
negative	i called bookit . com '_s customer_service right_away and was informed that , despite_being less_than 0 minutes after my booking , i was essentially out of luck .
negative	they were not able to cancel my flight so i could purchase the correct one .
negative	if i wanted to change my flights , i would have to still go through the same airline , pay their ridiculous baggage fees .
negative	i contacted the airline to see if i could at_least get alternate flights , but they only have 0 itinerary per day to cancun .
negative	no direct flights .
negative	in terms of my room , i attempted to upgrade to the room that i wanted online , but it was going to charge me over $_000 to do so -- $_000 more than the initial posted package price .
negative	after another phone_call to customer_service , this time i couldn_'_t understand the person through their accent , i elected to cancel my reservation for the hotel through the website .
negative	the site produced an_error , which forced me to contact the customer_service line - an_additional_$_00 fee on top of the standard $_00 change fee .
negative	interesting that they charge * you * an extra fee when * their * website is not functioning as it should .
negative	the 0rd phone rep , kelly @ ext 0000 was very helpful in terms of trying to assist me in any way that she could .
negative	i realize that she was restricted by a number of policies put in place , and she did the best that she could to help me come to a solution .
negative	while she was not successful in helping_me retract my original booking , she was able to at_least cancel the hotel portion of my vacation so i could book it separately at the cheaper cost than the upgrade cost .
negative	i was still charged the extra fee , but at that point i was so brow beat after_spending several hours trying to sort this out .
negative	surely there has to be a way to work through handling issues that arise in the moments after a reservation is made .
negative	i hadn_'_t waited a full week or even a day .
negative	it was literally just a few_minutes , and i would have even gladly paid the $_00 change fee to cancel everything and start over .
negative	i '_m still excited for my vacation , but i will likely not use booking . com in the future nor will i recommend it to others .
negative	i will not book with them in the future , i lost the price of my return ticket .
negative	i called the energetix company and they said they only sell to professionals and that anything bought online is not their product .
negative	i am upset that this deception is happening and will not order again .
negative	i rented a car for a week on rental_cars . com and got stuck with hidden_fees that tripled the original cost of my booking !
negative	first , i received an_email that stated that my rental covered local taxes and insurance .
negative	when i get to the airport , i '_m charged with more local taxes and insurance !
negative	what the heck ?!?
negative	i also booked a car_seat that was one price on their web_site , and a completely different one at the airport .
negative	i filed a complaint on their web_site , and after no response for over a month , decided to call them .
negative	the agent was extremely_rude and condescending and essentially told me that , yes , there are a lot of hidden_fees and for that reason , the majority of customers make reservations over the phone , to go over every potential fee with a live operator !
negative	beware !
negative	i took this policy out monday . the next_day collected my emails noticed apart_from my name dob the whole lot was wrong so phoned that night i was told customer_service was closed they will phone me 0am in the morning which they never i phoned them 0 times explained about my policy van details was wrong , ncd was wrong , payment wrong , never put tools on , purchase wrong so they said we will amend get back never all day so 0 people told me they would get back to me never so today i phoned they said the girl dealing_with it will phone you never did so after 0 phone_calls today i spoke to someone_who took my details went to amend them then wanted me to pay another £_00 so i said no way i gave these details on monday the man gave_me a quote on my correct details then changed them . so cancelled now but its cost me £_00 because they sais they insured me for the last 0 days but . what a girl called lucy said yesterday its not worth the paper its written because if we had an accident they wouldnt pay because in correct details . through no fault of mine people like this dont deserve jobs they are liars & if this was my company i wouldnt be getting_rid of people on the phone i would get to the bottom of this they shouls know everyone one person_who ive spoke to in the last 0 days if i was at fault they would . anyway iam so mad with these liars iam going to take this further . because i have insured the van for the past 00 years no trouble & for me to loose 0 nights_sleep because of monkey staff is not on people like this are dangerous . this isnt about money this is principle for me now but i do want my £_00 they got that because they took my payment by card & thats another thing i thought i paid yearly & the man put me on dd without a bank_account .
negative	i just sent flowers on the spur of the moment , wanted a bright fresh bunch to cheer my mum up in england .
negative	could have gone with interflora but preferred you guys as have ordered before and been happy .
negative	turned_out as more of a disappointment because they didn_'_t come close to conveying how much i love her .
negative	petals bruised and broken .
negative	please resend a fresh bunch , with small apology .
negative	i got a quote from bolier_juice on thursday but didn_'_t order until friday when i got a new quote .
negative	the price had gone up but i needed to order it anyway .
negative	i was showing a friend the website a couple of hours_later and got a quote and isa '_s very surprised to see the price had gone back down to what it was on the thursday .
negative	needless to say , i cancelled my order and replaced it at the lower_rate .
negative	i ordered a dress for my wedding .
negative	they told me it would arrive on time .
negative	it didn_'_t .
negative	i had to run_out the day before and buy a dress off the rack .
negative	i wished i would have done that in the first place .
negative	no one will return my emails .
negative	the phone_number that was given to me does not work .
negative	scam scam scam .
negative	don_'_t order thru them .
negative	i ordered a a size 0 shoe and got a size 0 .
negative	the sticker on the box said 0 but i could see that the size 0 sticker was placed on top of the size 0 sticker .
negative	i called to complain and wanted to order my correct size the shoe was sold out .
negative	i am very upset .
negative	this withdrawal ease did not work for me my md doctor looked it over and laughed told me it doesn_'_t have the right stuff to help me get through withdrawal from suboxzone waste of money but they do have some good story '_s on web_site sucked me in i took it for 0_weeks till showed my doc oh well wasted a bunch of money on drugs that wasn_'_t any good for me again !
negative	i had a lovely hour of so at this authentic restaurant .
negative	my disappointment wa sthat it took us so long to find the place .
negative	we aksed taxi drivers and restaurnaters and walked around for 00_mins in the rain .
negative	very embarrassed as i was bringing a friend for a meal which was lovely when we got there but not a great experienced before .
negative	the title should speak for itself .
negative	shocked !
negative	my story is like many many others i have found on the internet on complaintsboard . com and tripadvisor .
negative	i have booked airline_tickets through bravofly , my credit_card was charged , the flight was cancelled , bravofly informed me that the refund process takes a few_months , 00 months later i am still out of money , no prospect to receive a refund and it is very difficult to reach anyone at bravofly .
negative	given the number of similar complaints it looks like bravofly is in the business of stealing money from their on - line customers .
negative	i am going to pursue legal actions and plan to connect with other customers who complained to stress this point .
negative	the part i purchased arrived damaged , in a flimsy box with no packing_material to support it .
negative	parts_geek has no phone_number to contact customer_service , takes days to respond by email .
negative	it cost me $ 0 . 00 to send the part back and they also charged a restocking_fee of $ 0 . 00 for what reason , are they restocking a damaged part to resell ?
negative	so as a customer i spent a considerable_amount of money for a part i sent back , in actuallity , nothing .
negative	never do_business with themm again .
negative	i selected a car_rental_agency listed on travelocity for a rental in cape_town .
negative	the rental was for about 00 days and the cost was listed as $_000 . 00 .
negative	at the counter i declined insurance .
negative	so_far my credit_card been charged $ 0000 . 00 , the latest charge being posted yesterday - a full month an a half since i left the country .
negative	upon contacting the customer_support group at travelocity they said that there is nothing they can do .
negative	i interpret this to mean : 0 ) the prices quoted on travelocity '_s site cannot be trusted and 0 ) if a merchant does not provide a service or good for the price that was provided to travelocity , travelocity will not do anything about it .
negative	i have been using travelocity for 00 years -- but no more .
negative	i placed a large order requesting the supplements be shipped to my niece , martina hukel , at 0000 mascoutah avenue , belleville , il 00000 .
negative	the billing_address was listed as 00 old ellington road , broad brook , ct 00000 .
negative	the reason i chose to purchase the supplements from your company was the brand_names and free_shipping .
negative	the supplements were sent to me , which required me to pay for shipping and extend the time when she received them .
negative	i sent a note to customer_service and they stated i requested the shipment to 00 old ellington road , which i didn_'_t .
negative	i responded as such and received a note stating ups delivered them and did i receive the supplements , and if i wanted to ship the supplements back they can ship them to the correct address .
negative	this is the poorest form of customer_service i have experienced , which makes me question whether the supplements are being made in the united_states and if the brands to truly valid .
negative	i doubt i '_ll be ordering from your company in the future .
negative	manger was very bad manner
negative	when i stopped by to make my june payment , i was briefly notified by david ( the previous manager ) that management was changing .
negative	june_0th i receive a call from the new manager , alexa , saying she is returning my call , but i had never called ...
negative	so i called her back .
negative	no response .
negative	she later call me back .
negative	she said my new keys were there for me .
negative	i was greatly surprised .
negative	i had no_idea my lock was being changed .
negative	so i asked why .
negative	she told me that the sprinkler system was being changed so they had to cut the locks off to get in .
negative	alexa didn_'_t come off too kind .
negative	i expect friendlier customer_service and much more professionalism .
negative	when i started renting my unit david told me the locks and the doors were designed to protect against that .
negative	i am extremely disappointed with the lack of communication and notification about such matters .
negative	as a tenant i didn_'_t expect to have my locks cut_off an changed with being told , then to have a sprinkler service staff have excess to my belongings is beyond me .
negative	i placed an order on black_friday for an i - pad .
negative	i realized that i forgot to purchase the protection_plan so i called them right_away but no answered .
negative	i assumed that they were off on the holiday so i place another order and e_- mail them immediately to cancel my first order .
negative	no response for 0 days .
negative	so i have been calling and e -, mailing numerous since then and no answer and no response to any method .
negative	i got the items , both of them , yesterday .
negative	no box comes with the i - pad .
negative	i know it says open box but it never said that no box .
negative	just five_minutes ago , i was call them on the customer_service and billing support .
negative	no answer from both department .
negative	how do you run a business by not answering calls on a business day !
negative	worst online purchase ever !!!!!
negative	!
negative	labels were off center .
negative	ended_up making them myself .
negative	well let '_s see i placed an order on 0 / 00 / 00 and it seems that they cancelled my order and never informed me .
negative	now my classes start tomorrow and when i go to check the status of my shipment and it says it '_s cancelled !
negative	what ?!?!?!?!?!?
negative	i have never in my life had to deal with this amount of inconsideration ever !
negative	due to weather problems there were difficulties with my flights requiring that i make some adjustments .
negative	the airlines could not work with me directly because i had purchased through_travelocity , and the agent who answered for travelocity was very difficult to understand and singularly unhelpful .
negative	i ended_up having to buy an entirely new ticket , which i did thru the airline .
negative	i will never book through_travelocity again .
negative	interestingly , a coworker who had purchased the same travel plan directly with the airline had no difficulty getting their ticket adjusted , at no cost , even_though their ticket was also non_- refundable . lesson_learned
negative	i cannot_believe i was allowed to book a room for one female adult and 0 children at his hotel royal inn ).
negative	the pictures posted on the website are false .
negative	the hotel was filthy and smelled .
negative	i saw drugs being sold .
negative	as well as stood in line trying to cancel my reservation while prostitutes were checking in one by one while their pimp waited outside .
negative	all this with my too small_children .
negative	i was mortified and terrified for our safety .
negative	in fact , when i checked in to another hotel , i was told " you ' re lucky you didn_'_t get shot .
negative	that '_s a drug and prostitute hotel .
negative	".
negative	i ordered a dryer though i didn_'_t require their normal next_day delivery , so plenty of time until friday .
negative	00_hours before delivery i received a text saying i ' d been given the 0am - 0am delivery spot next_day , but could ring if not convenient .
negative	as i was travelling to the house to receive it , and tenants whose room it had to pass through would be asleep , i rang to reschedule delivery time .
negative	i was told they never change delivery times , but that i could cancel for a sum of £_00 ..
negative	despite talking to ' customer_services ' twice , to be given cool robot unhelpful repetition , all they would do is put me through to the delivery guys , who told me the same .
negative	on the info it says you will be charged if you give less_than 00_hours notice , yet they only gave_me 00_hours notice of delivery !!!
negative	i had to receive the dryer in the dark at 0 . 00am , waking_up the whole house .
negative	i won_'_t buy from them again .
negative	i paid but i couldnt got my point cause that didnt work on my canadian xbox ...
negative	well , i love their service , but i think thye should just do it like =
negative	i pay for a game card ~ , when my payment have been reviewed and approved , they should just send me the code by email .
negative	no phone_calls etc .
negative	i paid for express 0 day shipping did not even get it within 0 days .
negative	i needed it specifically for a sims but did not receive in time .
negative	opened an inquiry and still not gotten response a week_later ...
negative	dear otticanet
negative	i am still_waiting for my sunglasses - ordered and already payed !!
negative	!
negative	so , i '_m not satisfied at all in the moment .
negative	thanks for delivery in the next few_days .
negative	greetings ,
negative	my order should have arrived over a month_ago - in fact , it should have been at home before christmas , because how would i give my friend her christmas_present otherwise ?
negative	well , i am still_waiting for it !!
negative	no update on the status of my order , no compensatory measure for this trouble ...
negative	for the money ?
negative	oh it '_s already been debited from my account right after i passed my order .
negative	i love to pay for something i don_'_t get , don_'_t you ?
negative	!
negative	i am really disappointed by the big_bus_tour , not only did we frequently have to wait in excess of 00_minutes for a bus , we had to listen to some of the worse commentaries of london i '_ve ever_experienced .
negative	if you are interested in hearing_about how many t - shirts you can buy in primark and the most personal opinions possible , this will be your bag .
negative	at one point , we sat at a stop for 00_minutes , eventually i went down to ask why and found that the driver just felt_like chatting to some random other person .
negative	i would never recommend this company to anyone and never will i use them again .
negative	great store !
negative	service is garbage .
negative	i ordered my contacts in march 0 0000 . recieved them march 00 0000 .
negative	the left eye was the wrong prescription .
negative	called frames_direct , was told to send them back and in the meantime they would send me samples so i could see .
negative	i never got my samples .
negative	i called fd again and they blamed thier vendor .
negative	would not do anything to help me .
negative	i finally recieved my replacement box in april 0 0000 .
negative	i will never deal with this company again
negative	it was mostly my fault , but when i made this reservation online i didn_'_t realize i wasn_'_t booking with the marriott hotel_directly .
negative	the logo was similar , it seemed like a legitimate website , but it '_s not !
negative	the price is higher_than if i had gone_through the hotel_directly or on the hotel website ... but i didn_'_t figure that out until i had already booked .
negative	i '_ll be smarter next time .
negative	i also called the hotel_directly and they said they had heard my same issue before and i would have received a lower_rate if i had gone_through them .
negative	i gave this experience a one star not because of rude conduct but i found the experience unacceptable because it '_s deceptive advertising .
negative	i have not yet been to the hotel and hope that the people there will make my experience worthwhile , so i cannot_comment on the hotel experience yet .
negative	i recently booked a vacation trip to las_vegas .
negative	three_days before we were to leave , my husband '_s immediate supervisor ( our pastor ) was killed in an automobile accident .
negative	he was killed on saturday_night and i called sunday to cancel our reservations .
negative	it was not something we wanted to do .
negative	but , we had no choice .
negative	first we had to talk to someone in another country .
negative	we had bought insurance for our trip , but we couldn_'_t get a refund because he was not family .
negative	i felt that if you had truly represented us , your customer , you would have fought harder for us to receive compensation from our hotel for our lodging .
negative	you will be our very last choice in vacation planners .
negative	i had a couple of issues with processing an order with boohoo , initially caused by paypal .
negative	boohoo , although when contacted they replied within_00hours , offered very little help and in the end , with the issue still unresolved , they just stopped replying !
negative	i would not purchase with them again - it '_s all fine if it goes ok but if it doesn_'_t beware !
negative	this company likes to blame their customers for their mistakes .
negative	then their rude customer_service reps will shoo you over to their website for a refund .
negative	i expected to receive water_bottle_labels for my daughter '_s first birthday_party with her picture on it .
negative	their website advertise these labels as being long enough to wrap around a standard water_bottle , and having a photo centered with wording on the sides .
negative	i inserted her pic , and wrote a beautiful message on the side of the label .
negative	next i followed their simple directions to place the order .
negative	however , i received a pack of small squared stickers with her pic on it !
negative	no long pink label with her pic centered with beautiful wording on the side .
negative	when i called , they blamed me for the mistake .
negative	i think not .
negative	i '_ve never had this happen before .
negative	their '_s either a glitch in their system , or they are advertising their products falsely .
negative	i carefully re - ordered as they suggested .
negative	the 0nd order was never received , so i called and they reshipped it .
negative	when the 0rd order arrived , the day before my daughters_birthday , it was again , only small stickers !
negative	the customer_service lady , again blamed me for this mistake and said that i was actually supposed to peel the small stickers off and place them on the bottles .
negative	well , they were too small to stick !
negative	she was rude and could care less about the situation .
negative	her response was dull .
negative	no apology .
negative	she just shooed me over to their website for a refund .
negative	no one i '_ve spoken too seemed to care .
negative	the ' d listen , but would never apologize or give an explanation other than blaming the customer .
negative	i '_ve never been treated like this as a customer before .
negative	i will never buy from this company agin , and my expectations for my daughter '_s birthday_party will forever be ruined .
negative	first off i thought i was dealing_with days inn not a third_party my fault .
negative	should of know that when it took over 00_minutes to make a reservation for 0 rooms while making reservation i informed him that 0 of the rooms would by paid for by other people when we got there and acted_like that was fine and he need a card credit to hold rooms never told me he was charging my card right_away .
negative	one of the rooms had to be canceled which was a problem after arguing with them they said " ok " because it was before the 0 : 00_pm deadline and they did credit me for that room . but when we got to day inns of course there was a problem they could not find reservation for both rooms only one of them which i was already charge for both then the employes tell me this happens all the time with this company and sometime they charge people and make reservation even when days inn is all fulled up why days inn would let this company ruin there reputation is beyond me . so days inn charged me for one of the rooms which i already paid for so i called reservation_counter to get my money back took me over a hour with the man saying the same line of words over and over , i asked to speak to a supervisor never got one i asked for corporates number never got it finally thought i had everything straighten_out and they were going to refund my money in 0 - 0 days never got the refund call company again was hung_up on three_times transferred alot and then finally was given a fake corporate number .
negative	i am now going to contact bbb and days inn to try and resolve this issue .
negative	it has_been a week since i ordered and still no merchandise on hand .
negative	i know it is in transit and has_been for 0 days .
negative	i have long received merchandise from other_vendors , which was requested the samde day at the one in question .
negative	i can '_t say anything about the quality of the product yet .
negative	i don_'_t get it !
negative	my first shipment was a nightmare because i didn_'_t receive everything i ordered and no one communicated to me that the dog_food was on back order .
negative	on my second order i finally got the dog_food but inbetween the first & second order i had to go to the pet_store to buy food .
negative	no convenience there !
negative	my third order just came a few_days ago and once again no dog_food nor explanation .
negative	i have 0 large blk labs and need the food .
negative	i had to give them cat_food because i just figured the order would include the dog_food .
negative	so tomorrow i have to go to the pet_store and buy the 00_lb_bag of food that i didn_'_t get in my order .
negative	very annoyed and confused !!
negative	where is the convenience ?
negative	i ordered and it did not get shipped until 0 days_later even_though i paid for quicker shipping .
negative	will never order from them again !!
negative	!
negative	first of all , they sent me a wrong item ( which took 0_weeks of shipping ).
negative	now they have been ignoring my emails when i try to find out how to return this item .
negative	so frustrated because of their worst customer_service .
negative	i '_ll never order anything from this site again .
negative	ordered on line for convince and inability to get out to a store .
negative	what happened is the order was sent with $ 0 . 00 postage due , so i had to get someone to take me to the post_office to pick_up the package passing many stores on the way , pay the postage due and pay the person gas $$ to take me there .
negative	not a good deal at all .
negative	ended_up costing me a lot more than if i had gone to the store in the 0st place .
negative	i ordered two of one product .
negative	i was to receive them in two_days .
negative	took four .
negative	only one in the package .
negative	had to call three_times to get the other .
negative	took two_weeks to arrive .
negative	not sure if they will ever get my money again .
negative	afleverede mit produkt til service for nu næsten 0 måneder siden , stadig ikke fået det .
negative	de sagde der aller aller højest ville gå 0 uger , den først gang de brød et løfte ud_af 00 gange .
negative	tjek status via ordre id , det seneste de skriver er at jeg_har indleveret produktet , ja det ved jeg godt ?
negative	lyver gang på gang , find my iphone er_ikke slået fra , derfor har vi intet gjort med dit produkt i 00 dage .
negative	medarbejderen tjekkede så lige 0 gange om_det_var slået fra inden han sendte , og_jeg gendannede telefonen helt fra ny , så_det passer ikke , men okay ... beder så om at sende apple id , hvilket man gør , de slår det fra og siger reparationen nu vil gå igang , 0 uger efter , ja 0 uger igen !
negative	skriver de nu at det_ikke_er slået fra , og vil nu sende min telefon tilbage uden reparation ?
negative	hvad skal der ske ????
negative	ringer så til_dem og de siger ja vi skriver en mail med_det samme til_dem og du_får svar efter aller højest 00 timer ( helt_sikkert ....) der_er nu fået 00 timer intet hørt , ringer igen , de siger det samme .... to be continued ....
negative	dette er mildest talt det ringeste selskab at rejse med !
negative	problemer_med flyene gang på gang og dårlig behandling af kunderne .
negative	har_aldrig hørt om begrebet kundeservice .
negative	mig og min søster på 00 ventede i 0 timer i lufthavnen over natten på at vi skulle komme afsted , hvortil norwegian gang på gang blev ved med at udsætte , på_trods af sure kunder ved desken .
negative	order came with a torn up box with no instructions or hardware .
negative	i still_haven_'_t got my contacts yet .
negative	i ordered in the very beginning of may .
negative	i was supposed to get it on the 00th , then it changed i was supposed to get it last_week .
negative	the last time i checked the tracking , i was supposed to get it on tuesday .
negative	i '_m still_waiting ....
negative	very , very bad frauders supported company !
negative	yes , may be its good for buyers , but not good for sellers !
negative	lost 0000 $ with this frauder - company paypal !
negative	burn in economic crysis !
negative	not happy with this company as i ordered a product for my nephews birthday , and paid_extra postage for 0 - 0 day delivery .
negative	it arrived 00 days after i ordered it .
negative	i wont be recommending the site .
negative	my cell_phone bill is higher_than a car note .
negative	verizon doesnt care .
negative	their concer is making money .
negative	client opinions are null and void .
negative	when my contract expires verizon will be null and void .
negative	i will never shop with them again .
negative	thought it would be great to send my hard to buy for brother a gift_card with pictures of his niece and nephews .
negative	00 days_later the gift_card did not arrive by christmas , and no one could tell me why .
negative	i called many_times , but certain hours they can just look up information and can '_t do any sort of tracking .
negative	then when i called back during their " open hours " they said they weren_'_t sure where their trouble shooting people were ?
negative	finally the gift_card arrives a week after christmas and no one can tell me if it is valid and the replacement they are sending is being sent or not .
negative	i have never filled out an online review , but am so passionate_about this i signed_up for a trustpilot account just so others don_'_t get burned too !
negative	viewed a promotion of light up dog tags 00 %- this company used this as gimmick to get you to buy other products .
negative	i was soon notified that everything was available to ship except the light up dog tags were no_longer in stock and could not ship . 0 week_later they appeared for sale of their website again .
negative	they should have backordered the items rather_than tell me that they were no_longer available .
negative	now your have to order more products to get the dog tags .
negative	really ??
negative	?
negative	be nice to actually receive my items before they ask for a review !
negative	!
negative	my order had i item missing , i was told an e_mail had been sent , i have recieved no e_mail , my delivery was cancelled because i didnt reply to the e_mail i didnt get , have wsted a day of my holidays , i have to wait 00 days for delivery and the out of stock item is still out of stock , | i have emailed victoria_plumb but no one finds my complaint important enough to reply .
negative	ordered two mirrors - recieved one that was correct .
negative	a few_days_later the second mirror arrived .
negative	wrong mirror - a much less_expensive mirror .
negative	followed their instructions to get a new part .
negative	no answer - two_weeks_later - still no answer .
negative	called the better business_bureau of nj .
negative	big fat f rating and over 000 complaints .
negative	don_'_t see getting much help from the bbb .
negative	will never again do_business with this company .
negative	that rate was great .
negative	but the shuttle service was lacking .
negative	it took way to long to get a shuttle
negative	and the step up into the van was dangerous .
negative	i was told it was garage covered parking and i
negative	was not in a covered parking_spot .
negative	will probably not use again or wreck amend
negative	i thought it would be great to have pet_food delivered , but when it arrived i realized the bag i received was 0 / 0 the size of the one i buy in the store for the same price .
negative	i was sorely disappointed .
negative	ordered ink , as i have many_times before .
negative	was unable to print using the latest order .
negative	emailed customer_service for replacement / refund and was issued a list of things to try first .
negative	i will not order r recommend them in the future if that is their regard for customers .
negative	i will never go through this website again .
negative	the representatives are incompetent and rude !!
negative	!
negative	paypal gouges its customer with unnecessary fees for the most basic transactions .
negative	also , i have never trusted the company to keep my personal information safe after they had a security breach a few_years back .
negative	i just recived my othello pad that was orginally 000 . 00 i paid 000 . 0 it does not work its terrible i want to return it .
negative	iam so dissipointed i wsnted this to work out first time ordering china see what happens .
negative	yes i should of thought about that now what do i do . i want my money back , or send me a better tablet . if light in the bov reads this i hope they do please email me llady0000 @_yahoo . com asap ,
negative	carla
negative	i ordered a alternator part from you and was told to send back the core to get my fifty bucks back not once was there mention that i had to pay shipping !
negative	it was going to cost me 00 . 00 to ship it back .. thats bull .. never again !!!!
negative	you people are dishonest !
negative	!
negative	i had to many connections flights and rude flight attendants who gave_me a hard time to assist me on what gate to go and by the time i landed in el paso my was not even there .
negative	i want a refund for my baggage charge due to the fact i didn_'_t receive it till the next_day and i had drive to the airport being they were not gonna drop it off till mid_afternoon and i needed a shower and could not take one till i got my bag with all my personal_belongings
negative	they canceled my shoes because they were out of stock which is the only_reason i ordered a pair of skinny_jeans .
negative	tried repeatedly calling them over and over to cancel my other item before it was shipped and always got the voicemail .
negative	unheard of !
negative	i called during regular hours and no one is ever manning customer_service ?
negative	so now i have to wait_till the item ships to send it back and i bet i will go through hell and back to get my refund i '_m sure .
negative	thank_you for wasting my time and money .
negative	so i needed a room last_minute .
negative	i called expedia and reserved s room that was in my price range .
negative	i get to the motel about 00 - 00_min later but had no reservation .
negative	so i ended_up staying where i did the night before .
negative	the next_day , i check my account and i saw a charge from expedia ( not the motel ).
negative	i call expedia and tell them the situation and ask for s refund .
negative	i '_ve called 0x now .
negative	i '_m actually writing this review while on hold .
negative	so_far all i '_ve been told was that the motel got my reservation 0 min after i left , yet no one , not the motel or expedia notified me .
negative	this what expedia told me ; and that the motel held the room and kept the money and won_'_t refund .
negative	but again , it was expedia who charged my card according to my account info .
negative	i '_ve been on hold now for an_hour , waiting for a supervisor .
negative	my next step is to get my credit union involved due to unauthorized / fraudulent charges .
negative	never well i use or recommend expedia to anyone !
negative	i ordered two coffee_mugs and two beer steins for christmas_presents .
negative	i received the box and only one coffee_cup was wrapped in bubble_wrap .
negative	the rest of the bubble_wrap was at the top of the box .
negative	of course the only item still in one piece was that coffee_cup .
negative	in addition , the printing was very faded on the coffee_mugs , to where they were hardly legible .
negative	i wouldn_'_t pay $_00 for that .
negative	i took pictures ; however the customer_service said it was not necessary to email them .
negative	i asked for a refund as they were christmas_presents and there is not time to have them reprinted before christmas and they indicated that it would take 0 - 0 business days for a refund .
negative	lovely .
negative	i will not buy anything further from cafepress .
negative	car was not as_advertised and altho were assured they would cancel , nothing was done .
negative	company refused to refund $_000 and we had to go to another company .
negative	i had reserved 0 wheel . drive seats 0_adults and 0 luggage and they had a four door small car available .
negative	the door would not latch closed , and i was scared to ask for another room .
negative	i did not feel_safe there at all .
negative	i put the mini_fridge and my suitcase in front of the door and slept with one eye open .
negative	the next_morning , i awoke with my legs covered in bedbug bites .
negative	i placed like more than 00 clarisonic mia 0 multiple order becuase the promotion says that purchsed with free clarisonic cleaning gel gifts .
negative	i received none of them .
negative	it '_s like a cheat .
negative	besides that the products is out of order and they are still selling it .
negative	after you place them they will send you email says that you need to wait_until the date ..... really not a good experience .
negative	i would rather buy things in other skinstores .
negative	i was so disappointed at customer_service at travelocity .
negative	they refused to let us speak with a manager and left us on hold for 00 minute intervals several_times hoping we would hang up .
negative	the 0nd and 0rd reps were so rude it was unbelievable .
negative	if we were not on the hook for the holidays and cancellation fees we would have never stayed with this company .
negative	speaking with rude foreign reps is very sad and has made using other_vendors a lot easier .
negative	a previously loyal client for many years is shopping around now .
negative	i ordered an extra large and it would not fit even my skinny 00 year_old grand_daughter .
negative	all size is an incomplete fit .. where can i send it back to : address please .
negative	it is chinese return address ,
negative	after i ordered a cd i didnt get a confirmation_email and after a week of not having any communication or getting my item i wondered_if it had even gone_through .
negative	i got an_email_saying it had been dispatched 0 days after ordering and received it 0 days_later .
negative	not impressed
negative	on monday 00th_march i ordered 0 different bouquets , for mother '_s day , for delivery to my work place on friday 00th_march .
negative	obviously needed them for mother '_s day on sunday 00th_march .
negative	they never arrived and no - one contacted me to say there was a problem with the delivery .
negative	i waited at my work from 0 . 00am - 0 . 00pm on friday for the delivery .
negative	so i had to quickly get some flowers on saturday_morning , along with half the nation no_doubt !
negative	the courier attempted to deliver them on monday 00st march , i refused delivery .
negative	after 0 emails and a phone_call i was eventually told " on this occasion " they were willing to give me a full_refund !!!!
negative	what a cheek , like it '_s my fault !
negative	i thought i would give them a try , but no never again .
negative	i '_ll be sticking with interflora thank_you very much !
negative	!
negative	i would never recommend this company .
negative	if i could '_ve , i would have given any stars .
negative	a really crappy service !
negative	it was want i ordered so it doesn_'_t work in the printer that i have .
negative	i '_m out the money , very frustrating !
negative	called to get reservation , explained part of a party and need room on ground_floor , poolside if possible .
negative	said this 0 times .
negative	she said she understood and put in reservation .
negative	00_minutes later my daughter calls from hotel and states the front_desk told her there were more available rooms poolside but my room was upstairs , no request on reservation for ground fl or poolside .
negative	i spoke to front_desk and because it was booked through here , they could not change .
negative	called reservationcounter back , explained situation , he said that they would fax hotel and correct , assured_me it was no problem .
negative	got to hotel an_hour later , they had received a fax and responded but now reservationcounter would not respond back , seriously fax ?
negative	not online ?
negative	anyways , front_desk got manager and they did something so i received a ground_floor room but what a mess .
negative	will book online or at actual hotel from now on .
negative	costly mistake on my part .
negative	i trusted expedia would help me out by finding the best option for me .
negative	i had inadvertently scheduled my return flight for p . m . instead of a . m .
negative	i called the day before returning home to see what could be done .
negative	the first rep said the only a . m . flight available was at 00 : 00 and there would be over $ 0000 charge to change it .
negative	i questioned and re - questioned the rep as i knew delta had earlier flights to its hub , atlanta .
negative	he then switched me to another rep and amazingly she found a 0 : 00 and 0 : 00 flight .
negative	the extra_charge for me was now , $_000 .
negative	i asked if there was anything_else i could do - switch airlines , anything but she said no .
negative	i paid the money .
negative	upon returning home i called delta .
negative	i was told i could have had a same day , stand by mode for a $_00 charge , that is all .
negative	so i ended_up overpaiding $_000 .
negative	i made a complaint with expedia and i am done with them .
negative	the shop staff were good but misleading when buying .
negative	were told that we were buying natural wood but later find out it is coloured .
negative	when goods arrived dining_table damaged .
negative	was told it would be 0_weeks . we didnt have no table to eat off .
negative	we are carers so this was very frustrating .
negative	when the next one came it had been damaged in same place and glued .
negative	got back on phone to be told it is want sometimes happens in factory but it will be ok . so was offered a goodwill payment of £_00 .
negative	then i came to dust my sideboard and lifted my hi fi up to clean and the colour had come off .
negative	i rang them was told to wax it again didn_'_t work .
negative	they sent out a repairer he couldn_'_t do it .
negative	rang them back and they said the repairer had told them it was the buffer we used so guarantee was void i said just a minute your shop staff told us we could use one but that wasn_'_t the cause they then they said it was to much wax but you told me to put more wax on the outcome is another repairer coming out .
negative	so we will wait and see .
negative	all along the service and after sales_team and the quality of the furniture is nil .
negative	i wont buy anymore furniture
negative	the flowers ive picked out /" paid for " looked nothing like what was delivered !
negative	not worth the money !
negative	i will not choose this site again !
negative	supposed to get 00_mins on delivery to check goods .
negative	in reality you get as long as it takes the driver to close his doors and drive away .
negative	when we checked the delivery a door was smashed but hey no problem rang customer_services 0 days_later a new door .
negative	got the plumber on the phone and we start to assemble .
negative	got so_far through the assembly and notice that we are short of 0 rubber seals so again ring customer_services and explain 0 days_later seals arrive but they are too short .
negative	ring customer_service again and explain only this time i ask if they could be sent next_day delivery .
negative	the customer_service agent this time is not very helpful and the only reply is i can '_t guarantee this it will be between 0 to 0 days which this time is not good enough as i have the plumber waiting and i '_ve got the electrician booked for the next_day but again all i get is they can '_t guarantee but they will put a request to the warehouse . i ask to speak to a manager only surprise surprise they are not available so i ask if i could have a number for the warehouse only they don_'_t have one .
negative	now at this point i am seriously running_out of patience as i might as well head but the wall till i bleed as the so called cutomer service lady is having none of it and start to read her script again telling_me what i '_ve already heard i can '_t guarantee this .
negative	now i '_ve had enough and all i can presume is that this company don_'_t want any repeat business oh and yes i '_m still_waiting for the seals .
negative	would i recommend them no !
negative	at 00 may 0000 i order bouquet for my mother .
negative	the package came on 00th of may , one day delay .
negative	the box looks like hit by a truck .
negative	flowers inside , of course they are damaged as well .
negative	it looks lifeless and flower petals are dried .
negative	i don_'_t understand how can they still deliver such flower ?
negative	i write a few emails to their costumer_service with attached photo '_s , but they only reply in automatic email such as they received my email .
negative	i guess their costumer_service is only for charging your credit_card .
negative	i never hear from them again .
negative	i assumed they don_'_t have costumer_service at all .
negative	i '_ve been using their service for 0 times , every time is a disappointing .
negative	first time : the flower is dry out .
negative	second time : they deliver it to a wrong_address and tells_me that i should pick_up by myself at that wrong_address .
negative	and now this is happening .
negative	0 times is enough .
negative	i am very disappointed with their service and will warn all my friends on fb not to use their service at all .
negative	i have ordered 0 pair of shoes on the 00th of december to the us .. orlando , florida , and i still didn_'_t receive my order .
negative	whenever i send them emails , they reply very late and with no answers because they actually have no_idea why it '_s late !!
negative	how can '_t they know where the orders are ?!!
negative	they have to have direct contact with royal_mail or whoever they ' re using .. i ordered from forever00 , sheinside , amazon and charlotte_russe , and they all came on time and answered all my questions .
negative	i '_m very upset because i '_m leaving the us on the 00th of january .. this is the worst store and the last time i '_ll order from it !
negative	wanted 0 items sent to different_addresses and both went to one no_explanation
negative	took a week to even dispatch hoping to get these sometime this month .
negative	asked me for feedback before dispatch , here it is .
negative	despite following all their instructions and having multiple pieces of evidence proving my claim , paypal denied my claim several_times , including after i already sent back the merchandise and uploaded the shipping information .
negative	they claimed that i did not follow directions in shipping ( i . e .
negative	direct signature , online tracking ); but the rep i talked to had verified that i did follow directions .
negative	i had to call them more than 00 times and plead with them throughout the case .
negative	they would not give me a refund and stated that the seller had not received the shipment , when fedex very clearly showed that the shipment had been refused .
negative	i had to argue with multiple reps before they would admit that the shipment was refused .
negative	the website also stated a different status than the reps told me , which was also different than the emails i received .
negative	avoid this company at all costs !!!
negative	!
negative	i have ordered from 00dollarmall . com before .
negative	loved what i got an decided to purchase two coats .
negative	one gray and one navy_blue .
negative	i received my package damaged and missing my gray coat .
negative	need more winter clothes , come on guys it is cold and some parts of the u . s . please take all those summer clothes down .
negative	i order parts and then u send to somewhere_else and never got lugnuts and now i find out wrong wheels u sent me i am not happy
negative	i sent a number of floral gifts to friends and family this year .
negative	one of my friends sent me a photo of the flowers which she had received from me .
negative	i was shocked .
negative	the arrangement was the correct variety of christmas flowers and in the correct shape as indicated on the e_- florist site .
negative	however , i had paid for an upgrade to a large arrangement and i could count on one hand the number of flowers in the arrangement sent .
negative	i contacted e_- florist by e_- mail and by reply i was asked to send a photo of the arrangement which displeased me .
negative	i did send a photo of the arrangement .
negative	in reply , i was told that the arrangement looked as if it resembled the photo on the e_- florist site so they were satisfied that the florist had sent the correct flowers .
negative	no mention was made of the fact that i had paid fifty five_pounds for an upgrade which my friend did not receive .
negative	i will not order from e_- florist in the future .
negative	i was in denmark for only 0 months and made that very clear when taking out the service .
negative	the sales_associate assured_me i could pay the remaining balance when i left the country , however that was false ; he also told me he would contact me if there were any_issues and that never happened either .
negative	after i moved back to the us i never_heard from telia again until my boyfriend ( who_lives in dk ) looked into my credit and said i had tons of debt that was sent to collections because i never paid my telia bill .
negative	now , one year later i am more than 0000kr in debt and have no way to pay the outstanding balance .
negative	horrible can not call anyone about any_issues only email its crazy ........ then i send email_asking to call me and to say changing shipping address was fine anf i would get back a copy of there original email .... crazy still to date no parts or anything do not want to do_business with this company at all ...... do not want order got it from another company
negative	i rated this low because i am paying for the service as part of a package and it is not mac comparable according to the download requirements .
negative	useless to me .
negative	i received my part quickly , but in a very bad condition .
negative	it was broken into 0 pieces .
negative	flew delta which is my preferred airline .
negative	didn_'_t save any money and even_though there were better seats available on the plane ( as there were stand - by passengers who were given seats ) i was sent to the last row of seats next to the bathroom .
negative	ugh !
negative	since i am a delta preferred customer i know they normally would not have done this to me .
negative	i will take_care of my own travel in the future .
negative	such a hassle / waste of time ( money )
negative	my first and last purchase from chicago airbrush .
negative	i received a very misleading email about a 00_%_discount which prompted my purchase .
negative	unfortunately , my purchase did not qualify !
negative	when i called to voice my displeasure i was offered a 0 %_discount .
negative	i placed my order in excess of $_000 . 00 , but , when my order was processed , they would not honor their offer of a 0 %_discount .
negative	they obviously made the offer to get me to place my order .
negative	when i told them i would be returning the purchased items , i was told there would be a 00_% restocking_fee if i refused or returned the order .
negative	not an honorable company to do_business with ... never again will they get my money .
negative	ordered a part 0 / 00 , paid 00 , never received .
negative	ups showed they screwed_up my address so it was returned .
negative	i attempted to call this company , what a waste , no real_person will ever answer .
negative	your referred to their online customer_support .
negative	they did nothing more than state my package was being returned .
negative	i finally received a partial_refund , of $ 0 on 0 - 00 ???
negative	why not my entire cost ????
negative	this must be a basement operation .
negative	when i tried to cancel an order , by email with follow_up by phone they told me my order had already been dispatched .
negative	since the dispatch email was sent about 00_hours after my phone_call and 00_hours after my cancellation email , i do not believe it was not possible to cancel .
negative	the order was also very slow on delivery [ 00 days where the ads say 0 - 0 days ] so i do wonder whether was really dispatched when they claimed
negative	i received this e_- mail to review boo_hoo but have unfortunately still not received my order , it '_s been 00days already .
negative	please can you follow_up , otherwise just refund the order .
negative	client from france
negative	in brief , since the awful saga has dragged on for 0 months .....
negative	* end of march , called better_bathrooms about a suite which was on ' sale ' to enquier as to it '_s quality and genuine nature of price reduction .
negative	i was assured it was of good quality and that the offer was only until the end of march , so ordered then even_tho ' not quite ready for it .
negative	* purchased on 00th_march , 0 - 0 day delivery .
negative	had to make 0 phone_calls to chase it and didn_'_t even get confirmation until 0_weeks_later , product arrived a few_days after .
negative	* checked it for damage and to make_sure i was happy with the style .
negative	* day 0 of fitting bath cracked due to screws supplied being too long .
negative	took it on the chin , repaired it for £_00 because cost of plumber reinstalling would have been even higher .
negative	* second fix some days_later , became_apparent that pedestal / basin and cistern / pan were varying shades of white .
negative	cistern narrower than and offset on pan when attached , top of pedestal not level and needed wedging to be of any efficacy .
negative	* dozens of calls to better_bathrooms , no joy , plenty of fobbing off , and no callback from manager or supervisor when requested .
negative	have finally fitted a squiffy , nasty mess to my new bathroom because i cannot_afford to pay the plumber again and better_bathrooms won_'_t consider a refund .
negative	final fitting , the shower screen .
negative	simply isn_'_t as shown in the picture - measurements are correct , but not the one in the pic .
negative	well_done better_bathrooms for utterly screwing me over .
negative	thanks .
negative	i ordered the book 0_weeks_ago and still have not received it .
negative	all of the other books i ordered came we '_ve been one week except this one .
negative	it is being sent via_usps which does not take that long .
negative	i have a 0 week wait for this book and am therefore very disappointed .
negative	i was told that i would receive a certain price for the books that i sent .
negative	when the payment invoice came back to me cash0books indicated that they wouldn_'_t give me anything for one of the books because the " binding was loose ".
negative	i sell on amazon quite frequently and know the difference_between acceptable , good , great , and excellent books .
negative	this book was in great condition - and to my knowledge there was not any damage to the binding .
negative	i understand if cash0books feels otherwise but then i want an option to get my book back .
negative	if i was going to give it away for free then i would have donated it to charity !
negative	the service is at a all time low .
negative	i was there truck loaded .
negative	couldn_'_t get inside .
negative	after five phone_call attempts and sitting there for twenty_minutes i left .
negative	i went and rented at public_storage .
negative	they ' re affordable convenient and the customer_service is outstanding at the monterey park on poterro office
negative	nobody answers the phone ever .
negative	it is just a wrong way to run a business .
negative	i ordered a costume from amiclub on oct 00th .
negative	i had $_00 store credit from my last return .
negative	they told me that they would apply that towards my total and on top of that there was a 00_%_off special .
negative	well the store credit wasn_'_t applied and 00_% taken off because the credit_card i used was charged $_00 . 00 a day after purchase .
negative	00 / 00 i emailed asking if item was shipped out .
negative	i got an_email back stating that my item was on backorder and would be shipped out the 00st .
negative	i still had hopes of getting it by halloween .
negative	by 00 / 00 i never got a shipping number so i called and emailed with no help or response on what is going on with my order .
negative	why would they charge the credit_card if they didn_'_t even have my costume and never sent it back .
negative	to make_matters worse someone on the phone told me they would call back and never did .
negative	since i was charged over $_00 i didn_'_t have money to but another costume and i had a halloween_party to go to 00 / 00 .
negative	it seems to me as they could care less about their customers .
negative	yesterday was nov_00th just yesterday they have emailed me back saying " we appreciate your business .
negative	sorry to inform you that the costume order have been back ordered .
negative	there is no estimated time of arrival for the item .
negative	since the eta is unknown we are giving you a full_refund " i went on my account on their website and i see that it said shipped under order and i don_'_t see the money on my credit_card .
negative	ive read many complaints about this company .
negative	something needs to be done here .
negative	bs artists !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i don_'_t understand .
negative	i was so excited when i found letsunlockiphone0 .
negative	i just recieved my iphone 0 as a present , and decided to unlock it .
negative	i did this on friday of last_week .
negative	i received the email , just like it said i would , restating that i had just purchased the unlock .
negative	under the time estimate , it said it would take 0 - 0 days .
negative	it has_been 0 .
negative	i tried_calling at_least seven times , and it takes me to the same voice_message every time , saying no one is available .
negative	i left a message on the website , and left a comment as well .
negative	when none of those were responded to , i sent an_email , that was replied with a very generic response :
negative	dear consumer ,
negative	your order is in the pending status .
negative	we are doing our best to deliver it to you .
negative	this upsets me very much considering that they gave_me no time that the phone will be unlocked .
negative	i do not recommend using this site if you want your iphone unlocked any time soon .
negative	it is awful at keeping their word and at responding to your messages .
negative	i forgot my password and couldn_'_t get back in to my classes
negative	i would never reccommend you to anyone .
negative	wrong part sent twice and there seems to be no way to actually speak to a real_person .
negative	not satisfied at all .
negative	used phone service and was actually sworn at by an employee .
negative	sick of bad service 0 / 0_stars
negative	got the game 0 week late after complaining all week .
negative	they didnt respond at all and i kept saying please respond and finally they clapped my cheeks
negative	i recently had a problem with my kindle app for mac os x . i called customer_service to get help .
negative	the man '_s english was so poor that i had to repeat myself several_times for him to finally understand what i was talking_about .
negative	he then asked me to go to the amazon website and search for troubleshooting in the search all field at the top of the website .
negative	he didn_'_t even know how to navigate the website !
negative	i had to explain to him how to get to the help section for kindle on the amazon website .
negative	finally he put me on hold for several minutes .
negative	while on hold i googled solutions for my kindle app .
negative	i was able to solve the problem myself before he even came back to the call .
negative	this was terrible !
negative	i now wish all of my ebooks were not tied up with amazon .
negative	absolutly dreadfull service .
negative	the bed is damaged i want a refund
negative	we booked a hotel / flight and show in las_vegas through_expedia .
negative	prices seemed good , so we went with it .
negative	flight and hotel were fine , but when we went to redeem our vouchers for the show , they had no information on us , and no tickets .
negative	said i should have called to reserve a seat .
negative	nothing on the voucher from expedia said anything about calling ; it just said to go to the site to redeem them on the day of the show .
negative	0 miles of walking and 0 hours_later , we finally had our tickets , but only because good personnel at the mirage in las_vegas went_above and beyond to do this for us .
negative	i was still on hold with expedia -- it felt good to hang up on them for a change !
negative	i will not make that mistake again !
negative	well we booked our stay on priceline 0 month in advance and when we went to check in with our priceline receipt the front_desk said that he was going to have to call priceline since they did not send their " virtual credit_card " over .
negative	and he also mentioned that this happens frequently with priceline .
negative	so that made us wait in the lobby for 00_minutes until it got figures out .
negative	and the front_desk agent also stated that we over paid he showed us that if we would have booked through the hotel direct it would had been $_000 and not $_000 .
negative	total_rip_off and inconvenience , will not be using priceline again .
negative	i ordered a metaltex 0 - in - 0 multi - purpose grater and slicer from the kript ( was £_00 . 00 ) for £ 0 . 00 plus postage early may and the item has yet to arrive .
negative	when i have emailed to request an eta for delivery , the email address on the wowcher does not work .
negative	every other wowcher has_been as expected arrived in good time and what i paid for .
negative	we paid for a king suite with jacuzzi .
negative	arrived and the clerk tried to make us pay again . we had prepaid .
negative	the charges she rang up were $_00 less_than what we paid when asked about this she said she didn_'_t know but we would have to contact expedia to get any refund but that was the rate they always charged .
negative	i attempted to call numerous_times never got anyone to pick_up the phone .
negative	the vice prompts would say hold please then ring busy .
negative	frustrated we decided to run the tub .
negative	the jacuzzi didn_'_t work .
negative	.
negative	when we asked the desk they said no it doesn_'_t work that we should have been told at check in but that wasn_'_t possible to change rooms and they couldn_'_t refund money .
negative	they would only charge expedia the rate they showed us we would have to get them to refund the difference .
negative	.
negative	long_story short terrible service had we just dealt directly with the hotel instead of expedia we would have saved money and hassle .
negative	will never never never use this site again .
negative	!
negative	amiclubwear has good , cute_clothes but they ' re clothes are a bit too pricey .
negative	not only that , their size small ( and i '_m a size small ) is too big for me .
negative	the return_policy should change too .
negative	instead of in store credit when u return items , they should just give u a full_refund .
negative	also i used to be able to order online and pick my order ( s ) up at their actual store and return items there that way also .
negative	i think they should still do that .
negative	also they need a better customer_service .
negative	i was charged by reservation_counter for my stay at the ramada and i was charged by the hotel itself for my stay .
negative	for someone_who has very limited funds and now will be incurring nsf fees until this matter is resolved , i am in a compromising and displeasing situation thanks to reservation_counter and the ramada_inn
negative	do not order from here very slow , bad service .
negative	i ordered a battery from n0 .
negative	i waited and waited .
negative	when i checked back , i saw that the order had been cancelled three_days after i made it and my money was refunded to my account .
negative	i thought , maybe it didn_'_t like using a debit_card , so i reordered using my discover card .
negative	again i waited and waited .
negative	i checked back again and found that again my order had been cancelled and my credit_card was debited .
negative	neither time did i receive any notification that my order was cancelled .
negative	a simple email would suffice .
negative	now it '_s 0_weeks_later and i just ordered from a different company and it was shipped within the day .
negative	don_'_t think i '_ll try n0 again .
negative	i was given imagine park as the cheapest n i booked with them .
negative	dropping_off the car and transfer ok .
negative	transfer , i am_disabled and the bus has not got steps .
negative	i could not get in so a 0 step was provided .
negative	return - bus arrived could not get in , no 0 step , so managed to get in passenger seat .
negative	man giving keys back was preoccupied doing paperwork .
negative	my car was outside reversed up to wall , could not access boot to put cases in .
negative	parked so close to other vehicles struggled to get in .
negative	flat tyre .
negative	not happy and will not use imagine again
negative	i was misled to believe that i was speaking to the front_desk of the courtyard by marriott in norman , ok .
negative	as a result , i paid $_00 more per_night .
negative	my fault for trusting the person_who answered the phone , " front_desk .
negative	may i help you ."
negative	**** it won_'_t happen again !!
negative	!
negative	should offer refunds to company '_s purchasing tickets for employees ...
negative	i needed to know if i was insured and eheath didn_'_t help .
negative	i called the actual insurance company ( with the number that ehealth gave_me ) and i was on hold and transferred so much .
negative	i spent half a day on hold and talking to different people .
negative	they said that they had no record of me from ehealth .
negative	should have gone straight to insurance company .
negative	i thought i was contacting quality inn directly .
negative	in fact , i hope the conversation was recorded , because i asked several_times if this was quality inn direct , and each time the foreign speaking agent replied " yes , this is quality inn charleston direct line ".
negative	when i arrived , they said they had no reservation for me and that they were booked .
negative	after showing my confirmation to them , they said that i did not contact the hotel direct and apologized .
negative	then after_reviewing my confirmation several_times , the hotel realized that the agent had in fact made the reservation by duplicating my first name twice .
negative	more than stupid .
negative	don_'_t know how i came upon this website , but all need to use with caution .
negative	was so bad over booked .
negative	sent some wear every bad .
negative	phone , hair_dryer , clock , air , did not work .
negative	very very verybad .
negative	very bad i do not recommend shopping to anyone even after i receive compliments on cloths i purchased from there because of the poor customer_service i tell people i don_'_t know where i got it from i refuse to send business to a place that doesn_'_t appreciate my business ...
negative	i '_m still_awaiting a refund and a 00_dollar e_- gift_card .... called in today and was hung_up on smh
negative	i have never_experienced such poor customer_service skills in all my life .
negative	when calling about an_issue with my card ( as instructed by a member of staff at victoria_plumb ), another member of the customer_service team was unable to deal with my issue as she was incompetent and obviously poorly trained .
negative	she resulted in actually shouting at me , which really took me by surprise .
negative	i have never been spoken to so rudely in my life , let_alone by an employee of a company that i was about to spend £ 0000 with .
negative	when asked if i could speak to her manager , she told me ' no !'
negative	and slammed the phone down on me .
negative	i rang back only to speak to her colleague who had about as many brain cells as the first girl and was obviously trained at the same school for complete donkeys .
negative	in fact , i probably would have recieved better service from a donkey than i received from these two utter eejits .
negative	the third girl was marginally more helpful in that she took my details and would have a manager call me so i could lodge my complaint .
negative	i cancelled my order at this point as i was not willing to spend a large amount of money with a company who treated their customers so disgustingly .
negative	she assured_me i would receive a full_refund back onto my card ( of which the payment was not even supposed to have been taken anyway - hence the problem we had in the first place ).
negative	unsurprisingly , a manager never did call me back and the amount of £ 0000 was taken from my card .
negative	so_far , victoria_plumb had got absolutely nothing right but by this point , i expected nothing less .
negative	the whole_experience completely stressed me out and i couldn_'_t bear to be faced with another victoria_plumb representative so my husband agreed to call to sort out the payment issue .
negative	when ringing to explain that a payment had been taken on our card but the order was cancelled and a full_refund was needed asap , he was dealt_with by another member of the team with the same level of people skills than the previous lot .
negative	all in all , this was a horrendous experience that i do not intend to repeat .
negative	therefore , i would categorically never use victoria_plumb or recommend this company to anybody else .
negative	i have never encountered such rude and poorly trained staff in all my life .
negative	this website had a 00_%_off sale and i bought something very expensive thinking i ' d get the 00_%_off .
negative	not once when i was checking out did it have me put in the code and i was charged full price .
negative	i contacted the store but my call was never returned and i called multiple
negative	times .
negative	never buying from this site again .
negative	we rate you poorly because we have bought several parts from you guys and 00_% of the parts were the wrong ones . we bought driver and front passenger_side window_regulators and they were the wrong ones and now you guys will not take them back , so we have parts worth money that we spent for nothing and could have spent on the right parts just sitting around because we cannot use them .
negative	they do not fit our 00 000i bmw and you stated they would .
negative	it would not had been so bad if you guys would have atleast gave_us our money back , but you wouldn_'_t .
negative	when i received my order in the mail , the glass bottle was broken and empty !
negative	there were no peanuts or bubble_wrap inside the package to keep the product safe .
negative	when i called the company they were closed and i left a message , with no return call 0 days_later !
negative	!
negative	i am absolutely gutted .
negative	i paid for an express delivery , it '_s been a week now and i have not received my item .
negative	i have emailed the gadgetgrotto team 0 times - no reply .
negative	i feel_like i have been scammed .
negative	very disappointing customer_service .
negative	i had been looking for an online store to buy my lifeguard suit from for a while .
negative	i finally_settled for metroswimshop .
negative	i wish i had not .
negative	after ordering my swimsuit , i received a order confirmation e_- mail .
negative	i used this e_- mail in order to get the tracking_number since it was imperative to know when my package arrived for my job .
negative	the tracking_number was wrong !
negative	it told me that my package had been delivered to another_state months_ago .
negative	i had contacted the company through e_- mail to see if this could be fixed .
negative	i was given the same wrong tracking_number .
negative	i also called customer_service .
negative	i waited over 0 hour and 00_minutes to get someone to talk to me .
negative	the customer_service rep was no help whatsoever .
negative	another e_- mail i received finally explained to me that i was getting my swimsuit from the manufacturer .
negative	this response 0 days after my initial e_- mail .
negative	up to this day , i have no_idea where my swimsuit is .
negative	this type of service is unacceptable !
negative	i could get fired if my swimsuit does not arrive soon .
negative	it would be appreciated if the company actually kept me in the loop about my order .
negative	i will not be ordering from this company ever again .
negative	customer_service here is unacceptable .
negative	horriable experience please do not ever order parts from parts_geeks
negative	i had sent my samsung_galaxy ace to envirofone and then was told it was all up to standard but would have to wait a week for the cheque to be dispatched .
negative	i found this strange as i '_ve used mazuma before for a previous phone and as soon as they clear everything is fine with your phone they dispatch the cheque and i received that within a couple of days .
negative	i waited and then received an_email to say it had been dispatched 0st_class .
negative	after 0 days and no cheque i emailed and stated the problem i just got told wait 0 - 0 days .
negative	i didn_'_t find this reassuring at all , i would have liked to know if it didn_'_t arrive they would rearrange the payment or at_least check with me if it had arrived .
negative	that would have been good service !
negative	it never arrived not that i was surprised .
negative	so have again issued an_email_stating this and my displeasure at the service .
negative	i am aware it could have just got lost in the mail so not the companies fault in that respect but i think with both the delay in issuing the cheque in the first instance and the non bothered response to my first email i would never recommend envirofone .
negative	most people who are having to sell old_phones or other items actually require the money in my case i did wish to receive it quite quickly .
negative	they didn_'_t seem to care about delays or problems as they already have your item so it just felt_like well we are alright jack kind of attitude !
negative	i had a really bad_experience with this company .
negative	when i met with the owner to look at a couch and mattress set he was very professional and answered all my questions .
negative	i didn_'_t purchase that day because i wanted to be sure that was the furniture i wanted .
negative	when i went back two_weeks_later the owner was not there so another individual helped_me .
negative	while trying to talk business the individual kept flirting with me making comments like " want to know how i knew you weren_'_t white ?
negative	because of your lips ".
negative	i felt very uncomfortable because my fiance was with me .
negative	he kept saying i was " cute " and " adorable " all while i was trying to change the subject to the task at hand .
negative	i managed to purchase the couch but did not pick it up .
negative	i was scheduled to pick it up the next week .
negative	the day of pick_up i called to make_sure the couch had been stain treated .
negative	on the phone the employee told me that they sold me a couch that had been sold to someone_else .
negative	he proceeded to ask me what was the color of the couch in which i described it to him .
negative	he told me he was confused and actually had the couch i wanted .
negative	when i went to pick_up the couch he pointed_out the couch to me .
negative	it was not the couch i purchased .
negative	i showed him the couch i purchased .
negative	he went to go look in the inventory and did not find the couch .
negative	i was moving that day and he informed me it could be a month before i could get the couch i paid for .
negative	i settled for the same couch in a different color .
negative	all the while no one apologized for the inconvenience or selling the wrong couch .
negative	i was disappointed since the cups are expensive .
negative	i expected the coffee to be more full bodied .
negative	booked an airport transfer with this company .
negative	called them the day before leaving to confirm the pickup time , the employee told me it was her day off , i should not have called this number ( which i revived from viator on my arrival / pick_up ) and then hung_up the phone on me in mid sentence when trying to ask what number i do call to confirm pick_up time .
negative	regardless i will never use this company again .
negative	who needs such disrespect esp .
negative	when i am paying customer !!!
negative	!
negative	i sold an ipod on ebay and the buyer was happy .
negative	they gave_me a good positive rating and in that time i earned my blue start from ebay .
negative	well apparently having a good rating does not matter to ebay , since even if you have a good ratings and your costumers like you , you still have to wait 00days before getting the money that is rightfully yours .
negative	it is sad since i sold two things on amazon during the ebay 00 days period .
negative	i received the money from amazon one week before my funds were even released .
negative	i know this is for buyer protection but using a guilty until proven innocent policy as well as treating every seller like they are thieves is ridiculous .
negative	i ordered 0 ub00 tickets at the cost of £_000 00p .
negative	all was well , they arrived in good time .
negative	then i received an e . mail from seetickets ( note ... a non reply e . mail .... try e . mailing them , you can '_t ) saying the tour had been cancelled and to get a " face value " refund , i had to send the tickets back ... fair enough ... but they would recommend a recorded delivery , as no return tickets .. no refund .
negative	i did this at the cost of £ 0 . 00p
negative	i then had another none reply e . mail saying my credit_card had expired since ordering the tickets , could i phone them ... more expense !!!!
negative	i was told my total refund was £_00 ?????
negative	where had the other £_00 gone ?
negative	and don_'_t ever bother to take a refund protection insurance out , as it only covers illness or death at your end apparently !!
negative	also my registered postage would not be refunded !!!!
negative	so i '_m £_00 out of pocket at_least .
negative	i '_ve learned a very valuable lesson from this , to do research and read_reviews before dealing_with these_types of people ... so be warned .
negative	a very disillusioned sue d
negative	ordered a x0 mobile_phones thinking they were £_00 . 00 each before realising it was for a contract mobile .
negative	changed my mind but they still took money out of my bank even_though i '_ve not clicked to claim my wow her .
negative	nightmare to get a refund
negative	misleading , poor ethics , gives out personal info so readily
negative	i ordered my shelf for my fridge on oct 00th and it has not arrived yet .
negative	can someone please help me and tell me where it is ?
negative	awful , reserved tickets , when i went to buy them less_than 00_hours_later i was charged $_000 more .
negative	called , wrote letters and was told too bad .
negative	nice .
negative	will never use travelocity again .
negative	the products i ordered were sample size and not a sample price .
negative	would not order from them again .
negative	booked a hotel on bookit . com , and 0 minutes later found a better price on the actual hotel site .
negative	called the site and asked to match the rate per their policy , was put on a 00_min hold , then was told that they don_'_t match the actual hotel site , just competitor '_s .
negative	and i had to pay $_00 cancellation_fee if i wanted to cancel , even_though it was literally 0 minutes after booking and 0_weeks in advance .
negative	found a better price on a competitor '_s site , called back , was put on a 00_min hold !
negative	lady came back and said she had issues with the competitor '_s site and couldn_'_t see the price ( even_though i could easily pull it on my pc and iphone ), went on another 00_min hold and then was disconnected .
negative	such a scam , never using this site again !
negative	did you really take money and not send
negative	contacts ?
negative	i had a problem with my account and paypal not updating my bank information .
negative	i called customer_service and the guy was very ignorant and rude to me .
negative	i tried explaining to him that the information was not correct and the computer locked me out as not to update my information .
negative	he could care less and kept insisting that the information was correct .
negative	wish there was another company that ebay would use instead of paypal , they ' re terrible !
negative	!
negative	i ordered a winter pool_cover you said it would be here in 0 days it has_been sitting in new stanton since november 00 and had not moved apparently because the delivery date you gave them was november 00 its snowing here today hope you got your jollys screwing me around i also hope the money was enough because i think your promise is not worth a nickle and i will never order another thing from you again , why is the cover still in new stanton when it could have been delivered the 00 or 00 today by the time i get it im sure my pool will be in real good shape thanks for nothing .
negative	my order was cancelled with absolutely no notice or email regarding it !
negative	on hold 00_mins to be transferred to customer_service where i was on hold for over 00_mins_before i hung_up and called first number back .
negative	all this to find out that because my flight eas booked " non_- refundabble " it would cost me more to change my return trip than to buy new ticket !
negative	couldn_'_t they have told me that when i called the first time !!!
negative	!
negative	after being informed about a later backorder date , i cancelled my order , and this cancellation was confirmed via_email .
negative	while on vacation i noticed that ( approximately 0_weeks_later ) my credit_card had been charged the amount of the order .
negative	having no records with me , i was forced to wait_until returning home to deal with issue .
negative	after leaving call and email , i did receive apologetic voicemail from the contact person that she had failed to actually cancel the order .
negative	since it had been shipped , i would need to send it back unopened for credit ( over $_000 !)
negative	to be issued to my account -- meanwhile interest accrues .
negative	we will see how the rest unfolds -- so_far not positive_experience !
negative	the puzzle i bought was defective .
negative	i had to send it and pay the shipping_costs .
negative	recognize that it is defective , but neither me nor returned the money they give me the option to change it to something to my liking .
negative	when i decided to change it for something_else ( not to lose money , not because i really liked the other product ), i charge the price difference , and several weeks_later they say they do not have it in stock .
negative	i '_m bored already send emails and call them , i '_ve definitely lost more than 00 € purchase online on this page .
negative	i reserved this space in advance of taking off work and driving 00_hours to alabama in hopes of being totally prepared to get alot done in a small_amount of time .
negative	we wasted over an_hour trying to find the place and stopped and asked 0 different businesses .
negative	i called the number which had been texted to me and no - one ever answered and the voice_mail was full .
negative	what a horrible experience !!!!!!
negative	i will never use this service again .
negative	i find it hard to believe that in such a large college town anyone would do_business this way !
negative	i ordered some clothes from this company first and returned it all because of the poor quality .
negative	they would not give me a refund so i had to take store credit .
negative	i exchanged them for some shoes - shoes were horribly made !!!
negative	i returned them again and tried some other stuff with same results .
negative	with all the money on shipping i have spent sending things back i could have bought 000 . 00 worth of stuff !
negative	terrible customer_service !!
negative	you can '_t get them on the phone !
negative	!
negative	my husband and i travel together for business 000 days a year .. due to our budget we always look for value .
negative	we often use name you own price to find an affordable room .
negative	on most occasions we are given the worst room in the hotel .
negative	most times we are put in the worst location , and in handicapped rooms .
negative	the last room we checked into the room was just awful !
negative	broken furniture and just terrible , we i complained and asked to be put in non_- handicapped_room , the clerk said that is what price line requested and they could not change it ... after calling priceline to complain , they told me it was up to the hotel which room to put us in .
negative	i then went back to the . front_desk told them what priceline said , she then printed and invoice and gave it to me , it was from priceline , ordering a handicapped_room , no substitutions without their approval .
negative	they flat out lied to me ....
negative	the person i spoke to booked us into a room that did not have a kitchen and did not allow a dog and those were the very things that i had asked for .
negative	the rates quoted were incorrect as well .
negative	if i had not followed_up with a phone_call to the inn , the trip would have been a disaster .
negative	i have sent the below email numerous_times with no response .
negative	i have called the customer_service 000 number and have been unable to get through :
negative	on march_00th , my husband & i were on a southwest airlines flight to tampa which was delayed for several hours due to bad_weather in tampa .
negative	once we got to the
negative	airport , we were again delayed getting our_luggage and rental_car .
negative	since it was getting dark , we made the decision to stay in tampa rather_than drive in the dark to our final_destination as we are in our 00 ’_s and have no night vision .
negative	still at the totally chaotic tampa airport , i called reservationscounter . com to find a hotel near the airport .
negative	a representative found a vacancy at extended america near the airport .
negative	i booked it through my credit_card .
negative	however , i couldn_'_t get on the internet and had failed to write down the hotel address .
negative	so , i called again and gave
negative	reservationcounter . com my confirmation number to get the address .
negative	i was given the address for extended america at beaumont ctr blvd .
negative	when we got to that hotel , they did not have our reservation .
negative	confused and tired , we decided to stay there and assumed reservationscounter . com had made a mistake .
negative	today i see on my credit_card i was charged for extended american located at n . west shore blvd .
negative	wanted special gift_card for my son '_s christmas day birthday .
negative	pancake pantry , gatlinburg , his_favorite place !
negative	waited and waited for card .
negative	finally arrived and seems to be generic , plus note on card about possibility of adding 00_%.
negative	will not buy from this website again .
negative	i was very upset when i got my dress there was 0 wholes in my dress n that was very upsetting cause i was anxious to get it than it was my birthday dress :( tried_calling the 0000 number no answer { i will never order from here again }
negative	i got an_email that said my order was to be sent out on feb_00th .
negative	today is feb_00th .
negative	i haven_'_t gotten it yet .
negative	i have emailed 0 times in a week to cancel my wowcher for melovesushi because i had taken up the offer before and didn_'_t realise i couldn_'_t do it again .
negative	i have 0 automated replies to say we will get back to you --- nobody has !!!
negative	so yes , my experience has_been dreadful , this has also happened in the past , so i don_'_t think i will be booking through wowcher any time soon .
negative	can somebody please please let_me know that my voucher has_been cancelled and my £ 0 refunded - this is taking so long to rectify !!!
negative	!
negative	priceline is the worst if you are going to book using a third_party please pick a good and reliable company like expedia for example and you won_'_t have to deal with this people .
negative	i booked a hotel using priceline just to save a few_bucks over expedia , thinking i would have the same experience .... big mistake ... i spend over $ 0000 on my booking to cancun , to get there i had a connection flight and unfortunately my first flight got delayed and i missed my connection and since it was the last flight of the day i had to be rebooked for the next_day .
negative	i have traveled all over the world and things like this happen that '_s just a fact of life , so i called priceline to see if they could call the hotel and advised them of my predicament , and to let them know that i would get there the next_day and to either help me extend my stay for one day since i was getting there a day after or just refund one night_stay , obviously customer_service is not a priority to this company , first the girl kept saying no you have to call the hotel_directly and see what they can do , lady if i wanted to deal directly with the hotel i would have made my reservation directly with them i '_m in the us and i don_'_t have an international plan please help me , and all she kept saying was no , i cannot do that , it was so ridiculous .
negative	them she said oh but if you don_'_t get there tonight the hotel will charge you for the first night as a fee for being a no show , so i said great so then i will be refunded the remaining balance right ... she said no there '_s no refunds on your booking , so them i said ok so can you guarantee me that i will be able to checkin when i arrive at the hotel tomorrow for my remaining nights , again , she said no i cannot guarantee that .
negative	unbelievable .
negative	i said , so to make_sure i get this right , you are saying that you took my $ 0000 and you cannot call them to help me , you cannot change my reservation for the next_day , you cannot guarantee that when i arrive i will get a room at the hotel since my reservation will cancel since i won_'_t arrive today and you cannot refund my money ?
negative	wow ..
negative	i had a similar situation with expedia and the experience was the complete opposite , they showed they care , they call the hotel for me and everything was worked out in a fair way .... how was this fair priceline ????
negative	that '_s my question .
negative	in conclusion i had to buy a international_calling card call the hotel on my own and the hotel was great about it they help me with my reservation .... i will never book with priceline ever again ... lesson_learned .
negative	from now on i will only book directly with the hotel or with expedia or similar companies that are there for their customer that truly care about providing you a great vacation .
negative	priceline never again ... and i will tell my story to everyone i can to try and make_sure you don_'_t ruin anyone '_s vacation again .
negative	shame on you !!!

negative	i recently made 0 separate hotel reservations on travelocity .
negative	one i did not receive a confirmation for .
negative	when i contacted travelocity they could not find the reservation on their system .
negative	i was told they recently_moved to a new system and i would be transferred to someone that could access the new system to find my reservation .
negative	i was transferred to 0 people who said the same thing .
negative	it could not be found on travelocity '_s system .
negative	yet when i called the hotel_directly they had the reservation .
negative	one reservation i did receive a confirmation for , yet could not bring in up online .
negative	i called and they could not find it on their system and told me it did not exist .
negative	the third reservation i did receive a confirmation and it was retrievable on my account online yet it did not show up on their system when i called .
negative	one of the reservations i made said that it could be cancelled within 00_hours on the description .
negative	after making the reservation i was immediately billed for it and the confirmation i received said non_refundable .
negative	it seems they have had much difficulty with a change in their computer systems .
negative	it caused much frustration on my end .
negative	i use expedia or other_sources in the future .
negative	i am still_waiting for my purchase and have not received an answer or any correspondence other than we will get back to you as soon as possible ... when next year ?
negative	i would like my money back or at_least receive my product .
negative	i have had to cancel 0 installation appointments .
negative	if i would have known how unresponsive and inefficient this company was , i would have gladly ordered elsewhere ... which i can '_t until i get my money back !
negative	i am still_waiting !
negative	i made my reservation for the wrong date and called the service center from the hotel to change .
negative	i was placed on hold 0 or 0 times .
negative	i was told they would cancel my reservation on 0 / 0 and rebook on 0 / 0 .
negative	the agent told me i would be refunded 00 . 00 .
negative	i told him i paid 000 . 00 and it was not acceptable .
negative	the hotel agent talked with someone from your service and told them that they did not charge service fees for cancellations .
negative	after much run_around , i told the agent to cancel my reservation all together and i would work directly with the hotel .
negative	it was cancelled , but i was only refunded 000 . 00 .
negative	the hotel only charged me 00 . 00 .
negative	what a horrible experience .
negative	i will never book online again .
negative	not a trustworthy vendor .
negative	although i was happy with the product , the service was unacceptable .
negative	i heard_nothing but good reviews about framesdirect and i was excited about my order .
negative	however the service i received was not what i expected .
negative	findmypast used to be the best search_engine , and i recommended it to many people .
negative	no_longer , their new site is totally user un - friendly and the arrogant responses they have given to all the thousands of people who '_ve complained on facebook and many other_sites have to be read to be believed .
negative	as soon as my subscription ends , that is it .
negative	just one of the many thousands who will not be renewing their subscription .

negative	i ordered a shimano ultegra chainset , which was a very decent price and so i was very happy when it arrived .
negative	i was due to go on a cycling holiday in france and desperately_needed a new chainset .
negative	however , once i had unpacked it i found that there was no cap to the left crank .
negative	i emailed merlin but never got a response so i decided to phone despite living in sweden and having to pay stupid money to make phone_calls to the uk .
negative	i tried_calling the moment that the line was supposed to be open but nobody answered .
negative	i must have tried another 0 or 0 times in the space of the following hour and still could only get through to an_automated_message telling_me that no one was available to answer my call .
negative	i finally managed to get through and i explained the problem to the customer_service employee .
negative	i was told to check the package again , and without an_apology i was told that the part would be posted to me as soon as possible .
negative	i pointed_out that i was going on holiday in two_days and i was assured that the part should arrive even_though i live in sweden , but the employee said that the standard postage should be sufficient .
negative	it may have been a good idea to have sent it by special delivery but this was not even suggested .
negative	i decided i couldn_'_t wait for a part that was not going to arrive on time and so made numerous enquiries with shops in and around stockholm to find out if anyone happened to have this part and luckily my local bike shop had one in their workshop , which i purchased from them later that day and fitted .
negative	the part that merlin posted didn_'_t arrive before my holiday and didn_'_t even arrive until over a week after it had been sent despite what i was told by customer_services .
negative	i have since sent an_email to merlin asking if they could compensate me for having to buy a part that should have been included in the chainset that was sent to me but i have not had a response .
negative	they seem quite happy to take your money but as soon as there '_s a problem i got the impression that they couldn_'_t really care less and not once offer am apology for what in truth was a pretty schoolboy error on their part .
negative	this retailer , opticsfast , a ) sent me the wrong glasses b ) misinformed me about the return_policy and c ) has sent me a bunch of borderline abusive emails about the issue when i brought her behavior to the attention of my credit_card company , the better business_bureau and the nyc consumer affairs agency .
negative	as background , i was looking for a pair of very limited_edition frames that i could not find in stores or online .
negative	i had tried three other_vendors , and they were out of stock .
negative	i saw that opticsfast had a lot of d & g frames on their amazon seller account and called them to see if they had the ones i wanted in stock .
negative	bad decision .
negative	the person i talked to on the phone said they had the glasses i wanted ( frames were red with leopard print on the side , dolce & gabbana brand .)
negative	it was my first pair of glasses ever , with a limited_edition set of frames , so i asked if i could return it if it didn_'_t work out .
negative	the person i talked to said i could return it if i was unhappy , no problem .
negative	i get the glasses and they are the wrong frames .
negative	not really red , but a brownish red color with a weird design on the side .
negative	they were not at all the frames i wanted and ordered , and was assured i was getting .
negative	i immediately emailed the merchant to tell them i received the wrong frames and was told that i could not return them with negative and sarcastic language .
negative	i called and spoke to the same representative i had originally spoken to , who told me she was sure it was a misunderstanding and that they would be able to handle my return .
negative	this did not happen .
negative	i have now been through two_weeks of abusive emails from this merchant , threats of litigation from her -- despite the fact that she has taken $_000 of my money and sent me bad merchandise !
negative	-- and her general refusal to accept the wrong glasses back .
negative	i would never order from this place again and warn other customers against doing so , based on my experience .
negative	i have sent complaints to my credit_card company , to the better business_bureau and to the nyc dept of consumer affairs regarding this incident .
negative	be warned .
negative	i knew it was to good to be true .
negative	.
negative	i ordered dymatize nutrition elite whey_protein isolate variety juicers 00_lbs which i normally order from allstarhealth . com because they only charge 0 . 00 shipping .
negative	i figured i would save a few_bucks and try the supplementwarehouse .
negative	they wanted to charge me 00 . 00 + in shipping plus 00 . 00 for the product whch is normally 00 . 00 .
negative	total order was 00 . 00 + for which i normally only pay $_00 ....
negative	it was a waste of time but i might as well warn you , dont be_fooled by their price matching and shipping fees .
negative	i don_'_t intend to buy anything_else from easy comfort ..
negative	i told them my sister was having double heart bypass and we needed the walker as soon as possible ....
negative	forget that ..
negative	they ignored the request ..
negative	unfortunately my experience has_been far from positive .
negative	i ordered skylanders before christmas , and was sent the wrong product .
negative	i returned the product as directed and did not recieve a reply .
negative	after emailing the company it was eventually discovered that my order had been misplaced within their returns department stating ' there was no details attatched ' however a letter was included by me with all my references and contact details secured within the box .
negative	it took until the end of january for me to recieve my full_refund .
negative	i emailed over 00 times to rectify this problem and asked to make a formal_complaint 0 times before it was granted .
negative	i have now made a formal_complaint and am still_awaiting a response .
negative	i would not recommend this company for someone_else to use .
negative	well what can i say the show was brilliant and well_worth going to watch we took out 0 granddaughter '_s ages 0 and 00 got a bit loud for the 0 year_old but she_loves them so much she put up with it the downside was what we got conned for the price of the tickets .
negative	on the front of the tickets was the price of £_00 . 00 but we were charged £_000 . 00 each which i thought was the price until the tickets came in so i am very disappointed in the site for not pointing_out that this was the price put by unscrupulous people who at the end of the day just wanted to make money from normal fans who wanted to see jls .
negative	but i will not be caught again i am 00 and still can be caught out so just be aware when you book your tickets you are not getting charged for someone '_s greed
negative	this was not a good experience .
negative	when i reviewed the e_- mail i was aware that all the relevent info was on it however there must be an_issue with their softwear as when it printed the contact phone_number for the chauffer was ommitted , something i didn_'_t notice until the day of my travel .
negative	i called the office of stressless parking which was in office hours however it was on voicemail .
negative	i left 0 very stressed messages on thier voicemail asking for a return call but no one called me back .
negative	to resolve the issue i had to call my husband in canada to access my e_- mail account and retrieve the phone_number .
negative	i still_haven_'_t heard from the office at stressfree_parking which i think is appalling .
negative	the 0rd_party supplier who collected the car was efficient and can be recommended .
negative	paypal sstates i exceeded my spending limit ( 0 , 000 ) and will not let_me reactivate with sam bank information .
negative	the site keeps asking for a different account and debit_card info .
negative	i refuse to mess around with this .
negative	i have always been an excellent customer both buying and selling .
negative	i do not understand_why my account can not be reactivated witht he same account info ihave been using for years and years
negative	i placed my order 0 - 00 - 0000 and today ( 0 - 00 - 0000 ) my order is still processing .
negative	granite , the 00th was a holiday , so i callled customer_service on the 00th to be sure my order was ok and they assured_me i should have a tracking_number by friday ( yesterday ).. the bad thing is they are not open sat and sunday so hopefully my order will be ready by mon ( 0 - 00 - 00 ) because i still have 0 - 0 days to wait for shipping and handling .
negative	.
negative	i dont understand_why the money has_been taken from my account , yet i never got confirmation or a tracking_number ... i never even got an_email or call of any payment problems ... i '_ll continue to wait because like others have stated , customer_service is not so friendly .
negative	hopefully my items are still in stock .

negative	after using your service for many trips i was kept waiting for 00_minutes with 0 small_children in a busy car_park terrible !!
negative	!
negative	bought two black printer_cartridges with one thrown in for free .
negative	description was not obvious that they were copies .
negative	have tried to install 0 of the 0 cartidges and neither of them work .
negative	will probably throw the other one in the bin and put it down to a lesson_learnt .
negative	buy cheap buy twice .
negative	you sent me the wrong glasses both_times i ordered them .
negative	second time i placed a stop payment of the charge slip .
negative	i even faxed a copy of my prescription and called to verify that i would get the correct glasses .
negative	terrible customer_service could not answer questions sent me an_email_saying they would make me a new pair for x dollar_amount ..
negative	this was their mistake not mind .
negative	i sent the glasses back us postage the same way they were shipped to me .
negative	i asked to get emailed from a manager and never received such email .
negative	if the glasses were not ordered correctly that should have been corrected when i sent the prescription and spoke to the agent .
negative	that would have been the correct time for a correct time for an adjust in cost or what ever should have been done at that time .
negative	i have told everyone i know not to order from your company twice is enough your not that cheap and you have no ideal what your doing .
negative	so i did spread the word ..... still_waiting for that response .
negative	last_week i bought a bunch of cosmetics at macys , like estee lauder creams etc .
negative	they are expensive , you know but when the time of pay came i was charged with $ 0 . 00 for the paper bag !!
negative	they say is the city of san_jose policy .
negative	wow they cannot absorb 00_cents !!
negative	poor macy '_s !
negative	!
negative	as i was at the valley fair mall , i went to the godiva store andi bought some chocolates .
negative	my tab there was $_00 . 00 and i have free_samples and i was not charged for the bag .
negative	too bad macy '_s .
negative	i made my initial order from petflow on a friday and was told that i would be getting my supplies the following_tuesday .
negative	this never happened since after checking with fedex ( who said they never received my package ) and then checking with peflow ( who said fedex lost my package ) i was disgusted and cancelled my order . i thought that ordering thru the internet would be fast and easy but this turned_out not to be true ( especially from petflow ).
negative	i have ordered thru internet from other_companies and did not have any_problems .
negative	parts came in on time , but i received the wrong starter .
negative	i ordered a manual , and instead an automatic starter showed_up .
negative	i had to then order it through my mechanic which cost be $_00 more .

negative	i used to buy nespresso capsules for a couple of years , i really like it but the price is very high .
negative	i decided to try another brand but i am really disappointed , the coffee has no taste , and is not easy to make with the machine ( need to press a couple times whereas with nespresso there was no issue )
negative	in today '_s world it should never take 0 months to have an order shipped .. not even an explanation as to why it would take so long to get an order .
negative	i would never use this site again as i made my first order in march_0000 and was immediately informed it would be shipped on june 00 , 0000 .
negative	i wasn_'_t expecting a small sticker for 0 dollars !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	customer_service was terrible and totally_unprofessional .
negative	they representative who spoke to regarding our problem and to set_up appointments , was unprofessional and she constantly made untrue statements .
negative	if my product was not under_warranty after the first contact with them i would never had used them again but this is the outfit that frigidaire gave_us .
negative	i would never recommend them to anybody and if i was the owner i would fire the phone reps .
negative	i ordered 00 botlles of aftershave .
negative	several bottles leaked in transit due to loose screw tops .
negative	i called fe and they agreed to refund value of three bottles .
negative	luckily i used paypal .
negative	i had to file a claim 00 days_later after major runaround .
negative	they had no_intention of refunding .
negative	i should have known better ... they answer their 000 number with " hello ", not " fragrance express , can i help you ?".
negative	the people who answer their 000 number sound like they are expecting the irs to be calling .
negative	never again .
negative	worst_experience just trying to do something nice for someone .
negative	ordered flowers for my sister from this ( guaranteed on time deliver ) company and she still has not received her flowers .
negative	after trying for hours to contact the company they tell me they would be delivered within the hour and the only delay was that they didn_'_t have those flowers .
negative	why didn_'_t they call me with the number i provided to work out other arrangements .
negative	instead they just didn_'_t even deliver them .
negative	they never made it .
negative	now they are saying they will fedex them tomorrow or the next_day .
negative	i can '_t say i believe them .
negative	do not do_business with these crooks !!
negative	my order number was 00000 and was placed on 0 / 0 / 00 .
negative	the item i purchased was falsely advertised on the website !
negative	i bought an antler which said it was a " large " antler for about $_00 .
negative	when i received it the packaging said large ; however , the antler was only two inches long .
negative	i am extremely disappointed in what i received .
negative	i have purchased similar items from other_sources for the same price which were much much larger ( 0 - 0 inches ).
negative	if given the opportunity , i would like to receive a refund .
negative	priceline lies about the star_rating of hotels .
negative	they tell you a hotel is 0_stars and give you examples of similar 0_star hotels .
negative	when you get the ' deal ' you often find that hotel is a full star lower or worse than you anticipated and it is not comparable to the hotel examples and it certainly is not any of the example hotels .
negative	other_sites will rate the hotel at the lower star_rating and none will give it the high rating that priceline does .
negative	i don_'_t stay in 0_star hotels .
negative	i travel for a living and have stayed in more hotels then i care to remember , so i require a certain standard .
negative	i '_m not picky on brands , but i am picky on cleanliness and comfort .
negative	so i '_m very upset at being put up in a hotel that every other site ( hotels . com , expedia . com , etc ) rates as 0_star , when priceline says it is a 0 0 / 0_star .
negative	i '_ve tried priceline several_times and i '_m over being lied to !
negative	i ordered a white polo top .
negative	i received a top that had clearly been on display somewhere and not properly checked .
negative	the top had an orange stain on it and also had dirt on it .
negative	when i called i expected to be told one would be sent out next_day delivery .... instead i was asked to take pictures and sent them to them , which i refused anyway i had to wait another week while the first one was received then another sent in its place .
negative	don_'_t use this company have called twice total wait time a half_hour never able to speak to anyone .
negative	issue not resolved .
negative	screen did not work on my laptop ..... they refused a refund
negative	nachdem das falsche datum bei abschluss der buchung kam , und wir beim hotel nachgefragt haben , ob eine umbuchung möglich ist .
negative	es wurde bejat , meldet sich ebookers nicht .
negative	trotz mehrmaliger aufforderung .
negative	und jetzt fragen sie nach einer bewertung .
negative	unverschämtheit !
negative	i found the entire_transaction to be awkward , misleading and the resulting exhaust system that is supposed to be the model for my vehicle has to be seriously modified so it will fit .
negative	whether that is the fault of the manufacturer could be debated .
negative	however , in short i will not be ordering from parts_geek again !
negative	i received nothing from this company and have no review to share .
negative	it was only when i got the email_confirmation of my order that i noticed that one item was not in stock and 0_weeks away from arriving .
negative	this would have changed my mind about the purchase and perhaps that is why it was not flagged up in flashing , large , red letters .
negative	i '_m sure the goods are fine it '_s just that i wanted my bathroom done next week .
negative	we have a group of 00 + taking an all - inclusive trip to cabo and using bookit to reserve our travel .
negative	as i was reviewing options i was confused as to what was actually being advertised .
negative	i called bookit and was assisted by a bookit representative .
negative	as we were on the phone and i was explaining my confusion , she was walking thru the exact_same steps .
negative	i explained the reason i was calling and asked numerous questions for clarification .
negative	she even involved a for supervisor / manager for clarification .
negative	she said that the particular room that i was questioning was all_inclusive .
negative	i asked this question repeatedly .
negative	i thought when she had me on hold i heard it say that a representative can book this for a fee of $_00 per_ticket .
negative	i declined letting her book it and booked it myself immediately after the phone_call .
negative	due to constraints in booking on their site , i broke our booking into 0 bookings for 0 of us .
negative	i passed this info on to others in the group .
negative	sharing with them exactly_what i was told .
negative	a friend of mine was going to book her trip based the information i shared , but she called to verify as well .
negative	she was told something different .
negative	so , i called back in again and further inquired .
negative	i was given yet a different answer !
negative	the representative was kind and informed me that they would review the previous recorded call and get back with me .
negative	i received a phone_call about ½ hr later and the representative i had just spoke with left a message_saying that they wanted to go_ahead and rectify the situation and upgrade everyone due to incorrect information being given .
negative	then immediately after that call , that same representative called back and said " please disregard previous message that he thought there was only 0 rooms not 0 ".
negative	therefore he was going to go_ahead with the request to review the original call and i should hear something in about 0 - 0 days .
negative	a week went by so i called back , status was it is still under review .
negative	i called back another week_later and the representative said they realize they gave incorrect information from both previous representatives and she said all she could offer at this point would be that bookit would pay for ½ of the upgrade and i would be responsible for another $ 0000 ( after taking 0 room away from us , putting 0 people in 0 rooms instead of 0 !)!
negative	this representative was very demeaning by saying “ you are viewing the information that everyone else sees ”.
negative	i told her that i understood that , and that is what prompted my initial call .
negative	and obviously that the information displayed is very misleading even their own representative was confused !
negative	and , after getting a supervisor / manager involved i was still given incorrect information and i booked according to that information .
negative	they even offered for us to get a refund on our hotel but couldn ’ t do anything about the flights .
negative	like we want to fly down there and not have a place to stay !?
negative	not even reasonable !!!
negative	the options provided are unrealistic solutions !
negative	even after review of the calls i ’ ve made , and bookit blatantly admitting their representatives provided incorrect information , they are not willing to honor their own word .
negative	this should be upheld as it is a verbal contract and should be honored regardless !
negative	it ’_s been going on 0_weeks and i have not been contacted by bookit .
negative	nor has this issue been resolved .
negative	i am soo very glad i did not wait to look into this or find out when we arrived in cabo !
negative	this would have been devastating as we have a 00_yr anniversary and a wedding planned !
negative	highly disappointed !
negative	placed an order dec 00st around 0pm , paid for next_day courier to ensure we had the items in time for christmas , its the 00th now and nothing !
negative	the tracking_number says its still with the courier , emailed shopto . net which is a pointless task as they dont have a clue , only to ask me to fill in this survey !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	why ???????????????
negative	?/
negative	dont_waste your money , buy from amazon to ensure you get your stuff !!
negative	!
negative	ordered over four weeks_ago and have not yet received item so couldn_'_t really recommend .
negative	> i had booked a trip through_expedia from ottawa to san_diego with [_external reference_].
negative	the flight i had to chicago from ottawa got cancelled due to weather_conditions and i accepted an_alternate route through air_canada which i deeply regret doing .
negative	this is not the first time i '_ve experienced poor customer_service through air_canada , but i was hoping the other trips were an exception to the rule .
negative	> the airplane sat on the yow tarmac for over an_hour and the flight attendants could only say that it was because there was lightening storms in toronto and that most_likely all flights flying to and out of toronto would be delayed .
negative	> only good thing i can say is that they turned off the engine and allowed_us to get out of our seats while we waited .
negative	> on my way off the plane in tor , no one was able to provide assistance on how to ensure i could make my connecting_flight to san_diego which was showing " on time " on the flight board .
negative	after passing customs , baggage check , etc ... the flight was no_longer showing on the flight board and no one was to be found at any air_canada gate .
negative	> strangely , the skies were very blue and the pavement was dry .... no_indication there had been a storm .
negative	> the ac flight attendants i found roaming around had no_clue where to direct me .
negative	i happen to find the service desk , and was told to get in line even_though i said my flight was leaving in 00_minutes and i simply needed the gate number .
negative	as there were 0 people in line , my flight had left by the time i received " service ".
negative	> so booking another flight to get to san_diego , i opted for a layover in los_angeles that night , instead of waiting another 00_hours in toronto .
negative	i was not offered any compensation for either spending the night in toronto nor los_angeles even_though air_canada caused me to miss my flight .
negative	> " service guy " told me he could not give me the boarding_pass for the next_day flight , but omitted to say he did not complete the booking and that i was expected to go to the ac ticket counter at lax to get one .
negative	i only got the customer_service contact information when i returned to the desk to confirm my flight to san_diego was in fact the next_morning at 0 : 00 .
negative	> after a short night in a close by hotel , i returned to the lax airport the next_morning .
negative	i went to [_external reference_] who had no trace of my info who redirected me to [_external reference ], i found out that there was no ticket for me as the booking the to agent did not complete the booking .
negative	> the ticket agent and i spent over 00_minutes on hold with ac in toronto because no one was picking_up the phone at ac ticket counter at lax .
negative	my 0 : 00 reservation was cancelled in the interim and [_external reference_] reserved an 00 : 00 flight for me .
negative	> the agent in toronto said he could do nothing for me because the notes on file said i had accepted lax as my final_destination .
negative	after he finally got my argument that it made absolutely no sense for me to change my final_destination , he told me i needed to speak with a ticket agent at lax to see what they could do for me .
negative	since no one was picking_up the phone , i walked from [_external reference_] terminal 0 to air_canada terminal 0 and back .
negative	please look at a map of the airport to appreciate this is a 00 minute walk one way as i am in extremely good shape .
negative	i barely made the 00 : 00 flight .
negative	> i hate to think what would have happened to my baggage , had i any with me on this trip .
negative	> i received no apologies from anyone at air_canada throughout this whole ordeal and an overall lack of customer_service .
negative	[_external reference_] was the one that walked me through the steps and compensated for ac '_s lack of customer_service .
negative	[_external reference_] staff provided assistance in directing me to my connecting_flight going back to ottawa and to others on board making connecting_flights .
negative	>
negative	> i am expecting a full_refund for my hotel and meal expenses and a half of my air_fare for losing a day from my travels .
negative	i accidentally cancelled a booking that was non_refundable and was told the only way i could re - instate my booking is by booking and paying a second time ; and that i would be re - imbursed after .
negative	it has_been 0 days and customer_service won_'_t even respond to my queries .
negative	so now i am out $_000 , what a rip - off !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a hub bearing for my 0000 grand_prix and it was defective .
negative	i have talked to customer care and they want me to pay to ship it back before the send out a new one which is impossible because then i will be without a car .
negative	i will never order anything from them again and the worst part about it is i have ordered hundreds of dollars of parts from them .
negative	i never received my order and i was sent the wrong part even_though the initial item was said to be in stock .
negative	poor customer_service everything is done by email and you ' re not able to speak , to a live representative .
negative	and on top i can '_t receive my full_refund ( including the shipping cost that i was charged ).
negative	ridiculous and waste of time !
negative	i ordered a rear - view_mirror for an e000 ford van .
negative	i received a rear - view_mirror for a large pick - up truck .
negative	not at all what was pictured or ordered .
negative	now i believe i am expected to pay return shipping as i have not received a shipping label or voucher .
negative	i ordered 0 knock out roses for a mother '_s day gift .
negative	my mom calls to tell me that the pots arrive with the root system on top of the soil !
negative	she was very disappointed .
negative	she planted them just to see if they '_ll take or not .
negative	i tried to call but i '_m on the west_coast .
negative	customer_service is 0am to 0pm est .
negative	i sent an_email to the order email , no bounce back so i '_m not sure if i '_ll get through .
negative	very disappointing as a first time experience .
negative	i sent 0 e_- mails to customer_service .
negative	my card never arrived , which was supposed to be a present for my cousin for her bridal_shower .
negative	i was told in the first e_- mail that another card would be sent out and there was a problem with the tracking for the first card .
negative	it is 0_weeks_later and still no card .
negative	second e_- mail was never responded to .
negative	terrible customer_service and no resolution or present for my cousin .
negative	poor engraving quality and they would not refund my money when it was their fault .
negative	they only offered a partial_refund which does me absolutely not good .
negative	i ordered an eheim 0000 canister filter from the website directly , though they also fill orders on amazon and ebay .
negative	they had a good price , decent reviews , and were showing it as " in - stock " on the website .
negative	a few_days pass , and they ' d processed the $, but we still hadn_'_t gotten a confirmation_email / tracking_info .
negative	after we call , they admit it actually wasn_'_t in stock , it '_s on backorder - but due to arrive the next_day .
negative	0 more days go by .
negative	we call again .
negative	they say it actually did arrive yesterday , the warehouse just hasn_'_t gotten around to updating , etc .
negative	due to ship tomorrow .
negative	i get a call the next afternoon , was told the box was damaged in shipping .
negative	" there '_s a small_hole in the box ... but our quality control opened it and checked every component , they say everything is fine .
negative	can we go_ahead and mail it to you , for say ...$ 00 off ?
negative	or we can order another one and you can wait for it ?"
negative	she also refused to upgrade shipping , saying priority " always ends_up getting lost ".
negative	i agree to receive it , seeing as how that was the only one they ordered ( though the website was still showing it as " in - stock ", which i told her she might want to change , she agreed ), on the condition that they get it in the mail that day , and if there '_s anything wrong with it , they '_ll pay return shipping and give me a refund no questions_asked .
negative	it finally gets here .
negative	there are at_least two holes in every side of the box except one .
negative	i check everything , and sure enough : the plastic casing on the pump is cracked , split into multiple pieces and falling_off .
negative	i call requesting a return_label ( there was no invoice / instructions for return for refund included ) and got the least sorry apology i '_ve ever heard .
negative	" we just don_'_t have control over things like this ( blaming the shipping company ), unfortunately ... qc must not have caught that ."
negative	i also tell her their website is still showing it as in - stock .
negative	she said that is not how they do_business and she '_ll have someone look into that .
negative	i '_m told the refund should take " a few_days , tops " after they have receive the filter back .
negative	i call again ( a monday ), 0 business days after tracking shows they ' d had it back .
negative	the customer_service rep was rude and unapologetic , and i am now told it will take 0 - 0_weeks for the refund to be processed .
negative	at this point , i list the mishandling of this transaction from the beginning , and explain that it will make for a very legitimate better business_bureau complaint , which i will be filing on wednesday if i don_'_t have my refund by then .
negative	we get an_email a few hours_later saying the refund is being_processed .
negative	the money showed_up the next_day .
negative	i honestly gave them every opportunity , every_step of the way , to correct their mistakes and i was repaid with multiple delays and mistruths , bad customer_service , and unapologetic passing - the - blame attitude .
negative	i had to threaten a complaint with the bbb to get my refund in the time i was quoted .
negative	i '_m glad i finally got my money back , but i highly_recommend being wary with this company .
negative	i '_ve never had a worse experience with an online_retailer .
negative	also - their website still shows the 0000 filter as being " in - stock ".
negative	i wonder_if that '_s the broken one , or they just lied to me about not having an undamaged one to ship me ?
negative	either way ...
negative	caveat emptor .
negative	order shipped 0 different orders .
negative	received 0 ,
negative	contacted to find my order .
negative	still don_'_t have it
negative	or know where it is .
negative	geek parts suppose to
negative	locate have not received response .. has_been
negative	days .
negative	absolutely awful experience .
negative	trying to book a hotel room , and was on the phone for 00_minutes before she informed me that the reservation was unrefundable .
negative	the next ten_minutes were spent with her transferring me to customer_service ( wait , i wasn_'_t speaking to customer_service ?)
negative	and then waiting for that person to " review the policies ."
negative	i finally hung_up and called the hotel_directly - they were very nice and helped_me cancel the reservation .
negative	plus , the first woman took so long telling_me about all the amenities and great rates i was getting that the room booked up one of the nights .
negative	i used to work at the front_desk of a hotel , and so am quite patient with the spiels that i know the employee has to give .
negative	but , this was exceptionally bad .
negative	i tried to speak to customer_service about an_issue i was having .
negative	i was on hold for 0 hours and no one ever did come to speak to me .
negative	at 0 : 00hour i used my land_line placed a second call and to see .
negative	i waited an_hour on that call and never did speak to anyone .
negative	it '_s funny .
negative	reservation agents answer the call in seconds .
negative	i will never ever ever use expedia again !!!!
negative	!
negative	there was no email or any notice reminding customers that the account is about to be auto_renewed .
negative	babbel expects its customers to remember to cancel the account six_months after they first paid .
negative	there is no option to not auto renew .
negative	so six_months later , i am no_longer using babbel but found a surprised charge on my credit_card .
negative	immediately i contacted babbel to cancel my membership and to request a partial_refund .
negative	i am reasonable .
negative	i didn_'_t remember , six_months later , that my babbel account would be auto_renewed .
negative	i will pay for the 00 days that i forgot .
negative	but i am not using this service anymore .
negative	i don_'_t want to pay for another six_months .
negative	no .
negative	babbel simply refuse .
negative	" oh you were told , six_months_ago , in one tiny line , that your account would be auto_renewed ".
negative	" oh , it is stated in the faq if you bothered to go looking for it ".
negative	let '_s summarize : 0 ) expecting its customers to remember to cancel every six_months ; 0 ) not providing so much as an_email reminding that auto renew is about to occur ; 0 ) refusing to partially refund for the auto_renewed amount .
negative	all points to an unethical business that its only way to retain customers is by tricking them .
negative	had babbel partially refunded my auto - renewed subscription fee , i would consider_using babbel again in the future when i actually have time to use its service again .
negative	i am on auto renew with many online services , but none of them is this desperate for $_00 that they are willing to make a customer a lifetime enemy .
negative	i ordered a dress for my sister '_s wedding and the wedding was postponed due to hurricane_sandy , so i needed to return the dress .
negative	no one would help me , they wouldnt accept_returns on the dress .
negative	the customer_service was terrible for the price i paid - do not purchase from this website !
negative	i ordered my merchandise on the 00th of december it '_s christmas day and i '_ve still not received anything , i '_m so angry and disappointed i '_ve had to explain to family and friends that i '_m still_waiting for the delivery , which_means i had nothing to give to them , gadget_grotto has my money but i have not even one of the things i '_ve ordered , i '_ve still had no email about them either , and if i '_m correct they were advertising for delivery on the 00th still , if they could not fulfill there obligation considering they took my money they should of at_least sent me a email to let_me know , then i could have got my stuff elsewhere instead of sitting here cringing with no gifts to give to my friends or family , so all that said no i don_'_t rate them at all !!!
negative	!
negative	i placed an order for dog_biscuits .
negative	they enrolled me in the automatic re - delivery system , stating " cancel at anytime ".
negative	i thought , ok .
negative	but i didnt like the biscuits , so i went to cancel the reshippment of future orders .
negative	when i clicked the button , i got a msg to call an 000 number so someone can help me cancel .
negative	i freaking hate companies like this .
negative	bs customer_service ..... just let_me cancel for gods sake !
negative	this makes me never want to shop_here again .
negative	my time is valuable , i dont want to sit on the phone to cancel .
negative	i just rescheduled all my " future shipments " for the year 0000 .
negative	lol
negative	so_far , i '_ve paid two day shipping for product that took five days to arrive , was inferior quality and wrong_size .
negative	i get emails three or four time a day with sales pitches .
negative	have yet to receive item correct for my daughter .
negative	to make_sure that the glasses i ordered would fit with the lense i need to use , i contacted your customer_support .
negative	your person in customer_support send me an answer , after he had been in contact with your laboratory .
negative	the answer confirmed that i could use the glasses with the lense .
negative	i therefore made an order and received the glasses shortly_after .
negative	when the glasses arrived it turned_out to be a wrong answer i had received from your customer_support and i cannot use the glasses .
negative	the glasses are now on their way back to you .
negative	correspondance can be forwarded if it should be of any interest .
negative	ma_commande de deux pneux comportait une grosse erreur : un de 00 ' et un de 00 ' !!
negative	et en plus de marque dfférente !
negative	never use expedia .
negative	i just spent a total of 0 hours dealing_with them due to my soldier '_s cancelled flight .
negative	i was hung_up on after my first hour on the phone & " confirming " his new flight 0 times .
negative	the agent didn_'_t confirm the flight & book him , even after confirming it with me 0 times .
negative	she disconnected the call .
negative	a few_minutes later i called back from a different phone & was told the flight wasn_'_t confirmed & was no_longer available .
negative	i also received an_email during this 0nd call stating that the original agent attempted to call me back ( she didn_'_t ) so she didn_'_t book the flight .
negative	my phone , that was in my hand , never rang .
negative	the new agent i was speaking to kept telling_me new flights & then saying they were booked , leading me to believe they were booking quickly .
negative	she stated the original new flight was unavailable , i asked twice .
negative	there was no_longer a non_- stop flight available .
negative	i was offered what i was told was the only available flight for tomorrow & considering he was supposed to be back to base today , i reluctantly agreed to an earlier flight with a long layover at his first stop .
negative	after i got off the 00 minute phone_call , i checked online , & there were non_- stop flights available , including the specific one i had " confirmed " previously .
negative	i called back .
negative	i asked to speak to a supervisor & spent 00_minutes on hold before i even spoke to her , she also placed me on hold several_times , rectified nothing , argued with me , & ultimately made me waste another hour sitting on hold & intermittently talking to her .
negative	i have never been so disgusted & frustrated with customer_service in my life .
negative	i have never dealt_with a company so unwilling to right a wrong .
negative	and i have never_experienced a customer_service supervisor arguing with a customer .
negative	my soldier husband will make it back to his base .
negative	he will also sit in an airport for a long layover instead of spending that time with his family or at his base where he is supposed to be .
negative	no real thanks to expedia .
negative	i will never use them again & urge you to think_twice before you do .
negative	i booked two rooms and within two hours went back and cancelled one room .
negative	i received my bill the next_day for two rooms .
negative	called the support line and was informed they had cancellation and revised reservation but still billed me for two rooms !
negative	i will never use this service again .
negative	i '_ll sleep on the curb before i book through this service again .
negative	i '_m totally dissapointed .
negative	i booked with a guy_who gave_me a rate of 000 . 00 total .
negative	when i checked my account it was 000 . 00 .
negative	i will never book with you guys again .
negative	having read previous reviews i am surprised at the odd one that says this company is great - it certainly isn_'_t .
negative	this is my second dealing_with this store using their on - line ordering service and my fisrt experience was dreadful .
negative	this later one was actually an order my husband placed for a jacket .
negative	the item he picked_up in store and no_problems were encountered .
negative	however the purchase he made entitled hmi to a £_00 gift_card as his purchase was over_£_00 .
negative	the gift_card never arrived so he phoned them .
negative	the gift_card eventaully arrived but when he went to use the offer code to reduce another item it never accepted it .
negative	he phoned them again and they said they would send another the next_day , 0 days_later and we still have not received it ..
negative	he phoned them yet again and they have now said it would arrive in the next 0 days as they were very busy !!
negative	busy doing what , its a wonder they have any customers - never ever again will i use their on - line ordering .
negative	i asked if if i was talking with the hotel_directly and was told yes .
negative	when i called the hotel to ask about the facility i was told i booked though you .
negative	as a result i cancelled my reservation with you .
negative	macy '_s telephone customer_service is the worst i '_ve ever_encountered !
negative	to speak to a human_being , you have to go through a gauntlet of 0 customer_service ' menus '.
negative	all of these menus are automated .
negative	i spoke clearly and distinctly and the system could not understand my responses at all .
negative	when i finally got to a person , i was told that the system was down and they could not help me for at_least an_hour .
negative	i requested a direct number to be able to talk to a person and was told that did not exist .
negative	when i got mad , they asked what color my charge card was and gave_me a number based on the color of my card .
negative	when i called that number i was told they could not help me for 00_minutes .
negative	two hours_later , i called again , had to go through the whole menu system again and after 00_minutes was finally able to speak to a human .
negative	this person finally accessed my account and took_care of the overage charges , then tried to sell me on using my card for extra purchases !
negative	i call with a customer_service problem , which had my husband so mad he wanted to cancel the card , and they try to sell me on using it more to get ' points '.
negative	i think they need to get the point ... give customers prompt , accessible customer_service !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a lightweight litton with engraving when it arrived the chestpiece was plastic !
negative	the engraving was cheap - looking and not centered .
negative	they also didn_'_t state that delivery would require a signature which isn_'_t convenient for people who work during the day .
negative	i had to drive to the fed_ex station and pick it up .
negative	what '_s the use in ordering online if you have to pick it up yourself ?
negative	i posted a complaint and was told to send a picture of the product with the engraving and i '_ve attempted to do so ...... three_times and it is returned stating the pic is too large no_matter_how much i crop it .
negative	i would never , ever order from them again .
negative	bad product and even worse customer_service is a combo i will avoid .
negative	there '_s too many other options out there .
negative	my main problem with expedia is that everytime we have wanted to book flights at the time of payment they come up with ' fare not longer available ' and they increase the price .
negative	it happened once and thought it was a one off .
negative	then again and i decided to book with someone_else .
negative	i tried it one last time to book my easter_holidays .
negative	not only the website was not working but we were on the phone for an_hour and had given all info when at the moment of payment the operator said ' oh , that fare is no_longer available ' it would be 000_pounds more now .
negative	so , terrible customer_service and overpriced .
negative	my solution , use a search_engine like the brilliant momondo .
negative	i ordered a dress for an_upcoming_wedding for £_00 . 00 including postage . although the picture showed a very light colour it turned_out to be a murky brown .
negative	i returned and was later refunded £_00 . 00 which i dont understand even with the postage . so if you dont want to be dissapointed or out of pocket , i suggest you dont use this company .
negative	the wrong product was delivered and i returned it promptly .
negative	i confirmed the product was received by the third_party vendor .
negative	was promised by able kitchen that the refund was forthcoming .
negative	i have called no less_than 00 times over the last 0 months requesting the refund .
negative	they say it is on its way each time or that " joe " will call me back with more info .
negative	i have never received a return phone_call and they have now begun hanging up on me each time i call .
negative	i filed with the bbb and they did not respond to the complaint .
negative	i am now filing in small claims and will request additional penalties / damages and notify their third_party vendors about they terrible customer_service and illegal business_practices .
negative	do not use this company !!
negative	!
negative	i wanted to surprise my fiancé on our one year anniversary of being engaged and i was planning to get a sexy baby doll and found the perfect lingerie , but very pissed off to find out that i ordered a $_00 worth of lingerie and i received nothing !
negative	i literally waited 0 months to see if my package would come and i still didnt recieve anything !!
negative	and to top it off , the lady that answered the phone after 00_minutes of waiting to be answered , the b "&$ h told me that the money was returned to my credit_card because supposedly the item was out of stock when i ordered it but i always check my bank activity everyday and found nothing being put back into my bank_account !
negative	it '_s funny how this company can let you buy things when they ' re out of stock !
negative	and it doesn_'_t say " out of stock "!!!!!
negative	i am very disappointed and i will never ever ever ever purchase anything_else !
negative	and i will spread the word to everyone i know to not purchase anything from here !
negative	i will work on trying to find a way to investigate this company .
negative	dont trust this website !!
negative	!
negative	they amazon warehouse deals sent me a beat up book when i paid for a new one .
negative	auto_europe arranged for a car_rental with hertz ( frankfurt airport ).
negative	i was charged an_additional_$_000 . 00 fee on my credit_card for an additonal driver fee , which i did not request .
negative	when i called autoeurope , they were of no support .
negative	just emailed me the copy of the contract and said i had signed for an_additional driver and that was all they could do .
negative	i am in a foreign_country , where the agent did not disclose any additional_fees for an_additional driver and i had no_idea i was authorizing an_additional driver .
negative	if autoeurope was more supportive with my complaint and handled this dispute i would feel better about using their services in the future , which at this point i will not .
negative	i selected the dates for my vacation , booked done .
negative	i received confirmation via_email for a room two_weeks from my selected date .
negative	i called they transferred my reservation to a new hotel .
negative	i was okay with that .
negative	when i arrived at the new hotel .
negative	they had no record of my reservation .
negative	luckily they had open rooms and were able to contact travelocity and collect payment .
negative	so i thought .
negative	the invoice i received the next_morning showed the card used was not mine .
negative	this is the second time i '_ve had this experience with travelocity .
negative	the first was actually a friend of mine , same situation .
negative	i don_'_t even know why i thought to try again .
negative	it was really stupid of me .
negative	travelocity is not helpful when it comes to traveling , do yourself a favor and book with any other travel site .
negative	it '_s been nine business days ( 00 including saturdays because i saw on the tracking page that fedex works on saturdays ) since the book was shipped .
negative	i understand that there were weather days that might have delayed the delivery , but the tracking page says that the book has_been in my city for about four days .
negative	i don_'_t understand what '_s taking so long .
negative	i already have school assignments that were due , where i needed the book for answers and reference .
negative	very disappointed and frustrated with bookbyte .
negative	your website changes the default shipping to the default billing_address .
negative	this is idiotic !
negative	i have different billing and shipping addresses but your website can '_t deal with it .
negative	as a result , an order which i paid_extra to have shipped in time for travel has not arrived .
negative	i don_'_t know where it is .
negative	unless you fix your website i will never order from you again .
negative	i purchased a ticket last month and they modified my flight tickets without notifying_me , and when i tried to have them change it back to the date i scheduled it for they said sorry it is no_longer available .
negative	so i had them transferred to the supervisor and he did not help me out !!!!
negative	just simply said sorry we can '_t do anything !!
negative	worst service .
negative	never going to purchase ticket from them again !
negative	very dissatisfied because i haven_'_t recieved the product i paid for !!!
negative	!
negative	placed an order with them and they said they would price match and take off 0 %, they didn_'_t honor the price match or the 0 % and just went_ahead and charged my card the difference of almost $_00 !
negative	and then they lied to me when i called in and asked what was going on .
negative	bad business and bad customer_service
negative	ordered 0 posters for my son approx 0_weeks_ago .
negative	0 arrived_promptly in the post ( the first 0 in the line of my order 0 - 0 ).
negative	i phoned the company and the guy agreed by looking at his records that only 0 had been sent but gave no reason_why .
negative	money for all 0 was deducted from account very quickly after_placing order .
negative	said remaining 0 would be sent to me - this was 0 days ago and still_waiting .
negative	looks like i '_m going to have to contact them again but gut feeling is they ' re not going to arrive .
negative	would not use gbposters again .
negative	the writer put a fancy 0st page in , but the bullets in the resume stayed nearly the same .
negative	def not worth the money .
negative	no way .
negative	i expected them to clean up all of my bullets into more crisp concise ones , no such experience .
negative	i was booking an airfare for my son , daughter in law and their son how will be 0 months old at the time of travel and who did not need his own seat .
negative	it does not give you the option to book a " lap infant " whilst booking the adults and we were instructed to contact the customer_service number of travelocity to complete the booking .
negative	after calling customer_service , it seemed they had no_idea how to book a " lap infant " and had to call ba to find out how to do it .
negative	after several calls and long wait times on the phone , i got hung_up on and was not called back as they promised they would do if we got disconnected .
negative	i also called ba and after an_hour and 00 minute wait for them to answer was told that travelocity should certainly be able to do the booking for the baby .
negative	my son finally wrote an_email to travelocity requesting a manager contact him regarding this matter , and eventually received an_email_telling him he would need to go through ba to book the infant and they were unable to do it .
negative	i am happy to say ba finally did add my grandson to the booking but only after many hours on hold at both travelocity and ba .
negative	i am very upset that it was so difficult to add a baby to a reservation and i am sure that it cannot be the first time that somebody has tried to do this , why did nobody at travelocity know how to do it ?
negative	it '_s been three_weeks , not here yet .
negative	been told too many_times it '_s getting shipped and then nothing happening .
negative	i am starting to think the whole thing is a scam and my glasses are never coming !
negative	paid_extra for fast shipping to ensure i would have them for my holiday ... just spent 0_weeks in mexico wearing my husbands glasses , back home now and still not here .
negative	wish i had ordered elsewhere , service is unbelievably bad .
negative	order was on back order
negative	got my money back and my order was cancelled without notice then
negative	without notice again i got charged for it
negative	unfortunately i had a bad_experience with this company .
negative	the order has_been delivered only after i contacted with customer_service , that happened 00_hours after the order supposed to be delivered .
negative	they call to the birthday person first , than finally they brought the flowers , at 00_pm , when almost everybodyin bed .
negative	this is crazy , i dont trust this company anymore , even_though they have cheap prices .
negative	i ordered over $_000 worth of front and rear brakes and rotors for my vehicle yet i received rear rotors from a person_who was returning the and they were made for a volkswagen as the receipt described .
negative	the rotors were too small .
negative	i called several_times and unable to get anyone on the phone .
negative	i sent an_email to open a compliant report for a return and it took a while for someone to get back to me and they didn_'_t want to send me a ticket for my return until i showed them pictures of the rotors i received .
negative	the pictures were not uploading to partgeek properly and this took another few_days to be resolved .
negative	i am disgusted with the way i was treated and told i am responsible for returns .
negative	i had no control over what happened so a a result i will never use your services again .
negative	ups web_site shows as delivered 00 / 00 / 0000 by usps .
negative	still nothing from usps .
negative	this is bullshit .
negative	you tell me you ship ups , i expect it to be delivered by ups .
negative	if i wanted the part shiped snailmail i would have requested that .
negative	i asked 0 times for them to tell me if my order went through or not since i did not get a confirmation page nor confirmation_email .
negative	they never answered .
negative	i have also had browser trouble on an order before this , no_matter what browser i use , the order takes_forever to send through at the payment page , making me wait 0 hours once , just waiting and waiting for the order to go through while i do other work in another window .
negative	then since not knowing if that order went through , i make another order and then get charged twice and then utter stress getting them to respond , emailing 0 times for them to send me a pre_- paid address label to send the double order back .
negative	no repsonse from them for 0_weeks while i tripped over this box in my room continually , asking them if they are a professional company .
negative	no response from right after the order was taken either on another occasion , on whether they received my order or not .
negative	tried replying to customer email and tried their contact form .
negative	before this order , calling in was even more miserable with long_waits to get quick answers and them trying to get_rid of you fast .
negative	before that i inquired_about reselling one type of their shoes , if this was possible , asking politely for management .
negative	no answer then of course as well .
negative	is miserable dealing_with this company just to buy from them .
negative	their catchy deals draw you into this customer_support nightmare .
negative	i also find searching for a specific item impossible .
negative	i never find the item i '_m looking for , not by name , nor item number , so have to bookmark the page on every_single item i like to remember for later .
negative	what a hassle to the customer .
negative	also extremely annoying is that if i do take time to browse their many pages , wasting hours of my time , and put items in my shopping_cart ... if i don_'_t buy fast enough , they empty my cart !
negative	wtf ??
negative	i just wasted all that time for nothing !
negative	those sites that don_'_t remember your cart items a week_later i find annoying , other_sites not remembering your items for days_later even worse annoying , but for amiclubwear to not remember your items for a few hours_later is extremely upsetting .
negative	as a business you ' re supposed to make buying easy for the customer , night cumbersome or fight hard against them .
negative	they also do not tell you when an item will ship when you order say , 00 items , and only 0 arrive .
negative	for the ones that don_'_t arrive , i am gathering they will not send them at all !
negative	they need to tell you whether you will still get this item or not !
negative	very upsetting to deal with amiclubwear , & re - editing my review now , this review place allows you to post your review on facebook !
negative	wow .
negative	that means if you don_'_t hve the best reputation & really try to be a good company , that all these negative_reviews will widespread against a company , worse than having reviews at all .
negative	i would think it ' d be better to clean up customer_service , then try to get your name out there in a positive way .
negative	the only 0 good things about them is their close to half off deals & often times innovative designs , but very stressful to get this .
negative	one other good thing : so_far they have put all items in a sturdy box , not cheap shrink wrap like frederick '_s , which gets your order arrived to you more in tact and without damage ... so_far .
negative	another thing that i suppose is good , is that no_matter_how hard you try to trick the system and add something that was available a second ago , but not now , it will not be added to your cart , & if by chance you luck out & it is , it will still not arrive , and will show the previoius mentioned , zero item shipped for that number , and they do not tell you if you will get it , thus , why would it be listed on your invoice if they don_'_t plan on sending it ?
negative	that is not good to let a customer think they will get stuff when they won_'_t .
negative	that " is " good to tell a customer upfront in the shopping system it just isn_'_t really available , no_matter_how heartbreaking .
negative	i would appreciate if you deal right with people as you should , ami , regarding all of these things please , that i have experienced over time .
negative	they sent us the wrong pair of glasses , we had proof of what we ordered from them and we even paid shipping on our own dime to send them back .
negative	even_though they admitted to sending the wrong glasses we got a $_00 " re - stocking_fee ".
negative	rather_than just let it go when we disputed through the bank and provided our evidence they just went_ahead and threatened us .
negative	i ordered a helmet and elbow pads ... got the helmet , but the elbow pads were out of stock .
negative	i ordered this march 0 0000 .
negative	its now may 0 , 0000 .
negative	i have not gotten a refund nor my pads .
negative	i have contacted the company several_times .
negative	mostly get answering_machine , leave a message , get no return call .
negative	the 0 times i got a live_person , they said i would get an_email about a shipping confirmation or returned money .
negative	nothing !
negative	!
negative	i ordered 0th edition and the book arrived is 0th .
negative	on the website says good condition but the book come in without front cover which was torn off totally .
negative	i normally purchase online but since i had a question concerning the difference_between two hayward cartridges i called .
negative	the first operator was rude and actually hung_up on me .
negative	i called back and spoke to an equally rude person .
negative	she was so rude i actually told her so .
negative	i did end up purchasing it online , even_though i really didn_'_t want to .
negative	since this experience i have made 0 purchases else where .
negative	it '_s too bad that oldies . com can '_t deliver what they say they have to sell .
negative	i desided to try the iste again after several_years had passed that they did not have all the cd '_s i ordered .
negative	so_far , the same thing has happened .
negative	after waiting a couple of weeks ( which is longer_than my usual sites ) i received my order but the main cd i wanted was " on backorder ".
negative	the explanation said if it doesn_'_t come in within 00 days from the original order being shipped , it will be cancelled .
negative	a few_years_ago - the same thing happened .
negative	i have to take it that when oldies . com says the cd is in stock ; they really mean it can probably be found in the cyber world .
negative	i base reviews on facts not playing craps .
negative	////////// l
negative	get in touch with the hotels to verify availability .
negative	please do not make reservations for midnight because most people as well as the computers tend to become confused as to which day they are booking for .
negative	i had a horrible experience which i would rather not repeat !
negative	i bought my mattress , bed_frame , and sofa from them .
negative	the bed_frame broke after one week of sleeping on it and the spots where you connect the feet of the frame to the frame itself where not done right they ended_up falling out , the material is very cheaply_made .
negative	the leather on my sofa is torn within one week also the material on the pillows the sofe came with are shredding .
negative	i would never recommend this place for furniture .
negative	they have poor quality merchandise .
negative	i placed an order with zazzle on 0 / 00 at 0 : 00 : 00 am pdt .
negative	my account said it was shipped 0 / 00 / 0000 0 : 00 : 00_pm pdt .
negative	i still_haven_'_t received it , and when i look up the tracking_number , it says no information available .
negative	i have since opened 0 claims with them and haven_'_t heard_anything back .
negative	today , i thought i ' d give them a call , but i '_ve been on hold for 00_minutes so_far .
negative	not impressed .
negative	the new retractable leash i bought only cost $ 0 , plus shipping ... the ad said it was worth $_00 - not so much - it broke the very first time i used it for my jack_russell terrier ( not a big dog )- will not buy from this company again .
negative	the $ 0 leash deal was not even worth the $ 0 !
negative	i booked 0 tickets and 0 were turned away meaning 0 of my guests had to purchase their own on the day .
negative	i had the worst expierence of my life . everthing about this reservation was a lie . i asked for single king_size bed got twin beds . i paid for 0 rooms . they said we get free breakfast , and when we wnet to breakfast they said we need a voucher . the hotel restraunt called the front dest and they said no vouvher your package didnt come with breakfast . then no one told me they had construction going on we were awaken by loud banging and opened the door themen were in the hall putting down molding . it was awful . i called to confirm my reservation and no mention of construction . it is decietful and conning .
negative	my husband and i bought 0 couples aolg because of pase experences and we were embarrested and felt awful . i lost my cell ph at the hotel they waited a week to call me and tell me they found it it cost me 000 . 00 for a new phone .
negative	i ordered my book did not receive it on time , couldn_'_t track it online , had to drop a class because of he delay .
negative	delivery . com has several glaring shortcomings that even the $ 0 off promotion can '_t fully mitigate :
negative	- reviews are incredibly easy to game .
negative	b /_c delivery . com doesn_'_t pull in menupages or yelp ratings , several 0 - star reviews can have a major impact on the overall rating of a restaurant , which leads to many restaurants very clearly gaming their reviews .
negative	untrustworthy ratings are a huge flaw .
negative	- the website itself is extremely slow and not particularly user_friendly .
negative	when i log_into grubhub . com , for example , i '_m presented with lots of things i '_m actually looking for - types of cuisine i may want , the cheapest restaurants in my delivery area , the closest , the highest rated .
negative	" neighborhood faves " or " trending " are not terms that mean anything to me ; presumably they ' re meals that were ordered most recently , but why would that be relevant to me ?
negative	i want to know what '_s good in my area , not what '_s arbitrarily most_recent .
negative	since the reviews aren_'_t trustworthy , i '_m presented with a sea of choices and no guidance at all on what to select .
negative	your repeated " stop " admonitions & trying to get me to expand my order or have it automatically repeated are just about enough to make me go to another pet websight .
negative	it '_s simply a blatant attempt at getting more of my $$, & delays the order process .
negative	it is offensive , wastes my time , and is demeaning - probably not how you want your customers to feel .
negative	my dog put a hole in the dog bed only 00_mins after i got it after saying chew resistant very disaponted
negative	i ordered a a /_c compresser pump for my chevy tracker for $_000 . 00 and what came was a door_handle for a olds cutless .
negative	it has_been a pain from the start .
negative	people say they will do things , then do not .
negative	a complete and utter nightmare .
negative	so very stressfull
negative	when i wanted to change my reservation , in plenty of time , no one could find the details .
negative	i had never received a confirmation .
negative	i spent hours on the phone talking with people who could not grasp the problem .
negative	travelocity charged my credit_card , but apparently , travelocity and expedia are now one and the same .
negative	neither one had any record of the transaction .
negative	i was not able to change the reservation , and so_far , am stuck with paying for a night i did not use .
negative	even my credit_card company could not resolve the issue .
negative	i will not use travelocity or expedia again .
negative	i thought i would get the parts in 0 - 0 working days took 0 week .
negative	i recieved a credit on a part before i knew it was out of stock .
negative	i also had 0 parts total , came in two_seperate boxes 0 days apart .
negative	i have now waited to hear back about a return and have heard_nothing so_far .
negative	it was not a good experience for me .
negative	i spent the time to customize the cards , i was buying 00 , and i even received a receipt .
negative	shortly_after i was emailed saying i could not use a logo image .
negative	it was the logo of my company , nothing trademarked .
negative	instead of giving me an option to upload a new picture my entire order was canceled .
negative	netaya is a scam .
negative	they are a complete fraud .
negative	the diamond_ring i bought is of much lower quality than they said it would be .
negative	do not buy from them .
negative	flying ryanair is worse than getting on an old bus .
negative	so impersonal .
negative	when i fly to dublin i always fly arelingus now .
negative	ryanair might be cheaper but i would rather pay more than have to run to the plane to be able to sit with my family .
negative	please notice : this email is sent automatically , therefore it is possible you have received this before your package or service .
negative	if this is the case , you are of course welcomed to wait_until you have received your package or service before writing your review .
negative	do not deliver what they offer .
negative	i ordered three toilet on july 0 .
negative	today is november , and they did not deliver the product or money .
negative	i am still trying to redeem my gift_card
negative	if you go to their site and look for shoes for your size only and try to purchase it your size may not be available even_though your only suppose to be seeing shoes in that size .
negative	that should have been a sign .
negative	i clearly order my shoes 0 . 0 and they sent me an 0 but i never checked the invoice when i summited the order .
negative	be careful because they don_'_t care your just out of luck with your money if you ever order from them .
negative	why would i order two_pairs of shoes thats not my size .
negative	never again .
negative	having taken out a five month worldwide backpackers policy , we asked to extend by one month ( and for one single country ).
negative	the premium to cover that final part of the trip , when we couldn_'_t shop around elsewhere ( most companies require you to be in your home country when you apply for the policy ) was as much as the five preceding months combined (£_000 ).
negative	according to sales_reps this had nothing to do with a claim made in december ( and which multi_trip paid out only £_00 on , towards the £_000 i paid for medical treatment ) - i had specifically_asked if making the claim would impact on the extension premium as such a small claim could easily be outweighed by excess charges .
negative	their explanation was that the insurers might be charging the same for one month as for multiple month periods , so we ' re forced to pay up or not have coverage .
negative	and to add_insult to injury , their call_centre attempted to add an £ 0 charge when i called ( the number they provided ) to pay for the policy .
negative	honestly , i feel shafted .
negative	my trouble with this company started almost_immediately .
negative	i waited 0 week after_placing my order for confirmation of delivery date .
negative	i finally chased them via_email after hearing nothing from them .
negative	i was told that my order would still be another 0 days !
negative	i asked why it took so long and the customer_service team sent me the following : ' as stated online , delivery is anything up to 00 working days ' i asked where abouts on the website this was stated and the member of staff admitted that they had lied and that delivery should be 0 - 0 days unless they are using an_alternative courier company ( they weren_'_t for my order ).
negative	the item eventually arrived , and surprise surprise was faulty .
negative	i am now in the process of arranging a return , but guess what , the fictitious 00 days for collection and replacement has re - appeared .
negative	i have sent them countless emails , phone_calls and have spent an inordinate amount of time on hold and am no closer to a resolution .
negative	i implore you , for your own sanity , do not ever use this organisation .
negative	they are absolute cowboys who have no regard for standard lead times or good customer_service .
negative	i booked a hotel room for one night and paid for the room .
negative	when i showed_up at the hotel on the east_coast they did not have my reservation , they were sold out .
negative	tney said " this happens sometimes with third_parties ".
negative	i called " getaroom " the next_day and followed_up with an_email .
negative	i still have not received a response .
negative	worst company i have ever come in contact with .
negative	bought a table and chairs .
negative	cost me $_000 . 00 to have it brought to my home .
negative	dropped it at the door and told me to put it together .
negative	opened the boxes and found material with holes in it and big black glue spots on the chairs .
negative	told them i wanted my money back and to come get it .
negative	they told me if i wanted to return it i would have to bring it to them .
negative	my husband had to take the day off of work to help me load it up and take it back to them .
negative	told them i would be there the next_day and to my surprise they were closed except for one of the guys in the back .
negative	he took it back and gave_me a receipt for the return .
negative	still fighting them for a refund .
negative	when i talked with them about it they told me i got what i paid for :(.
negative	really ............. this is the kind of service you will get from this place .
negative	and the quality of the product well let_me say i could drive around and find better furniture that someone kicked to the curb for trash pickup .
negative	i booked a ticket for a person with a double barrel name there is only the option for one part , phoned to check left waiting 00mins paying 00cents for a minute to be told i have to change the name otherwise he wont be let on the plane and that it is my fault charged 00_euros plus commision they dont reply to emails and when they do thier english is so poor that it is un - understandable
negative	i ordered a scarf and it is so below standard quality that i don_'_t even know what i will do with it .
negative	very disappointed and won_'_t be ordering from your company again .
negative	0st because the produce came from overseas i had to be home to sign for it .
negative	0nd and most_importantly … the capsules do not fit properly in my nespresso_machine .
negative	although they do work .
negative	i will not purchase from fine_coffee club again !
negative	i ' d give no stars , but i have yet to receive my order !
negative	placed my order sept . 0tth 0000 .... after being told to wait_until oct . 00th to send another complaint , because as of yet then still no order received !
negative	then it turns_out the order was lost .... so now nov . 0th they supposebly mailed them again and now am told to wait 0_weeks for their arrival !
negative	it '_s been 0 days since then so ... i again am just waiting !
negative	had i known the process was so slow , and very unprofessional , i would have never ordered through them ... i '_m just hoping that after over 0 months of waiting they are decentley , wearable specs !
negative	the operators were rude and could not resolve my issue and in fact lied to me about my reservation when i was trying to confirm a breakfast package .
negative	i was assured i had purchased it and was told they didn_'_t know how to confirm it for me and then i received an_email later stating that it did not include the breakfast package after all .
negative	called 0 times for a total of 00_minutes without a resolution .
negative	placed order three_times with different credit or debit_card and all refused .
negative	crazy bad business .
negative	i wish your ads would quit showing up on my computer since you are not a legit business .
negative	my cards were and still are valid , so either send my purchases or leave me alone .
negative	i followed all the steps , got a confirmation and several hours_later it came back canceled because my card was not valid .
negative	well , i use them all the time to order online and never a minutes trouble .
negative	just your fake site .
negative	see above !
negative	still_awaiting arrival so unable to rate .
negative	was not satisfied did my own reservations through orbit myself cost less $ per_night also
negative	petflow could be a really , really great service if they ' d get their website problems and their order fulfillment correct .
negative	it '_s easy to set_up a flow ( their term for a periodic order ) but modifying it takes way too many steps and a lot of times , their website crashes in the middle of me adding an item or changing my delivery date , and prompts me to go back to the very beginning .
negative	extremely frustrating .
negative	i would have to call them every time i wanted to make a change , and i was told that their website was having issues .
negative	every day ?
negative	i '_ve been a customer for over a year , and the rate at which i receive the correct items in my orders is at around 00_% of the time , which is dismal .
negative	once , i was sent dog_food instead of cat_food , and the box had someone_else '_s name and account number on it .
negative	the shipping address label for my order for cat_food went on someone_else '_s order and i got her dog_food instead .
negative	then , i was sent cat_litter two_weeks after i ' d canceled the order .
negative	then , after ordering the same prescription cat_food for a year and a half , suddenly petflow decided they had to reverify the prescription with my vet .
negative	i was told that petflow was doing this with all their customers with prescriptions .
negative	which is okay , but it took them over 00 business days ( and 0 emails and several phonecalls from me ) to finally call my vet , who was more than happy to verify the prescription , as always , was prescribed for the rest of my cat '_s life .
negative	in the meantime , because my cat ran_out of prescription food , i had to hunt all over town to finally find a pet pharmacy who was able to special order the food and have it shipped overnight to their store at considerable cost to me .
negative	worst of all ?
negative	when petflow finally sent the cat_food , i was sent one case of the correct prescription food and 0 cases of another prescription food that my cat couldn_'_t eat .
negative	i had to wait yet another week for them to send me 0 replacement cases of the correct food .
negative	for a company that prides itself on convenience and ease of ordering pet_food and supplies , they sure make it as difficult as possible for me to keep using their service .
negative	i have switched my order for my cat '_s prescription food to the local_pet pharmacy , who has begun keeping it in stock .
negative	i '_m sorry to say that i cannot recommend petflow because of their repeated errors .
negative	i bought a pair of shoes .
negative	the description read " cobalt blue " the shoes arrived dark blue .
negative	tried to return them for a refund , but had to pay to have them sent back - and could only get a store credit instead of a refund .
negative	what ???
negative	luckily , i smelled bullsh * t and returned the shoes with " return receipt " to assure their arrival .
negative	that '_s when the issused a store credit of $_00 . 00 .
negative	i '_m now $_00 . 00 in the hole .
negative	i thought that i had them when i found a pair of shoes for $ 0 . 00 with s &_h the grand_total would be :
negative	$_00 . 00 .
negative	okay , i '_ll spend a couple of extra dollars to be done with them .
negative	but , nooooooooooo !
negative	check out would not allow a purchase under_$_00 . 00 .
negative	tried to add $ 0 . 00 purchases of lipstick , or eyeshadows and even a necklace - all of which were out of stock .
negative	i beleive this to be done on purpose .
negative	finally , i found an item of $ 0 . 00 in stock and though u - hun , i got your ... now !
negative	purchase now totalling $_00 . 00 i was happy .
negative	it was finally over .
negative	they can have the difference !!!
negative	when i saw $_00 . 00 s &_h charge bringing my total to $_00 . 00 i almost died !
negative	you mean i still have to give these fu * kers some money .
negative	this is why people snap !
negative	this is why snipers are on tall buildings !
negative	this is why people are killed .
negative	i was so disqusted , that i simply powered down my system and walked away .
negative	there ought to be a law addressing low - down and dirty practices .
negative	i '_m not done .
negative	i '_m going to find a way to spend as little as possible with this company .
negative	but , my prayer is that they go under ( like the big businesses ) or fall down ( like the world trade center ) either way will be alright with me !
negative	terrible service .
negative	not only was my order cancelled , but i wasn_'_t even notified that my order didn_'_t get processed .
negative	for days i waited for my books to come in , waiting in anticipation as i needed them asap for my classes .
negative	i finally looked on the website ( not in my email because i wasn_'_t even sent an_email of confirmation or shipping number ) and saw that it had been canceled .
negative	outraged , i scrambled to look for an answer and the website was impossible to navigate in .
negative	i couldn_'_t find the answers to my questions on the help section .
negative	looked for a number and couldn_'_t even find one to ask for more clarification on what happened .
negative	furthermore , it took the company about two_weeks to return the refund , which_means i has to wait two more extended weeks to finally get my books and study .
negative	not to mention that the book i bought in the student market didn_'_t get charged until 0_weeks_later so i ended_up buying another copy thinking that the order was canceled as well .
negative	now i have to figure_out returning .
negative	i hate this website .
negative	it '_s terrible .
negative	i never write these reviews so please take this advice with the utmost value .
negative	this company is an_absolute nightmare to deal with .
negative	there should be an option for " 0 " stars .
negative	i needed a print by a certain date for an awards presentation .
negative	i placed the order and requested overnight shipping , i was told that i would be informed via emial in 0 - 0 business days if overnight shipping would be possible ( that in it of itself should have tipped me off ).
negative	once i finally received an actual call from what was described to me as a " internet only based company " i was assured that the order would be delivered by my needed date .
negative	on the morning of my scheduled delivery date i still did not receive a tracking_#.
negative	i called and was simply told " there '_s nothing we can do " and " we will forward your issue to the escalation team and you may hear back in 0 - 0 business days ".
negative	upon further inquiring as to why i cant speak with anyone or why i only " may " hear back , i was told that " people are very busy " and " its monday , they may have a lot of cathcing up to do ".
negative	finally after having to call several_times i was lucky_enough to get an employee who did simply read off of prep printed index cards .
negative	low and behold my order had not even left the building yet !
negative	so i will not have my order in the time_frame i was guranteed .
negative	i can fully understand that sometimes things happen that are out of anyone '_s control .
negative	however , what is in a company '_s control is their customer_service .
negative	this company has none .
negative	so long as your credit_card clears , this company knows they have you by the short hairs and could not care at all as to any issue or problem .
negative	you ' re better off finding another company or painting one these pictures yourself .
negative	do yourself a favor and just give this company a call first and see what their absurd phone responses are to your inquiries .
negative	customers service very bad and service very poor
negative	order said delivery in 0 - 0 days , 0_wks later im still_waiting .
negative	had 0 email_saying they were looking into it & nothing else .
negative	wouldnt buy again from them .
negative	i called to get am rma_number and was on hold for a long time then a recording came on telling_me to go on the website , then hung_up .
negative	please have a human call me to fix this .
negative	they have the worst customer_service ever .
negative	we ordered two parts on a saturday for our business truck .
negative	wednesday our order still was not processed .
negative	attempted over and over to contact them by phone , left on hold for 00_minutes with no one coming to the phone .
negative	sent the email on their help section and received a reply that it would take them 00_hours to answer .
negative	then received a reply that they had system issues and should receive the part in a few day .
negative	never was i able to actually speak with someone to find out when the part would go out or to be able to cancel the order .
negative	after ordering 0 bridge stonne t000 , i went to the garage and they were not there .
negative	the garage contacted tyresaver and put them on the phone for me , they give me the story that there is a back log for these tryres in the uk and had tried to phone and had emailed me .
negative	this is a load of lies i have a 00hr answering_machine and no messages have been left .
negative	i would avoid these like the plague !!
negative	the guy at tyre_shopper offered me what he said was a newer tyre which was the bridgestone e000 , which is a load of lies as i had these fitted last_year and are still on my car now , they offered no extra discount if i was to have taken the e000 and said i could have a refund .
negative	great customer_services , traveled 0 miles to get tyres already paid for and there not there .
negative	after ordering my e_- one i have been given 0 differnent dates for delivery .
negative	after third time i '_ve asked to cancel my e_- one as im getting told each week it will be with me next week .
negative	today i got offered a refurbished e_- one with 0 optic cartridges and a partial_refund , i declined this and asked for a full_refund .
negative	i '_m getting told to send an_email to thomas to make this formal and to receive a refund . i have been told lie after lie .
negative	watch out .
negative	if your to order one phone and speak to some one and get a delivery date .
negative	they don_'_t bother to phone and advise of the delay aswell .
negative	parcel was clearly_labelled fragile , but on delivery receiver advised that that the glass on the fire was cracked , fire was in perfect_condition when was collect .
negative	i was trying to get a speedy exchange on a product that i have received broken and that hasn_'_t happened .
negative	i just keep getting emails that say in theta next 0 - 0 days i '_ll get a return_slip !
negative	one week still getting e same emails no return_slip or refund on a broker part !
negative	i gave since had my dealership put on the mirrors that i needed for a camping trip and i am still_waiting for my return_slip and a refund at this point and they want to charge me 00_% for a restocking_fee on a broken part .
negative	i '_m sure the mirror that i got was returned from someone_else !
negative	will never use this place again !
negative	when i first booked the vacation i had a hard time understanding the lady_who i was working with .
negative	i should have called back , but did not have the time to do that .
negative	she did not add all of my request to the document , which_meant i had to call again anyway .
negative	i also purchased insurance , and i asked if it would cover our entire trip , including flights and she said yes , only to find out it had to be purchased at the same time .
negative	such a waist of money .
negative	i was put on hold several_times so she could try to understand the policy .
negative	not sure if i would book with them again .
negative	i just hope my reservation goes through to the hotel since we booked a year in advance .
negative	i bought a gift_card at giftrocket . com and it was cancelled shortly_after being redeemed !
negative	they didn_'_t say why so i asked and the response was : " we figured we would just save you the extra service fees since you are sending it to yourself ."
negative	i was appalled and contacted the bbb .
negative	they then made up all this lie about how it wasn_'_t allowed by their bank to send gift_cards to yourself and how it is considered a money transfer service .
negative	really its tangible goods .
negative	i didn_'_t know what to think of that but i won_'_t be going back !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered an eye pencil which never arrived ( i work from home so i '_m pretty sure i didn_'_t miss it !
negative	and the postman would have tried to put i in the letterbox since it '_s only an eye pencil )
negative	had to wait 00 working days before being issued a form to print out and send back within 0 working days and i '_m now unable to print as i '_m away till end of the month .
negative	the form is not very customer friendly and very intimidating :" i understand that a false claim for compensation could result in criminal prosecution .
negative	i declare that , to the best of my
negative	knowledge , the information i have given on this form is correct and truthful .
negative	i also undertake to advise beautybay . com ltd immediately if any lost items are subsequently traced or received , and to
negative	refund beautybay . com ltd any monies paid in compensation or the replacement value for those items .
negative	please_note : by making a claim for compensation you are consenting to your name and address being used for the purpose of making enquires into the claim "
negative	i will never sue this website again !
negative	update !
negative	!
negative	my eye pencil turned_up in the mail friday the 00th of october and since i couldn_'_t be bothered to print forms and go to the post_office to return an item i ordered in july i had to pay for it !
negative	i want a new car true enough !!
negative	but i don_'_t want to feel_like rushed into paying a car note !!
negative	they have reasonable down payments !
negative	but it seems if they give you ten days_later to turn_around and pay your car note !!
negative	last place i financed a car from gave u 00 or 00 days to make first payment !!
negative	drive time doesn_'_t offer that !!
negative	will like to if they would , so i am returning car asap !
negative	because the phone_call kept getting cut_off , i spoke with threee agents .
negative	0 was very professional and fluent in english .
negative	0 very very nice but had very poor english .
negative	the third told me to call the hotel_directly to book because she had to go pee and she was going to have an accident ( i am serious !).
negative	the call kept dropping , then they messed_up the reservation and booked one room instead of two .
negative	i would never call them again !
negative	!
negative	have never purchased via shopatron and wouldn_'_t .
negative	someone fraudently used my credit_card via shopatron .
negative	the credit_card company and police have been involved .
negative	after_contacting shopatron of the fraudulent use , it '_s been long_periods between email responses - little or no action on their part - conflicting instructions etc .
negative	very frustrating .
negative	you ' d think they ' d want to be more helpful but they don_'_t seem to care at all .
negative	terrible service , completely incompetent .
negative	honestly , i '_m quite sure the positive posts are just from staff and their friends .
negative	i lost out $_000 from this site which is most_likely a scam .
negative	they don_'_t have a number you can call them at .
negative	they don_'_t reply to their emails .
negative	they don_'_t call you despite promising to do so within 00_hours on their automated site .
negative	honestly , just don_'_t use these_guys .
negative	i am quite sure the whole thing is a scam .
negative	i lost out $_000 and don_'_t have a pair of sunglasses .
negative	i am having to work with the singapore better business_bureau to get my sunglasses once and for all .
negative	again , a scam , don_'_t use them .
negative	i purchased frames online thru becky_s after she agreed to price match on a order of frames and lenses .
negative	couple days_later she says she can '_t send the glasses she has because there is a crack in the temple .
negative	she offered me a 0 % extra discount if i wait for the backorder .
negative	i agreed .
negative	couple weeks_later i get my frames but they are not in the size that i ordered .
negative	i ordered a size 00 but a size 00 was shipped .
negative	becky or someone from her company deliberately used a sharp tool to scratch off the imprinted " 0 " of the 00 located on the legs of the frames to hide the fact that the frames are not the size 00 that i had ordered .
negative	i had the frames measured and it was a 00 , plus , on the nose rim , there is another imprint that says 00 .
negative	i guess becky was not aware there was another size marker on the nose rim , otherwise , this part would have been etched off as well .
negative	i emailed becky again and we agreed_upon an_additional_$_00 off if i kept the frames .
negative	a week_later , i open an_email from becky saying that she will charge my credit_card additional_$_000 .
negative	when i contacted her to inquire_about this , she kept making up and changing stories .
negative	to make the long_story short , she said she need to charge me $_000 to cover her profits .
negative	she said $_00 for her profit and $_00 for the extra discounts that she gave_me .
negative	this is the exact quote from her email , "$ 000 is the cost without the price match .. $_00 is what i am in a los for the $_00 is my profit which i will give up if we can agree to the $_00 . i am unable to go this low when i said i will do off $_00 i didn ’ t realize that the order already has_been pricematched to a place where is below my cost .
negative	so its my fault .. send back the frmae we undo this deal ."
negative	when i called my credit_card company she had already charged my account of $_000 .
negative	why am i being charged more than the originally agreed_upon price a week after receiving the shipment ?
negative	so , i can cover her profits ?
negative	it '_s a done deal whether or not she made profit off of me .
negative	it '_s her fault for miscalculating and offering discounts .
negative	bottom_line to potential buyer : beware !
negative	read the other negative_comments .
negative	you think it won_'_t happen to you , right ?
negative	sorry , but you are next in line to be scammed as soon as you submit your order through this company .
negative	oh , i highly doubt the reviews on this site are legitimate .
negative	she also offers $_00 off for posting positive_reviews .
negative	go visit another review site , there is only a 00_% approval rating .
negative	go check bbb too .
negative	unbelievable amount of complaints .
negative	i purchesed sleeping mats and what was shipped was not what was pictured , i called the min i received them and was told the 0 that i opened would not be accepted for returned due to opening it !!
negative	very disappointed in there customer_service and will not purchese from them again !
negative	i was quite disappointed with boohoo , you see the adverts on tv and all the stuff is looks fab .
negative	this is the second time i have bought a maxi_dress and the second time i have sent it back .
negative	the price for dress was good ( it was £_00 reduced from £_00 ), although i would have never paid full price for it .
negative	however when i got it the fit wasn_'_t any good and i was really disappointed in the quality of the fabric .
negative	i am normally a 00 - 00 but the 00 was too big and actually was a little on the short side .
negative	despite that , i did enquire_about exchanging it for the 00 to see if it was any better but i was told they don_'_t do exchanges .
negative	so i would of had to return the 00 and then fork out £_00 plus postage for the 00 before i was even refunded for the 00 !
negative	i find this totally ridiculous so i just decided to return the 00 and not bother with the 00 .
negative	it took_ages for boohoo to even acknowledge my returned parcel and then a while to refund my dress .
negative	what i am really angry at is that they keep a £ 0 re - stocking order !!!
negative	this is insane , it in no way costs someone £ 0 to put something back on a shelf !!
negative	no where else does this so i don_'_t understand_why boohoo thinks this acceptable .
negative	so all in all i will never buy anything from boohoo again and would not recommend it to anyone !
negative	i was scammed out of £_000 by an ebay_seller and paypal , which pides itself on its saftey let_me down badly .
negative	i filed a claim in the resolution center and paypal encourages you to sort the dispute out together so the seller emailed me asking to drop the claim so i did .
negative	a week_later nothing turned_up , i tried to file a complaint , i got a message_saying it was succsessfull but when i looked on my resolution center summary nothing was on there .
negative	i ran paypal and they said that they couldn_'_t help me as i have filed a claim once already and i had never been told upto this point when it was to late i can only file a complaint once .
negative	paypal is a disgrace !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	usually i do my bookings through bookit . com however this last past one has_been a nightmare !
negative	they took_forever on the phone i was on the phone dealing_with them for 0 days up to 0 hours each day !
negative	i '_m not kidding about this either !
negative	they got my reservations wrong and i could_barely understand what they were saying on the phone .
negative	one of the ladies that i spoke with who worked in the customer_service dept was rude !
negative	she kept saying " ms . myrna you don_'_t understand what i '_m telling you " " clearly you aren_'_t getting this " how rude !
negative	i was so anger i forgot to get her name but i almost want to call back and ask what it was if they don_'_t put me on hold for an_hour !
negative	when i tried to help my friend with her booking they messed all of it up and were trying to charge me double than what she was supposed to pay i was basically doing thier job and telling them what to do step by step i should earn some money for working as hard as i did to book our trips !
negative	i ordered a full size blouse which i wear a 0x or a 0 x and the two blouses i bought that were 0x were more like a xlarge .
negative	i was going to place an order for an item at walmart on line so i thought i would save myself a couple of bucks and but a gift_card on line ( an e card ).
negative	what a waste of time .
negative	it took 00_minutes for the order to process .
negative	i kept waiting for the ecard number to come through on email and after 00_minutes i called .
negative	the " help " told me it was after 0 : 00 so the order would not go through until tomorrow .
negative	never again will i order from this site !
negative	!
negative	this was the last time i will use travelocity .
negative	due to their weird , outsourced relationship with expedia , of which i was unaware , it was extremely difficult to make_changes to my reservation .
negative	almost_impossible , actually .
negative	and although everyone i spoke with was very courteous and helpful , it took literal hours to track down my reservation because it was lost in some_sort of travelocity / expedia limbo .
negative	i guess the lesson is use expedia in the first place .
negative	but they don_'_t tell you that '_s who is servicing your reservation -- it seemed a bit shady .
negative	in the end , they were able to help , but it '_s so not worth the hassle .
negative	where is my refund ?
negative	we tried purchasing a disney vacation and it charged my bank_account 0 times because of problems on there website .
negative	during the second attempt book it raised the price by 00 dollars in a matter of minutes .
negative	the charge that went through was the more_expensive charge .
negative	we called book it . com and explained the issue .
negative	we ended_up with a lady on the phone who had no_idea what was going on .
negative	i also was on the phone with my bank trying to find a resolution .
negative	the lady at book it . com put me on hold for at_least 00_minutes and never came back after she had said her manager did not personally want to talk to me or fix the problem .
negative	so i called the number on another phone and reached a man_who was very enthusiastic to help which was a sigh of relief after that issue .
negative	in the end i spent 0 hours on the phone trying to resolve the problem .
negative	i will never use this company again .
negative	i ordered 00 yards of organza fabric , a flower girl basket and a couple small bags of decorative flowers .
negative	whoever packaged them thought it was okay to fold the rolls of fabric in half , shove both rolls into a small square box , and proceed to shove the flower girl basket which was stored in a plastic box that is also now squished into one box .
negative	it had . no packing protection what so ever , so the delivery condition was awful as well with holes in the box .
negative	when i emailed to mention this , no one offered any solution to the problem , no credit , nothing .
negative	after several emails back and forth explaining that it is impossible to iron 00 yards of crunched fabric and simply being begged to keep the material i just gave up .
negative	i will never again use them .
negative	i '_ve used amazon for a long time they used to be trustworthy an good to use .
negative	as time goes on they just get worse an worse ...
negative	i had gift_card problems an the real people i talked to it was like just terrible ...
negative	finally someone finished me up but they were pissed an they made sure i knew it .... and they !!
negative	were a supervisor ....
negative	i went to order something recently cause i had a 00_dollar gift_card an i '_m all ready happy to use my gift_card ... did not even cover the cost of shipment ...
negative	i was ticked ...
negative	so i went somewhere_else an found almost everything cheaper ... one item i ' d been waiting for was down in price so i clicked it an i waited lets say 0 hours ?
negative	when i went to finish my order they double the price of the item an did not notify me or like a pop_up nothing !!
negative	i officially hate amazon ...
negative	i used to think they were cool but it '_s just the same as ebay ( jab jab ...) no deals here they should be ashamed > _ <
negative	!
negative	@ _o !
negative	refused to refund exorbitant shipping_costs incurred due to website malfunction .
negative	i placed an order on march 0st , today is the 00nd and i am still_waiting .
negative	my item did not say that it was not available .
negative	it said " in stock " will never order again from this place .
negative	i sat on hold for an_hour and a half before anyone even answered the phone .
negative	then , i asked to change my flight and they put me on hold again for another 00_minutes !
negative	i finally just gave up .
negative	i will never , ever use travelocity again .
negative	i ordered three products and did not receive one of them .
negative	this was a wig for my halloween_costume .
negative	when i contacted amiclubwear , they told me that " it was on the packing_slip " which i know because i received the packing_slip .
negative	however , i don_'_t care what '_s on the packing_slip , i care what '_s in my package .
negative	the package i received was in great condition and was untampered with and unopened .
negative	the only things inside were the gloves and shoes i ordered .
negative	there wasn_'_t even any packing materials such as bubble_wrap , paper , or packing peanuts for it to get lost in .
negative	just one shoebox and a plastic_bag with the gloves in it .
negative	ami says that they have to perform an investigation now with my shipping carrier , but i don_'_t have time for this , as i know for a fact that my package was perfect and unopened .
negative	nothing looked weird so i know nothing was removed after shipment ( plus , who would steal a silver crappy costume wig ?).
negative	the item simply was not included in my order and i either want it before my halloween_party on the 00th or a refund for the total price of the wig $_00 . 00 .
negative	i really just wanted to get what i ordered for my costume but this has_become a complete nightmare dealing_with this company .
negative	i hope this company goes out of business so that no one has to deal with this stress and grief .
negative	i would like to give this business no stars .
negative	i have sent 0 messages via their contact page and one facebook message .
negative	but no resolution .
negative	this is my latest message .
negative	maybe with a posting on trustpilot they will finally take some notice ?
negative	i did not receive the promised 00_%_discount ; i received a message reading : hurry !
negative	00_%_off site for one hour only - at 0 . 00pm .
negative	i placed this order 00000000 for £_00 . 00 and received the order confirmation at : 0 : 00_pm .
negative	five_minutes later !!!!
negative	but i only received £ 0 . 00 discount .
negative	therefore , the discount for order 00000000 was calculated incorrectly .
negative	00_% of £_00 . 00 is £ 0 . 00 .
negative	please refund £ 0 . 00 to my credit_card
negative	when i sent this to your customer ' service ' department , i received a canned response .
negative	either the person on the other end couldn_'_t be bothered to read it or they thought they could get away with over - charging me .
negative	either way , this is not customer ' service '.
negative	this is bait & switch or out - and - out fraud .
negative	i would not have placed the order without the carrot of the 00_%_off
negative	order number : 00000000
negative	order items :
negative	00000000 , 00000000 ,
negative	this was one of the responses - the other one was the same :
negative	one of our customer_services advisors has reviewed your query and we are able to confirm the following :
negative	hello helen ,
negative	thank_you for getting in touch about your order .
negative	unfortunately this offer was a declining discount , which_means as times goes by , the offer will drop down by 0 %.
negative	i apologize for the confusion caused .
negative	if there is anything_else that we can do , then please do not_hesitate to get in touch and a member of our team will be happy to help .
negative	kind_regards ,
negative	daniel
negative	i can initiate a chargeback with my credit_card company - which you will lose - or you can calculate the correct discount .
negative	your choice .
negative	but this time , at_least do me the courtesy of a response
negative	i believe that trust_pilot either invents reviews , and / or allows fake reviews to be posted and / or fails to pass on business responses to customers
negative	trust_pilot apparently makes no attempt to check that reviews are genuine or warranted , and does not provide email_addresses for businesses to follow_up with people who have posted their complaints .
negative	therefore their assertion that " trustpilot is a community that connects ..... with the companies they buy from " is clearly false .
negative	the trust_pilot system of reporting does not enable retailers - or anyone_else - to know whether reviews are even honest or accurate .
negative	to prove my point ; my company '_s rating at reselleratings is 0 . 00 / 00 ; we are rated a + by the better business_bureau ; bizrate gives us 00_% satisfaction , epinions 0 . 0 / 0 and price grabber 0 . 00 / 0
negative	but at trustpilot we are rated at 0 . 0 / 00 .
negative	in spite of my numerous complaints , trustpilot apparently can '_t see that their review and rating_system is clearly flawed
negative	worse experience ever ... after booking with them you get all_kinds of charges that wouldn_'_t show on the main page if you want to cancel you still get charge half of whatever you cost is .... wouldn_'_t recommend at all ... 0_star only cause won_'_t let you post your comment .. 0_stars ...
negative	i got a coupon to buy a certain_amount and get that discount .
negative	i appiled the discount , it took it , and then when i went to check - out , it was removed unless i selected auto_ship !
negative	when i order from chewy . com or doggiefood . com , they do not give you a discount based on auto_ship .
negative	on chewy . com , they let you know when ordering that you can select auto_ship to get money off .
negative	but they does not take away the coupon that they sent .
negative	i don_'_t trust petflow anymore .
negative	they suck , their liars just don_'_t go there !!
negative	money suckers !!
negative	!
negative	i sent petflow an_email explaining the problem .
negative	we have had lots if flavored rawhide over the years and sometimes the carpet gets stained but it is always cleanable .
negative	these rawhide bones left permanent stain .
negative	they refuted to stand_behind their product and replace them with other rawhide item .
negative	we bought a rowing_machine for my son '_s birthday ( 00 ).
negative	he and his dad unwrapped and assembled it with eager anticipation but a hole had been misdrilled through so the pedals could not be properly attached .
negative	we sent pictures that evening of problem and this seemed like respnse was good .
negative	however we are now chasing the firm 0 days_later rather_than them organising an immediate replacement !
negative	in fact we '_ve now asked for a refund as we feel we '_ve been badly treated as customers , the problem feels ours not theirs .
negative	i phoned ahead before submitting an order to check the curtain rings i wanted were the correct size .
negative	having been told they were , even to the point the man assured_me he had measured the diameter ( both internal and external ), i submitted my order for the solid brass curtain rings .
negative	they arrived_promptly , however they were way too big , and no way matched my existing rings .
negative	i was really cross as i had spent time and effort to ensure they were right .
negative	i returned them and asked them to refund the postage as i had been completely misled by them . guess what , no communication , no apology and no postage back !!!!
negative	i will never buy anything from these people again , because they lied and didn_'_t have the decency to even apologise .
negative	not a good service to use .
negative	when issues with the hotel , no one can assist you .
negative	hotels listed should be reviewed closer before booking on their behalf .
negative	fedex refuses to work with deliveries to make it better / easier for those receiving packages .
negative	their attitude , like comcast '_s , is “ here ’_s our time , take it or leave it ".
negative	as for picking_up at an authorized fedex site , they are impossible to get to make any changes even when the place is miles from where people live or work .
negative	united_states postal service is so much_better .
negative	priority_mail and over night delivery can match if not exceed anything by either fedex or ups .
negative	the driver / delivery person was delightful and did understand my frustration .
negative	however , naquan and felicia offered no help , while debbie , my final contact , did help as much as her " tied corporate hands " would allow .
negative	corporate headquarters you need to make_changes or customers will stop using fedex .
negative	i called the 0 - 000 number to reserve a unit ...
negative	confirmed it they even sent me a txt and email with the confirmation #...
negative	i drove 0 0 / 0hrs to the destination only to find that the place of business didn_'_t have a unit available .. thanx
negative	i exchanged my glasses because there were lines instead of the progressive no line .
negative	they recalculated the cost and gave_me a $_000 credit when i paid $_000 and charged my credit_card an_additional_$_000 without my knowledge nor consent .
negative	i have tried for more than a week to hear back from them after leaving multiple messages .
negative	because of the shipping time_frame ( i recently paid_extra for shipping and it still took days for the items to ship out , and i felt i got taken by paying extra ) i won_'_t be ordering anything_else from 00dollarmall . com
negative	not happy at all with the shipping process .
negative	entspricht garnicht den dargestellten stern . selbst die mitarbeiter meinten es_ist ein schlechteste zimmer . abrissbirne hat nicht getroffen .
negative	geek parts have great deals and easy to find parts for a girl looking for help and parts .
negative	i have really_enjoyed there response to me and will be coming_back over and over .
negative	staff on line was great on pc and on phone .
negative	great place to shop .
negative	the cheap dog chews were so tiny they were not even worth the price of shipping .
negative	even on sale .
negative	before cancelling my order i telephoned the customer_service line to explain that what they were asking was in direct contravention of my bank '_s security recommendations .
negative	i was told my order would not be processed without the scanned copy .
negative	i am sorry , the security of my bank funds is more important to me than the order .
negative	i live in australia and was trying to send a birthday_present to my son in charlotte , nc , usa .
negative	i am a very frequent internet shopper , my clothes are ordered from m & s and dispatched to australia , i purchase gifts from waitrose , john_lewis , amazon and many other specialist stores .
negative	i will not be using your site again .
negative	the hotel was in very bad condition .
negative	all night i smelled smoke all around .
negative	i could not get a receipt from the front_desk showing my total charges and then i found out that i was overcharged .
negative	thought i found gold !
negative	ad was very promising but doesn_'_t deliver .
negative	looked for pedigree dry_dog_food ( weight_control -- no chicken )-- none !
negative	looked for bil - jac -- dry_dog_food -- weight_control -- none !
negative	and the claim is -- good selection ?
negative	ha !
negative	(!
negative	*-- no rude service -- nothing to buy to give the opportunity for rude service !)
negative	we had to wait and wait for the driver and were told to drive round by the police .
negative	having unpacked the car with two small_children and then have to re pack we were not best pleased .
negative	we were told that there had been problems with this driver .
negative	surely a good reason to not use him again ?
negative	!
negative	i wouldn_'_t know .
negative	i still_haven_'_t received it yet .
negative	when and if i get this part , ask me this again and if it works , i '_ll give you a great review
negative	it takes_forever to get the books and there '_s no one to call and talk to it '_s all through email .
negative	i ordered 0 med blue harness , 0 black leash with blue light , and 0 med black collar with blue light .
negative	i received the harness and 0 collars .
negative	i called the company on 0 different days , only to have the music and message continue and it was definitely during their business hours .
negative	so i wrote an_email requesting the leash i purchased and saying that want to return everything else .
negative	they were sending me a leash at no cost and i was to return everything else for a refund .
negative	i received another black collar in the mail , still no sign of the leash .
negative	although they are responsive by email , it '_s annoying that they can '_t do a simple shipment correctly .
negative	the time and effort to get this correct and send back the wrong items is annoying .
negative	product feedback :
negative	the harness didn_'_t come with directions and was way too small for my 00_lb .
negative	medium dog .
negative	the good thing about it was that the light actually was lit throughout the entire section , which it was supposed to do .
negative	however , the black products with blue leashes are poorly made .
negative	the blue light is brightest by the power source and fades before getting to the other end of the collar .
negative	since i received 0 of them , i can attest that both of these were the same -- very poorly made .
negative	i sort of saw that on the website and dismissed it , but if you have a choice , don_'_t pick this option .
negative	bottom_line : the prices are cheap because the products are cheap .
negative	i '_m going to spend more money in the long run , but i know i '_m saving myself time and aggravation by not having to deal with this company .
negative	placed order online with promocode item order in xl .. received size l .. called to tell them about it .. got hispanic girl who did not speak or understand_english !!
negative	checked next_day .. imbecile never placed the order !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	reordered .. just got an_email order confirmation !!

negative	i ordered my product on 0 / 00 .
negative	credit_card charged .
negative	shipping info indicated 0 - 0 days for this size shipment .
negative	as of 0 / 00 still have not received product .
negative	i purchased a hotel room from priceline .
negative	the reservation provides a 0pm guaranteed check - in .
negative	my room was not ready until 0pm .
negative	priceline informed me it is not their fault because they don_'_t have control over the hotel '_s check - in time , and therefore couldn_'_t provide any compensation .
negative	i asked the priceline rep , " if you had my experience , would you use priceline again ?"
negative	he replied , " no i would not ."
negative	at_least priceline '_s employees are smarter than their business_practices .
negative	rate hikes should not be passed on to existing customers who are in effect a captive audience , i live on a fixed_income and a rate hike of $ 0 . 00 a month effects my bottom_line in the negative .
negative	everyone i have talked to is surprised and unbelieving that public_storage would raise my monthly rate , and all say the same thing " you are being taken_advantage of ", and " i have never had a storage company raise my rate like that , once you sign_up at one rate it should not change while you are still in that space ".!
negative	!
negative	this is not good advertising for your company and even_though you are a large presence in the las_vegas area , you are not the only storage .... and word of mouth is a powerful tool ..... and word of mouth says public_storage seems to be a greedy big corporation who takes advantage of its loyal paying customers !
negative	!
negative	an appalling experience , first the collection driver arrived on the day arranged but didn_'_t go to the pre_- arranged address to collect my package , so left without even leaving a card , then , when he came the following_day , when by luck i was in , had the audacity to tell me he hadn_'_t been given the information about collecting from a different address , it was obvious he was lying and attempting to cover up his mistake .
negative	it was then one week before he even sent the stuff to music_magpie , then , although i was sent updates on the progress , it was a painfully_slow process .
negative	almost a month from start to finish , will i use them again , not a chance , i have already warned friends who were going to send stuff , having seen the glossy tv ad , now they know the truth , they aren_'_t .
negative	ordered a scooter from killer motorsports and it was a nightmare from the beginning .
negative	no one called me back when i requested a tracking_number , and when it finally arrived it did not run .
negative	had to take it to a scooter repair facility which found a faulty starter .
negative	after numerous phone_calls to the warranty manager , she agreed to send the part , which never arrived .
negative	the worst customer_service i have ever_experienced .
negative	stay away from this company , as they will take your money and then not support their product .
negative	ordered for parents christmas flowers and as usual delivery compant clare '_s florist uses is useless
negative	non delivery 0st of all then when delivered late no notiification no knock nothing to say flowers had been delivered just dumped on the front doorstep to be found next_day destroyed !
negative	worst shopping_experience of my life .
negative	took my $_000 and it has_been months and still no dress .
negative	each time i order a replacement dress they take e order and then tell me the dress is sold out !
negative	ordered item and after a week contacted them to enquire where the package was and told that it was sent 0 days prior and to wait 0 days , waited 0 days and emailed , 0 days_later still no response , emailed again and waiting a reply ...
negative	we made a reservation at la_quinta inn on 0 / 0 / 0000 for 0 nights .
negative	the third night we stayed there the room had not done housekeeping and there were no towels for baths .
negative	we checked out the morning of 0 / 00 / 0000 not wanting to stay the 0th night due to service rendered .
negative	the motel was aware of the poor service and provided the night of 0 / 0 / 0000 complimentary .
negative	we was charged for all 0 nights by reservation_counter .
negative	we were then told we would get a refund for the night we did not stay but are not offering the complimentary night given by la_quinta inn for their poor service .
negative	we did not know we were doing_business with reservation_counter .
negative	we will never do_business with reservation_counter nor la_quinta inn due being completely unsatisfied with either service .
negative	we need to refunded for the complimentary night give us by the hotel along with the refund for the night we did not stay .
negative	we will tell all our friends and family about our dissatisfaction .
negative	they are now claiming that it '_s alright to sell food with even a 0 - moth expiration_date .
negative	my 0 dogs are pretty small and a 00lob .
negative	bag can last me a year .
negative	i buy bigger bags to save_money .
negative	i have been buying my supplies from pet_meds ,, pet000 , pet " food direct ,, etc .
negative	for at_least 0_yrs and they always give me fresh dry_food with expiration_dates ranging_from 00 - 00 months .
negative	ii suppose pet_flow is not concern if my dogs might get sick if i feed them with expired food .
negative	das auto war_die reinste schrottkiste , komplett verbeult , die reifen waren teilweise kaputt und_es_hat nach urin gestunken .
negative	mietsation war bk rent a car auf ibiza .
negative	rückgabe des wagens war am 00 . 00 . 0000 , meldung das die kaution nicht erstattet worden ist erfolgte am 00 . 00 . 0000 , und nun laufen wir unserer kaution hinterher und sunny car nimmt sich fein raus und sagt sie warten immer_noch auf eine antwort der mietstation .
negative	sie arbeiten aber mit hochdruck an der abschließenden klärung .
negative	unmöglich die kunden so lange auf ihre kaution warten zu lassen .
negative	wenn_man sich solche probleme ersparen möchte , sollte man sich besser anders orientieren .
negative	auf keinen fall weiter zu_empfehlen .
negative	i would not use this service again , we were not given the wedding rate .
negative	other people that connected to the hotel_directly were told that there was a cancellation_policy and that their card would not be charged until the actual stay .
negative	my telephone agent , immediately charged my card and advised that i could not cancel .
negative	i find it ridiculous that several attendees to the same wedding are given different stories .
negative	additionally , the agent put my on hold to wait for confirmation .
negative	my chase alert advised of the phone charge and my iphone indicated the confirmation several minutes before the agent came back on the line .
negative	i ordered 0 items and had to return two of them .
negative	that was on nov_00th .
negative	and can you believe i still have not been credited .
negative	in this day and age refunds should be made in a week .
negative	so i am not keen to do much more shopping with boohoo because i feel_like crying myself !
negative	i was dissapointed when i loaded my " new " ink_cartridge to find it was a used one that was identified by my computer as being " used ".
negative	it wasn_'_t very clear at the time of purchase as being used .
negative	everything went wrong - from the wrong product to wrong shipping address to wrong amount refunded - and there is no customer_service .
negative	this company should be reported .
negative	do not order from this company , i faxed and emailed them my prescription three_times , thinking they where already shipped , i get an e_- mail ( after they cashed my payment ) asking once again for the prescription to be sent !!
negative	i asked for a refund and it took six days to get refunded .
negative	will never use again --- order never delivered and no notification that delivery was delayed or not to be delivered .
negative	also order was placed 0 days in advance ( not the day of or day before ) and amount was charged / deducted from account immediately .
negative	as of now , the order status now says " out for redelivery " and no lines are available to speak to customer_service .
negative	i am extremely upset with the way the order was handled , no update or information that the arrangement was not going to be delivered until the end of the day when the arrangement never arrived per the person_who was supposed to receive .
negative	i will never use ava '_s flowers again in the future and will be sure to not to recommend to anyone_else in the future .
negative	the worst part is that i had an order ready to go with 0000flowers and chose ava '_s flowers based off their reviews instead , with the peace of mind that ava '_s would deliver .
negative	will never use again .
negative	how embarrassing it was to find out at the end of the evening that the mothers_day arrangement was not received , with zero notification from ava '_s flowers .
negative	i ordered 0 bunches of flowers that should have contained tulips and roses , i was told that if the tulips were out of season ( i feel the bunch shouldn_'_t be on the web_site if out of season ) they would be substituted for other flowers , a list was provided below and no where did it say they would be substituted for cheap unfashionable carnations !
negative	i was very surprised that now all of their conversations with their customers are recorded or they could have been deleted .
negative	i wanted to make a change to my trip to honolulu last christmas by refunding my return trip only in exchange to purchase a flight to hong_kong from honolulu instead .
negative	the representative on the phone the first time i called in october suggested me to change my itinerary when i am physically in honolulu .
negative	i did what the representative suggested and called travelocity again to find out that since the first trip was already made , i cannot receive a partial_refund .
negative	i called united and that was a dead end .
negative	i talked to the supervisor and asked him to review the recorded conversation from the last time i called to fix what the previous the problem that the representative have caused .
negative	the supervisor didn_'_t do anything .
negative	because of that incident , i lost over $_000 and my loyalty to this company .
negative	i am moving to expedia . com instead !
negative	sorry your customer_service is not true to its promises .
negative	this service gap will only cause your business to plummet further .
negative	i booked a flight from sydney to nyc a few_weeks_ago .
negative	paid in full .
negative	money charged to my credit_card .
negative	today , i '_m told " the airline " cancelled the flight and want to replace it with a flight the next_day .
negative	timing mattered when i booked .
negative	i had to beg for a refund ( put on hold for a long time ) and then was told that they would rebook a flight but the prices would be way higher because i had booked weeks_ago !
negative	well , that was the point !
negative	i booked weeks_ago at the lowest_price and didn_'_t expect them to just cancel and leave me hanging .
negative	they should have offered to rebook a flight with the same time_frame and they should have absorbed the additional_cost .
negative	don_'_t deal with these people .
negative	when i asked to speak to a manager , i was put on hold and no one ever came back on the line .
negative	travelocity changed my flight reservation without my authorization or permission .
negative	this company is the worse .
negative	can '_t call and speak to a live_person .
negative	i was stranded and needed to speak to someone live and requested a call back and never did receive a call , just an_email .
negative	then , you guys sent the wrong part and i am still_waiting on a credit .
negative	i had to go through a different company to get the correct_part .
negative	horrible service .
negative	can someone please call me ?
negative	i '_ve paid for health insurance months_ago and i '_ve only been charged once i '_ve never received a card i need my insurance every time i call i get put on hold for over an_hour and i have to hang up ... i '_m very upset and want to speak with someone i need insurance i '_m free tomorrow from 0 : 00_pm on my cell is 000 0000000 thank_you
negative	the worst company i have ever_dealt_with between them and their sister company hotwire . comthey have about ruined my vacation i have been billed 0 times for the same room and air flight i have had numerous phone_calls to both companies with very little help i am still_waiting on a refund they tried to tell me if my credit_card must have been stolen so the thief book the room next to mine on the same night i was there these people need to figure_out how to run a business and actually give customer_service
negative	the worst_experience in my life between expedia and their sister company hotwire they have about ruined my vacation i have been charged 0 times for the same room and the same flight and nobody seems to want to give me my refund they promised immediate service but leave a message and will get back to you in 00_hours i wouldn_'_t send my ex husband to do_business with this company
negative	i purchased two products through northshore_care_supply .
negative	i am extremely disappointed with both .
negative	i called to inquire_about a refund but i was told that i will not be issued any .
negative	in addition , i would have to pay for the return .
negative	:(
negative	they shipped the wrong part .
negative	the item number was totally wrong .
negative	i sent an_email to get an exchange and they said i have to get a refund and reorder .
negative	i do not think this is good customer_service !
negative	they made the mistake and will not fix it .
negative	i will not be ordering from this company again .
negative	i booked a hotel in ca and luckily saw a day before my arrival that it was charged to my credit_card in full !
negative	i was never told this would be the case and immediately called to cancel .
negative	then i booked directly to the hotel .
negative	i am hoping the refund is processed more quickly than the 00 days they say it may take , because it clearly only took them one day to charge me !
negative	still_waiting 0weeks on from when i placed the order .
negative	boohoo needs to change delivery company !
negative	boohoo as a company is ok but they do take a long time ( 0days ) to respond to emails and the automated responce is really annoying !
negative	would be better to have a phone_number to be able to talk to an actual_person .
negative	never bought anything before from boohoo and i definitely won_'_t be using them in the future !
negative	i have nothing good to say about this place other then the rooms are some what clean .
negative	from the second we arrived the front_desk person checking us in was very rude and when we had asked questions like " when is breakfast " and " what time is check out " she acted_like we were asking major questions and had no time for it .
negative	then we went to go in the pool and hot_tub ( only_thing we were looking_forward to ) and well the hot_tub was ice cold so could not enjoy that , then we went to go swimming with the kids and that to was so cold that even my kids were only in there for about 00_minutes and wanted to get out ( you know its cold when your kids are shivering ).
negative	the manager ( i believe ) lives there and they were cooking something that stunk up the entire hall way .
negative	the walls were so paper thin we could hear the tv from room next to us .
negative	yes the price is cheap but so not worth saving the extra $_00 .
negative	four of the seven items i ordered were not delivered .
negative	i ordered replacement cartridges for my new epson xp - 000 printer .
negative	installed the cartridge and it worked once , and then started skipping lines , and then nothing .
negative	not sure how to go about getting a refund .
negative	i had good results with a canon_printer so this is very disappointing .
negative	not too happy i have not received my oreder yet !!!
negative	!
negative	help
negative	i ordered a driver_side_mirror for a chevy impala and received a passenger_side_mirror for honda_crv .
negative	0 days i could not create a ticket on their website and you cannot reach anyone by telephone .
negative	finally was able to create a ticket and after more than 0_weeks i now have an_email_stating my money was refunded .
negative	how ridiculous .
negative	i wanted a shipping label to return the mirror and get the correct one .
negative	now you just gave_me a free mirror since i still have it and no way to get in touch with you people unless i send another damn email and continue to wait and wait .
negative	the most ridiculous business i '_ve ever_dealt_with with such poor customer_service , not that i '_ve received much service !
negative	i ordered 0 made to measure_blinds , i received 0 of which 0 were not mine , when i called 000 blinds they told me the order had been mixed up with another clients and i would get mine when i returned the incorrect ones , as i wouldnt release the incorrect ones until my order was put right the i was then told i was inconviencing their client and they catorgorically refused to send me my correct order until their other client got the order that had been delivered to me although they had been fully paid for my order .
negative	0_weeks_later after many calls and emails i received a refund for the missing blinds and told to dispose of the blinds that had been sent to me incorrectly ... why couldnt they do this in the 0st instance instead of making me wait .
negative	i will never use this company again and had to laugh when they sent me an_email to rate their service , they dont deserve the 0_star_rating that i have had to give them .
negative	not happy at all with the no service i received , i placed my order received my confirmation which said your meal would be ready in 00 - 00_mins ... after 00_mins i called the restaurant to find out where our order was and was told they wasn_'_t delivering that particular night and takeaway . com were informed of this , and when i asked why nobody had the courtesy to call me to let_me know they said this is not customary ... yeah to right it wasn_'_t customary so i wont be using either takeaway . com or the restaurant again !!!
negative	i dont want to rate with any stars but unless i do i cant post this comment so i '_ve had to rate it with star !
negative	!
negative	maybe printed about 00 sheets documents )
negative	delivery 00 days late , never advised .
negative	no satisfactory outcome to my complaints - just a number to a customer advisor each time .
negative	not value for money .
negative	looks like lots of other customers experienced the same .
negative	a very special_occasions ruined .
negative	whilst i understand a package can get mixed up every now and again , going online i find that i am definitely not the only one having_trouble with delivery .
negative	after recieving somebody elses order i was left completely in the dark about what was happening to my order for over a week and no way to directly contact boohoo as they have no phone_number .
negative	i had to resort to the facebook_page with the many many other customers just to get an answer on what was happening .
negative	i have ended_up with no clothes and still no refund yet 0_weeks after the order was placed and had no option in whether i was to get a refund or my items sent to me .
negative	i sent my designer_glasses for reglazing as they were pretty new and i needed to change my prescription .
negative	i sent them recorded delivery , plus paid the extra postage for safe return of them once they were done to make_sure they were insured if the went missing .
negative	i placed my order on 00th_june and they arrived on 00th_july , which isn_'_t bad atall as they order the lenses in ... however the one of the lenses wasn_'_t sat correctly in the frame , so i sent them a complaint including 0 photographs of the problem , via their online complaint service .
negative	00_hours_later i received a response asking me to send another photograph as the original wasn_'_t clear , so i did , then another 00_hours after that i receive a response saying return them with a returns note which they attached in the email and include my prescription .
negative	there was no freepost address or offer of refunding postage , so i assumed i would have to pay another £ 0 . 00 to post them recorded delivery which i think is a bit_steep considering it was their poor service .
negative	i sent them another message asking about refund for postage , and blow me another 00_hours_later , i was told they would refund £ 0 . 00 maximim , so in total i have paid £_00 . 00 for postage and only £ 0 . 00 will be refunded .
negative	i am going to try and fix it myself instead .
negative	they are a joke , and would advise anyone looking for glasses to use lensway or glasses_direct , and if you want reglazing try a few high_st opticians instead of this shower .
negative	i also ordered from them on february 0th .
negative	today is february 00rd & i have seen no sign of shipment !
negative	i did actually get two responses the first time i asked questions , but i '_ve asked 0 questions since then & has not been answered yet !
negative	i spent $_00 on a psp & wish i wouldn_'_t have !
negative	ugh !
negative	i am getting very frustrated & all the bad_reviews does not make this any better !!
negative	!
negative	ordered on 0 / 0 .
negative	order confirmation said items would be shipped beginning of april .
negative	my fiancé chatted on - line and called previously in which we were assured the order was shipped .
negative	last conversation stated we would received the order by this past weekend .
negative	no order received , no notice stating why the delay .
negative	my fiancé just ' chatted ' again today , obviously now annoyed as we would like to get the garden planted and this is the below conversation ( yes , he is now annoyed , as am i !)
negative	will never order from here again if we even ever get the order .
negative	poor service all around .
negative	please_note - this is the first review i have ever given , so that should tell you a lot on the quality of service received - which is none .
negative	****
negative	[_cathy ] hello , my name is cathy .
negative	how may i help you ?
negative	[ dan ] im checking on the status of my order .
negative	order # is ********, placed on 0 / 0 / 00
negative	[_cathy ] please hold while i access the account .
negative	[_cathy ] the order will likely ship the week of 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	[_cathy ] you will be notified via_email with tracking_information when the order leaves our facility .
negative	[ dan ] i was told last_week it would ship likely by the end of last_week
negative	[_cathy ] that may have been the case last_week ,
negative	[_cathy ] but it was just an estimate .
negative	[_cathy ] until the order is in ship status all the dates are estimates .
negative	[ dan ] wow , ok i guess its when ever i get it then
negative	[_cathy ] great .
negative	[_cathy ] thanks for using chat today .
negative	[ dan ] im sorry for wanted to know when im going to receive my order and hoping to receive a date when i will get it .
negative	it appears i will just have to wait .
negative	you have a great day !
negative	update_: never responded to my fiancé email on monday or mine yesterday .
negative	again , poor customer_service .
negative	i have been sent an_email to review this company and product
negative	however i haven_'_t even been told who the courier will be or the expected delivery date of the item i have purchased so am finding it very difficult to comment !
negative	one of the worst companies we have ever_dealt_with .
negative	they do not apprise you of their actions and just do as they please .
negative	recently , they determined we owed a small fee , ($_00 ), supposedly from six years_ago -- who could prove this now ?
negative	the fee was paid and for over a week , they kept us dangling , lying with every phone_call that it takes a few_days to reactivate our account .
negative	the last phone_call resulted in paypal closing the account .
negative	why ?
negative	simply because they wanted to , no reasons were given other than they chose not to do_business with us again .
negative	oh , yes , another point ... they will refund your money in 000 days ; we have asked our clients to demand paypal refund their money .
negative	we have lost these customers forever and have gone to heartland , a normal credit_card processor .
negative	everything is fine with paypal , until its not .
negative	when will that be ?
negative	that '_s the point , it '_s up to them .
negative	we would have happily rated them no stars , but that is not an option .
negative	i have not received my order yet and it has_been well over a week .
negative	the delivery was slow , and they just stuffed the product in my mailbox which did not allow me to reject the delivery because i had already bought something_else .
negative	i got a ketoconazole / chlorohexidine shampoo - the product was poor quality , it was weak and watery and a waste of money .
negative	see comment section for a second update
negative	*** update ***
negative	i '_m beginning to doubt whether i even have authentic oliver peoples glasses , considering this company hasn_'_t bothered responding to my last few emails , which are regarding their offer to give me a $_00 credit on my purchase if i reviewed their company here and at another site .
negative	guess once they lock in the sale and good reviews , all their_promises go right out the window .
negative	i '_ll never do_business with opticsfast again .
negative	" loved that they mentioned their price match_guarantee and worked with me to do just that .
negative	answers were pretty prompt .
negative	shipping time was decent , especially_since free .
negative	i just wish they would put the frame sizes somewhere .
negative	i had to ask if i could get a 00 or if it was a 00 .
negative	they told me i would just enter my preference at checkout .
negative	had the size info been available right_away , i wouldn_'_t have had to bother with an_email to them and thus waiting to place an order .
negative	only other complaint is the 00_% restocking_fee .
negative	it '_s really hard to know what glasses will look like on your face .
negative	but it seems all the online eyeglass companies impose this charge .
negative	the glasses themselves are in perfect_condition and came nicely_packaged . "
negative	i will never use travelocity again , they are worthless
negative	i ordered from ami clubear about three_weeks in advance from the day i was going on vacation ...
negative	i ordered 00 items in total , i received my order about two_weeks_later just to open the box and see everything in there was nothing i ordered so i called them uo and they were really nice about it and emailed me a return_label to send back the box of items i did not order and said they would over night me my order the next_day so i waited no order came in so i called them up again so they had bad_news they only had 0 of my 00 items in and i could either find something_else or get the rest refunded to my card ... so i told them just to refund my card and again i was told they were going to overnight my box still a week_later no refund no box . received a voice_mail on a friday at 0 : 00_pm " sorry for the inconvenience but your package will not be sent overnight if you have any questions call us back during business hours mon - friday blah , blah , blah ,... by then i was already going on my trip and thanks to them had to go and buy different outfits ,,,, they really suck and this is the first and last time this happens to me because i wont be ordering from them anymore !!!!
negative	lost a very good customer because i love shopping oh well
negative	i ordered a discounted card from giftcards . com .
negative	i ordered at the 0th of the month .
negative	i have normally received my gift_card within 0 - 0_weeks of ordering , so when i didn_'_t receive my card after two_weeks , i called customer_service .
negative	i was told that i needed to give it another week as sometimes it can take up to 0_weeks for a card to be delivered .
negative	i said that i had noticed on my invoice that for the amount that i had ordered , that it was listed as $ 0 and that this was strange , since it wasn_'_t ever like that .
negative	but , i was told that it didn_'_t mean anything .
negative	i waited another week and after having failed to receive it after 0_weeks , i called back .
negative	i talked again to customer_service who told me that a ticket would be opened .
negative	then , i received an_email_saying that it had been resolved ( and it had not ).
negative	so , i called back and talked to some other person_who said that i would have to wait to get a lost card email and would have to solve it that way ( something like that ), and then before we hung_up , she saw that the card actually was not in inventory and that she would submit a refund and that i would have to wait another 0 - 0 days to get my money back .
negative	she only said that they were sorry as something must have happened in their system when i had ordered .
negative	i think that having to make three calls on my part to find out that the card wasn_'_t even in inventory is absolutely unacceptable and that if i hadn_'_t called , i would not have gotten a refund .
negative	and , after having gone_through all this trouble and getting nothing at the end , a simple " i '_m sorry " is not acceptable .
negative	it is really unbelievable to me that someone from giftcards . com hadn_'_t caught this error earlier and notified me .
negative	don_'_t buy from supplement_warehouse -- here '_s what happened to me :
negative	i ordered two supplements , totaling $_00 .
negative	postage was $ 0 +.
negative	they say that their price for the supplements are the best so they can '_t give free_shipping .
negative	a week_later , they send me an_email that they are out of one of the supplements , so they are refunding me the $ 0 .
negative	well , no refund is given on the shipping , so i am paying $ 0 + for shipping a $_00 bottle of supplement .
negative	that really brings the price of the supplement up to $_00 .
negative	be careful on their bait and switch on their postage and their " low price guarantee ."
negative	this company is a complete fraud !!!
negative	i will never do_business with this company !
negative	i ordered a molding piece for the grille on my 0000_hyundai tucson and when i received the part , it was broken in 0 pieces .
negative	it was sent in a box that was half the size of the actual grille , which i thought was odd when i received the package from the mailman .
negative	and was absolutely disgusted when i opened the box .
negative	i brought the product to my autobody guy just to make_sure i wasn_'_t crazy , and he told me that whoever packed the grill had to break it into 0 pieces to get it to fit in that box .
negative	i cannot_believe that this company has employees who would do such a thing .
negative	of course they don_'_t have a customer_service phone line to call , so i had to file a complaint with the company online and now have to wait to hear from them .
negative	i had to cancel my appointment with my autobody guy because of this .
negative	a complete inconvenience to me and a disgrace how this part was package and sent .
negative	buyer_beware !!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered the parts never recieved them , send me a email_stating i was going to be given a credit no reason for the credit !
negative	'_ve rented from enterprise four times in the past two months ( they ' re the closest car_rental company from where i live ).
negative	in spite of the fact i '_ve been renting with them regularly and am always dealing_with the same people , they have made zero commercial gestures .
negative	they require you to come in with a paycheck stub or a utility bill in your name .
negative	even_though i '_ve rented 0 times in less_than 0 months with them , they still want me to bring a utility bill .
negative	i ran_into a big hassle with my printer and called to see if i could bring something on a flash_drive .
negative	they said they could not open anything from a flash_drive ( i '_ve seen them print google_maps directions from their computers so they ' re not restricted in what they can do on the machines ).
negative	so much for making things easier .
negative	the people who work there are not all pleasant .
negative	i '_ve only been to a small west michigan office so i don_'_t know if it '_s the same everywhere .
negative	anyway , a couple people are always making an effort to smile and be helpful .
negative	one guy always complains about how hard his job is and the one lady seems so confused about what is going on it '_s painful to watch .
negative	i talked to her on the phone and after telling her my name , explaining that i had rented from their location before , she pulled my info on her computer .
negative	the first thing she asks is my address to make_sure i '_m calling the nearest location .
negative	at first she tells_me the only option i have is an intermediate_car at 00 : 00 ( she makes it clear there is absolutely nothing else ).
negative	i explain that 00 : 00 is not going to work for me , and that i need something earlier ... all of a sudden she has 0 different classes of vehicles available for 0 : 00 .
negative	i understand scheduling car_rentals is not easy but lying to customers is not the best way to do it .
negative	the fess are correct , the prices for the vehicles increase in function of the size and what you spend on the vehicle itself is reasonable .
negative	then there is a $_00 a day fee if you ' re under 00 ( it '_s $_00 a day , not for the whole rental ).
negative	the part that really bothers me is the insurance they sell you .
negative	the insurance is not included in the quote they give you over the phone and they don_'_t even mention the insurance over the phone .
negative	the first time i rented a car with them , i fill_out the paperwork inside , we go take a look at the car and there i am told that they offer an insurance and that it '_s $_00 a day .
negative	i '_m really surprised at this point and don_'_t really want to spend an_additional_$_00 , and after waiting 0 min in the freezing weather the enterprise employee finally caves in and tells_me i can also subscribe to their basic plan , which costs only $_00 a day .
negative	from then on i just told them i wanted the $_00 plan right_away since they apparently don_'_t want to tell customers about the cheapest option ?
negative	and they also take $_000 ( they call it a deposit ) and then refund everything to your account except the cost of the rental + insurance .
negative	the vehicles are overall pretty good .
negative	i '_ve rented a suv from them and the vehicle was really nice , same with an intermediate size vehicle ( except for the car charger that had no power ?).
negative	i '_ve also rented one of their small disposable vehicles and would not recommend it ( ticking noise coming from the motor , the gears were really rough , etc ..)
negative	i ordered 0 cards with each one for a different child .
negative	six ( 0 ) had the same name on them .
negative	i am not happy !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	this company is a complete fraud .
negative	they are advertising one price then charging you another .
negative	i found a great looking pair of sun_glasses that i when thought the whole purchasing process .
negative	then i received an_email that said that they needed o speak with me .
negative	i called them and they said that i had paid the incorrect amount ; she said that when she had the correct amount she would call me back .
negative	then when i received a call back the customer_service that i spoke with was a bunch of bullies .
negative	she would not allow me to speak ( continually talking over me ) and telling_me how they were going to charge me an_additional 000_+ dollars for sunglasses that i had already paid for .
negative	i am now having to wait for the charge to appear on my credit_card so i can go thought the dispute process .
negative	i placed a $_000 . 00 order ... never got a confirmation_email .
negative	i was charged for the product but never received it .
negative	their phone_number is d /_c .
negative	they do not reply to emails .
negative	deb
negative	recently needed black and color cartridges which came in record_time .
negative	installed both .
negative	problem is at first all suppose to be in black came out in green and now sometimes blue .
negative	this is not the first time i have had a problem with cartridges .
negative	when we eventually got through to the telephone_number given ( which took at_least 00_minutes ) we were told we were not even on the list for the car to be collected .
negative	a driver was then dispatched which didn_'_t take that long .
negative	on our return we rang to find out why the delivery of our car was taking so long and we were told it had gone to the wrong terminal .
negative	overall we would not use this company again .
negative	i ordered several items during the week of cyber_monday .
negative	that thursday i received a message_stating that 00 of the 00 items i ordered were on backorder and that my entire order would ship when they were back in stock ( approx 0 - 0 days ).
negative	i received a shipping notification on december_0th .
negative	when my order finally arrived on the 00th , only 0 of the items i ordered were in the package .
negative	there was no packing_slip or explanation on why some items were missing from the package .
negative	when i log_into my online account , the missing items have been removed from my order entirely .
negative	i never received any notification that those items were not being sent or that they were being cancelled from my order .
negative	i posted on their facebook_wall concerning this and someone replied with the head of customer_service email address and told me to contact him directly .
negative	i did so on monday and i have yet to receive a response .
negative	i am highly unsatisfied and disappointed with this entire experience .
negative	i had to find last_minute replacement gifts ( all costing me more money ) since i did not receive all of my order and the lack of responsiveness in this matter is completely_unacceptable .
negative	i will not be shopping here again .
negative	ever .
negative	ordered bully_sticks and they looked pretty old and dried out .
negative	still , i gave my dog one thinking they ' re cheaper quality but not actually bad .
negative	i was wrong .
negative	my dog got very sick and had diarrhea for three_days .
negative	won_'_t ever order from here again .
negative	i placed a 00 . 00 order last_week and was very excited in anticipation of receiving the products .
negative	i was very disappointed to say the least in the very cheaply_made products .
negative	the pig_ears were transparent , the bully_sticks were very thin , etc .
negative	even at the discounted price you offer this was still a ripoff !
negative	i contacted customer_service regarding the issue and got nowhere .
negative	i have ordered from chewy . com and petfooddirect . com and the products are so much_better .
negative	i will never use petflo again and am passing along the word on how poor their products and customer_service are .
negative	read the letter i recently sent to corporate , a copy of which i emailed a copy to this address as well .
negative	it '_s too long to cut and paste here .
negative	my letter describes in detail my experience , and it was not a positive one .
negative	after receiving my wisteria , i went to the recommended website and planted it according to the directions .
negative	it has now been in the ground for a week .
negative	at first it looked good , but now the leaves are wilting , drying and falling_off .
negative	every day it looks worse and worse .
negative	there is also some rust discoloration on some of the leaves .
negative	i am beginning to think you sent me a diseased plant and am quite dissatisfied .
negative	i recently booked a business class ticket on expedia traveling to europe .
negative	i had to cancel and rebook .
negative	i was on the phone 0 different times and each time i encountered a foreigner who couldn_'_t understand i wanted to travel to nice not venice .
negative	one even went so_far as to book the venice ticket even after i gave him the airport code .
negative	when i finally got on the line and did the booking i found the itinerary i wanted on their website and saved it in my itinerary so they could see exactly_what i was looking for .
negative	they were not able to bring up the flights and see what i was seeing on their website .
negative	they finally came back ( after almost two hours on the phone and multiple 00 minute holds and told me i would have to pay an_additional_$ 0 , 000 even_though i was on their website and the cost shown was $ 0 , 000 less .
negative	never , ever book on expedia .
negative	i placed my order last tuesday and have not received official confirmation and tracking as_promised .
negative	the order has not been delivered as yet .
negative	and i had assumed from lack of communication from shima_uma that my order had not even gone_through , was therefore very surprised to receive this email_asking for my feedback , i would much rather have email_confirming my order and expected delivery date !
negative	the ordering procedure was very vague - no item description or picture to clarify what was being ordered .
negative	the big selling point was free delivery and that you stocked some envelopes that i have searching for on different sites and your prices were very reasonable .
negative	i have yet to be impressed with your service - at the moment i am very disappointed !
negative	i put $_00 . 00 dollars which should give me about 00_minutes of talk time to haiti , but i had a deceiving experience where rebtel kept on shortening my time and constantly ask for more money .
negative	i ended_up talking for about 00 ish minutes and i had to recharge the card .
negative	if it walks like a duck ....
negative	this company is not one i use a lot , but i have used several_times in the last 0 months to much regret .
negative	i am a consumer with a paypal and buymelater account ( they solicited me for ) and both have been nightmares !
negative	i say both because while paypay does own buy me later they refuse to take_responsibility for billing issues there .
negative	this company sets out to establish themselves in your financial portfolio and then all benefits come to them , when you have a problem it '_s the run_around .
negative	i hung_up after 00_minutes on the phone trying to resolve / complain_about a refund i received being " held " by paypal that was made by angie '_s list - instead i '_m using the next 00_minutes to make my voice heard on rating sites .
negative	paypal - you need to wake_up to the new economy , predatory lending , banking , services may still be out there , but we are not going to stand by as consumers and just watch your exploitation of the american consumer .
negative	i booked either an expedition or excursion from budget because it specifically said it would hold 0 passengers and 0 pieces of luggage .
negative	the confirmation just said suv or similar which i thought odd since i knew i selected the ford since a tahoe holds 0 or 0 .
negative	when i showed_up to get my car i had a tahoe .
negative	at first the agent said it would only hold 0 .
negative	then he kept trying to upsell me to a suburban .
negative	of course what i booked wasn_'_t available .
negative	since we were with a big group we took this car and gave friends one of our passengers and some luggage .
negative	when we got to the car it did hold 0 but couldn_'_t hold our_luggage .
negative	so now i know why it said suv or similar on my recept .
negative	i had no proof of what i booked .
negative	the ol bait and switch .
negative	me email says the package has_been delivered and have no package ?
negative	wth ???
negative	?
negative	naturally there isnt a phone # to call , ughhh
negative	seemed a great buy nice lamp almost_half price .
negative	dissapointed and shocked to see same lamp in local diy store two_days_later at half the price i paid litecraft .
negative	litecraft claimed it was a different model but lamp was identical in every_detail even down to warning labels user fitting insructions etc .
negative	would advise to check other_websites before buying anything good chance it will be a good bit cheaper !
negative	!
negative	i received the part i ordered in a couple of days but when we open the box it was broken .
negative	i call the same day .
negative	no answer left a message but still have not received a call back .
negative	i have filled out the form on the website but have heard_anything on it either .
negative	this was on 00 - 00 - 00 .
negative	i have called 0 or 0 times more .
negative	no answer .
negative	i needed this in 0 days it ended_up being 0 days i paid 00 for shipping when i called the girl told me there was no way to track it but right on the website they have a place to enter the fedex #.
negative	i will never use this service again or refer anyone to it .
negative	wish i had read the reviews before i spent the money ...
negative	box was all riped up one of the parts was broken trying to contact u people on hold forever then get hung_up on .
negative	not happy .

negative	i ordered shoes on two_separate days since they were having a great sale .
negative	they emailed me saying i will receive a tracking_number when they ship .
negative	they never sent me that email .
negative	almost 0_weeks_later after i ordered my 0nd shipment i received one of my orders but it was the 0nd order i placed .
negative	where was my first order ??
negative	i emailed them three_times asking where my red heels were and they never got back to me .
negative	i then called them four times and i was on hold for 00_min every time till a machine came on to leave a message .
negative	i left one and still never received a callback .
negative	i finally get an_email yesterday confirming there was a " problem " with their system and they are working on it .
negative	then i get another email this morning saying my shoes were damaged so they are going to refund me in the next 0 days so we will see if that happens .
negative	if not i am filling a claim since i payed threw paypal .
negative	all in all bad customer_service !
negative	they have nice products but its not worth the hassle of wondering when you will receive what you bought since they don_'_t communicate with you .
negative	& its funny that their warehouse is about 00min away from where i live but it takes_forever for them to ship .
negative	i also follow their page on facebook and they are always posting new products and things all throughout the day but they can '_t make_sure that their customers are being taking_care of first .
negative	it seems like they are one of those companies who just likes taking your money instead of making that extra_effort to keep you wanting their business .
negative	i have read numerous bad_reviews and complaints about this site but i still gave the benefit of the doubt by ordering and now i see what those people were talking_about .
negative	never again will i be visiting this site or ordering from them .
negative	i rather pay more for nice shoes somewhere_else where they appreciate their customers .
negative	i wouldn_'_t recommend this service at all .
negative	i ordered a bottle of vodka and it arrived 0 days_later .
negative	i needed the alcohol that night because i had friends over .
negative	we waited and waited .
negative	no email letting_me know when it would arrive .
negative	when i placed the order the website read it would be delivered same day .
negative	i placed a complaint and customer_service did nothing about it .
negative	my experience was awful .
negative	i ordered a body lift , and the money was taken right_away .
negative	when a week had passed , and i hadn_'_t heard_anything , i called .
negative	apparently , a machine broke and you couldn_'_t fill the order .
negative	i was never notified of any_problems , nor given any other options as to what to do .
negative	it has now been three_weeks since i made the purchase , and i received an_email two_days ago that it was finally shipped .
negative	yeah , thanks for the notification on that ... i am so disappointed , and will never order from you again .
negative	i was very impressed with your speed of delivery !
negative	however , after installing one of each colour , my son printed off 0 practice sheets to make_sure all was well .
negative	these seemed to be in order although slightly different shades of blue etc_., than previous inks had given .
negative	why then did i go to print a black and white voucher off 0 days_later and the page was blank except for a faint appearance of the logo on left hand corner .
negative	i now wonder_if your prices are good , because the ink_cartridges are almost empty ?!!!!
negative	not impressed .
negative	i bought a wowcher for a product from cougar it was faulty and neither wowcher or cougar wanted to know .
negative	i ordered two new tyres and booked kwik_fit '_s mobile service to come out to fit the tyres the following_day .
negative	i received a voicemail_message from michael at kwik_fit about 00_minutes after booking to confirm the order and date the fitting would take place .
negative	i was advised the fitter would called 00_minutes before arriving ( the fitting times are 0 :_00am to 0 :_00pm ).
negative	the following_day , i waited and waited and waited .
negative	at around 0 :_00pm , i still hadn_'_t had a phone_call from the fitter so called kwik_fit mobile on 0000 000 0000 .
negative	the number rang out for 0 minutes then i hung_up .
negative	i called back at around 0 :_00pm and again the number range our for 00_minutes before i frustratedly hung_up .
negative	i then emailed kfm - operations @ kwik - fit . com at 0 :_00pm asking for someone / anyone to contact me to let_me know what was going on .
negative	i left work at 0pm , still without a phone_call or email from anyone at kwik_fit .
negative	at 0 :_00pm , i had a missed call from a random number on my phone ( i was driving and couldn_'_t pick_up ).
negative	i called the number back at 0 :_00pm and it was the fitter who was apparently ' on his way ' but i ' d ' probably left work now '.
negative	i asked why no one had contacted me all day and he said the tyres hadn_'_t been delivered until lunchtime and that he wasn_'_t happy with them but this still didn_'_t explain_why i hadn_'_t had a phone_call to explain this !
negative	i said that i wasn_'_t very happy with the poor customer_service and that i understand everyone runs late and mistakes with tyres can happen but i should '_ve been informed about this earlier on in the day .
negative	i could '_ve then made alternative arrangements to stay at work later .
negative	i explained i ' d called 0000 000 0000 and the fitter said the hq in scotland are difficult to get hold of .
negative	i '_m not sure why this number is on the confirmation_email if this is the case !
negative	i finally received an_apology but to be honest , it didn_'_t sound particularly genuine and i felt that the fitter was running_late and just couldn_'_t be bothered to come out to me as it was after 0 :_00pm .
negative	i arranged for the fitter to fit my tyres the following_day and thankfully , he arrived and fitted the tyres without a problem .
negative	i ' d also received an_email from kwik_fit at 0 :_00am to say ' mick ' had left a voicemail_message on my phone to explain what had happened .
negative	i hadn_'_t had a missed call or voicemail_message from anyone called mick so i '_m not sure what that was about .
negative	the fitter was called mark so perhaps there was some miscommunication at kwik_fit but mark hadn_'_t left a voicemail_message in any case !
negative	overall , i thought the customer_service i received was appalling .
negative	if you state the fitting hours are 0 :_00am to 0 :_00pm , then you need to adhere to them .
negative	if , for any reason , the fitter cannot be there in between those hours on that day , the customer needs to be informed at some point during the day before 0 :_00pm and the fitting re - arranged asap .
negative	the customer shouldn_'_t have to desperately try and contact kwik_fit , calling an 00 number charged at 00p_per_minute and any other number they can find on your website to find they can '_t get through to anyone .
negative	i believe the treatment i received was totally_unprofessional , especially for such a well_known company .
negative	this was the first time i ' d used kwik_fit and it will certainly be my last .
negative	i wouldn_'_t recommend kwik_fit to any of my friends or family .
negative	i sent you an e_- mail explaining the reasons for one of my purchases expiring , which i felt were valid .
negative	in response i believed i had been treated with disdain and extremely patronized ( perhaps you have a copy of my reply to same response )
negative	i understand that " rules are rules " but i would have hoped to have been listened to and at_least met half way .
negative	sent them several emails regarding leaking cans of cat_food .
negative	even_though i received two emails in reply saying they were on the case and i ' d hear from them in 00_hours ( turned_out to be several days ) a representative emailed me saying they hadn_'_t gotten an_email from me regarding the problem .
negative	i '_ve switched to amazon .
negative	i don_'_t appreciate being lied to and treated like an_idiot , particularly after buying hundreds of dollars in cat_food over a two year period .
negative	my daughter lives in new_zealand .
negative	what a great idea e_mail voucher
negative	wrong !
negative	boo_hoo cant help that you have different currencies
negative	your mother will have to shop for you
negative	wrong
negative	the e_mail adressee and the recipient of the voucher are not the same email
negative	surprise surprise
negative	its an_email gift voucher from 0 email address to another !!!!!!

negative	i ordered to a top and a pair of jeans and paid .
negative	the next_day i had an_email to say the top was no_longer in the seasons catalogue so i couldn_'_t buy it but they would send the jeans .
negative	the jeans arrived , they weren_'_t the ones i ordered , emailed customer_service to tell them to send the correct ones but i had to post the wrong ones back first and then they would send them .
negative	sent the jeans back then got an_email to say the jeans i ordered originally were not available !
negative	they would send a different pair !
negative	they must have known this when i put my order in , i '_m not happy with this .
negative	i ordered 0 items online neither were available and i was told this after i purchased and they tried to send a similar item .
negative	i won_'_t use this website again !
negative	i ordered a 00lb .
negative	bag of chia seeds that came with a hole in the bag .
negative	as i took the bag out of the box the chia spilled all over my basement floor and the freezer i was attempting to unload them into .
negative	although i was able to salvage some of the chia i lost a great deal of chia .
negative	i placed what i saved in containers without holes since the existing packaging was ripped .
negative	i called customer_service asking what they could do to replace what was lost .
negative	i explained that i did not loss all the chia and would understand if they couldn_'_t replace a 00lb .
negative	bag but that i would like a pound or two to replace what was lost in the spill .
negative	they were not able to offer me a replacement unless i sent the ripped bag of chia back .
negative	what was i supposed to do dump the chia seeds back in the box with the ripped bag and seal up so they could have it spill all over their floor too ?
negative	nor could they simply replace my lost chia with a one pound_bag .
negative	they ultimately gave_me 00_%_discount on one item only , not even an entire order .
negative	i am not happy with their customer_service .
negative	i have never had a problem with vitacost or iherb and will_continue to shop with these companies , not pureforumulas .
negative	they should know as a parts service that trust and knowledge is key .
negative	as well as the service that will end up bringing you your part .
negative	ups surepost is what they use and i '_m still_waiting on my part having ordered it two_weeks_ago before the holiday .
negative	i '_m so unhappy .
negative	and i have lost so much money due to this timely delivery .
negative	i tried to cancel the order and send it back but they don_'_t offer that .
negative	and if you want to return it you have to wait days for a specific number to send it back .
negative	very unorganized and too much time to send very critical things needed for your car .
negative	i doubt i '_ll ever use this again .
negative	i had no trouble with figleaves until i tried to return my order .
negative	on a whim , i sent the package with delivery confirmation .
negative	i had attached their own address label sticker so i know the address is correct .
negative	two and a half weeks after sending $_000 worth of bras back to the company i still had no confirmation of receipt of my order .
negative	i checked the delivery confirmation and discovered that item had been delivery two_days after i sent the package .
negative	they had received it exactly two_weeks_ago .
negative	i contacted the company and said : " i shipped you my return on july 0rd .
negative	according to my delivery confirmation ( insert delivery confo number here ) you received my item on july 00 , 0000 , 00 : 00 am at your va , usa location .
negative	however , i have not received an e_- mail to confirm that the item has_been received .
negative	as it has_been two_weeks since you received my item , i would like confirmation that my order has_been received and to know the current status of my refund .
negative	thank_you for your understanding ."
negative	the company replied : " unfortunately , we still have no record of having received your return .
negative	we ' d therefore suggest that you make a claim with the carrier you used to return the goods .
negative	if you need any further information from us in order to do this , we will of course be happy to help ."
negative	at this point i was panicking .
negative	i decided to follow their advice and contact the post_office .
negative	however , since i had proof that they had received it i began to file a paypal claim as well in case things at the post_office revealed only that figleaves did have my item .
negative	as i was filing the paypal claim i received another e_- mail from figleaves stating : " just to let you know that your returned parcel from order number xxxxxxxx has arrived_safely back at figleaves . com .
negative	[ continue with canned response here ]."
negative	from this incident i would make the following comments :
negative	a ) i will not be ordering from them again without a delivery confirmation on my end no_matter_how this situation is resolved .
negative	anyone_who is being jerked around by them should file a paypal claim .
negative	b ) i would suggest to figleaves that they try the following approach when they are unsure where they put a package .
negative	" we don_'_t see your package in our system , please give us 00_hours to check our warehouse for your item .
negative	if we cannot find it , we will contact the postal service to find out who signed for the item since your confirmation number does show it was delivered here ."
negative	oh , and apology for blaming me would go a long way .
negative	c ) i found it extremely_rude that i should have to contact the post_office when it was a mistake on their end .
negative	that is just_plain irresponsible to ask your customer to do the leg work when there is obvious proof you received the item .
negative	d ) until figleaves changes it '_s attitude and policy regarding shoving customers under the postal system bus for figleaves mistakes , i '_ll be staying away .
negative	i ordered a virtual visa_gift_card as a birthday_gift and it was a nightmare .
negative	the email wasn_'_t delivered when promised .
negative	i had to call and email these_folks repeatedly as i was given the runaround .
negative	i would have been better off just buying a physical gift_card and mailing it .
negative	that would have been quicker_than getting this email to the recipient .
negative	my gift ended_up late and i was frustrated the whole time .
negative	never again will i use them .
negative	it has_been over 0_weeks now and i have not received my order .
negative	i got a shipping confirmation well over 0_weeks_ago but still no package .
negative	i have emailed customer_service 0 week_ago but have had no response .
negative	apparently giving them a bad review on either this site or facebook is the only way to garner any attention to your issue .
negative	with that being said , here is my order number :_0000000 .
negative	i look_forward to hearing from someone .
negative	rachel
negative	major language_barrier , promises never kept , unable to produce glasses as an exact repeat of the last pair , long email exchanges about whether i would wear the glasses over my contacts , etc .
negative	ultimately sent the rx to another internet company eyebuydirect . com , and had my reading_glasses in 0 days , perfect .
negative	pass on global .
negative	i wish i have read all these review before ordering my tickets !!
negative	same as others , i was told i will receive my tickets one day before the match , but i didn_'_t receive anything at all .
negative	call them no answer , email them not replying .
negative	we have to sat at the hotel to wait for the tickets .
negative	totally ruin my vacation !
negative	i will never use them !
negative	!
negative	i would write a review of the products i ordered but they have not been delivered .
negative	the tracking_number given to me by 00_dollar mall does not work for any delivery service .
negative	i contacted customer_service and never received a response as of 0 days_later .
negative	i don_'_t mind shipping taking 0 to 0 days but i would appreciate a working tracking_number .
negative	they were '_t rude , but i ordered a book for my patent law class and did the search under a very specific isbn_number and my receipt even states the isbn_number .
negative	i got the wrong edition and cannot use it for my class .
negative	in addition , they wanted me to pay to ship it back to malaysia for a refund .
negative	i would understand the shipping cost if it was my mistake , but it wasn_'_t they sent me the wrong book .
negative	um , that is going to cost more than the book .
negative	it is not worth the " savings " if you ask me .
negative	if you do want to " gamble " and hope to get the right book , use paypal so you can dispute it when you get the wrong book .
negative	also , they incorrectly told me they advertised it as the edition i received .
negative	no , they didn_'_t , i saw the book cover art , and saw the isbn before i clicked " buy " and received a different book .
negative	i had to buy it again before my class_starts .
negative	ridiculous .
negative	stick with amazon or half . com for your book purchases .
negative	i bought the wrong coloured balloons because their description and picture on website was misleading .
negative	there was no response from my email how to return / exchange a product .
negative	nor was there any information on their website .
negative	their phone manner was rude , unhelpful and uninviting .
negative	i will not use this company again and do not recommend them .
negative	after we left our hotel in santiago chile ( hotel galerias ) and were on the plane we realized that we had left souvenirs and jewelry in the safe in our room so as soon as we had phone reception we called the hotel to make arrangements to have the items shipped to us and they said there was nothing in the safe so i called my representative from south american travel and she could do nothing even_though this was the hotel they had recommended and booked for us .
negative	the items were worth over $_00 , 000 . 00 and we never received anything for the replacement of them .
negative	never trust leaving things in a safe in the hotel ( hotel galerias ) in santiago chile .
negative	the employees are not honest or trustworthy .
negative	i haven_'_t received my merchandise - it is late -
negative	the worst service i have ever_seen .
negative	i don_'_t trust this company and i will shortly send a request for investigation to my lawyer and the police .
negative	my personal experience is that more than a month_ago i placed an order and as of today , more than a month later , i haven_'_t received .
negative	the company doesn_'_t have a phone contact number and they never answer by email on time .
negative	the worst online shopping_experience somebody can experience .
negative	ordered a trench coat for my son , the size was too small , so i sent it back , all i got from boohoo is just " give us a review " email !
negative	i am forced to get my money back a different way :(
negative	still_waiting for refund - item picked_up a week_ago - won_'_t order from them again .
negative	the booking agent said i could put six rooms on hold and each reservation could call in and charge their room at a lower non_refundable rate .
negative	they charged all rooms to my card at full price and said that was the way it was .
negative	i have shouted and complained and nothing has_been resolved .
negative	i will not pay my credit_card charge .
negative	it has bee horrible and i would not refer this company at all .
negative	didnt even want to give them any kind of star , but we had too !!
negative	customer_service is terrible their exceptions and rules are misleading , vague and totally unrealistic .
negative	when you talk to one person then talk to another everyone gives you totally different answers .
negative	the insurance is a scam .
negative	they lead you to believe that what you need is what the policy is , even if it is not .
negative	when asked to speak to a supervisor they argued about that then they said they will put us on hold , but it wont make a difference .
negative	then we hung_up after two hours and no one even answered .
negative	they dont care they are a big business if they lose one person they think , heck there are two other suckers to take their place .
negative	all they care about is money not customer_service !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered some
negative	flowers and picked out the most beautiful bunch from the internet , when they were delivered they looked nothing like what i had ordered let_alone paid for , they looked really expensive value on the picture but when they were delivered they looked about 0 pounds worth , half of the flowers looked dead that was in the bunch i really was not happy at all
negative	parts ordered were not complete .
negative	unable to reach a real_person by phone for assistance .
negative	did your e_- mail thing twice !!!!
negative	still no help .
negative	will need to return parts i ordered as the fender extenders you sent did not have the hardware to put them on the truck .
negative	no where on your site could i find what was needed .
negative	i made 0 attempts to contact partsgeek , unable to get someone to answer the phone .
negative	very dissatisfied with the service .
negative	i ordered lots of bits and pieces off confetti .
negative	was so disappointed when my huge dented box arrived and on opening it found 0 items bent and marked and everything else just thrown in !
negative	not happy !
negative	then i returned the item and had no confirmation of receiving it or that a refund had been processed nor an_apology for the inconvenience !
negative	!
negative	would not shop at confetti again !
negative	wasn_'_t aware of hidden_costs which changed from last time i flew with them .
negative	very confusing and ended_up more_expensive than alternative airlines so the ' that '_s what you get for such a cheap flight ' argument didn_'_t hold up .
negative	i am_disabled and was confused about the arrangement here .
negative	at the overseas airport , there was no assistance at all and chaos with wheelchair assistance wouldn_'_t have looked out of place in ' father ted or little britain '
negative	angry from twickenham !
negative	ordered items for a christmas_present , 0_weeks_later still_waiting for its arrival !
negative	the prices on petflow seem attractive , but there are some things that are troubling about petflow .
negative	0 .
negative	my credit_card was hacked immediately after_placing an order from petflow .
negative	may not have been anything to do with their website or pratices , but a big coincidence .
negative	0 .
negative	i asked petflow to remove me from their contact list , and they replied that they had done so .
negative	yet this email came in today asking me for input .
negative	i am fairly certain this rating will never make a public appearance .
negative	i wish i had read other reviews before placing an order for a bath with qs supplies .
negative	they have been consistently terrible .
negative	i ’ ve been lied to again and again and in the end i have no bath , no refund , project delays , wasted lots of time and lots of money chasing this up .
negative	they destroy your faith in humanity !
negative	do not do_business with them , it '_s not worth it .
negative	in my case they
negative	0 ) never sent me documents relating to my order despite repeated_requests ( this contravenes distance_selling regs )
negative	0 ) provided incorrect information about delivery timescales on two occasions
negative	0 ) never responded to any e_- mails or written communications via their website ( about 00 sent )
negative	0 ) did not notify me that my item was no_longer available – contrary to their own terms & conditions !
negative	0 ) did not provide a refund within the suggested timescale , never got in touch with me about the refund despite repeated_requests .
negative	i '_m still_waiting for a refund .
negative	0 ) caused repeated frustration with their utterly poor telephone advisors , that lack the interest or ability to do anything useful .
negative	in my case , they agree a refund is due , they just can '_t seem to be bothered to actually give me the money back .
negative	heaven knows what it must be like when they argue with you .
negative	save_yourself the heartache .
negative	i ordered a bed 0_weeks_ago and was sent an_email by the deliverers to say it would be delivered today between 00 - 0 .
negative	at 00 . 00 i receive a phone_call from the delivery company who say they did not get the bed in time to be included ( they had 0_weeks notice !).
negative	on checking the parcel tracking service they have declared it as a failed attempt to deliver !
negative	i have been sitting here waiting for the bed to arrive and now anticipate another night sleeping on the floor .
negative	somebody is lying .
negative	i am appalled .
negative	i would like an explanation for what has gone wrong at the very least but feel that with so much notice for this order i deserve some financial recompense for your incompetence .
negative	finally after 0 week i got my staf
negative	but when i opened
negative	my god
negative	0 car door_handle in a big box like 00 " x00 "
negative	one broken :(
negative	when i shipped my package i had to make 0 different delivery dates because the first time they sent the wrong fedex_truck to pick_up my package .
negative	then the second time i sent my package i was never given a tracking_number and now i am unable to receive a refund for my package because fedex is refusing to give me my tracking_number !
negative	horrible customer_service .
negative	do not ship with fedex !!
negative	!
negative	i purchased a dress for a wedding last sunday and paid_extra for it to be delivered on the saturday .
negative	i waited at home all day long and around 0 : 00 i checked the status online and the delivery company claimed to have tried to deliver the package but claimed they " could not access the building ".
negative	if the guy had simply rung my flat he would have found that i was home .
negative	i called the shipping company and the woman was admittedly as helpful as she could be in the circumstances , told me the driver was on the other side of the city and could not come_back but that he would be returning to the depot at 0 : 00 and i could drive to the depot which is a 00 minute round_trip , to pick_up my dress .
negative	i had no choice but to get someone to drive me to the depot ( it was an asian wedding so the dress had to be to the floor which was why i just couldn_'_t wear something i already had ).
negative	there is absolutely no excuse for why my package should not have been delivered .
negative	first and last time i buy something from boohoo .
negative	tactics are worse than ryanair !
negative	take off an extra change , quickly switched to a different page to check emails for flight number then went back to page to pay and the fee had been added again
negative	my husband ordered me a personalized stethescope as a christmas gift .
negative	we recieved an e_- mail two_days_later stating that it was out of stock .
negative	there was a number to call and an address to e_- mail with the options of choosing another color or canceling the order .
negative	we called a few_times throughout business hours and only recieved a busy signal , so we sent an e_- mail asking for the order to be canceled , and we placed an order for the same stethescope from another website to ensure it would be here before christmas .
negative	two_days_later we got an e_- mail_stating that the stethescope had been shipped out , still no response to our e_- mail .
negative	i had to place two tickets in for cancellation before someone e_- mailed me back and told me to not accept the order .
negative	too late , i had already accepted it and am now stuck with two stethescopes thanks to the poor customer_service and response from medisave .
negative	i am now in the process of trying to ship it back and get a refund and reimbursement for shipping ...
negative	my first time ordering was so frustrating - i was led to believe i qualified for a ten_dollar discount on my fairly large order but when i entered the code - no_matter_how i did it - the code was rejected . after three very frustrating attempts i gave up and completed my order without the discount .
negative	i will of course not be a repeat_customer .
negative	i have both a dog and a cat - you lost a potential good customer over ten_dollars - how stupid on your part !
negative	!
negative	the part broke after my son put it on his truck , 0 days after putting it on he tried opening his tailgate and the part broke
negative	i am completely amazed_at how a company can withstand the kind of blatant lies told to me by the agent that handled my reservation .
negative	i am_disabled with serious mobility issues and called to make a reservation for a hotel for 0 nights near the cleveland clinic in cleveland , oh .
negative	i was very explicit with the agent that i required a hotel close to the clinic that had a shuttle to take patrons back and forth_between the hotel and the clinic as i do not drive and cannot walk more than a short_distance .
negative	i was reassured several_times by the agent , eli , that what i was booking ( raddisson hotel gateway ) was both near the clinic and had a shuttle .
negative	he actually told me that their shuttle ran to the clinic every hour .
negative	i felt_compelled to verify his promise the following_day and discovered that the raddisson is actually a 00 minute drive from the clinic and has no shuttle .
negative	had i not called he raddisson to check on this , i would have been stuck with a hotel too far away for my needs .
negative	i had to call three_times and was placed on hold for unacceptable time periods , and although i requested some form of compensation for my inconvenience , i was given nothing except the run - around .
negative	do not use reservation_counter !!
negative	!
negative	called last friday to tell you i did not receive my 0 peace rose_bushes .
negative	tracking told me it went to the wrong_address , was rejected and sent back to you .
negative	the person i talked to has still not called me back to tell me what happened or if i was even getting them .
negative	she was going to call fedex .
negative	if i '_m not getting them , then give me my money back since you '_ve taken it out of my account .
negative	very annoying
negative	i have been writing to you for some months now asking for the outcome of salmonella tests on egg_whites you sold me .
negative	although i have recieved e_mails and even a phone_call when i threatened to complain formally i have never actually had the results as_promised .
negative	each contact fave me a one or two week timeline which was not complied with .
negative	i paid 0 . 00 on wednesday to guarantee delivery on saturday ..
negative	courier stated on website attempted delivery on thursday of 0000hours and friday at 0000 .. didnt happen and i was refused anytype of refund for my postage even_tho it took till the following thursday for me to receive my item ..
negative	i ordered a case of 00 merrick new_zealand summer sausage dog_treats .
negative	they arrived and the expiration_date is october_0000 which_means they have been sitting somewhere for a very long time .
negative	the treats are supposed to be very soft and they are not .
negative	i ordered a second case at the same time which has not arrived yet .
negative	if it has that same expiration_date i will be returning it .
negative	my trust in petflow has plummeted and i won_'_t be ordering anything more from them because of this .
negative	your wxpwsiency in getting the merchandise out , definitely needs improvement .
negative	to say i was dissapointed is an_understatement wen i ordered a bed and headboard from this company i was told i could not have the delivery on the day iwould have liked so arrangements were made for delivery on thursday 00th of april this bed was for a holiday chalet which is about 0 hours away from where i live so i arranged for someone to be at the chalet address . i was sent a txt and an e_mail to say delivery would be between the hours of 0000 to 0000 hrs so this person waited @ waited '@ waited yes you can guess the rest waited again no delivery was made when itried to get in touch with somebody the following_day iwas told the person_who i made the arrangements with donna lunn was not in work because of bank_holiday i was kept on mobile_phone for about half an_hour iff not longer and was told they could not find any information on my order and too phone in on tuesday i must have wasted alot of money looking into my delivery and why it was not delivered as arranged i could not apologise enough to the person_who i asked to be at the dlivery address she was at my property until 0000 hrs waiting ihope that when the bank_holiday is over iwill have the answer to why this order was not delivered ihope i am not given feeble excuses ie got lost on way could not find address
negative	i have no way of providing my feedback directly to the company which i would love to do .
negative	however , i have spent well over 0 - 00_hours on the phone trying to resolve various issues .
negative	most of which were started on expedia '_s end .
negative	the representatives are all nice , but extremely unhelpful .
negative	they put you on hold to " look into things " without ever explaining why and coming_back on the phone to ask questions they have already asked with no progress .
negative	the phone gets disconnected several_times and you never know if the representative will actually call you back or not .
negative	so then you are left to start all over again , or just pay for a flight you will never use .
negative	there is so much more i could document , but frankly i do not think it is worth my energy .
negative	the point is , i will not be using expedia again for my travel needs .
negative	i would recommend using one of the 0 other_sites reviewed on this website that all seem to have 0 out of 0_stars !
negative	i ordered a book , got my confirmation thinking everything was fine and dandy .
negative	a week passes by , nothing !
negative	i didn_'_t want to make a big deal about it so i checked online for the status of my order turns_out my order was cancelled .
negative	so here i am expecting my book to come in the mail when my order was cancelled .
negative	not even an_email alert , nothing that told me it was canceled .
negative	i had to email bookbyte to have it confirmed it was cancelled .
negative	it '_s not a big deal but atleast tell me it '_s cancelled instead of making me wait a whole week especially a week before school started .
negative	have double_charged me on one occasion
negative	don_'_t like you using you debit / credit_card and have actually blocked e from doing so on occasions
negative	having the most terrible trouble with this company .
negative	booked monarch flights through them and unfortunately need to change the dates .
negative	each time i agree the new dates and the additional_charges and penalties and give visa_card details , they are unable to process the additional payment .
negative	we have given three different visa_cards , all with plenty of available credit , and each time they are declined - obviously the fault is at their end - they promise me a call back but i end up having to ring them again and they go through the process of telling_me they have to refer back to the airline to check the current prices and penalties .
negative	this has_been going on for over 00_hours now and i am becoming increasingly concerned over their inability to process visa payments .
negative	the only good point in their favour is they do answer the telephone very quickly .
negative	take a tip from me , book direct with the airline .
negative	i ordered a competition suit on a friday and payed the 0 day delivery , because i needed it before sunday i come_back to méxico and by thursday i noticed that it will be delivered on monday .
negative	moré than six days .
negative	and i really needed the swimming suit for my daughters meet .
negative	i am very dissapointed
negative	ordered visitor ticket for man u v liverpool .
negative	liverpool are the visitors .
negative	received ticket with someone_else '_s name printed on it and found it to be a home team supporters ticket .
negative	called the company only to be told its a match ticket and that satisfies the order ???
negative	no replacement ticket and no refund .
negative	their terms and conditions are bizarre and you have to question is this even legal .
negative	i am not going to use the ticket and am in touch with the british embassy in spain to see if i can at_least raise awareness of these rouge traders and may be even get any money back - gutted
negative	very unsatisfied with my experience .
negative	i created two personalized cards as presents for my sisters .
negative	my only notification was when the package arrived and there was only one card .
negative	now it is too close to christmas to reorder the card without paying $_00 for fedex shipping .
negative	i will not be doing_business with this company again .
negative	the 00_lb .
negative	bag of dog_food i ordered arrive quickly , but unfortunately , it had spoiled in transport .
negative	i knew immediately when i opened the bag that it was bad because it smelled terrible .
negative	against my better judgment and because i was low on dog_food , i fed some to my dog .
negative	he ate about half of the bowl then refused to eat any more .
negative	later , he was sick and vomited what he had eaten .
negative	when i called petflow . com to request a refund for the spoiled bag of food , the rep informed me that " the dog_food isn_'_t our responsibility sice we get it from the manufacturer ".
negative	even_though they sold me the dog_food and gladly took my money , they refused to do anything to make the situation right and suggested that i contact the manufacturer for a coupon .
negative	oh , and he recommended that since i didn_'_t " like " the dog_food , i could donate it to a local_shelter .
negative	i really resent the inference that i was trying to get a refund simply because i changed my mind .
negative	the bag of dog_food from petflow . com was spoiled , unfit for any animal to eat and the company shirked all responsibility for their product or customer_service pledge .
negative	bottom_line -- buy your dog_food from a trusted , reputable , local_dealer who will stand_behind what they sell
negative	seems that i " cancelled " my cancellable hotel reservation at crescent suites in waltham ma rather_than selecting to " change " the date and i now am out more than $_000_dollars .
negative	i had the reservation for less_than 00_hours .
negative	can this be legal ?
negative	expedia is trying to tell me that they cannot work with the hotel manager .
negative	really ?
negative	then there is the amount of time i spent holding on the phone ( one of the three calls lasted more than 00_minutes ).
negative	no resolution of the issue .
negative	i am waiting for my filters they are not here yet !
negative	i have to say that it was a very simple thing to buy a ticket at your site .
negative	the instructions were clear and i '_ve recieved exact information about my flight .
negative	problems started with the thing bravofly didn_'_t do .
negative	the company did not inform me about the cancellation of my flight even_though one month earlier ( as alitalia told me ) it had recieved the exact information from the airline .
negative	in consequence i had many problems to get home , because i '_ve learned at the airport ( sic !)
negative	that my flight had been cancelled .
negative	those were additional costs that i '_ve had to pay ( more than 00 eur )!
negative	what is more , there are a lot of problems to contact the customer_service for the refund , because there is not enough people to answer the phone .
negative	in the consequence i will have to pay additional amount ( more than 00_euros ) for the phone_call that did not give me any information about the refund .
negative	so i '_ve paid 00_euros for the flight that did not happen , 000_euros for the new flight , more than 00_euros for the phone_call without the answer for my questions !
negative	and this is all because bravofly did not inform me about the cancellation !
negative	my first encounter was horrible .
negative	i booked 0 rooms which both were supposed to be booked for 0 nights and a refundable rate .
negative	the lady_who for some_reason could not understand me placed me on hold for 00_minutes and still could not refund my reservation due to booking the room at a nonrefundable rate .
negative	she told me after she had to call me back , since i hung_up due to being placed on hold for 00_minutes to call the hotel_directly .
negative	she could not resolve the problem .
negative	i have stayed with holiday_inn express numerous_times and have never had an experience like this .
negative	do not know if i will ever stay at a holiday_inn express again due to having such a horrible experience making a reservation .
negative	my wife and i recently booked a room in panama_city florida .
negative	bookit confirmed that the total price was 000 . 00 .
negative	bookit charged my card $_000 and did not tell me there was any additional_charges whatsoever .
negative	upon_arrival i was under the impression that the room was paid for .
negative	the next_day my bank_statement reflected another $_000 had been charged by the hotel .
negative	when i called the front_desk i was notified that the extra $_000 was for service fees that i was unaware of .
negative	the front_desk_clerk stated " that '_s the problem with bookit .
negative	they don_'_t tell you that and many people fall victim to their dishonesty ".
negative	it was my first time using this website and i will never use it again .
negative	sincerely , benjamin and michelle roberts
negative	i ordered something and even_though i received a confirmation_email it hadn_'_t arrived after 0_weeks .
negative	i sent repeated_requests to their contact us form asking where my order was and after several business days they said they were looking into it .
negative	after another week i gave up and filed a chargeback to my card .
negative	will never use it
negative	never again .
negative	no one delivers flowers without a vase .
negative	please see above .
negative	called to make a reservation for mid july at the same hotel that i had booked a year_ago in asheville , nc .
negative	when i received confirmation via_email , the hotel the representative book for me was in hendersonville , nc .
negative	00_minutes further away from the one i booked .
negative	i even gave him the address .
negative	when i phoned back the manager said that the hotel that i wanted seemed to show no rooms available .
negative	also , that it would take 0 - 0 business days to refund my money .
negative	so , i called the hotel_directly .
negative	she looked up my previous stay and booked a room in a matter of minutes .
negative	you would think that a company of this size would practice better customer_relations .
negative	i should get a refund or at_least some kind of credit for my lost time !
negative	i am more than disappointed in your company .
negative	i purchased a $_00_dollar gift_card for myself last saturday and have still not received the e_- mail with the link to receive it .
negative	i have called and sent e_- mails with no results .
negative	all i have received is e_- mails with " tickets " that don_'_t mean anything .
negative	\
negative	the only_reason i decided to make a purchase from this seller again was because i was left with store credit after a return , otherwise i would have never purchased from them again .
negative	i ordered a halloween_costume from them back in october , and had to wait 0_weeks to find out from them that it was sold out .
negative	i purchased 0 items , and after a week , i received one item .
negative	another week passed by , and i received one more item .
negative	i was irritated at this point , because it had been two_weeks , and they did not contact me telling_me why my order was taking so long to process .
negative	so i called the company , and after waiting on hold for literally 00_minutes , i finally was able to speak to a customer_service representative .
negative	this representative seemed like her mind was scattered all over the place , and it took her a long time to finally give me the information i requested .
negative	it turned_out that the other 0 items that i ordered were out of stock .
negative	i had a horrible experience with this seller .
negative	not only did they charge the full_amount to my paypal_account ( i even left my reference_number for the store credit like they asked in the comments section of my order ), but i had to email them after waiting 0 days after_submitting my order to see why i was charged the full_amount .
negative	they did not process my store credit until i called them ( and waited on hold for 00_minutes !).
negative	then , after waiting two_weeks to receive my order , nobody contacted me to tell me that my items were out of stock .
negative	i had to call them to find out the status .
negative	she refunded me the incorrect amount , and now they expect me to wait 0 - 0_weeks to receive a check instead of refunding it into my paypal_account .
negative	to sum it all up , this company has the worst service i have ever had to deal with .
negative	the customer_service is near non_- existent , and although the prices are great , i would not mind spending a little extra at other stores to not have ever put up with this kind of mess again .
negative	fairy solar_lights worked for one day only ... do not purchase them what a waste of money .
negative	brake parts would have been cheaper in my own town if i had known the full scam they pull with refund on core_charge .
negative	a rip_off .
negative	go to credit karma and save your money
negative	i ordered a premium flower_arrangement for my cousin '_s funeral , the day before the service .
negative	i paid_extra money for express service , so that it would arrive by 0 :_00pm .
negative	i also added a special note indicating that the funeral was at 0 : 00_pm and i wanted them delivered by 0 : 00_pm .
negative	at 0 : 00_pm the day of the funeral the flowers had not arrived .
negative	i called the florist and had to navigate through their automated_system , which was nightmare .
negative	the system kept adding numbers to my order number and looking up information on other orders .
negative	finally i was able to speak to a person .
negative	while she was checking on the order , she cut me off .
negative	i called again and went through the system again .
negative	when i got a live_person , they cut me off again !
negative	the third time i called , i was finally told that the flowers would not make it in time .
negative	they just couldn_'_t deliver them on time , was their excuse .
negative	needless to say , this one - time event was very important and they really screwed_up .
negative	i did get a refund , but it was too little , too late .
negative	made the reservation over the phone - specifically_asked if an 00 year_old could check in .
negative	explained that my son would be checking in and he is only 00 .
negative	paul , the employee on the phone reservation , called the hotel , and then told me yes , that hotel would allow an 00 year_old to check in by himself .
negative	when my son arrived , he was told he could not check in .
negative	i called reservations again , they told me they could not help me .
negative	oscar , the gentleman from marriott , apologized , called the manager , but said there was nothing they could do .
negative	luckily , his aunt lives in san_antonio , and went over to check him in .
negative	i then received an_email_asking me to rate them , and if i could not give a 0 or 0 , please call so we could resolve it .
negative	i have been on the phone - listening to elevator music with no assistance for 00_minutes .
negative	obviously , they are of no help .
negative	there has to be an easier way to return / exchange clothes !
negative	i bought a package around 00 / 00 ( thanksgiving ).
negative	i returned some merchandise because , you know , things online don_'_t always look the same way when you see actually see it .
negative	( and plus , some didn_'_t fit ) so i sent a return package on 00 / 00 , where is it now ?
negative	the usps contacted me that they had delivered it to the yesstyle in california the following_monday , but apparently yesstyle " didn_'_t receive " it yet .
negative	i am very disappointed by the fact that it has_been over a month since i returned it and i '_m not hearing good news from customer_service .
negative	drop_off my car at_0am to get 0 replacement and i purchased 0 more new_tires the personnel was very friendly and courtesy .
negative	told him my brother was going to pick you the car at 0000 pm because i have a meeting today he said it will ready at 0000 pm .
negative	ok . then my brother pick_up my car at town_fair tires and when he pick me up he stated they forgot to put the good tires i was replacing aside i called and the personnel told me he will check and when he back on the phone he stated that the job was not done and when can i come_back to get the job_done .
negative	0 hours_later and the job wasn_'_t done !!
negative	had to drop it off again seriously that was bad .!!
negative	i would not recommend this town_fair tires to anyone .
negative	..
negative	your people pretended they were with choice hotels and promised they would give me the free night i earned , but i had to first pay for one night .
negative	after giving her my credit_card number , i asked about the room .
negative	she hung the phone up .
negative	i called back and they hung the phone up on me once again .
negative	i highly discourage anyone from doing_business with you .
negative	dr . kight
negative	i wanted to change my flight to an earlier flight because the flight - company had changed the schedule .
negative	but the customer - service in england could not help me with this .
negative	we had to call them 0 times ( expensive for us !)
negative	to at last tell them to cancel our flight and then book a new flight ourselves .
negative	we were very disappointed that they could not help us with a simple thing like this .
negative	never ever bravofly again !

negative	// linda from sweden
negative	haven_'_t received my product yet .
negative	they use a shitty delivery company who seem entirely hostile to the prospect of delivering the product ordered .
negative	the company and the delivery people expect you to hang_around for days on end at the property to receive the item without being_able to deliver by a clearly defined date .
negative	not impresesd .
negative	i had a medical_emergency and have to cancel my international trip for 0 people .
negative	first i called and optd for a call back because the machine said the wait as long but they would definitely call me within 0 hours .
negative	of ourse after 0 hours nobody called me !
negative	it '_s been 0 hours since that first call and no call .
negative	0nd , i decided to call and just wait in line .
negative	i finally talk to a rep who couldn_'_t find my itinerary with the number that was sent to me in 0 different emails .
negative	she looked with the trip id #, my email , my name , ticket number and she couldn_'_t find anything so she told me to call back later when i had the trip #!!!
negative	which i did !
negative	i asked to speak to a supervisor who could help .
negative	i was transferred with no information from one relayed to the other so i had to repeat the whole_process since my trip # showed invalid : s
negative	after giving all my info again , this 0nd rep was able to access my trip information but she said she couldn_'_t access my account so she had to transfer me to a 0rd rep !
negative	the 0rd rep found my info and i was finally able to cancel my trip after 0 . 0 hours on the phone !
negative	i purchased a moses_basket and stand for my first born ... i ordered this item several weeks_ago as it was showing in stock and i thought i would have no_problems with delivery , payment etc as debenhams is usually such a reliable company .... wrong !!!!
negative	the payments as taken instantly and i received a confirmation_email of my order , then nothing .
negative	i expected the item to be with me within 0 - 0 working days as stated on the website for in stock times , however nothing arrived .
negative	i checked the website and the item was showing a dispatch date of 00nd october which was a little later than i had obviously expected but i wasn_'_t overly concerned .
negative	however , i checked again to find the estimated dispatch date was now the 0nd of november which is ridiculous considering i ordered the item in september !!
negative	i have received no emails or contact in anyway from debenhams to keep me informed of the delay in receiving my items and even accessing my order through the tracking_system it only states ' item will be dispatched shortly '.... no date , nothing ... i had to search for the item on their website to find that information .
negative	this is very poor customer_service and i am genuinely shocked as i did not expect this from such a well_known company .
negative	i did receive prompt response to my emessages when enquiring about my items , however , they were as vague as the tracking_information , blaming the manufacturer for not delivering the items to them in time .
negative	if an item is not in stock then it should not be made available for purchase as this is misleading to customers , and the lack of communication is truly shocking !
negative	i will never be purchasing anything from debenhams plus or debenhams stores ever again .
negative	i wish i had read the reviews before trusting this company , i have now requested a full_refund ( i wonder_how long that will take ) and will be purchasing my moses_basket elsewhere .
negative	i have used goldstar many_times in the past .
negative	unfortunately , because of a major error that ruined my short trip to nyc and their unwillingness to make the situation right , i will not be using them again !
negative	i had obstructed view seats that allowed me to only see one half of the stage .
negative	not what i paid for or intended to have .
negative	petflow . com lied when they posted :
negative	" satisfaction always guaranteed !
negative	your tail will wag
negative	petflow stands_behind both it '_s service as well as the quality of products we sell !
negative	if you ' re unhappy for any reason whatsoever , petflow . com will make it right !
negative	just call , live_chat , or email us at any time !
negative	we '_ll take_care of your concerns , no_matter_how big , or small .
negative	we '_ll make your tail wag !"
negative	satisfacton is not always guaranteed ( see my experience below ), they do not stand_behind it '_s service , they do not make it right when the customer is unhappy , and they do not " make my tail wag ."
negative	they do tick me off with their unprofessionalism and dishonesty .
negative	i wish they would do the right thing by me , but they wont .
negative	if they read this post and do finally decide to do what they promise as stated above then i will come_back here and post that .
negative	i have been ordering from petflow . com for almost a year .
negative	in the beginning i found them to be professional and ethical but with the order i just placed and the two orders before that i found that this company is no_longer professional or ethical .
negative	several_times in the past few_months petflow emailed me a coupon to use on my " next order " but when i attempted to use the coupons i would be told that either the coupon was no " longer valid " because it had expired ( even_though the email said they were valid for at_least a few more weeks to another month ) or that it could not be used for that particular order because it had restrictions on it ( even_though the specific restrictions the company gave were not written anywhere in the email they sent me with the coupon .
negative	when i first started doing_business with petflow . com i requested for autoshipping for my dog_food .
negative	the dog_food i purchase was $_00 . 00 per 00_pound_bag .
negative	a few_months_ago when i logged_into my account and viewed my " future " orders i saw that the price of the dog_food was going up in jan . 0000 but was not changing before then .
negative	in other words , the price was changng to $_00 . 00 in jan_0000 but not before then .
negative	my september and october orders shipped with the price of $_00 . 00 per 00_pound_bag .
negative	however , when i called in today to add the trial orders of food kelly changed the price to $_00 . 00 to be effective immediately .
negative	when i questioned her she could not give me a reasonable explanation for change .
negative	when i advised her that this would be my last order with petflow due to the immediate price change even_though the site said the price would not increase until jan_0000 , she started being rude to me .
negative	i had spoken to an employee back in september as well as in october and asked them about the price increase and they assured_me that the increase was not going to be in effect until jan_0000 .
negative	if a business quotes a price either in writing or verbally for a product or service then they are bound by law to honor that price .
negative	petflow . com refuses to honor their written and verbal price quotes to me .
negative	after checking petflow . com today to ensure that the avoderm canned_cat_food trial ($ 0 . 00 / case ) i was offered via_email was still available and found that it was .
negative	so i called the company today to order it and was told by the employee , " kelly ," that it was still available and she added it to my order that was to be shipped out tomorrow .
negative	as i was on the phone with her i clicked the refresh button and i saw that the order for the trial avoderm cat_food was there .
negative	i clicked refresh a few_times more because i added more trail offers and each time the avoderm trial was there .
negative	however , after i hung_up the phone i clicked refresh one more time and the trial avoderm food was no_longer listed .
negative	when i called back i got a male ( who never gave his name ) and he was very rude to me and he came_across as arrogant .
negative	he told me that the trial offer was not there because it was no_longer available .
negative	it didn_'_t matter that kelly checked to make_sure it was available and found that it was and added it to my order .
negative	he was very confrontational and challenging with me .
negative	i am allowing today '_s order to be processed and then i will no_longer do_business with petflow . com again .
negative	i have found them to be unprofessional , rude , and dishonest .
negative	if you do_business with petflow . com then know that the old saying , " buyer_beware ," applies .
negative	elizabeth
negative	at first i loved these , within days they were becoming very loose and falling_off constantly .
negative	i only wore them about 0 times .
negative	and then one day i was reading and they fell_apart .
negative	the arm just fell_off , couldn_'_t find the screw .
negative	when i checked the other side , it is very loose also .
negative	i don_'_t mind having to tightened screws , but not after a few_days of wear .
negative	i '_m afraid to tighten the other side because i think they will crack , and there really isn_'_t a reason , since i can '_t wear them anyway .
negative	just hope you not have to change your flight as they have the most backward way of dealing_with these queries .
negative	not only will this ineffective method of dealing_with complaints leave you frustrated it will end up costing you more and more as the prices go up every time you try to connect to them !!!
negative	the all not take payment from you and rely_on ' the airline ' to ring you back ...... you wait in all day waiting for them to confirm and they just lie and say they contacted you when they haven_'_t - then your back to square one trying to book again !!
negative	!
negative	its been 0 days and counting and still_hasn_'_t been resolved ......
negative	we needed to make a reservation while on the road traveling to our destination .
negative	we thought we were speaking to the hotel_directly as the young_man " daniel " never identified himself as anything other than that !
negative	. he proceeded to tell us that there was only one room left at the hotel we were requesting and as it turned_out at a much higher_rate ($_000 . 00 ) and when i inquired_about a goverment rate he said as it was the very last room the hotel would not give us that price . our friends had booked at the very same hotel l only an_hour before !
negative	we felt very very deceived when we checked in and found out that hotel was only 00_% full and the front_desk told us our rate for the night would be $_000 and upon checkout we were charged $_000 . 00 .
negative	we then realized that we had been speaking with a booking_agency and will never make that mistake again !
negative	sad that doing_business has come down to deceiving the customer !
negative	my flight was changed without my permission ending up in phoenix instead of portland .
negative	after 0 hours on the phone and my call being dropped three_times the operator told me she had it all fixed .
negative	she asked me to check my email to confirm .
negative	she had me going to dallas for a departure flight and my return flight was dallas to portland .
negative	i cancelled everything .
negative	i tried to get compensation for their ignorance but only got responses saying " thank_you for your feedback . "
negative	do not use travelocity .
negative	i have spent most of the last three_days trying to establish why the summerhouse i ordered was not delivered as agreed on tuesday .
negative	the phone system is a shambles regularly cutting off calls , it took me 0 . 0 hours to get through again today only to be told that they could not give me a firm answer about delivery , and could not organise a refund !
negative	i have emailed my cancellation and await a refund - not much confidence it will be quick and i suspect i will be talking to my card issuer .
negative	think very carefully before you buy from this outfit .
negative	i am truly very sorry i have given bookit . com my recent as well as past business !
negative	in the past week i have had a gruelling experience with bookit . com .
negative	after numerous attempts to book a vacation package online , i had no success .
negative	after several hours on the computer , i finally called the agent & worked on the phone with him .
negative	he too discovered it was impossible to book a package for me , as error_messages continued to come up .
negative	( this took another hour of his and my time !
negative	we had no success but he encouraged me to keep trying and change the dates or pick a different airline to use .
negative	on the eve of may 0 , i attempted to book another package around 00pm but received error_messages again !
negative	the following_day i decided it would be better to just book the hotel and do airfare separate !
negative	i received confirmations by email for this booking !
negative	later that day i checked my bank_account and i saw suspicious money was coming out of my account for another booking . com transaction and spirit !
negative	i never received any confirmation from either spirit or this company that the booking went through !
negative	i have spent hours on the phone with them over this issue and i am being stuck with a $_000 bill from spirit , which was turned into a credit for a trip i cannot take in the next 00 days !
negative	!
negative	this error was their error , and it should not be passed on to the customer !
negative	i am very disappointed in the services and the poor functioning of their online booking system !
negative	when i spoke to a supervisor , she felt bad about the situation but could not / was not willing to admit it was the bookit company who caused this error !
negative	i will make_sure this situation is disclosed to everyone i know & if i have any opportunity to review the services they provide i will rate them as poorly as i can !
negative	i am sorry i chose to do_business with them
negative	poor customer_service and they lost $_000 of my money !
negative	booking the hotel with bookit was easy and i was feeling optimistic that i made a good selection for a hotel in d . c .
negative	i was told there would be a preference submitted for a room with a view of the monuments on a higher level of the hotel , away from the pool and noise from the pool .
negative	when we arrived , we were given a room with a view of the parking_lot and mcdonald '_s .
negative	not happy with that , we decided to try to make the best of it .
negative	the toilet leaked but at_least it would flush so we dealt_with that .
negative	the shower was not draining properly so we ended_up standing in a pool of water when we showered .
negative	there was no refrigerator ; microwave ; or coffee_maker
negative	.
negative	we were only supplied with one shampoo for the two night_stay .
negative	but beyond all of that , the room was so very , very loud .
negative	traffic from major_highways were right outside our door and we were not able to sleep peacefully .
negative	for sure , i will never stay at capitol skyline hotel again , and there is a strong possibility i will never use the services of bookit . com again either as a result .
negative	i checked online and it listed the book arrived in chandler az at a local post_office .
negative	why was it not delivered to my home ?
negative	why was i not informed of how to get my book ?
negative	was i supposed to pick it up at the post_office ?
negative	it would have been nice to know how or when i had to pick_up my book from the post_office .
negative	too bad it was sent back to bookbyte and i no_longer want the book .
negative	i want a refund for the book i paid for that never arrived to my home .
negative	the black_ink that i just received are blank ink_cartridge and i am very unhappy and would like a refund , i order the pack which has three .
negative	two black and one color i am unsure_about the color .
negative	i am scared to try the color because both black_ink_cartridge were blank .
negative	becky will aggressively harass you via_email throughout the night .
negative	if you tell her you want to speak to someone_else , she will tell you " too bad ."
negative	i ordered frames over a month_ago , when i asked for an update on when they would arrive , becky told me , " you '_ll get them when we get them ."
negative	i requested am order number , an invoice , and a tracking_number .
negative	i was denied all three requests .
negative	i asked for a refund .
negative	she said no .
negative	then she told me after three_weeks of waiting for them , " if they don_'_t come in 00 day , maybe you can send them back and get a refund " but i would have to pay a 00_% cancellation_fee .
negative	i told her to cancel my order , and not to send me anything .
negative	i didn_'_t hear from her for over 0_weeks , and then i received an_email_saying the frames had been shipped and they charged my card .
negative	this was the worst transaction i have done in my life .
negative	these people should be shut_down .
negative	absolutely underwhelmed , twice were posters not in stock to be sent , even_though they were claimed to be available online .
negative	on the 0nd occassion , an employee also confirmed that my alternative choice was available .
negative	but instaed of the poster or an_apology - i get a ' here is your money back ' email .
negative	wrong part was sent .
negative	over a week_later , i '_m still_waiting for authorization to return product .
negative	will not order from this company again .
negative	the employee ( days inn irving ) running the front_desk was rude and unhelpful .
negative	we missed our flight because they made us wait 00_minutes for the shuttle and when the shuttle did get there and i asked him if he could get us to our gate quickly he told me that depends on how well i tip !!
negative	when we returned from our trip we were told to call them when we had our baggage .
negative	we had to call 0 times and let it ring until they would pick_up the phone and hang it up
negative	on us .
negative	we finally were able to reach_someone ( at that point were looking for a cab ) who then told us to walk to a different gate further down .
negative	these people have no concept of customer_service and are just looking to make a quick buck !
negative	we will never use this service again !
negative	!
negative	messed_up my first oeder and i only ordered one product !
negative	i truly thought i had the deal of a life - time getting a flight from michigan to arizona at $_000 . 00 .
negative	upon_receiving my card statement i found it cost me # 000 . 00 .
negative	an_additional fee of $_000 . 00 .
negative	i am sorry but i will not recommend this service to anther .
negative	i was told when contacting tripsta it ws so stated when i applied .
negative	must have been in the smallest print for the naked eye to see .
negative	i bragged up this deal and am sorry i did .
negative	thank_you
negative	i don_'_t want to accept the terms and conditions but in order to send this i have too .
negative	i ordered parts for my son '_s car and wanted it delivered to my place of employment , where i knew someone would be there to accept the delivery .
negative	i do not trust anything to be delivered to my home due to theft .
negative	they would not deliver to my po_box .
negative	as such , they wanted me to call my credit_card company , get a 000 number and go through all this process just to have the parts delivered to me at my place of employment .
negative	i read their terms and conditions and their help site .
negative	it stated that the parts ordered would not require a signature upon delivery .
negative	as such , should it be stolen , they would not be responsible to replace the parts .
negative	i then cancelled my order and ordered my parts from a trusted company .. rock auto_parts .
negative	i received the parts within 0 days of placing the order .
negative	my flowers have not been delivered .
negative	they took my money .
negative	where is my service ?
negative	as of today , jan 00 , 0000 i have not received my package
negative	didn_'_t even last all season .
negative	looked awful after only a few_weeks .
negative	expensive shipping .
negative	i ordered a purse .
negative	and wanted to use it for only a few_months - assuming the lifespan wasn_'_t long because i didn_'_t have a very high expectation on the quality of the purse , since it '_s roughly only $_00 and coming from yesstyle ( i heard many review that material & craftmenship quality wasn_'_t great ).
negative	but i didnt expect my purse to come already broken .
negative	the latch / hook was missing a pieces and not allowing me to use it as a shoulder bag - which is the main_reason i made the purchase .
negative	i contact the customer care and they gave_me an_rma_# for the return of the defected item exchange .
negative	i sent the package back using regular air mail like they reccomended , but i also paid_extra out of my pocket for a tracking_number .
negative	the tracking_number said that the package has_been delivered almost a week_ago .
negative	and in the previous email they sent me on " how to make an exchange / return " they said they would immediately email a notice when they receive my returned package .
negative	i waited a few_days and they still havent emailed me .
negative	so i contacted yesstyle on the status and they never replied back to any of my emails .
negative	i was hoping that i would have a pleasant first experience with yesstyle but i haven_'_t .
negative	as of now i wasted over $_00 purchasing and returning & have absolutely nothing to show for it !
negative	horrible customer_service !
negative	when i purchased from louis_vuitton and had to make an exchange they were very sweet and on top of things .
negative	they received my return and sent out the exchange item immediately and informed me with emails .
negative	with lv it took less the 0_weeks for me to send back the item and for me to receive the new item .
negative	but i dont_know what is up with yesstyle . com - they leave u out of it and don_'_t let u know if u will ever see your money or your order again .
negative	thank_goodness i didn_'_t make a huge bulk order and told my sisters to wait and see how my purchase with yesstyle was before they order .
negative	yesstyle is ridiculous .
negative	i told them not to order from yesstyle that they are better off with forever00 and h & m - i don_'_t recommend yesstyle to anyone unless you like to throw money away .
negative	horrible company .
negative	will never ever use them .
negative	the hotel room we paid for weeks in advance isn_'_t ready because the hotel is trying to run amoma credit_card .
negative	the card is declined !!!!!
negative	how are we supposed to get our room .
negative	this is shady and i don_'_t understand_why my 00 and 0 year_old kids have to wait in the car while they try and figure this out .
negative	we should get a refund .
negative	but of course it will take a week to get money back and we need our room tonight !!
negative	!
negative	the time from when an order is placed to when the order is shipped is glacial and completely_unacceptable .
negative	the shipping info on the website does not clearly explain the long delay before the order is shipped .
negative	on top of that , when i called white_flower farms to find out what happened to my order , their customer_service people were totally defensive and told me i was wrong to feel that shipment was too slow .
negative	i will never order from them again .
negative	waited 0 days for my 0 items to arrive .... contacted them after day 0 ... yes order had been dispatched ... already knew that as i had been tracking my order .
negative	however 0 days_later my items where out of stock ????
negative	what i really dont understand ... and they have also not refunded my account correct i seem to be money short .
negative	if i was you i would defo dont order .... youd only be dissapointed ..... and they e_mailed me to ask for a review ... kiddin me
negative	i normally book 0 holidays a year with alpha_rooms but never again .
negative	there were 00 in our party including 0 children grandparents and a 0 month old baby so i could not book on line and had to book over the phone .
negative	i asked for the 0 families to be booked into the roca dor playa in calador where we have stayed twice before great location on the beach .
negative	the " sales " girl was very nice and we advised of how nice the hotel was she took all the details and booked us in .
negative	we paid and looked forward to our holiday .
negative	i did not receive the accommodation vouchers so just took the itinerary details with me .
negative	i booked my own transfer and when we arrived after being up from 0am in the morning at the hotel was advised we were not booked in there .. a call to alpha_rooms followed and i was advised we had been booked into another hotel the cala dor playa about 00_mins_away , after a lengthy argument and after_speaking to a [_private_data_removed_] and [_private_data_removed_] ( manager ) was advised point_blank that they would not do anything to help they advised they would need to listen to the call i waited for ages and then had to call back as they didn_'_t contact me , the manager advised that the sales girl had mentioned the cala dor playa to me and that i didn_'_t question it , i told them i only knew the name of the hotel i wanted to stay at and that i would not have listened out for another named hotel as i would expect them to book me into the one i requested and for all i knew the cala dor playa could just have been the area .
negative	i asked them to listen to the first call where i asked for the roca dor playa but they said no that it was irrelevant i spent most of the afternoon arguing and literally begging them to book us in but no not a chance .
negative	the hotel did have room and could have booked us in , in the end alpha_rooms said the only way they would do this is if we were to pay roughly £_000_per family there and then .
negative	i wasn_'_t paying for a blatant mistake from there staff , i advised we were tired and had a 0mth old baby that needed settling but no they were very cold and heartless and had no interest whatsoever i asked for the managing directors address but was told they would not give this to me .
negative	i will be making a complaint to them but will not ever book with this compay again they are a disgrace
negative	we ordered some garden furniture to be delivered .
negative	it arrived ok but we are not happy with them .
negative	homebase agreed to take them back but on the collection day no one showed_up and we received a voicemail to say that ' the message to pick_up the goods had not reached the pick - up dept ' and we had to wait a week for a new date - next tuesday_afternoon .
negative	no_worries of course we can just keep taking days off from work to wait at home .
negative	not .
negative	then i received a text saying the pick - up is arranged for ...
negative	there is no date .
negative	and the pick - up time has changed form ' afternoon ' to 0 am - 0 pm .
negative	i phoned up and they said the collection would definitely be when promised in the first voicemail .
negative	let '_s see if the people will turn up this time , the slot is due tomorrow .
negative	i also ordered some paint ( why do i bother with you ?)
negative	and it said it would be delivered within 0 days .
negative	0 days have passed and i '_ve just emailed you to complain .
negative	how do you guys stay in business with service like this ?
negative	if you are purchasing a mic from this site you need to be aware that you cannot return it .
negative	make_sure you read the terms and conditions hidden at the bottom of the home page .
negative	i checked in to the car company at 00 : 00p .
negative	i had reserved the car for 00am .
negative	they have a 0 hour_window for a reservation .
negative	since i was 00_minutes over that ... they did not have a intermediate_car and i had to purchase an upgrade to a more_expensive car .
negative	i don_'_t_believe it .
negative	well i ordered a gorgeous bunch of lilly '_s and roses for my mum .
negative	pretty expensive .
negative	what my mum got was lilly '_s and then a bunch of daisy '_s and other flowers .
negative	no roses .
negative	the bunch resembled the picture on the website in no way .
negative	i have written an_email to teleological to complain and still have received no reply .
negative	pretty bad customer_service if you ask me .
negative	i ordered schwarzkopf bonacure silver shampoo , along with the 0 . 00 $ samples .
negative	i got the package in 0 business days which was very fast considering i live in new_york .
negative	however , when i opened the box my shampoo wasn_'_t in there !
negative	i got the samples that they threw in but not the main product that i ordered !!
negative	crazy , so i emailed them .. still no word back .
negative	don_'_t know what to think .
negative	lightinthebox does not provide return address , number , only email .
negative	the live_chat will only response to you if it '_s pre_- sale .
negative	as soon as you mentioned return or tracking , then send you the " help " link and terminated the chat .
negative	and all tickets and emails submitted to their service representative have no response .
negative	worst_experience and poor quality of products .
negative	do not ever buy from them
negative	not impressed one bit with this company .
negative	ordered blind 0 days ago and heard_nothing .
negative	i know its been the christmas_period but i ordered on the 00th - do you think someone could have telephoned or emailed to say the delivery would be delayed till such a time due to the holiday_season .
negative	no !!!
negative	!
negative	order frames only on 0 / 0 there was some_confusion on stock was told not stock then was told they did have stock and order will ship got frames and there were damaged .
negative	scratched was told to take pictures of the damage have you ever tried to take pictures of a eye_glass frame .
negative	im not a professional .
negative	but i did it
negative	someone did get back to me but its been back and forth ever since .
negative	i wanted a exchange now that im not getting answers i want a refund .
negative	i will take legal actions in order to get my $_000 . 00 if someone can just call me so we can get answers ..
negative	i '_ve tried that 0000 # and no one is
negative	ever there .
negative	very unhappy ,
negative	i bought some things for my teenage nieces birthday , but what a pointless exercise that was seeing as i still_haven_'_t received my order .
negative	despite getting an_email the day after my order was placed telling_me it was being prepared , i have had no communication from anyone to tell me anything .
negative	as i was worried i called yesterday asking where my stuff was , explaining it was my nieces birthday at the weekend and the items were for her .
negative	in reply i got a very unsatisfactory email , telling_me my order was delayed_due to an item being out of stock and they were awaiting redelivery .
negative	they did not tell me what the missing item was or why they had not contacted me sooner about this or why they couldn_'_t have forwarded the in stock portion of my order and the other item sent on when it came back instock .
negative	now i have nothing to give my niece for her_birthday and am extremely dissatisfied with the service i have received .
negative	i was very disappointed with my order .
negative	the hydrangea i sent to my daughter arrived without a single bloom or even a leaf that was opened .
negative	i also took the time to write a note of thanks and it was not included .
negative	what i thought was going to be a beautiful surprise , turned_out to be a very big_disappointment .
negative	although i made the reservation and had a confirmation number the hotel had absolutely no record of this .
negative	when i called the reservation company regarding this mistake the representative used inappropriate language during our conversation .
negative	won_'_t pay for anything .
negative	would not recommend to worst_enemy .
negative	i have used travelocity before to make reservations , so when i wanted to make a car reservation in juneau , alaska i went to travelocity .
negative	i reserved an economy car .
negative	they said the car would be there and that budget would take my credit_card when i got there .
negative	when i got to the budget counter they had no car and were shocked travelocity would think they did .
negative	i could have rented a vehicle from a local company that did not advertise on the internet , but opted to go with travelocity for a slightly better deal .
negative	in the end i did get a rental_car for 0 days .
negative	it cost me about $_000 more than what i expected and about $_000 more than the local company would have charged .
negative	i sent and e_- mail to travelocity and only got some stupid automatic response .
negative	i '_m done with travelocity .. this was completely_unacceptable !
negative	i would never use this again !
negative	i called to book a reservation , the person could not answer my questions directly relating to the property .
negative	then i was booked for the wrong days which i specifically said soon him reoeating the dates back to me , only to get an_email a few_minutes later for the wrong dates .
negative	when i called back after being on hold and going through all the info again with someone_else i was hung_up on , called back again and took over 0 minutes to get my email spelled correctly .
negative	i ended_up just canceling my reservation .
negative	i could not understand the people i was speaking with and the overall process was way too difficult .
negative	well i have bought a couple of things from this parts company .
negative	all past experiences were great until this last purchase .
negative	getting in contact with the company has_been difficult too .
negative	i refused one of the packages because the first transaction stated there certificate had expired .
negative	so i placed a second order and it said my credit_card was denied .
negative	shortly_after that i looked on my account and realized i was billed both_times .
negative	the next_day called my bank and they referred me to partsgeek which i was unsuccessful by phone instructions kept telling_me to due to unusual call_volume i needed to use the claim process which i did .
negative	i hav yet to be reimbursed .
negative	our drivetime experience was awful !!!
negative	it first started with us getting an_appointment time for 00 : 00 .
negative	we arrived at 00 : 00 and was not seen until 00 : 00 - which was aggravating .
negative	why give appointment times if you are not going to stick with them ?
negative	then when we were finally helped , the girl that was putting our information into your computer acted as though she had never typed before ..... which took_forever .
negative	we were finally released to a salesperson , which was amazing .
negative	shauniece bent_over backwards to help us .
negative	she went_above and beyond to get us into the car we wanted .
negative	everyone at the dealership moved at snails pace and acted as though they had no desire to be there .
negative	we finally made a decision on the vehicle we wanted to be told that we could not drive the vehicle off the lot until we had insurance on it ...... which is understandable .
negative	the only problem was our insurance agent does not work on the weekends so they offered us " your " insurance .
negative	for two_days of car insurance cost us $_00 . 00 which is completely ridiculous !!!!!
negative	i was scheduled to work at 0 : 00 which i was half an_hour later due to spending 0 hours at the dealership .
negative	yes , 0 hours !!!!
negative	totally ridiculous !!!
negative	we were told that your cars go through some type of iinspection before being put on the lot .
negative	i have to disagree with that statement !
negative	not only do i have a new vehicle that is leaking anti_- freeze , i am 000_% certain the oil was not changed or even looked at .
negative	it was filthy !!!!
negative	you really need to look at the way your " office " is run .
negative	have all salepersons on when you know you are going to be busy - fridays and saturdays .
negative	you should have a finance person that is doing just that .... financing and paperwork .
negative	i will not be referring anyone nor will we return for another vehicle !
negative	so disappointing !
negative	!
negative	i had made two reservations for a hotel in portland for our daughter '_s graduation .
negative	one under my name and one under my husbands name .
negative	one had a king_bed and the other had two queens .
negative	i had made the two reservations not knowing who would be attending with us .
negative	about a month before the graduation , i called to cancel the king_bed room - since we would only need the other room .
negative	when we arrived at the hotel - there records showed that your employee cancelled the other room ( with the two beds ) and we had the king_size bed room .
negative	so then we needed to have our adult son - sleep on a small cot .
negative	( the hotel was sold out !)
negative	there was also a difference in prize and we were charged by travelocity the higher price .
negative	i attempted to reach_someone by email and then by phone .
negative	after being on hold for 00_minutes , i gave up !
negative	it was very frustrating !
negative	i will think_twice before using travelocity again !
negative	it is fine if every thing is ok - but when there is a problem and you need to be reached it is impossible !!!!!
negative	you need to change your contact me part of your service .
negative	it is unacceptable !
negative	as my email message on ebay refers , i was disappointed with my order from cleverboxes .
negative	i ordered a winx club doll for my neice for her_birthday and the box was damaged on delivery .
negative	the outer casing the doll came in is quite weak and it was just packaged in a plastic_bag .
negative	not sufficient in my opinion as it was squashed when i received it .
negative	i had to give my neice it damaged which i '_m sure you will agree is not acceptable .
negative	i could have gotten her 0 dolls from ebay for the same price without the boxes , which i would have been better off doing .
negative	i haven_'_t left feedback on ebay as yet as i am still_waiting on a reply from cleverboxes as to whether they will offer me a refund .
negative	if i don_'_t receive a reply soon i will mark feedback as negative as i think other buyers should be warned
negative	tried to rebook a domestic flight 0 days before takeoff .
negative	prepared to pay for charges etc to do it .
negative	sounds simple right ?
negative	i even went to the trouble of ringing the airline first , and confirmed it wouldnt be a problem .
negative	rang expedia .
negative	00_minutes later , was told by a customer_service person , that it couldnt be done .
negative	i told her that was not right , because i had spoken to the airline in the previous hour .
negative	she told me i was ' not listening to her ' and when i asked to speak to her manager , was told ' my manager will just tell you exactly_what im telling you '.
negative	she then left me on hold until i hung_up .
negative	i sent a strongly worded complaint about the way i was treated .
negative	i explained that i was rebooking to spend time with a gravely ill family_member .
negative	i was responded to with a stock standard apology and a $_00 voucher for future travel ( with a handful of caveats which_meant i would have to spend a few_hundred_dollars to be able to use it ).
negative	i wouldnt recommend this company , even to my worst_enemy .
negative	expedia is a joke , but the consumers suffer as a result .
negative	rude and incompetent customer_service staff should not be tolerated by anyone , let_alone paid for !
negative	ordered a treadmill , it arrived badly_damaged , i phoned sport & leisure that day and sent photos , they agreed a full_refund on that day , so i could purchase another one .
negative	they collected it the following week .
negative	that was 0_weeks_ago , i am still trying to get my money back .
negative	over_£_000 !!!
negative	every time i phone ( twice a week ) they promise that it will be done that very day .
negative	i have now had to lodge a dispute with my credit_card company ( thank_goodness i used a credit & not debit_card ).
negative	a company to be avoided !
negative	!
negative	did not work , all black & white , showes non_- hp cart . are thay refills ?
negative	i had a confirmation of my order .
negative	never_heard from my recipient .
negative	thought perhaps she wasn_'_t the type to write thank_you notes .
negative	got a delivery confirmation one month later !
negative	?
negative	( along with a prompt thank_you ) i " m terribly embarrassed .
negative	my recipient was gracious .
negative	the service was terrible .
negative	i made a reservation online , and before i was finished answering all the questions the computer said page has expired .
negative	so i thought i had to reenter all my answers .
negative	when i did this , my emails showed i had booked 0 rooms .
negative	so i attemped to cancel one of them .
negative	but i was told the reservation no .
negative	did not exist .
negative	so i called the hotel .
negative	they told me to call expedia , which i did .
negative	but guess what - they did not make the reservation .
negative	i called the hotel again and talked to a manager .
negative	she gave_me another number to try .
negative	but instead i tried this site again .
negative	this time i was able to cancel one of the rooms successfully .
negative	guess what !
negative	both of them were cancelled .
negative	amazing .
negative	bad customers service didnt get what i order shipment was delayed
negative	ordered 0 items that were in stock 0_weeks_ago and still have not received them .
negative	it took over a week for them to be shipped .
negative	i called customer_service 0 times over a 0 day period before i actually spoke to someone .
negative	the first 0 calls i was on hold for over 00_minutes and then a recording came on told me to call back and then disconnected the calls .
negative	so , i '_m still_waiting for my package .
negative	:(
negative	i made a mistake with the booking date .
negative	april 00 instead of april 00 0000 .
negative	they would not change the date 0 mins after i made it , without a $_00 . 00 cancelation_fee .
negative	i cancelled and booked directly with the hotel .
negative	i am still_waiting for a refund i have contacted you and heard_nothing .
negative	had to chase up order of my new fridge only to find they had no stock and would not delivery in time for xmas .
negative	did not offer alternative and the guy on the phone could not care less .
negative	found alternative company how delivered in 0 days .
negative	they are the worst delivery company i have ever_experienced .
negative	as i live along a lane with potholes , the driver would not deliver apparently !
negative	i receive all other deliveries but not my hermes .
negative	frustrating that you cannot speak to them when they are in the area with your parcel .
negative	despite passing on my telephone_number via the seller and even offering to walk up the lane to collect my parcel , i never had them delivered .
negative	purchases were returned to retailer who then have had to use another courier .
negative	i am still_waiting ......
negative	ordered goods and paid_extra ( c £_00 ) for delivery last saturday .
negative	three_days on , still no goods - so sadly cannot rate them !
negative	had an_email to say the parcel had been despatched and nothing more .
negative	although i have emailed the firm today i have received no_explanation for non appearance of goods .
negative	rating should be no stars but i was required to put something in there unfortunately .
negative	leveringstider over 0 måned er ubrugeligt .
negative	herudover bliver levering ændret uden at man meddeler det til køber .
negative	når_man køber tøj regner man med at få det her og nu - man_skal jo bruge det .
negative	og med så lange og uforudsigelige leveringstider er_det uvist om man overhovedet er i stand til at være hjemme , når_man_skal afhente varen på_posthuset .
negative	med omkostninger til følge hvis det_ikke bliver afhentet af_en .
negative	herudover er_det dårligt , at man ved fejlstørrelse ikke kan returnere i butikkerne igen ( det_kan_man når_man køber på magasins webside ) så_man har store omkostninger når_man_skal sende tilbage .
negative	første og sidste_gang_jeg køber der .
negative	betjeningen var_hurtig_og venlig , maden derimod var kold og slatten .
negative	minder om_det allerbilligste man_kan finder supermarkedernes fryseafd .
negative	minder absolut ikke om_de tapas man får i spanien .
negative	meget dyrt og dårligt .
negative	i have purchased from this company before and recently i made a big purchase and ordered these pumps , well after getting them they were too big , i called customer serv .
negative	and asked about exchanging them for a smaller_size , i was then told to send them back me paying the return shipping and that i would be accommodated the right shoes at no charge shipping to me !!
negative	after calling multiple_times not always reaching anyone during normal hours and speaking to a manager i was told that there is no such thing they will not pay shipping even_though i had the rep who stated that three_times to me over the phone , and that the shoes i wanted would be in stock , but i would only get store credit what i paid for them , trick is the prices change and go up so what i paid originally was not going to pay for the shoes a second time !!!
negative	after having a week to process my return that they got first thing monday_morning it was not checked in until 0days_later !!!
negative	which i was told would take three_days max !!!
negative	now the shoes i want and that i was told over and over again i would get are no_longer in my size and there is nothing they are going to do about it !!!
negative	im pissed y the hell would i even pay to send the damn shoes back waste my money only to not get what the hell i wanted to begin with !!
negative	this is a rip_off company !!!
negative	beware !!
negative	!
negative	this rental_car firm offers rental_cars ( booked and paid for about 0_weeks in advance ) in the middle of london with empty petrol tanks !!
negative	it also charges extra taxes on pick_up and takes a " deposit " which is returns several weeks after the car is returned .
negative	their " policy " is hand over empty of fuel at both_ends , creating quite a challenge for the visitor to the uk ... and ensuring they gain a little more from every tank .
negative	when the vehicle was returned , in the same good condition in which it was received , there was an opportunity to stand in a 00 minute long_queue in the heat ( among other heated customers ) at bristol airport ... to be told " next time , just drop the keys in the box and go ".
negative	there will be no next time !
negative	i had to book 0 different room type for my trip which required to call reservation :
negative	0 bedroom with 0_adults & 0 children ( queen_beds / high_standard room )
negative	0 bedroom with 0_adults ( king_bed / standard room )
negative	it took 00_min for the sales_rep ( located in india ) to book the 0 different rooms in same hotel .
negative	so incompetent !
negative	i ended_up with 0 reservations where she split my 0 kids in each room with extra guest fee for each reservation of course and a king_size bed instead of queens bed !
negative	i called back ( still in india ) to make the correct changes and i was told if any changes was to be made this had to cost me a fee as per whatever policy of theirs … she nicely offered to call the hotel to make_sure the high_standard room was provided with enough beds for 0 guests and simply hanged up .
negative	i called 0 times and always got hanged up on before i could even talk to any sales_rep … i ended_up calling the hotel myself who couldn_'_t do much besides lowering the standard of my room if i wanted to sleep with my children in queens bed or charge for a rollover bed for my 0 kids to sleep in .
negative	of course , no reimbursement was possible …
negative	i had a promotion_code for 00_%_off and my hotel wasn_'_t named in the exclusion .
negative	when i asked to have it applied they replied it was part of a chain hotel named in the exclusion and therefore couldn_'_t apply it … very borderline in terms of fraudulent advertising .
negative	no proper manners at all every_step of the process .
negative	avoid expedia
negative	my multiple_emails to their support_team were never responded to .
negative	my experience in the store required arguing with the manager to get my purchase returned and exchanged at all .
negative	they were helpful in finding new products otherwise .
negative	all of the critical reviews i have read about this company including this site and other_sites have been the same .
negative	this company is completely disorganized & unprofessional .
negative	i booked a room with my husband in la at one of their properties .
negative	we were aware that this is not a typical hotel type set - up , it '_s a self check - in apartment in a large gated complex with no staff on site .
negative	fine , we received the email with the highly detailed_instructions and pre_- purchased parking .
negative	it '_s funny how the instructions are so meticulously detailed which leads you to believe this company is on top of it , however when you get there , you are expected to be held to the defined specifics of their policies but they adhere to no protocol whatsoever .
negative	the room is not ready at the 0pm check in time , you have to wait_until someone brings the keys .
negative	which we waited with several other ginosi clients who were also waiting for their rooms .
negative	the security people at the building are annoyed at the ginosi customers , in fact they are almost hostile if you ask them more than once if the room is ready .
negative	a young_girl finally shows up totally frazzled with a handful of tangled keys , garage remotes and a scribbled piece of paper listing the names of the customers & the room assignments , i mean totally_unprofessional .
negative	you had to sign that messy sheet to get your keys which took the girl a while to figure_out which keys were which .
negative	when she gets to me she gives me keys to a different room , not the room that i viewed and booked on line .
negative	i could see on the sheet that the room that i booked was given to another customer who had not checked in yet .
negative	i showed her my confirmation and told her this is the room that we are confirmed for why are we not getting it and why is this other person getting it ?
negative	she just gave_me this deer - in - the - headlights look & shrugged her shoulders .
negative	i felt badly for her because another customer was also having issues with the parking situation while another one was trying to work out an_additional guest .
negative	the poor girl just couldn_'_t handle it and had to call someone on the phone which we all had to speak with individually .
negative	i suppose this guy on the phone was suppose to be a manager although he never formally introduced_himself as any specific position in the company .
negative	he could not give me any explanation about the room situation .
negative	he just said " there was a problem with the room so we gave you a different room ".
negative	i said " but i see that room is available for someone_else who has not checked in yet ".
negative	he couldn_'_t tell me what the " problem " was and kept skirting the issue .
negative	after pressing him further he finally admitted that that particular room was overbooked and the person had it for a week but did not show up the day before when they were suppose to .
negative	i felt that if that person did not show up as scheduled then they should have to forfeit the room and they should get the other room assignment that they were trying to give to me .
negative	he did not agree with me and just basically gave_me an " oh well , take it or leave it " attitude .
negative	he couldn_'_t even offer me a " sorry for the inconvenience " which honestly would have appeased me just fine considering we were only staying one night & i understand a customer paying a full week would be more of a monetary loss to them .
negative	but it '_s the indifference and just lack of professionalism that really ticked me off .
negative	i asked if they could at_least comp the $_00 parking fee for the inconvenience , he said i would have to write a formal_complaint to the company .
negative	which i did and sadly it was the same person_who replied to my email that i spoke with on the phone .
negative	he just gave excuses for everything and treated me with the same indifference , still no apology .
negative	totally mind boggling .
negative	the room we got looked nothing like the room that was advertised on the site .
negative	a lot of the reviews say the same thing : late checking in , didn_'_t get the room they wanted , treated rudely by ginosi staff , etc .
negative	it '_s a wonder_how the good reviews that they do receive seem so_far off , one liner sentences with no specifics as if they just get their employees to write good reviews to off - set the ratings .
negative	it '_s possible , however the staff doesn_'_t seem to take much pride in the company anyway so that may be far - fetched .
negative	i wish i would have read more reviews prior to booking .
negative	i believe their business set - up is more appropriately classified as college - age youth hostels .
negative	however i don_'_t think anyone at any age should be treated rudely .
negative	i have a bunch of books that have been building up and most of them are new still but every time i put in the isbns it says yall are not buying them back .
negative	i need to get_rid of these books but i am not going to throw them away when i paid up to 000 . 00 a piece for most of them , i would like to sell them back .
negative	the first time i ordered from sport pursuit i returned part of the order .
negative	it was a long time before the refunded my money and it took several emails to get the refund .
negative	after this experience i decided never to order from them again .
negative	however , stupidly , on 0th_december i paid for another order , thinking that maybe i had just been unlucky last time .
negative	my order took three_weeks to come and when it arrived i found that i needed to return it as everything was too big .
negative	sport pursuit received the goods back over a week_ago and still i have not been refunded the £_000 i am owed .
negative	i have now opened a case with paypal which did prompt sport pursuit to send me an_email_saying that they have refunded my money .
negative	on checking my account i find that they have still not made a refund .
negative	i have now had to escalate the case on paypal and hopefully they will sort it out .
negative	the customer_service is appalling and is presumably the reason they don_'_t give out a phone_number so they can avoid having to handle complaints .
negative	the explanation below that communicating via_email is more personal sound a little strange to me .
negative	my 00 year_old daughter ordered stuff in october , we have yet to receive it !!!!!
negative	i have contacted this over_seas company several_times and all i hear is " i so sorry , it lost in mail , no tracking #, can you wait another 0_weeks ?"
negative	where is my stuff ?????
negative	now they want my paypal_account to refund my money , are you kidding me ?!
negative	they have my credit_card info , put it back on there or is that lost in mail too ?
negative	ridiculous !
negative	this is a scam if you ask me !!!!
negative	my daughter wants her stuff !!!
negative	do not donate to this scam !!!!!
negative	you will get nothing !!!
negative	!
negative	received a brand_new screen with a dead pixel and paid more than 00 dollars for it .
negative	ordered a part from parts_geek i did not get a confirmation so i called them spoke to a girl who was very incompetant .
negative	i ordered a spider injector 000 . 00 she told me she seen where i ordered a wheel_hub for 00 . 00 .
negative	i told her what i ordered she just repeated herself i see where you ordered a wheel_hub and that it had already been shipped .
negative	i knew i needed to talk to someone_else it hadn_'_t been 00_minutes since i ordered it so it couldn_'_t have been shipped already .
negative	i asked to speak to a supervisor she put me on hold for about 0 - 0 mins came back and said i '_m sorry you ordered the wheel_hub over a year_ago .
negative	we do not see where your order came through there is no confirmation number you need to reorder the part .
negative	i did .... bad idea i was charged for 0 and shipped 0 now i am trying to get a refund and it has_been several days .
negative	they said they would be sending me an_rma and that there might be a restocking_fee .
negative	i found out they charged my debit_card twice when i went to the store and tried to use my debit_card and it was declined .... how embarassing .... also i was told it could take a couple of weeks to get a refund .... i don_'_t reccomend this company .
negative	sorry really don_'_t think this is what you wanted ....
negative	i got a gift_card for my birthday and i was not able to use it for what i wanted .
negative	i was not at a restaurant , gas_station , or hotel and when the store ran it as credit it automatically added 00_% to my purchase .
negative	not worth the time or headache !
negative	it kept saying insuffuicent funds and made me look like an_idiot , when i had $_000 on the card , and the purchase was only for $_000 .
negative	embarrasing , dont_waste your time or money !
negative	ordered flowers for my daughter '_s wedding_anniversary .
negative	they should have been delivered on saturday but did not arrive until monday .
negative	when they arrived the flowers had all dropped and were very dry .
negative	i bought a luxury bunch , but was not impressed .
negative	will not be using teleflorist again .
negative	rang to explain that after two missed deliveries ( and the couriers office being closed by the time i rang each night ) i was told i should have ' left clear_instructions to the courier ' to leave with a neighbour & a third attempt would be at my cost of another £_00 .
negative	when i said no , i was told ' or you can drive to their hub to collect ' which was over 0hrs away !
negative	then had to ask for a refund & quote distance_selling regulations to guarantee my p_& p back to which they just said ' yeah ' to in the end .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	don_'_t buy if you a ) work full time , b ) don_'_t know the ins and outs of courier delivery , c ) are not a mind reader & d ) want your item .
negative	no attempt to help , offer advice or even get my item to me .
negative	just told i would have to re pay postage when it wasn_'_t my fault i was at work in the first place !!
negative	a total scam .
negative	will be going else where to purchase .
negative	avoid .
negative	worst_experience of my life !
negative	missed spelled one persons last name and could not get them to change it so lost all that money and had to purchase a new ticket .
negative	they blamed it on airlines but airlines called with me on third_party line and travelocity got caught lying and hung_up phone on airlines .
negative	will never use them again !
negative	i have tried for a week to get contact to return order , but keep getting each time a represtative , will get in contact with me with in 00_hours , never happened , i have sent numerous e_- mails . this was second order with parts_geek and probably the last , i run a car - lot and numerous_times i find myself needing replacement parts , i guess i just have to keep looking for a supplier that has a prompt return_policy , i dont like being run_around , debra ewing
negative	this company was recommended by an auto_parts store .
negative	the prices were good , but when the part is bad they ignore you .
negative	i had to file complaint with credit_card company to get results .
negative	also , i didn_'_t realize that defective parts are returned at my expense .
negative	i was sorry i thought they were like other online companies who value your business .
negative	i was expecting a delivery today , and my bike has not turned_up .
negative	it won_'_t turn up .
negative	i was not notified !
negative	i booked today off work .
negative	just awful .
negative	i purchased a dress from boohoo .
negative	only to receieve another ladies dresses when i emailed boohoo they did not respond it was up to myself to do my own investigation and was told they respond via facebook .
negative	i messaged boohoo and they told me my item had sold out and to return the ladies dresses .
negative	worst service ever .
negative	and to be told my item was out of stock when i securely purchased it was disgraceful .
negative	i didnt even receieve any sort of sorry compensation .
negative	never again , i will_continue using asos
negative	representative seemed drunk , process took 00_minutes , and my name was miss - spelled .
negative	stop !
negative	do not for one moment even consider buying from this vendor .
negative	dishonest , sleazy .
negative	i bought a new phone - they substituted a lesser version and it has dings on it .
negative	i spent extra for 0 day delivery , i got it in 0 days .
negative	i went to sites where they had positive_reviews - i '_m sure they wrote every one of them , including those on this site .
negative	should have checked with the better business_bureau , learned a valuable lesson .
negative	will use ebay in the future - they have policies to keep this from happening .
negative	do not buy from cell0get !
negative	could not book on line tried several_times would not accept my address had to call , spoke to a woman whose english was very poor and i had to keep repeating myself and still she spelt names incorrectly , took me an_hour and half just to compete a 0 day trip , with wasting time on internet and having to repeat myself over and over again on the phone .
negative	you should maybe consider hiring english_speaking personnel .
negative	overall a very tiresome and not pleasant_experience .
negative	i waited more than two hours for my food .
negative	i know it wasn_'_t the restaurant '_s fault because the food was still warm .
negative	apparently delivery . com " forgot " to send everyone '_s order to that restaurant and because they were incompetent , my order was severely delayed .
negative	i repeatedly asked for some_sort of refund but was not granted one .
negative	let '_s just say i won_'_t be using delivery . com anymore .
negative	i purchased a domain_name brokered through godaddy with 0 year of hosting .
negative	four months later the seller re - sold the name to another buyer , again using godaddy as the broker .
negative	i '_ve had multiple conversations with godaddy representatives over a 0 month period trying to get the domain back , but to no_avail .
negative	each time i '_m promised that a representative will contact the seller and get back with me within a few_days .
negative	i '_ve never had anyone follow_up with me .
negative	each time i call in i '_m told my case has_been closed and i have to initiative another complaint .
negative	how does this company have such high ratings ?
negative	i ordered the book , they charged my account , and a week_later they email me that my book is out of stock .
negative	shipping is too - o slow and i am still_waiting for my order --- it has_been 0 days .
negative	advertising cars on various reputable internet sites .
negative	getting customer in to see car and then saying it was the wrong price .
negative	tested over a week , they did this 0 times - advertising the car at a cheap price and 0 times with different customers they said it was the wrong price " a clich on the internet " buyer_beware - never buy from these cheats
negative	i have literally purchased hundreds of pounds worth of clothing over the last 0 - 0 years from matalan .
negative	mostly i buy online and occassionaly go instore . i am a top contributer for their reviews just ordered summer bikinis - paid and sent for collection at local_store .
negative	just had a flier through advertising same items with big discounts - telephoned customer_services and explained .
negative	asked if i could stop order and order online with new discounts .
negative	no .
negative	asked if anything they could do for a good loyal_customer .
negative	no explained art of customer_service and asked them to look at my account no ....... more training i think if you are going to be in the customer_service centre and do well joanna !!!
negative	!
negative	the bolt representative that i spoke with on may 00th , 0000 , sasha iyamu - osagie , said that i would be paying a total of $_00 . 00 per_month and he also said that my down payment of $_000 . 00 would cover the entire first 0 months and that i would not have a payment due until august_0000 .
negative	i received my first bill in the mail , and it says i am paying $_00 . 00 per_month and that my first bill is due in 0_weeks ( june ).
negative	on top of this suprise , i had asked sasha via_email on may 00 , 0000 for any kind of paperwork or details regarding our policy because all i had received was a 0 page insurance binder with a very small_amount of information .
negative	i have questions for sasha since there are a few things that i do not understand completely such as why it says " commercial general liability "- does this only cover offices and commercial buildings or does this also include the residential side of my cleaning business ?
negative	also , will i receive an insurance card or a hard_copy document in the mail for proof of insurance ?
negative	i would really appreciate some guidance on some of these issues that i am having .
negative	thank_you .
negative	i tried booking a trip from minneapolis to phoenix , airfare & hotel .
negative	each time i got to the point of confirming my booking it wouldn_'_t book it .
negative	i would get an_error_message .
negative	each time my credit_card was billed .
negative	i was billed for 0 trips but didn_'_t have any trip .
negative	i am still trying to get my credit_card refunded by bill me later .
negative	made hotel reservation and received confirmation .
negative	arrived at hotel , after having traveled and spent the day in icu with a critical relative , to find the hotel didn_'_t have our reservation and was full .
negative	literally sat on the phone with travelocity for an_hour while they tried to figure_out what to do .
negative	they passed me from department to department and called the hotel desk_clerk twice to confirm that there were no rooms .
negative	this took_forever .
negative	in the end , they found us someplace else , and did us the " favor " of not charging for the difference_between the room we booked and the one we eventually got .
negative	we finally got to bed at 0 : 00 am only to get up a few short hours_later to return to the hospital .
negative	never again .
negative	my experience with travelocity was outrageous .
negative	called their customer_service to try to redeem a voucher for a product that i had paid for .
negative	i also wanted to make a complaint about another product that i again had paid for but been unable to understand how to redeem and thus lost my money .
negative	explained that i am not an expert at getting around a site and that it would be a good idea if they gave instructions in clear_explanations .
negative	their agent spoke to me like a child ( i am 00 years old and she sounded very young ) she spoke over me so i did the same with her and she put the phone down .
negative	probably going to be another case of me loosing more money with them .
negative	customer_service thus appalling , need urgent training for their staff in how to speak with customers & help them accordingly and not to patronise them
negative	not only do they not allow returns , their policy is not posted or mentioned anywhere in the store prior to any purchase .
negative	more frustrating then even their unfriendly return_policy was their service !
negative	the young_girl was so intent on just spraying everyone of her favorites on a paper strip she ignored our explanation of the type of fragrance we were looking for .
negative	in addition she could not tell us the price of anything she was showing us .
negative	when pushed she would scan it in the register to find the price for us .
negative	after our final selection we asked if there were any gift sets .
negative	she yelled across the store at her manager who looked to the floor under the register and then back to us almost as if he were deciding if he were going to tell us or not .
negative	he finally said yes , she looked at us and said yes .
negative	we had to ask twice to see the gift set !
negative	when we asked how much she said only $ 0 more than the bottle alone and ultimately charged us $_00 more as she really didn_'_t know the price once again .
negative	she now said if we made a second purchase it would be anywhere between 00 - 00_%_off , of course we took the bait asked for a favorite stand by fragrance and she quickly quoted us only $_00 off - this was an $_00 bottle of perfume .
negative	this was the one we tried to return the next_day and were told we could not .
negative	not only was the packaging not opened but it was less_than 00_hours old .
negative	i spoke to the manager mehdi , who was even less understanding .
negative	i told him it was sad that knowing i would never be back that to him losing only one customer in the realm of all the other unexpecting customers he could care less .
negative	he said nothing .
negative	very pleased , competitive in price , all brands available , convenient , arrived in a timely_fashion to my door in a box .
negative	no more wrinkled shop worn bags lifting and tugging for this old lady .
negative	will buy again
negative	fedex can '_t read their own shipping labels .
negative	this is the 0rd time they dropped_off our packages to the wrong_address .
negative	i call and complain , but all i get from them is well the status says driver delivered to the proper address .
negative	i have provided them with the mistaken address they keep dropping_off our packages and they still can '_t get it right .
negative	i have called the shippers and confirmed with them that they shipped to the correct address as fedex has asked and then call them back and still the packages get to the wrong_address .
negative	there are fedex labels on the packages with our correct address , but the driver must not double_check if they look at all .
negative	there is a huge sign on our property with the address clearly showing and yet they still deliver to the wrong_address .
negative	even better is the fact that the wrong_address location has an even bigger sign with the numbers clearly showing .
negative	our number is 00000 and the wrong location address is 00000 and yet they still deliver to the wrong_address .
negative	i could understand if there was a one number difference , but there isn_'_t .
negative	i have asked fedex to flag our address to make_sure the driver double checks and still they deliver to the wrong_address .
negative	i ordered a dress on october 00 and just today ( november 0 ) they told me that it wasn_'_t available .
negative	really ?!
negative	their clothes are very tempting to buy but i '_m not sure if i want to buy again ...
negative	i ordered gifts for my 00 year_old_grandson '_s birthday .
negative	only part of the order was received and i have spoken to football fanatics twice to no_avail .
negative	i was put on a " two minute hold " and after holding for well over 00_minutes , i was hung_up on .
negative	they don_'_t know where the rest of the order is and refuse to resend it .
negative	i had to file a dispute on my american_express and reorder from a different company .
negative	i would never order from them again and would recommend that you not order from football fanatics .
negative	laat het onderstaande voor bedrijven die een pin apparaat via sepay willen kopen / huren een waarschuwing zijn !!!
negative	!
negative	betreft factuur nummer 00000000
negative	sinds 0 jaar zijn wij klant bij sepay en huren bij hen een pin apparaat waar wij maandelijks een huurbedrag voor betalen .
negative	nooit problemen gehad .
negative	als het_apparaat het_niet naar behoren deed , werd_het_apparaat of onderdeel vervangen .
negative	wij gaan netjes met deze gehuurde apparatuur om dus daarom geen beschadigingen .
negative	het pin apparaat staat niet_op_de toonbank maar op_een aparte vaste plaats .
negative	tien weken geleden stopte echter het pin - apparaat midden op_de_dag .
negative	gelijk de klantenservice gebeld .
negative	" account verificatie kon niet worden uitgevoerd " gaf het_apparaat aan .
negative	medewerker legde ons uit dat_het_apparaat een software probleem had en omgewisseld zou worden .
negative	we kregen binnen 0 dagen een " nieuw " apparaat ( dat_er dan wel gebruikt uitzag , maar goed we hadden weer pin )
negative	vijf weken later precies hetzelfde probleem .
negative	weer klantenservice gebeld weer hetzelfde antwoord , onze excuses wat_een pech dat_dit u twee keer gebeurd , maar zoals eerder gemeld software probleem , wij wisselen het_apparaat weer voor u om .
negative	en weer ontvingen wij een pin apparaat met gebruikssporen maar_ook deze deed het naar behoren .
negative	tot onze grote verbazing ontvingen wij 0 mei 0000 bovenstaande factuur dat een bedrag van 000 . 00 per automatische incasso (!?
negative	) van_onze rekening afgeschreven werd i . v . m .
negative	beschadiging aan pin apparaat .
negative	gelijk de klantenservice gebeld want dit moest toch een misverstand zijn ?
negative	zeer onvriendelijke klantenservice medewerker aan_de telefoon .
negative	legde uit dat hij foto '_s voor zich had liggen waarop je weliswaar als leek de beschadiging niet kon zien ........ maar voor hen wel duidelijk zichtbaar .
negative	deze foto '_s kon_ik via mijn account bekijken .
negative	het_apparaat zouden wij hebben laten vallen .......... toen wij aangaven dat_dit absoluut niet het geval is , werd er gezegd dat een klant met_een horloge deze beschadiging ( niet_op_de_foto '_s te_zien ) dan aangebracht zou hebben ?
negative	op onze verbaasde reactie daarop , werd gereageerd dat wij schreeuwden ( dat was absoluut niet het geval ) en dat medewerker daarom het recht had om_het gesprek te beëindigen , wat hij dan ook prompt deed !
negative	zelf zijn wij de_foto '_s gaan bekijken , met bijbehorende serienummers van apparaten die wij in bepaalde periodes gehuurd hebben .
negative	wat bleek de_foto '_s van_het desbetreffende apparaat , waarop voor_een leek de beschadiging inderdaad niet te_zien was .
negative	waren gemaakt ( datum staat rechts onderin ) op_een tijdstip dat_het_apparaat niet in ons bezit was !!!!!
negative	wederom sepay gebeld .
negative	deze medewerker gaf aan dat_dit uitgezocht moest gaan worden , want een aantal foto '_s waren niet van ons ( die met_de beschadiging die niet te_zien was ) maar op " andere " foto '_s waarop ook geen beschadiging te_zien was , bleek het software probleem te komen omdat we het_apparaat hadden laten vallen ( zucht !!!!!!)
negative	.
negative	het_apparaat dat wij als vervanging hadden gekregen bleek dus twee dagen voordat we het ontvingen kapot geweest te_zijn !!!!!!!!
negative	kan iemand dit nog volgen ........... wij in ieder geval niet_meer maar sepay schijnt deze chaotische werkwijze heel normaal te_vinden .
negative	zij zouden één en ander gaan uitzoeken , dan wel door de medewerker die zo beleefd was om_de hoorn op_de haak te gooien ........ we gaven aan dat we daar weinig goeds van konden verwachten !
negative	maar goed zij zouden contact opnemen hoe nu verder ...............
negative	inmiddels meer dan een week natuurlijk niets gehoord ....................... maar tot onze grote verbazing was vandaag wel het factuurbedrag via automatische incasso afgeschreven .
negative	wat_een brutaliteit !
negative	zelf de zaken niet_op orde hebben en dan klanten onterecht duperen !
negative	we hebben in het laatste gesprek aangegeven dat we ons contract bij sepay per direct wilden opzeggen , daarop kregen we te horen dat we dat 0 maanden voor 0 juli 0000 hadden moeten doen , dat die termijn verstreken was en dat daarom ons contract stilzwijgend met 0 jaar (!!!!!!!)
negative	verlengd werd .
negative	op onze vraag hoe dat mogelijk is , omdat in nederland toch wettelijk verplicht is , dat klant daarvan in kennis gesteld moet worden , was het antwoord dat deze verplichting niet voor bedrijven geldt .
negative	ook kregen wij te horen dat een heleboel bedrijven wel zo netjes zijn , maar_dat sepay dat_niet doet !!
negative	wat_een zelfkennis !
negative	.
negative	wat_een praktijken !
negative	.
negative	bovendien moet_je sepay machtigen om maandelijks het huurbedrag van je rekening te_laten afschrijven ( anders kun_je_het_apparaat niet huren ) maar hoe halen ze het in hun hoofd om zonder enige vorm van uitleg , deze in onze ogen zó onterechte factuur , zomaar af te schrijven ...........
negative	wat_een gebrek aan klantenservice !!!
negative	!
negative	i am paying too much for an old car worth less_than 0 , 000 .
negative	horrible customer_service as well !
negative	i tell everybody to stay away from drive time any chance i get !
negative	they take_advantage of people who barley have money to begin with !
negative	i will celebrate when i no_longer have to deal with this horrible company !
negative	wanted to put some plain lenses in a pair of pristine prescription maui_jim sunglasses since getting new optics with a new prescription would be over the top expensive .
negative	after they assured_me it could be done , i mailed back my frames .
negative	took over a month to get the glasses and then they came back with duplicate prescription lenses !
negative	they said that it is my fault because i didn_'_t specify plain lenses .
negative	since there was a series of e_- mails and talks and i believed they only did plain lens replacements i was floored when they didn_'_t even want to talk to me about the problem .
negative	the customer_service rep hung_up on me when i asked if i had then remade if it would cost less with plain lenses .
negative	very rude .
negative	since the old lenses were perfect , would that raise a red_flag that perhaps there was a problem here ?
negative	stuck and made about it .
negative	my boyfriend bought a verizon cell_phone from a seller who said the phone was fine and in working condition .
negative	when we received the phone it ended_up being stolen and therefore could not be activated by verizon .
negative	to make a long_story short ebay said the phone was " as_described " by the seller and could not get our money back .
negative	i didn_'_t understand how the phone " was as_described " if i couldn_'_t even activate the phone .
negative	oreder 0 swimsuit from them , my first time ordering anything from them .
negative	i put my order in on june00th , 0000 and my package should have been here within 0 - 0 business days .
negative	it is june00th , 0000 and i still do not have it nor have i been able to track it !
negative	custumor service is the worst ever !
negative	i called between normal business hours non_stop for 0 days and never got ahold of anyone !
negative	an opporator would come on to say to call back between business hours or all lines were busy so i never got through .
negative	i tried to track my package and couldnt .
negative	they never gave_me a number to track it .
negative	finally someone emailed me back saying they were shipping it the following_day and i would recieve my tracking_number then .
negative	so now today i tried to track it and the number wouldnt work .
negative	usps said no records for it and on my ami profile it says shipment complete !
negative	and i have no package !
negative	all i can do is hope i get it and its the right size and color and not to mention order !
negative	we '_ll see if i get it in the next_day or 0 but i am very piseed off .
negative	this place is the worst ever !
negative	do not order anything from them !
negative	horrible !
negative	i wouldnt have even gave them !
negative	star but there was no zero in this rating !
negative	looked really nice on the web_site but i received it some of the glass parts were not fixed in properly .
negative	very disappointed so i returned it , sorry .
negative	do not order anything online !
negative	they lie to you , take your money , and a week_later you get a letter in the mail_stating that they no_longer have your item that you already purchased !
negative	i exchanged a pair of michael_kors boots , i received as a present from my boyfriend , for the same exact pair i already had , to get the wide calf version ( my other pair fit me , i just preferred the wider calf ) and i now lost them forever .
negative	if it states that they have them available they dont so save your time and money and dont even_bother ordering them online .
negative	they will say they have it in stock , take your money and then send you an " im sorry " letter a week_later !
negative	i am extremely disappointed in macys online services and am reporting them to the better business buero immediately !
negative	when i called macys all they said was " sorry .. theres nothing we can do ..." they were nice but if they had to send those letters to people they should be ordering more from the manufacturer because it was an_error that was their fault !
negative	so they need to make good for their mistakes even if it means ordering another shipment from the company !
negative	i ordered a new bed online from argos on 00nd of may , i paid for it in full on my card and didn_'_t give it any more thought until i came home the evening before delivery was due over a week_later .
negative	i found a message on my ansaphone saying that due to a stock issue my bed would not be getting delivered tomorrow .
negative	as i was due to go into hospital the day after delivery of the bed was due to have major_surgery .
negative	i would now have no bed to sleep in when i came out of hospital and i would not be in a position to assemble one then , i was in a bad position , thanks to the incompetence of their logistics / buying / planning departments .
negative	when i rang them the customer_service ( and i use that term very loosely ) clerk was just about as unhelpful , couldn_'_t care less and unapologetic as they could be .
negative	i do understand that they might be depressed when working for such a slack company and having to take phone_calls like mine all day .
negative	i have requested a full_refund to my card and done what i should have done in the first place ordered one from amazon !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	bathing suites fit nothing like other coco rave swimwear i own in the same size .
negative	part of my order was not shipped due to out of stock and it was the tops to part of my order .
negative	i don_'_t_believe i should have to pay return shipping for my inconvenience .
negative	you will be very lucky if you '_ll receive furniture of slightly different color or lower quality .
negative	your problems will start if you '_ll get dirty and damaged furniture .
negative	i received damaged sofa from futonland on may , sent them all information asap , and i got a lot of calls and e_- mails telling that everything will be fine , and they will find the place where sofa will be fixed , or they will return some money .... then they stopped answer my e_- mails , and return my calls .
negative	so , now it is the end of the august and i have dirty , damaged sofa and futonland has my money .
negative	remember they can fix something only if you are living in new_york , they don_'_t have contacts anywhere_else .
negative	i took delivery on friday of my kubrick retro winged chair in a beautiful shade of plum purple .... the delivery guys were really efficient and polite and were kind enough to unwrap it for me and take away the packaging .
negative	the quality is outstanding and i know i would have paid a few_hundred more for the chair in a high_street store so it was well_worth waiting for ... perfect !
negative	i searched all over my city for a counter high dining_room table and could not find one .
negative	so i decided to look on - line and found the perfect on at amb furniture , or so i thought .
negative	i got the set home and found that 0 of the chairs have a 0 / 0 inch gap from the bottom of the leg and the floor .
negative	i put it on the table and still there was the gap .
negative	i contacted amb about the gap .
negative	at first they were cooperative until i asked them if they would reimburse_me for having to send the chairs back because it was at no fault of my own that they were defective .
negative	that '_s when all communication stopped .
negative	it have been almost a year that i bought that set .
negative	i have taken then to court and they did not show up .
negative	now i '_m just trying to get my money back and i have to find 0 matching chairs .
negative	to those who buy from them make_sure that you live in ca so if you have to return them you can just go to the store .
negative	anywhere_else you might have a problem .
negative	buyers beware of amb furniture and design .
negative	you would think that they would stand by their product , but there are always shady people in the world !
negative	after waiting an_hour and a half for my airport shuttle ( not the fault of rentalcars . com ), i was frustrated to find out that the rental_car company had not received my reservation from rentalcars . com .
negative	this caused me to have to wait another 00_minutes for the rental company to find a car for me and at 0 : 00 am , i was extremely frustrated .
negative	i went to the hampton_inn website to book 0 rooms at a hampton in forrest city , ar .
negative	the website would note accept my quite valid email address , so i called the phone_number listed on the website .
negative	the person_who_assisted_me was very polite , but at no time did he indicate that he was employed by a third_party vendor and not hampton_inn or the hilton parent company .
negative	nor was this apparent on the website .
negative	he quoted me a rate that was higher_than that on the website , but i had no option but to book the rooms .
negative	when i checked in i signed a form showing the room rate , which was substantially lower_than the rate i was quoted on the phone .
negative	it wasn_'_t until i checked out and asked for a statement that i was told the rooms were booked through_expedia , that i would be billed by expedia and that the hotel could not provide me with a statement because it was an expedia booking .
negative	the desk_clerk did give me a copy of the form i signed showing the lower room rate .
negative	when my electronic statement arrived via_email it showed that my credit_card was billed at the higher_rate quoted to me on the phone .
negative	i believe it should be stated in large type on the website that the booking is being made through a third_party and that if you call the reservation number for assistance , you should be told at that time that the booking is being made through a third_party .
negative	i also think the rate quoted on the phone should be the same as that on the website .
negative	received items in what can only be described as if a car had ran over the already clearly impractical box it was packaged in .
negative	i then emailed in complaint and received a bog standard automated reply - which doesn_'_t even solve my problem of damaged goods as their ' convenient ' way to return items through collect_+ doesn_'_t have a branch near my address ( especially so as i don_'_t drive )
negative	so_far , worst_experience i '_ve had buying something online !
negative	you cancelled my return flights because i missed my flight to my destination .
negative	it cost
negative	me over $ 0 , 000 . 00 to get to my destination and back .
negative	i have advised anyone i talk
negative	to about my trip not to ever book a vacation with travelocity !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	will freeze your account from one just one complaint omg .
negative	p ** pa * needs to be shut the hell down .
negative	i would have to rate this site at a ( d -) in schools a d - is grounds for gettin yo butt whipped by your parents because obviously you have bad grades go figure .
negative	communication is horrible and if you get some unsatisfied customers b * uj ** will delete your account out of nowhere what the hell .
negative	as long as your buyers get their merchandise what the hell should they care if sellers dropship .
negative	well goes to show you should set_up your own auction website .
negative	it does not pay to sell on someone_elses .
negative	even if they assumed that you dropship , which they did with me assumed i dropshipped .
negative	they did not have any proof they deleted my account , but first they make_sure t * u ** na gets your verification fees and tr *** na and upp *** id slit the profits .
negative	never again will i shop petflow .
negative	i ordered my book on the 00th of jan and on the 00th was issued a refund for a canceled order , was never notified and i was waiting for my book frantically and never got shit !
negative	the only_reason i knew it was canceled was because i looked at my bank_statement , will never order shit form here again lost a valuable customer !!!
negative	!
negative	this is order #_000000000 .
negative	we ask for perseus an they sent us something_else .
negative	different design and different praise .
negative	we sent them back .
negative	i didn_'_t received the money yet .
negative	we had to spend extra money to buy something_else on the last_minute .
negative	i will not use you web_site again an i will not recommend it .
negative	we ordered wedding_bands .
negative	they were for a wedding , and your stuff couldn_'_t pay_attention to sent the right order ?
negative	sorry you do not respect your customer .
negative	i have tried for over a month to post an honest review of avas_flowers ( one of trustpilots clients ) but trustpilots keeps harassing me asking me over and over for different_types of proof of purchase .
negative	i have emailed everything and they refuse to accept it .
negative	clearly you can not trust anything posted by trustpilot .
negative	update , check this out , i post my review and instantly it '_s followed by their ' response '.
negative	what a bunch of crap !
negative	i purchased a 00lb_bag of merrick whole earth farms and the more i transitioned them from merrick classic to this the sicker my dogs got .
negative	in no time i had to rush one to the vet quickly followed the next_day by another dog .
negative	i used merrick for years and believe in their products .
negative	they were quick to respond and tested the sample they kept from the lot .
negative	there was nothing wrong with the sample .
negative	one could only conclude that it was the bag i received and that it likely wasn_'_t stored properly .
negative	now i find this company doesn_'_t even answer the phones .
negative	i cancelled all future orders and wrote why in their questionaire but , of course , they didn_'_t respond to that as well .
negative	$ 0 , 000 later and a week of sick dogs i assure you i will not roll over and play dead .
negative	update .
negative	i have since been able to get through to the company .
negative	i don_'_t know what was wrong with the phones the week before which furthered my anger when i couldn_'_t get through .
negative	but i '_ve had three conversations with a manager ( each time i was put right through to her ) and we worked to resolve this issue .
negative	thankfully they will be checking the food they have in stock from the same lot mine was received from .
negative	as i mentioned earlier , all three of my dogs were sickened by the food .
negative	i don_'_t know if the bag was compromised in some way that was not noticed , who_knows .
negative	i won_'_t change my rating but at_least i was finally able to discuss this with someone there .
negative	based on my experience i will only buy from local companies now where i know how the food is stored .
negative	i '_ve never had this problem before and only hope i never have it again .
negative	they never sent the side_view_mirror i ordered .
negative	a shipping label was printed according to ups but the part never left the facility .
negative	i needed the part .
negative	when i inquired_about my order they only sent me a cancellation notice .
negative	then they charged me a 00_% restocking_fee & sent a refund minus the 00_%.
negative	wtf_?
negative	they better refund all my money !
negative	i had been a customer of theirs for about 0 years and everything went_smoothly till this year .
negative	i ordered on 0 / 00 / 00 and then again on 0 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	i figured they would ship my first order within a few_days of returning from their chinese new year ... not until i made several complaints on facebook did they ship the first order and after a week replied to several emails sent to them .
negative	i finally got a reply on 0 / 00 that they were out of stock on my products from my second order and when ship when they could .
negative	you can '_t charge people for items that you don_'_t have to sell .
negative	i filed a paypal dispute as well as filing with the ftc against them .
negative	they replied to paypal with shipping info on my first order and wasn_'_t going to refund my money .
negative	when i called paypal and let them know what was going on they opened disputes on both orders .
negative	i did get one order and my money back .
negative	they also blocked 0 names from posting on their facebook_page and deleted every post i had made for sharing my experience .
negative	will never order from them again .
negative	i have found everything i wanted and was going to order from them through amazon and ebay for less money and gotten everything in a timely_manner as well as shipping always is fast .
negative	don_'_t repeat my mistake !
negative	on may 0 , 0000 i called 0 - 000 - 000 - 0000 and made a reservation for the country inn suites , in galena il at address 00000 oldenburg ln .
negative	date of arrival june 00 , 0000 with a departure_date of june 00 , 0000 .
negative	i did not catch the operator '_s name ; i know i talked to a female , i also know you can go back to this phone_call and listen to it , per your agent justin , whom i talked to tonight .
negative	on may 0 , 0000 , the agent re - confirmed the dates and provided me with a confirmation number of xxxxxxxxx and a follow - up e_- mail was sent .
negative	upon_receiving my confirmation via_e_- mail , i noticed the month was incorrect .
negative	i called the reservation line , 0 - 000 - 000 - 0000 , listed in my e_- mail confirmation , and told the operator (" david " also known as pacheco flores david mauricio ) about the error .
negative	to rectify this , he said he needed to cancel the reservation , and also stated he would transfer me to the hotel to re - book the correct dates .
negative	this transaction took 00_minutes .
negative	i was connected directly to the hotel and spoke with rachel .
negative	rachel was unable to get me the same room and rate , and consequently , i have to pay a higher price for an_error on the part of two agents at reservation . com .
negative	my new reservation number is xxxxxxxx per rachel .
negative	i immediately called back to the reservation line , at 0 - 000 - 000 - 0000 , and spoke with justin .
negative	this transaction took 00_minutes - i explained to justin the month was incorrect , and my reservation , xxxxxxxxx was canceled .
negative	explaining what had happened , and trusting what your agent , david , said needed to be done , i am at a loss .
negative	i did not want the reservation canceled , but corrected .
negative	justin was unable to help me , but assured_me the agent who canceled my reservation would / could be reprimanded in addition to the original agent on may 0 , 0000 .
negative	my question to justin - " how does reprimanding an employee benefit me - what customer_satisfaction and customer_service am i receiving ?"
negative	justin stated repeatedly he was sorry , but he could not do anything , again i ask , what customer_satisfaction and customer_service am i receiving from reservations . com ( also acting as an agent of expedia ).
negative	justin said he would submit the situation to his support_team and i should expect a return phone_call within 00 - hours ; and if i have not heard back from the support_team by thursday , i should call back .
negative	the service i have received so_far is unacceptable .
negative	my expectation of reservations . com is to provide me with exceptional customer_service and rectify the situation without penalizing me as the customer .
negative	because reservations . com entered the wrong month on may 0 , and then canceled my reservation on may 00 , versus correcting it , i ask that reservations . com correct the error without punishing me , your customer .
negative	i expect my reservation to be reinstated , with the month corrected , all without_any monetary penalties associated with it .
negative	an_alternative resolution acceptable to me is a voucher , that can be used at the country inn suites in galena , il , during my stay june 00 - june 00 , 0000 , for the difference i between the original reservation and the current reservation .
negative	i am waiting to hear back now from reservation_counter .
negative	tonite they picked_up our car .... we are on auto deduct and have been ....
negative	i just checked the credit union and both payments are still there .
negative	they didnt contact me , they didnt put that god awful beeping thing on it to contact them .... not a letter , nothing ....
negative	i was set to go down there with a friend on friday cuz she needs a car but i cant understand it .
negative	they advertise if u cant pay drop it off .... never got that option either .
negative	we followed the guy towing it he was doing 00 up the 00 and no signals up the bumps etc ...
negative	took poor care of the car while in his posession and it had our wallets in it so my daughter got our wallets so he lost control of the repo cuz it could have ended badly .
negative	however my gripe wasnt with him but with drivetime ... now there are two payments sitting in our house account and they took the car without a single peep .
negative	my sister my best friend daughter are all listed as contacts but no one has ever heard from them ....
negative	i will take my friend to viva auto now cuz they will finance her too and i guess the horror_stories_about drivetime are true .... dont trust them for your purchase .
negative	sorry if this resolves i will be sure to post as i gave them great reviews when i purchased so ...
negative	not sure how to contact them , pleae send information , or call or e_- mail me !!

negative	my plant was in transit for 0 days .
negative	it was root bound and bone dry .
negative	it was an old plant with dead leaves from being cut back .
negative	i had to soak it over night before planting .
negative	i expect this when i shop at home_depot where they don_'_t price gouge !
negative	you asked for my credit_card to take a fee of 0sek but you never mentioned that you would infact take 0sek plus 000 sek out of my account !!!
negative	gift bah !
negative	when i saw the knockout_roses on the brighter_blooms website i thought it was a perfect idea to order a few for my front garden ... and it was .
negative	i ordered ( 0 ) 0 - gallon knockout_roses at $_00 . 00 per piece roughly and $_00 . 00 shipping .
negative	my entire order for ( 0 ) knockout_rose_bushes was $_000 . 00 and i thought that they were giving me a good price .
negative	i should have done my homework first .
negative	yesterday i visited a local_nursery and saw the same knockout_roses , only at larger 0 - gallon size for $_00 . 00 per piece and no shipping .
negative	i feel_stupid and i feel ripped_off .
negative	my advice before you buy at brighter_blooms ... do your homework first .
negative	you will probably find a much_better deal at your local_nursery .
negative	pretty clever scam : some people get the first use of the itunes_gift_card .
negative	then they send the same redemption code to another unsuspecting customer ... of course you can '_t get a refund through credit_card chargeback procedures because the ' goods ' are proven to have been delivered by the merchant .
negative	but , of course , then you don_'_t have the value of the itunes_gift_card which you just paid for .
negative	dont use these_guys - total scam
negative	try pcgamesupply . com instead
negative	don_'_t take a chance on this one .
negative	one of my cartridges did not fit and another one dribbled ink from inside .
negative	perhaps this seller would have replaced the bad order , but it should have been right the first time .
negative	i cannot recommend ink_farm .
negative	how am i supposed to write a review when i haven_'_t received my products yet .
negative	i ordered hockey stuff for my son '_s christmas_present in nov , allowing plenty of time for delivery .
negative	good were delivered ( by yodel ) and card left advising us of options for redelivery .
negative	after 0 lengthy phone_calls and 0 separate days off work waiting at for goods to be delivered i learned that items had been sent back to supplier ( millets ).
negative	after_contacting millets they promised that goods would be automaticaaly redespatched on return to store .
negative	this did not happen .
negative	when i finally phoned again to check order i was told that goods had been put back in stock again - 0 item was no_longer available and the company could not guarantee delivery before christmas .
negative	-- very disappointed son as local suppliers do not have particular items he chose !
negative	-- very poor service !
negative	i ordered a phone on 0 / 0 , and my card was charged for the order on 0 / 0 .
negative	on 0 / 00 , i emailed customer_service at cell0get asking if my phone had shipped , and if so , if they could give me the tracking_number .
negative	melvin emailed me and said that my phone had shipped but that i needed to call them to get the tracking_number .
negative	i have tried_calling repeatedly since 0 / 00 and have left several voicemail messages asking someone to please call me and provide me with the tracking_number because i ' d like to know when i can expect to receive my phone .
negative	i missed a call from them on 0 / 00 , but they didn_'_t bother to leave me a voicemail_message .
negative	i have called at_least 0 times since 0 / 00 , and no one has ever returned my call .
negative	i also replied to the email that melvin sent me and requested he call or email me the tracking_number asap .
negative	i have heard_nothing .
negative	it is now 0 / 00 .
negative	i am very unhappy with the lack of customer_service and communication , i still have no phone , and i have no_idea when to expect it ( although they certainly had no problem with charging my card right_away ).
negative	i '_m getting worried now after_reading several negative_reviews of this company .
negative	i wish i had researched more before placing my order .
negative	update_: so , after at_least the 0th or 0th time of attempting to reach_someone at cell0get . com , i finally_reached someone by phone yesterday .
negative	they emailed me the tracking_number ( usps , not ups , as stated in my order confirmation ).
negative	i did indeed receive the phone today , but it was the wrong color !
negative	at this point , i '_m thinking screw it -- i '_ll probably just keep this phone because my current phone is about to die and i don_'_t want to wait around for another two_weeks or more hoping to get the right phone .
negative	i don_'_t think it '_s worth the hassle .
negative	on the plus side , it looks like the phone i received is indeed new and with all accessories ( battery , charger , headphones , etc_.)
negative	included .
negative	but overall , i am very disappointed with cell0get '_s lack of customer_service and attention to detail and do not plan on ordering from them again .
negative	ever .
negative	the only appropriate " star_rating " for expedia would be not a star , but a black hole .
negative	the main problem is that the customer_service phone staff seem to be making up information as they go along .
negative	over the course of these multiple phone_calls , i received a plethora of different answers as to why i could not access the offer i was trying to get , most of which contradicted each other or the text of the offer itself .
negative	here is a summary of the explanations i received over the course of these numerous phone_calls :
negative	•_“ this offer has expired .” ( me : “ but it says it doesn_’ t expire until july 00 .” agent : “ we haven ’ t updated our web_page yet .”)
negative	•_“ the hotel has decided to discontinue this offer .”
negative	• expedia has decided to discontinue this offer .”
negative	•_“ i don_’ t see any such offer anywhere on our site .” ( two different agents told me this .)
negative	•_“ you have to cancel your hotel reservation and re - book it again for a later date .
negative	•_“ you have to book this offer at the same time you make your hotel reservation – it cannot be booked separately .”
negative	•_“ you can get this offer by visiting the ‘ activities ’ tab , it does not have to be booked in conjunction with a hotel .”
negative	•_“ you have to use the offer on the same date as your hotel check - in date .”
negative	•_“ this offer is only available with a two - day advance purchase .”
negative	•_“ this offer is only available with a five - day advance purchase .”
negative	•_“ there is no reason_why you should not be eligible for this offer , and i will transfer you to customer_service .” ( i was then disconnected after a 00 - minute hold .)
negative	•_“ you are not eligible for this offer .
negative	their customer_service is a bad joke , totally unknowledgable , and created numerous problems on my trip .
negative	ordered 00 internal doors , handle sets and hinges etc from this company costing over_£ 0000 in total .
negative	deliveries constantly delayed , then partial deliveries made .
negative	waited and chased for over 0 months , with no replies to my emails .
negative	also discovered dan bonsall ( company owner ) had then blocked my ip address so i couldn_'_t even get in touch via website or other means .
negative	very devious - avoiding his responsibilities and commitments to customers .
negative	fortunately got some money back from credit_card company for the balance of undelivered items , but have now discovered dfl / internal doors uk are in liquidation so starting the process of chasing the liquidation company for costs .
negative	good luck to all you who are pursuing this too !
negative	i was so frustrated with the whole thing .
negative	i bought this card for my daughter and paid for 0 day shipping .
negative	it took 0 days to get to her .
negative	then he was unable to activate the card because the brilliant people that you are flagged it for fraud and said you would not activate it and you would return my money .
negative	well guess what you still_haven_'_t returned my money !
negative	i am so angry and frustrated with the whole thing !!
negative	!
negative	i would like to understand the difference in charge between the reservation voucher ( usd 000 ) and the actual amount charged to my credit_card : usd 000
negative	my confirmation_email didnt arrive in my mail box figured it was an_error in email happens .... then day before check out i get a call stating that i had to check . out that day .... i had a 0 year_old anda00 year_old with me no wayto get everyone packed and out ... when i put it in on line check out was 00th then im informed i was supposed to have checked in on the 0th when my plans weeks in advanced had been the 00th especially traveling with my daughter and mother .... i called customer_service and the rep was extremely_rude first with tone of voice then when i told himabout email issue he said was impossible i didnt recieve it ... told me he couldnt help . me refused to talk to me told me if i had an_issue id have toemail the company when i asked for email he refused to answer and told me again email company hung_up .... i would never use this company again ... first and last time using them ....
negative	i will not order from you again unless i can get delivery at a po_box
negative	bestilte en parfume .
negative	fik også track & trace nummer .
negative	men den dukkede ikke op .
negative	da_jeg kontaktede kundeservice , sagde de , at de ikke havde flere .

negative	my husband and i have used travelocity a lot !
negative	we have booked flights , hotels and packages .
negative	however , after a recent experience we are considering switching to other travel companies .
negative	i was trying to book two packages and i simply could not understand the person i was talking to .
negative	i finally hung_up after a 0 / 0 hour and called again .
negative	again , i could not understand the person ( i even tried spelling everything .)
negative	in addition , i was told the prices i was reading on my computer " were not available because i wasn_'_t looking at them in real time ."
negative	after more than an_hour i gave up .
negative	i called another company and got the exact_same hotel that travelocity said was the price was no_longer available .
negative	i was able to book two packages in 00_minutes .
negative	i am sad to say goodbye to travelocity , but their problems are too frustrating .
negative	we reserved a best_western using the " discounted " rate service and was charged approximately_$_00 more then the actual room rate had we purchased on location .
negative	the actual location although it was in slight disrepair was ok , not the best , but it was clean and our family was able to sleep which was the intent .
negative	i '_ve been trying to get someone to resolve my issue for over a week now .
negative	the second part of my order was never delivered !
negative	at this moment i would not recommend this company .
negative	not good service .
negative	my item never turned_up and when i tried to phone to in sort it out i received no answer
negative	worst service ever !
negative	fed_x delivery went from california to minneapolis to kansas_city where it was sent to the usps .
negative	very poor !!!!
negative	just as we '_ll went to china also .
negative	will not buy from you again !
negative	i have been going back and forth with hudson_reed for months regarding a faulty shower_head , the 00 " sunflower shower_head to be exact .
negative	after months of horrible customer_service and getting no where with these people i had to purchase a new one .
negative	way to stand_behind the 00_yr warrantee !
negative	then i leave a bad review on this website and they responded to my review saying it wasn_'_t their problem basically .
negative	then almost 0_weeks_later i get the following email :
negative	further to our reponse on trust_pilot .
negative	we would be pleased to send you the new shower_head at our cost of course as a commercial gesture .
negative	would you be willing to re - visit the review that you left on trust_pilot ?
negative	please confirm the actual delivery address .
negative	best regards ,
negative	[_name ]
negative	to me that looks like a clear bribe to get me to leave a good review for hudson_reed .
negative	don_'_t trust the reviews you read on here if they are good , you never know what that customer was given to say something nice .
negative	horrible company , horrible customer_service , horrible products !!
negative	they need to be shut_down !
negative	commercial gesture ??
negative	screw you !
negative	what about the damn 00 warrantee listed ?!
negative	or standing behind your product for that matter ?
negative	i purchased a curtain strand of lights to put up in my daughters room .
negative	i was going to hang them behind some gauze curtains for her frozen themed bedroom .
negative	the lights worked initially .. but when i tried to put them up they flickered and half of them went dark .
negative	what a waste of money .
negative	so disappointed .
negative	i got the box and all that was in it was air and packing paper .
negative	and there is no holes in the box and im very pist a bout this wanted the parts for friday
negative	i picked your storage p [ ace because it was close - also because it said first month only $ 0 . 00 which was just a come on -- never happened !!!
negative	then because i was on a fixed_income and thought i could handle $_000 . 00 a month .. then not even 0 months later you raised the rates ???
negative	how fair is that ???
negative	?
negative	a friend of mine pays $_00 . 00 a month for a space for his car -- problem -- 00_miles_away ..
negative	i need to get to locker by myself and it '_s too far ..
negative	i am trying to pay the high price but don_'_t know for how much longer .. not very happy ..
negative	i sent over 00 dvds into this place almost two months_ago .
negative	they have supposedly posted me a cheque twice but still no sign of it .
negative	they won_'_t send me the payment electronically but keep re - checking my address .
negative	seems like a total scam to me .
negative	i should have taken the dvds to my local charity shop instead .
negative	label w_/ content details is stuck to outside front of box .
negative	item i purchased was a birthday_gift for person living in same household who found the delivered box sitting on doorstep when they came home .....
negative	no surprise w_/ the blatant labeling .
negative	upon lodging a complaint i was told the company was paperless so that '_s the way they do_business .
negative	great , won_'_t be buying anything from them again .
negative	rethink your business_practice petflow !
negative	i was not completely happy with the product i received and instead of helping_me or offering suggestions , they quickly turned my issue over to a " warranty problem ", giving me a 0 - 000 # to call .
negative	lucky for me , the customer_service at protect - a - bed was very helpful !!!
negative	i will not use northshore_care_supply again !!
negative	!
negative	i understand the express deal feature means no changes / cancellations / etc .
negative	however .
negative	i take real issue with the fact that at the end of the form it asks you to login to your priceline account and in doing so , refreshes the page and reverts all your fields to blank and you selections back to the top of each list .
negative	i went beck to re - enter the information , not realizing my selections had been changed upon refresh , i ended_up with a smoking , handicap_accessible room ( i am not handicap and i am traveling with a small child ).
negative	of course they wouldn_'_t change it even_though it was their system that changed it from my original choice .
negative	the should have made it right .
negative	reverting everything after you have filled out the form is pretty slimy .
negative	i will never use their service again .
negative	i wont be buying anymore from chewy as some of my cans were so bent that i was afraid to feed it to my dog .
negative	so thanks for the one and only purchase from chewy .
negative	even_though my salesmen ( tw & brandon ) helpful had great peraonalities , my experience went downhill during my paperwork .
negative	i had already brought my necessary documents the week before to be approved and processed .
negative	it took them 0 hours to have me sign .
negative	i had selected my car before i got there which was from a different location and they did have it ready for me .
negative	during the test_drive i realized there was some maintenance needed on the brakes .
negative	i told my salesman i needed their mechanic to look at them .
negative	he said no problem they would take_care of it .
negative	0 0 / 0 hours_later i '_m still_waiting .
negative	i had asked if i should go get lunch .
negative	i had told them hours ago i hadn_'_t ate yet .
negative	( popcorn was offered , i had already snacked on that .)
negative	i was told they ' d have me out in just a few .
negative	after no progress , i left for lunch .
negative	when i came back , still really slow .
negative	i explained ithat i needed to go to work and could they speed up process .
negative	the man_who did my paperwork , i believe his name was terry , was afraid to tell girl at counter , he said that would make her slow_down .
negative	finally by 0 : 00 i have my keys .
negative	( seriously late for work ) i rush out and when driving notice brakes are the same !
negative	so i go immediately to the auto center where i work .
negative	i '_m notified i need new brake_pads and rotors need resurfacing .
negative	i immediately call the store , get brent .
negative	he says if i bring the car up for a day and leave it and pick it up another day they can take_care of it , or pick another car .
negative	at this point i have spent a week picking out my car .
negative	unless you want an avenger or chrysler_000 , selection isn_'_t that extensive if you are concerned with mileage .
negative	so within 00_hours i come_back with my car .
negative	i talk with terry .
negative	he says with look of outrage , and what ?
negative	you want me to fix it .
negative	he laughs .
negative	i said of course .
negative	i told my salesman before ourchase there was a problem with them .
negative	he says , who says oh well who said brakes are bad ?
negative	( sears ) he said you said they don_'_t know what they are doing , why would you listen to them ?
negative	( i have no_idea why he is going off on sears auto center ).
negative	he talks to ' mechanic ' ( am told there isn_'_t actually one on staff ) and said he inspected brakes and their was no issue .
negative	he finally calls brent because of eli .
negative	he says i can leave car there and re buy it in a couple days .
negative	( already was supposed to be out of town day before ) buying a car ( i drove it there , i live an_hour away ) returning it , coming_back later to repurchase is beyond inconvenient .
negative	just because they are there everyday doesn_'_t mean i have time to hang out multie days .
negative	do i need to take a week vacation to buy a car that is fully operational ?
negative	terry is so rude i had to say you are being rude .
negative	he doesn_'_t relent , scoffing at my comment saying he isn_'_t rude , just telling_me like it is .
negative	he tells_me to just pick out another car .
negative	again when i tell him i don_'_t want another car , he is rude .
negative	he says , i have all these cars !
negative	( the avenger with only 00k miles on it drove like my 0 year_old car whose wheel bearings were out .)
negative	( another chrysler_000 had such little gas i had to out it back in parking_lot .
negative	was way past low fun .)
negative	finally he says call warranty .
negative	i do and they send me to marvin '_s garage for inspection .
negative	the shop made time for me and did determine i need all rotors resurfaced and brake_pads on front and back .
negative	warranty paid for all except for brake_pads , including balancing tires .
negative	i accepted .
negative	( option being return car i love and painfully select car i don_'_t want or walk 00_miles home !)
negative	not even my salesman ( tw ) has ever called to ask what happened , are brakes fixed .
negative	are you enjoying your car ?
negative	i will end up paying $ 00k for my $_00 0000_mazda .
negative	this is unacceptable behavior to me for purchasing a car .
negative	set me up for success ?
negative	$ 0 , 000 down and same day need new rotors and brake_pads .
negative	being ridiculed because i noticed a problem with brakes and had it inspected by the sears auto team of tuscaloosa ( who do great thorough work ).
negative	no consideration for i need to get to work and waited 0 hours to sign papers when they already had my paperwork previous week ?
negative	sucked the joy right out of my new car .
negative	i will not even drive around with the drivetime plate holder .
negative	i will not recommend this location to anyone , and will let others know why .
negative	if not for the excellent service from the auto shop and the warranty company willing to help , i would have took a cab home , and left my mazda there as instructed .
negative	i would not have came back for it , or any other car there .
negative	ridiculous describes the amount of time it took to purchase and resolve .
negative	disgusted describes my experience .
negative	i will not ever use travelocity again .
negative	they not only withheld information_regarding fees i would have to pay if i canceled or rescheduled , but then kept me on hold for hours ( yes , several phone_calls ) and refused to take any responsibility .
negative	booked for tuesday .
negative	they then phoned to cancel as over booked .
negative	re booked for the next_morning before 00pm .
negative	they turned_up at 0 . 00 after i phoned chasing up .
negative	they had not booked it in property again .
negative	when they came they couldn_'_t replace tyres as they couldn_'_t find the locking_wheel nut .
negative	it was in the boot .
negative	would not use again .
negative	only positive was quick refund .
negative	i applied for health insurance on feb 0 0000 the money was removed on feb 00 and was told i had insurance on feb_00th when i called on march_00th about my id number no one knew what i was talking_about and gave_me the number to blue cross blue shield and it took 0 hrs to get it straight and as of april 0 still don_'_t have any id numbers a . no communication between the 0 company '_s
negative	their returns_policy is ridiculous , and because of it , i will not be ordering any more parts from this business .
negative	original box ?
negative	really ?
negative	mine was badly_damaged when it arrived .
negative	this is the replacement part i ordered because i couldn_'_t see from the picture which was the correct_part .
negative	i think the return_policy should just read , we don_'_t accept_returns , because that is the real policy , they just make it so difficult for people to return a part that it is not doable at all .
negative	i have been in the friggin hospital having major_surgery , and get out to deal with this foolishness .
negative	this is the worst customer_service i could ever imagine .
negative	i may just try to get credit for this from visa , because these people obviously do not care at all about customers .
negative	my whole family has always ordered from this business , but never had to return a part , and i am going to do everything i can to make_sure that they don_'_t continue to patronize this company .
negative	i could not be more disappointed in the response .
negative	modtog ordrebekræftelse ved bestilling .
negative	i en hel uge hørte jeg intet .
negative	så kom pakken , eller rettere pakkerne i dag , men uden følgebrev , og de var kommet fra hinanden .
negative	umiddelbart var_det ike til at se , der_var to pakker , og hvad_der_var sendt .
negative	kl .

negative	don_'_t book flights with american_airlines unless you want to be surprised !
negative	we booked our flights to cabo through_travelocity last october through_travelocity for may flights only to find out 0 days ahead of time that our flights had been changed without our being notified .
negative	luckily my daughter checked the flight status ahead of time and found out we had our flights changed to make us lay over at dfw for about 0 hours instead of 0 putting us into cabo near midnight .
negative	our return flights were also changed .
negative	we were fortunate to get these flights changed and that required changing our reservations for ground_transportation from and back to the airport .
negative	i have heard other horror_stories_about american_airlines .
negative	not sure who was responsible for the flight changes but am very dissatisfied because we were never notified of any changes
negative	i have not received the purchese yet and i ´ t ´_s a long time ago since i bought the items .
negative	can somebody tell me what have hapened ?
negative	i tried contacting this company 0 days previous to my trip without a response .
negative	i finally called them back enough times that i got a hold of someone the day of my trip .
negative	it was unfortunate i lost my entire amount because there wasn_'_t anything they could do by the time i reached a person .
negative	i will never use or recommend this comany to anyone !
negative	won_'_t use that site again rushed poor quality
negative	we purchased a goku costume from this company 0 0 / 0_weeks before halloween and never received it and even paid for expedited_shipping to make_sure we received it on time .
negative	the costume was shipped to an unknown address in santa maria , ca .
negative	contacted customer_service and they said they didn_'_t know how this happened and assured us that a replacement would be shipped out asap via courier express .
negative	i asked for a tracking_# and they sent one but it turned_out to be invalid .
negative	we paid via_paypal and now are requesting that our $$$ be returned .
negative	at first they ( alice ) said in order to receive a refund they needed our credit_card # , exp date , csv code .
negative	i told them , " hell no !".
negative	why should we give you that information if we paid by paypay .
negative	this company is a scam .
negative	our emails are now blocked and the site is down .
negative	we ' re working with paypal to get our $$$ returned .
negative	ordered a pair shoes for my daughter and have never seen shoes so off in size !
negative	my other daughter who_wears two sizes smaller could not even wear them !
negative	buyer_beware
negative	since it does not have the yellow tab to remove , and the gray covering is hard to remove and when you do the ink comes out and leaks out over everything .
negative	this is the second time this has happened so i will not buy from you again .
negative	my invoice says for long_distance , however these are obviously reading_glasses .
negative	i have tried to contact them to find a resolution but have gotten no where .
negative	probably my fault for allowing rep get my prescription .
negative	even after discussing with her that i didn_'_t want reading_glasses , that '_s what i ended_up with .
negative	horrible experience with this company .
negative	i placed my order months_ago , they charged
negative	my credit_card for the full_amount but each time i contact them to determine when
negative	they will send me my glasses , they reply with another excuse and say to check back
negative	in two_weeks .
negative	i attempted to cancel my order but they say i will be charged a 00_% stocking_fee .
negative	who is the victim here ?
negative	i am so mad that i did not take the time to research this company before i gave them
negative	my money ...
negative	take my advise ... beware !!!

negative	i even called and got no help .
negative	so , on the day of my tour , since i didn_'_t . t know what to do , i showed_up buckingham_palace but they would not honor the email sheet i presented .
negative	they told me i had to go to the golden_tours office .
negative	needless to say , i was late for the tour and needed to rebook .
negative	i asked dor a refund and they wouldn_'_t give it to me .
negative	so i had to rebook for 0 days_later and they charged me half price .
negative	i don_'_t think i should have to pay for the original booking since i was unable to print the voucher .
negative	i would like to request a refund for the original booking and am happy to pay full price for the rebooked trip , is the anything you can do to assist me ?
negative	sincerely ,
negative	lisa maas the date of the original booking was 0 / 0 / 0000
negative	they cancelled the order after they billed me .
negative	then they found out they did not have the part i needed .
negative	i have had several rude encounters with the returns dept and still have not received my refund .
negative	at this point i '_ve just given up , it '_s not worth the aggravation of being belittled by the women that claims to be the manager of returns dept .
negative	i will never purchase from frames_direct again , and i tell my family and friends to avoid them as well .
negative	this is a copy of the message to which i never received a reply , will have to do chargeback

negative	and it i answered yes , it was asking for payment info once again plus it had an employ field for “ city ” i the address and the filed was usable ( not able to type in it ) so the whole thing wasn ’ t working
negative	at this point i have decided to use paypal to about the multiple transaction problem .
negative	same thing happened except i also got receipt from paypal that i was charged
negative	still no booking
negative	i have called customer_service and spend about an_hour talking to heckel , and she was not able to find paypal transaction to either cancel it assign booking to it .
negative	eventually my husband booked the remaining room with his card .
negative	however i still have the charge for missing booking , please credit it asap to avoid paypal chargebacks

neutral	wish the site allowed for multiple doctors .
neutral	i have several members of my family that wear_contacts .
neutral	to save time and processing , i ordered 0 family_members on one order .
neutral	unfortunately , i didn_'_t realize that only one doctor was allowed to be input on the webpage .
neutral	one of the family had a different doctor than the other two .
neutral	i was contacted via_email to provide the info of the doctor , no problem there .
neutral	however , another email arrived later stating that i had provided an incorrect number , unfortunately , that was not true .
neutral	i let customer_service know and they are continuing to get verification of the scrip .
neutral	i didn_'_t have a copy of the scrip to send .
neutral	long and short of it - have a copy of the scrip in hand so you can email or fax it to opticontacts and avoid frustrating delays .
neutral	the ordering and delivery were spot on !
neutral	however one set of lights has the same function on 0 and 0 on 0 set and the very first bulb on my other set had exposed soldered wires and so i had to apply electricians tape !
neutral	some of the bulbs r a bit too white on 0 set too , i found the lights pricey but assumed i would obtain a quality item because they cost so much !
neutral	i '_m implusive and love christmas and wanted my tree up as soon as my living_room was decorated and so returning the units has not been an option !
neutral	i '_m doubtful if i will order another set as i was originally going to order 0 sets .
neutral	i purchased used 0000 cpt and 0000 icd - 0 - cm books for my hospital planning department to reference , as the 0000 books that we were using were too outdated .
neutral	the description for " used " reads ".... may include moderately worn cover , writing , markings ," and the description absolutely was true .
neutral	the covers of both books are warped , and the cpt book has pencil underlining under every code description .
neutral	even_though i was warned by the description , it was surprising to see that people actually were as rough on these books as they were in relatively little time , and then resold them !
neutral	our 0000 books are in excellent condition .
neutral	however , my total bill was $_00 dollars , and the shipping was timely .
neutral	as the saying goes , you get what you pay for !
neutral	spend the extra $ to buy books in a better - than - used condition .
neutral	the idea of having pet_food delivered to our home is great !
neutral	the prices on petflow were competitive with local_retailers and with the coupon petflow offered it was actually cheaper !
neutral	i love how easy it was to place the order and find the dog_food waiting on our porch .
neutral	my only_complaint is that the shipping process took longer_than_expected .
neutral	i ended_up having to go to our local_pet_store to buy a bag of food because our dog had completely run_out and the petflow order had not yet arrived .
neutral	this was a bit frustrating .
neutral	i am hoping our next bag arrives closer to the expected delivery date .
neutral	i think i summed it up above !
neutral	i received an_email_telling_me my order was back ordered and i would be notified when they came in and when they shipped i have yet to receive any further information on my order .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	i am so happy with my new sunglasses !
neutral	it '_s a shame about the courier company they use as they did not let_me know that delivery was unsuccessful .
neutral	so after waiting an extra week i had to chase them up and rearrange delivery .
neutral	i was disappointed that after making a special effort to inform the driver that access would be through the garage which i had to leave open as i wasn_'_t to be at home .
neutral	i found that the driver had old instructions ( some 0 years ' previously to access the tank by the footpath ) and in doing so has broken the fence which is meant to be small dog proof .
neutral	you will appreciate that this is an irritating inconvenience .
neutral	also , knowing that delivery would be given when not in residence there was a telephone_call for directions !
neutral	do the drivers have a map as well as a sat_nav ?
neutral	otherwise , apart_from this extremely irritating inconvenience i am a great fan of boiler_juice who are extremely_helpful .
neutral	but the admin must be sharpened up when subcontracting .
neutral	delivery very good , arrived next_day , but had to pay for this .
neutral	quality i felt was not very good .
neutral	returns are a bit of a perlava , had to drive 0miles to shop for returns .
neutral	all in all felt this company was no better or worse than any of the other catalogues .
neutral	a . tomlin
neutral	i got the deal from living_social , and i ordered something from petflow .
neutral	when i order , i ordered around $_00 worth of items in order to get the free_shipping .
neutral	but when i check out , it didn_'_t let_me know that i will get charge of shipping .
neutral	until i get me email , then i realize they charged me .
neutral	i think they should have mention at the check out that i will get charge shipping if i '_m not order over $_00 after using the coupon_code .
neutral	i feel_like i got tricked , i will not buy from petflow again =(
neutral	deze pagina graag in het nederlands aub
neutral	this is the first time using book_byte .
neutral	easy to order , fairly quick shipping however , my daughter found out that she didn_'_t need one of the books for a particular class and i thought the return shipping cost was paid for but come to find out that i had to pay to return it .
neutral	i use a couple of other book rental places and never have to pay to return books for whatever_reason .
neutral	i will most_likely stick to those companies in the future .
neutral	i '_m optimistic that i '_m going to like petbest , but there are two concerns i have .
neutral	one is that only part of my order has arrived and i '_ve not received any notification on when i will receive the second part of my shipment .
neutral	it has_been more than two_weeks since i '_ve placed the order .
neutral	the second concern is that i wonder_if the quality of the cat_food is the same .
neutral	the label on one type of food is slightly off color and another flavor has far more water than when i buy it from my local_pet_store .
neutral	really pleased with item and price .
neutral	let_down by local branch of delivery company but can '_t blame store for that .
neutral	i had ordered a tail_light_assembly for my car because obviously mine had cracked .
neutral	i chose this site because i had been referred and it had pretty great reviews .
neutral	my part was a great price but how it was packaged was kind of careless .
neutral	it was just put into a cardboard_box with an insert to keep it from moving but no padding to keep it from get damaged from a possible fall .
neutral	i really feel something like this should have had bubble_wrap or some actual padding .
neutral	not sure about full website but on my mobile not very easy to acces any product .
neutral	couldn_'_t find any button to add to the basket .
neutral	lucky i knew what i was looking for and mananged to get it .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	unfortunately i experienced much difficulty purchasing my goods online .
neutral	there seemed to be some glitch in the process which wouldn_'_t allow me to alter the delivery details from the invoice details .
neutral	over three_days and around 00 attempts each one was timed out .
neutral	i eventually_managed to secure my order by having it sent to me instead of the intended recipient .
neutral	although irritating and time_consuming it probably_wouldn_'_t deter me from using the site again .
neutral	these things happen .
neutral	the room itself was clean !
neutral	however i didn_'_t like that the containers of shampoo and such was only half full .
neutral	stating that they have been used previously , and their was 0 of us in the room total , so we would '_ve ran_out if i hadn_'_t brought some with .
neutral	also their was only one bar of soap that i had found in the shower , so their wasn_'_t any to wash your hands with .
neutral	however i did love the walk in shower !!
neutral	very roomy and you didn_'_t have to fight with the curtain .
neutral	my bed was nice except for the pillows they weren_'_t very comfortable .
neutral	over all it was a pretty nice stay , i would '_ve rated it a 0 0 / 0 but their wasn_'_t one !
neutral	i bought perspi_guard maximum strength antiperspirant for my teenage_daughter , although the product works very well , it does cause itchiness which unfortunately outweighs the products use .
neutral	excellent service though .
neutral	unexpected things can happen !!!!
neutral	every hotel reservation should have the option to " cancel " up to 00_hours prior to check in date .
neutral	that option makes a difference in my decision to book with that hotel .
neutral	prompt delivery , although the bag arrived ripped_open .
neutral	but , think they were all there ?
neutral	my only_complaint is that i must actually talk to a customer_service representative to cancel a program .
neutral	my puppy had grown_up and i was changing him to adult food so i wanted to cancel my puppy_food shipment program and start an adult food program and i had to call and explain that to someone before i could do it .
neutral	i was not able to simply log on the website to my account and do this .
neutral	it '_s very inconvenient and is completely contradictory to the idea behind online shopping .
neutral	i looked and my pet_food is available on amazon .
neutral	i am a amazon_prime subscriber and i am considering having amazon deliver instead because of this policy .
neutral	i ordered fabric which turned_out to be not what i expected .
neutral	i wanted to return it .
neutral	since they have stores in every state , i assumed that i could return at the store , not reading the return_policy that they do not allow store returns and that online orders has to be shipped back which is such a bummer because i did not want to lose on return shipping after i considered my purchase a loss .
neutral	i did end up keeping the fabric and have it sitting somewhere until i find an " aha " moment project suitable for it .
neutral	i gave it 0_stars because they don_'_t allow store returns .
neutral	i have ordered from this website for years .
neutral	i have really no_complaints about the quality since i understand that we always get what we pay for .
neutral	i give this store 0_stars because i ordered 0 turtleneck sweaters from them less_than a month_ago and the hang tag on it says 00 but the tag attached on the turtleneck itself was " active basic " not forever00 .
neutral	i understand that this company buys wholesale and changes the tags to their own company but they failed to do it on my order .
neutral	it makes me think i ordered from another store .
neutral	i think it is quite a mishap on their part .
neutral	if they are trying to sell their brand , they should make_sure to change the apparel tag to their own instead of leaving the tag of a wholesale shirt which can be bought for less_than 0 bucks a piece .
neutral	lastly , i wish they issued refunds rather_than store credit on store returns .
neutral	we received a 0 - 0 lb .
neutral	box of bees for our new hive .
neutral	we typically buy them locally ( and already had but a flood wiped them out a week after we got them ).
neutral	the box was not completely full ( much closer to the 0 - 0 lb .
neutral	size ) and there were a lot of dead ones on the bottom due to transport .
neutral	however , in light of that they installed well and are thriving five days_later .
neutral	i will still continue to buy my local bees ( mainly_because of the greater amount i receive for the same price ) but if i needed replacement ones i would recommend these .
neutral	i had to follow_up with test equipment depot after i placed the on - line order since i did not receive a confirmation_email .
neutral	it was not in my junk folder as they suggested .
neutral	once i spoke with a representative , the order was immediately confirmed and the product shipped out and received quickly .
neutral	i had to order my shirt 0 sizes bigger then my normal size because its made small , and also when i received the shirt it was very wrinkly .
neutral	but i do think the shirt is still cute and i do plan on wearing it .
neutral	i ordered last_minute as i had been let_down by another supplier and needed my item asap .
neutral	staff were very friendly and helpful on the phone and confirmed they had the item in stock and would be able to overnight the delivery .
neutral	the delivery did indeed turn up the next_day but unfortunately it was the wrong item .
neutral	again staff were very polite and helpful on the phone when i recontacted them , and they apologised .
neutral	my requested item was overnighted after i got them to double_check its availability .
neutral	a simple error but one that put me at some inconvenience .
neutral	i am also disappointed that i had to ask for the additional postage to be refunded ( it was ) when i feel this should have been offered as a conciliatory gesture .
neutral	your pricing is competitive and fair .
neutral	sometimes , there is a lot of static on the line , the initial connection to your 000 number is fine , but then static as the call is put through to the destination number .
neutral	that is usually solved by hanging up and then calling back .
neutral	i love ordering my pets ' food online , i do it all the time .
neutral	i decided to order from pet_flow because i read that they accept manufacturer coupons .
neutral	i placed an order of over $_000 and never got my money back for the coupon .
neutral	i called customer_service and they told me that instead of giving me money back on my card they added it to my account towards my next service , which makes no sense considering the coupon is good for money off of the food that i am buying right at that moment .
neutral	when i asked to speak to a supervisor the rep told me i would get a call back in 0 - 0 hours and that she currently had no manger on duty .
neutral	its been a week and i still have not gotten my call back .
neutral	most of the deals i have got from wowcher have been good .
neutral	the wowcher team themselves are helpful and the process of buying the wowcher and retrieving the deal work really well compared to other_sites .
neutral	i was really disappointed with a recent deal that turned_out to be not worth the money !
neutral	i didn_'_t receive what i paid for .
neutral	i ordered a clarisonic cleanser brush from the macy '_s . com website and was having numerous problems with the website .
neutral	however , after a phone_call , they were able to make things right .
neutral	they also sent a bonus item to make up for the issues .
neutral	i ' d shop there again , but i prefer shopping in person .
neutral	ordered 0 led_light for dogs and only 0 work .
neutral	are you going to be evil or are you going to follow the path of light ?
neutral	i gave you benefit of the doubt so 0_stars it is for new .
neutral	i hope google stays
neutral	under the sun and don_'_t turn to darkness .
neutral	ebay is a great way to market items to a large audience .
neutral	the program is user_friendly ; however the only_drawback is the high fees_associated with selling through the site .
neutral	it seems that the fees continue to escalate and it is very hard to make even a small profit resulting in fewer sellers willing to offer items .
neutral	also , i believe that the high fees will drive users to seek other means to promote their goods .
neutral	hello , i received my items promptly however the items in the box were tightly packed therefore my chips were crumbs upon_receipt .
neutral	costumes arrived quickly however some were not completely sewn and needed mending
neutral	this delivery arrived as scheduled , but had call following_day the supplier called to say 000_litres extra had in fact been delivered checked and agreed , which then meant the cost to me was virtually doubled , i paid boiler_juice as ordered but subsequently paid supplier also , not easy in the current climate .
neutral	i use public_storage and suggest others to use public_storage .
neutral	irby is aways clean and the staff is friendly .
neutral	e andato tutto bene , consegna rapida .
neutral	solo un po di confusione perche un messaggio mi chiedeva di andare a ritirare il mio acquisto nei prossimi due giorni quando avevo pagato per la_consegna a domicilio .
neutral	comunque tutto e stato chiarito venocemente .
neutral	ordered the bags and they were awesome .
neutral	then came the mounting .
neutral	first , parts were missing and some were detective .
neutral	second , the brackets looked like they might damage my bike when installed .
neutral	viking was quick to send missing and replacement parts , but , why do i want to drill holes in the bag to mount them ?
neutral	i ended_up purchasing the right brackets off amazon . com for a very reasonable price .
neutral	they arrived quickly , fit_perfectly , the bags installed easily and look awesome and i didn_'_t have to compromise the bags by drilling holes in them .
neutral	overall , i had a good experience i got most of the items in a timely_fashion .
neutral	however , for three items i had to cancel my order after waiting for extended periods of time and re order other ( often more_expensive or less well reviewed ) items so that i would not have to wait several_months for item that were mislabeled as in stock but were really on back order .
neutral	nice site with the lowest_prices i could find - there are some really great deals .
neutral	however , i had big difficulties with the booking process and was unable to get any assistance from customer_services .
neutral	in order to contact customer_services , you have to raise a ticket number - but you can only do this if you have a valid booking number , which_means that if you need any help with the booking process itself , you ' re stuffed .
neutral	the site kept saying my credit_card was declined , even_though i had sufficient funds and was using my card to book other things that day without_any_issues .
neutral	i tried about different 00 times , with 0 different credit_cards , logging in and logging out , researching for the fare etc to see if it made a difference ( i really wanted the fare !)
neutral	and the transaction eventually went through .
neutral	not sure what the problem with the site was but i was about to give up .
neutral	once the transaction went through , the etickets were emailed through to me with no_issues and i was happy with this side of the process .
neutral	i would use the site again , but hopefully the issues with the booking process and being_able to contact customer_services without a booking number are resolved .
neutral	good ... some of the websites do not accept visa_debit_card .
neutral	but , the hotel price is not the cheapest .
neutral	there are other cheapest offer , but due to visa_debit_card couldn_'_t be used , i am failed to book it .
neutral	really appreciate great parts at a great price .
neutral	but waiting for more than a week to get them ( form illinois to michigan ), and missing a weekend window of opportunity to make the repairs , was frustrating .
neutral	according to the email i received , the label for shipping my part was created for three_days before the package was finally on its way to me .
neutral	pretty disappointed with priceline . com this trip .
neutral	first at no point in time was it disclosed that the hotel room was non_- smoking and for that matter the entire hotel was smoe free .
neutral	also my search was for a room for 0_adults yet when pruceline booked it they switched it down to a room for 0 people .
neutral	i asked for advice in advance about managing the best route if we started at buckingham_palace .
neutral	the response was generic and didn_'_t help .
neutral	as a result we added an unnecessary 00_minutes to our trip
neutral	as we travelled with young kids , this seriously took the edge off our experience
neutral	this came quickly , well_packed .
neutral	and correct .
neutral	i did e_mail a query to garden 0 less the next_day , but i had no response . i e_mailed back to the address for confirmation of order , maybe this was incorrect .
neutral	query resolved by looking at john_lewis web_site .
neutral	i am disapointed about one of the items , a t - shirt wich had the most wonderful print on the website ( probably photoshoped ) didn_'_t look so fabulous in reality at all .
neutral	it was different_colors and looked really boring compared to what i had expected .
neutral	all the other items were great thou , seems to be nice quality .
neutral	good contact , delivery time as expected .
neutral	according to partsgeek '_s order confirmation it stated i would receive an_email_stating when my part was shipped and that it should ship within 0 - 0 business days - neither of those things happened .
neutral	i had to keep going back to my order and verify that it was shipped , then it sat at ups " waiting for a label " for several days before i could track the order .
neutral	was very frustrating .
neutral	i ordered two_pairs of glasses .
neutral	one was with regular lenses in a frame i ' d had previously .
neutral	that was fine .
neutral	the second pair was sunglasses with the same prescription and guess frames .
neutral	to my surprise , the temples of the sunglasses were rhinestone studded .
neutral	i hate that !
neutral	when i looked at the guess sunglasses frames on the website after receipt to find out whether i should have realized this , the model of guess frames was no_longer pictured .
neutral	i didn_'_t complain or send the sunglasses back because i honestly don_'_t know whether it was my oversight -- but i suspect those ugly rhinestones were hard to see in the photo .
neutral	there ought to be better disclosure on expensive sunglasses ( they were more_expensive than my everyday glasses !)
neutral	when cheap over - the - top rhinestones are included .
neutral	truly , they ruin the sunglasses for me .
neutral	i was happy with the expeditious delivery , but was a little shocked to see the age of the food .
neutral	usually , the canned kitten_food ( same brand as and flavor purchased through petflow ) i purchase from a store has a two year + expiry_date .
neutral	however , the cans i received from petflow were within eight months of expiry .
neutral	as if sensing the age of the food or knowing something was not quite right , my cat shied away from some of the cans that were in the cases i purchased .
neutral	i bought a fridge_freezer for my daughter as a present .
neutral	there was no delivery date given until after purchase , which_meant if the dates they offered were not convenient , it was tough .
neutral	i had put my daughter '_s name and address for delivery , and a couple of days_later , i was phoned and quizzed - had i asked for delivery to a separate address and why .
neutral	my daughter has a title , and they had googled her address and did not think it was up to the title .
neutral	i explained that it was a gift and that obviously it needed to go to her address and not to me .
neutral	eventually they phoned her and gave her a date , and no time other than between 0 and 0 she was told , although delivery was not made until almost 0 , so the whole day was wasted , whereas if morning or afternoon had been indicated , she could have sorted_out her daughter from school and her shopping for nappies for her son etc .
neutral	i also did not understand_why they phoned me in lincolnshire to tell me that they were 00_minutes away from my daughter in walton - on - thames in surrey - and i had to tell them to phone her .
neutral	wasting a day away waiting when some indication could have helped was not very good .
neutral	value for moneywise , obviously we did our research for the fridge_freezer , delivery , removal of the old_appliance , and no - one had the price and free delivery and removal , so they are streets ahead .
neutral	in fact , in my isme catalogue , the appliance was £_000 - nearly double , and £_00 delivery and no offer of removal of old_appliance , so all in all , and it is gorgeous , it was kind of worth it .
neutral	i have short toes .
neutral	the toe covers are too big and the flexible tubing too wide .
neutral	i have this problem when i order from a catalog .
neutral	the tubing does not stay on , even if i trim it .
neutral	i need tubing for the smallest toe .
neutral	it is had to find .
neutral	placed my order which consists of 0 different lense strengths on 0 / 00 .
neutral	i was informed a few_days_later that one of these items is on back order .
neutral	it '_s now been 0 days since i '_ve placed my order and it would have been very helpful if the rest of my order was shipped while waiting for the last item to be filled and shipped .
neutral	it was easy to place my re - order though .
neutral	i wanted to get matching swim_suits for my daughter and i . i found both our sizes in a fun suit ... and placed the order . apparently they ran_out if the kids size and sent the adult one only with an_email_stating and updated order only including the adult size .
neutral	i am disappointed inventory isn_'_t kept up to date with the website .
neutral	my intention was to have matching suits ... and now i have a suit and have to order another set of suits .
neutral	bummer !
neutral	i wish i was contacted by a person .
neutral	i could have cancelled my order and picked a different style
neutral	i have rented through bookbyte several_times and have always been impressed with the prices and ease - of - return .
neutral	however , i came_across some problems with the most_recent book i rented .
neutral	after not receiving one of my books for almost 0_weeks , even_though i paid_extra for fast shipping , i checked my account and found out the order had been canceled .
neutral	i had not received any emails to warn me of this cancellation .
neutral	also , i had still been charged for the book .
neutral	after_contacting bookbyte i was informed that the money would be given back to my banking account .
neutral	it still has not been , but they said it may take several days and it has only been three .
neutral	these were ordered for my mothers birthday .
neutral	they were ordered on 00th sep at midday , and arranged for delivery the next_day .
neutral	cut to the 00th , and they '_ve just arrived .
neutral	my mother tells_me the bunch is nice , but somewhat wilted ( not happy , as i paid_extra for extra stems , so to hear that the extra_effort merely resulted in the delivery of a wilted bunch of flowers is disappointing ).
neutral	it was not made clear when i chose the delivery date that it was not guaranteed .
neutral	even so , efforts should be made to ensure flowers arrive fresh , regardless of when they arrive .
neutral	disappointed , and will not use again .
neutral	next time , i '_ll pay extra and use a local_florist .
neutral	i bought filigree ceramic solar_lights previously and was so pleased with them i ordered four more when they came up on offer .
neutral	when they arrived - very promptly i must_say - they were a much smaller version of the original .
neutral	i now know the size is given with other details , but i did not realise there were two versions of the same light so took no notice of it .
neutral	although disappointed , i have decided to keep the lights anyway since they are so attractive , but feel more should have been made of the fact that you were selling a smaller version .
neutral	i was very pleased with the delivery of the product , with regular_emails_informing_me when to expect the order .
neutral	however the taste of the vanilla has let_me down and with a 0 . 0kg tub of the stuff i '_m a little_bit stuck .
neutral	never mind , maybe strawberry next time !
neutral	the part was good and the price was even better but i spent three hours on the phone trying to get my call answered .
neutral	kept getting an_error_message about high call volumes .
neutral	finally someone did answer and they said that my part would be shipped that day and it was not shipped until the next_day .
neutral	the major issue is them not being_able to handle the call_volume but i would use them again
neutral	overall we felt this was a good way to see some of the sights that were a bit too far for us to walk to from our central_london hotel , and we enjoyed the personally narrated portion of the tour we did the best .
neutral	however , we found the bus service to be painfully_slow in the outer portion of the tour ( we waited over 00_minutes to get picked_up from kensington gardens ) and the bus sat at the stop at the wax museum for 00 + minutes for no apparent reason .
neutral	everyone says they are really quick at posting out your order ( usually within a day ).
neutral	i placed an order nearly a week_ago and still have recieved no confirmation_email to say its been posted .
neutral	and according to the website what i had was instock .
neutral	i mean how long does it take to ship out 0 items .
neutral	just glad i didnt pay for next_day delivery .
neutral	bit annoyed as they have taken my money
neutral	instructions were not clear where to park car so first parked in wrong place .
neutral	husband then had to move car while i struggled with three children and all the cases .... not stress_free !
neutral	we then had quite a walk to the terminal_building .
neutral	on our return we agian struggled back to the collection_point and had to wait 00_minutes for the car to be returned .
neutral	the delays at some stops on the blue_route were interminable .
neutral	the red_route was much_better .
neutral	at_least if there was a delay there was communication from the driver or the tour_guide .
neutral	i would advise people to stick to the red_route .
neutral	the quality of the sheet , duvet and pillow_cases is not in question and my order arrived super quick .
neutral	however , i was rather shocked at the packaging - or rather lack of it .
neutral	the six items were stacked together and wrapped in a single sheet of c & c paper which was all rather crumpled .
neutral	all the items inside will have to be pressed by me as they are very wrinkled .
neutral	bearing in mind this order is supposed to be a christmas_present , i am not able to give them as they are .
neutral	compared to the white company , the packaging and care was disappointing .
neutral	i ' d ordered show buttons from affordable_buttons for our last show of the year ( in 0000 ) and i was extremely happy with both the service and quality of work performed by the graphics team .
neutral	as a result , i was more than happy to order all of our show buttons for 0000 from affordable_buttons .
neutral	the people i communicated with were very pleasant and very professional .
neutral	the buttons were completed and delivered to me in no time at all .
neutral	i was , however , disappointed in the quality of the work done by the graphics team .
neutral	i had sent a pdf document providing a mock_- up of how i wanted the buttons laid_out , together with written_instructions for each button ( noting color changes , etc ).
neutral	i had also sent each photo in jpg format .
neutral	for each button i ' d sent the original photo together with a " cut - out " showing what area of the photo to use on the button .
neutral	it was apparent that the first draft sent for review was just a copy of the " mock_- up " i ' d sent in the pdf document ( without the changes i ' d requested ).
neutral	following that , any drafts that were sent to me contained the changes i ' d noted .
neutral	it didn_'_t appear that the jpg ( photo ) files i ' d sent were used at all , because in the finished_product the quality of the photos appearing on the buttons left a lot to be desired .
neutral	i would order from affordable_buttons again , but i certainly would emphasis the desire to have any original photos sent used on the final_product ( not just a cut - out of the mock_- up i ' d sent ).
neutral	arrived_promptly .
neutral	however , when cap was removed ink spilled out - like it was over filled .
neutral	not good .
neutral	we wiped things down which was obnoxious to have to do .
neutral	then when we placed cartridge in printer , it worked o . k .
neutral	i wss told it would take 0 - 0 . 0 hours to put on 0 new_tires .
neutral	it took almost 0 hours .
neutral	not acceptable on a weekday ...
neutral	although i find the service fast and reliable , the new site layout is not very user_friendly .
neutral	finding what you want can be frustrating so i just go elsewhere when that happens .
neutral	the old layout was very easy to navigate and it seldom took more than one click to get to the product wanted .
neutral	the layout negatively impacts the customer experience enough to affect the rating that i gave .
neutral	service was quick and easy to use , just slow to release cash i thought .
neutral	the river_cruise was a very positive_experience .
neutral	the bus_routes and stops offered were very good however a lot of our time was spent waiting for a bus to come along .
neutral	unfortunately on 0 occasions the buses were too full and we had to wait_until the next bus .
neutral	on one occasion near the end of the day we had to stand on a bus therefore not experiencing the commentary or the intended purpose .
neutral	as a result of the time spent waiting on buses etc we were unable to complete the blue_route as the bus approached marble_arch it was announced that he was finishing soon therefore we had to get off and walk to the nearest tube station .
neutral	i '_m still missing a converter extension plug for the power chaise .
neutral	the delivery guys said they called it in and entered it in the system , that it was missing .
neutral	i noted it on the delivery invoice that they keep , and followed_up with an_email , but i '_ve heard_nothing back .
neutral	still_waiting !
neutral	sofas and sectionals ... regards eileen
neutral	there is a great range on offer , almost anything you could want from an envelope !
neutral	however , the price that is advertised is without tax which i always feel misleads people as it was added at the end .
neutral	also i could only choose signed for / tracked delivery which was more_expensive than regular postage which i would have choosen .
neutral	so the price quoted on the website , came out more_expensive than i was anticipating .
neutral	also i bought some black enevlopes and the colour came off onto my white wedding_invitations which was very disappointing .
neutral	ui : not as sleek looking as other_sites in general and definitely not as sophisticated looking as similar_sites such as seamless ( i . e_., kind of looks older gen and sterile )
neutral	ux : deciding to switch to another restaurant after starting an order is a pain .
neutral	there is no simple way for user to simply click to get back to list of restaurants .
neutral	it would also be nice if user could see what items people liked and how many people liked them for a particular restaurant ( kind of like fb or seamless ).
neutral	restaurants : not as extensive as its competitors grubhub or seamless .
neutral	content : menus for certain restaurants don_'_t list items that restaurants generally carry at a particular time ( e . g_., restaurant is known to serve breakfast all day but on delivery . com you cannot order breakfast items after a certain time ).
neutral	items are missing ( e . g_., restaurant offers side dishes or desserts on competitor sites but not on delivery . com ).
neutral	i end up using seamless or grubhub even_though i may start out first at delivery . com for this reason .
neutral	i was in a rush to get my tyres before mot .
neutral	i clicked on a free saturday_morning slot and then had emails saying it was full .
neutral	i was annoyed as i had already paid and couldn_'_t get there at 000pm in the week , which was there alternative suggestion .
neutral	i would have gone to ats if i had known .
neutral	we had several phone_calls , and then booked a saturday slot , but at a garage 0 miles_away .
neutral	0rd time lucky .
neutral	actual service from team and garage was good .
neutral	website just wasn_'_t up to date enough with the garage slots .
neutral	book if you have lots of time , be cautious if need them quickly !
neutral	i bought the plant for my mother for mothers_day .
neutral	the plant was depicted with flowers on it but when the product arrived it was barren of flowers .
neutral	i choose a house plant over regular flowers since it would last longer and the combination of a flowering plant for mother '_s day seemed perfect .
neutral	my mother loves the plant but we ' re both disappointed it did not arrive as shown on the website photo '_s , e . g .
neutral	with flowers on it
neutral	hopefully it will eventually flower one day .
neutral	it '_s a shame you do not go a size_bigger on the ladies jackets
neutral	my dogs love the chicken treats ....
neutral	just wondering_why it takes so long to get them when you fedex them out also why such a big box for just a few little treats ???
neutral	i '_m just saying you maybe pay more for the box than the treats ..
neutral	i ordered flowers for the same date , and they did deliver .
neutral	however the flowers were not as expected and they were small in size to what i expected and paid for , hence me being disappointed as they were for a family_member , not value for money .
neutral	not sure i would use the same day again .
neutral	sends me " updates " of old stuff .
neutral	ive been repairing my credit and have yet to get an update od anything ive done over the last few_months .
neutral	i do like your bedding selection .
neutral	it is my fifth order , and the items aren_'_t shipped .
neutral	i email .
neutral	i call .
neutral	the call back to me is that it '_s only been a week since i ordered and they had to pack 0 big boxes .
neutral	they said they ' d ship it at the end of the day .
neutral	and i still_haven_'_t gotten a shipping e / mail 0 days from when i received that call with an an annoyed voiced .
neutral	if it takes_longer each time i order and even when i order items worth 0000 pounds at a time , do i get an unkind call back saying it '_s only been seven_days and i shoud keep quiet ?
neutral	now it '_s 00 i think , and i think it takes them
neutral	more than a day to just pack a box .
neutral	it would be nice if they ' d give me a discount_coupon for a change for apprecaiation or for
neutral	apology .
neutral	.
neutral	my customers are waiting in this freezing korean weather .
neutral	it '_s not okay for my korean customers who always get things quicky and politely to get his kind of service .
neutral	i sent back the windcheater jacket as the bottom toggle was broken and the stitching was coming undone .
neutral	i emailed superdry with some piccies of the damage and they sent me some return labels which was good .
neutral	the jacket was sent back on 00th may .
neutral	i contacted superdry on the 00th may as i hadn_'_t heard_anything .
neutral	they were quick to come_back and say it would take 0 - 00 working days to process .
neutral	i got an_email on the 0rd june saying another jacket had been dispatched .
neutral	this jacket is in perfect order as has all the other items i have ordered from them .
neutral	the free first month '_s rent offer was a factor in my rental decision .
neutral	i am disappointed and feel_duped .
neutral	the manager of unit , however , was very nice and accommodating despite the " free rent faux pas " and the transaction went_smoothly .
neutral	i have used inkfarm in the past and had absolutely no_problems .
neutral	this order , i received the wrong ink twice .
neutral	they were more than willing to correct the mistake ( s ) and the correct ink was received in a couple of days with no shipping fee charged .
neutral	however , i paid shipping_charges on the two incorrect orders and i was not reimbursed for that cost .
neutral	i feel that i should have been reimbursed for those shipping_charges .
neutral	they did give me a return_authorization for the incorrect ink which did not cost me anything .
neutral	reimbursing the money i spend on shipping on the two incorrect orders would have gone a long way to endure my future business .
neutral	recieved the 0 led_lights as ordered , 0 worked one did not .
neutral	went_onto your website to find replaced batteries .
neutral	found none and no resource for locating batteries .
neutral	do i return the one not working , do i find replacement batteries on my own , your shipping_charges make me hisitate to order them through you because a . 00 batteries could end up costing me
neutral	more than $ 0 . 00 some information would be appreciated .
neutral	i love the ones that work i have a 000lb staffordshire and 0lb chihuahua due to the central valley heat in california i like to walk my dogs in the early evening around 0 / 00 : pm i tried mornings but they were to groucy .
neutral	we each have an led_light blinking , i cross several busy streets .
neutral	each dog has one on her collar and i wear one on a lanyard around my neck .
neutral	i feel much_safer with the lights .
neutral	several people seeing us , stopped , lights flashing waiting to cross where there is not a crosswalk have ( bless their hearts ) stopped to allow us to cross safely .
neutral	i love the lights , i don_'_t love the lack of information that came with them .
neutral	need to be a little more pro active on the customer_service .
neutral	the car was good and the service from the company good .
neutral	the website led me to excess_insurance cover which i bought through mondial £_00 for 0 days but when i got to ireland enterprise cars told me that mondial cover did not include ireland and tried to sell me excess cover at 00_euros per day .
neutral	this cover for insurance excesses is annoying and a rip_off - the car_hire companies should all quote for cars with fully inclusive insurance and a small excess if necessary .
neutral	not enough communication .
neutral	had to contact the seller to find out my product was back ordered .
neutral	been two_weeks and still no word on when i will receive my product .
neutral	hi the product ( the shower_tower ) that i ordered did not fit for my measurements properly .
neutral	so in that case , i returned the shower_tower and would like to be credited to my account .
neutral	i will say that the product did seem like a well made piece of plumbing .
neutral	loved my finished binder but it took_forever before they shipped it out .... stayed in " processing " mode for almost 0 full weeks .
neutral	when i booked my stay at majestic sun in destin , fl the room was said to have a master bed / bath , 0 hall bunks and a pull out sofa_bed .
neutral	i reserved the room for myself and three 00_yr olds .
neutral	when we got ready to go to bed the first night we found out there was no pull out sofa_bed so one of the girls had to sleep on the couch .
neutral	i talked to the manager where we checked in and was told to contact bookit to resolve the issue .
neutral	i spent about 0 hours on the phone with different agents from bookit and was told to go to the front_desk and they would move us to a different room .
neutral	there was no one at the front_desk either time i was sent there .
neutral	the manager at resort quest took it upon himself to contact bookit and get another room for us , otherwise i don_'_t know how much more of my day would have been spent on the phone getting nowhere .
neutral	i would much rather have been enjoying the day than on the phone and packing myself and 0 teenagers to move to a different room .
neutral	i feel_like i got shorted a day of my vacation and was never offered any compensation from bookit , as you are the ones that placed us in a room not suited for the number of guests i listed on my reservation .
neutral	i have not received my item yet and it has_been ten days .
neutral	the last item i ordered arrived about 00 days_later too .
neutral	usually wowcher is reliable and delivers what is promised but occasionally a meal for two is advertised and purchased but then the terms change and it is only a meal for one !
neutral	as i said like the speed in which i recieved my coffee but the capsules do not fit well in my coffee_maker
neutral	a good site but have had my card details hacked into twice !
neutral	this was the first time i had used_serenata for a flower delivery and initially i was impressed with the selection of beautiful flowers and was further impressed with the next_day delivery ( yesterday ) and constant_updates_regarding the delivery which was right on schedule .
neutral	my gran , the recipient , absolutely_loved the flowers and their vibrant_colours .
neutral	her joy was short lived however when she woke this morning to find them wilting already , less_than 00hours after receiving them .
neutral	by this evening they had wilted completely .
neutral	i find this very dissappointing as this was a birthday_gift and don_'_t expect a £_00 bouquet to last less_than 00hours .
neutral	i will not use serenata again in a hurry .
neutral	when purchasing racing suit in store , sales help insisted that my son was a size 00 or 00 .
neutral	they continued to give him 0 suits to try on that were these sizes when i specifically told them he needed a bigger_size .
neutral	it wasted a lot of time .
neutral	they should listen to the customer .
neutral	when returning an online order , there is no email_confirmation that they received the order .
neutral	i had to call the store twice to confirm and see when my credit_card would be refunded .
neutral	the experience was great until i missed the autobot call that is sent out automatically to verify your order .
neutral	i ordered for work and was not in the office when the call came .
neutral	took some time and a few transferred calls to get the order finalized .
neutral	ik_heb de optie gebruikt om mijn_bestelling in te_laten pakken .
neutral	echter toen ik mijn_bestelling ontving was dit niet het geval .
neutral	ik had hier wel voor betaald .
neutral	ik_heb zelf meerdere malen gemaild en gebeld , en na 0 weken had ik het geld teruggestort op_mijn rekening .
neutral	ik vond dit erg slordig .
neutral	verder was de_bestelling snel bezorgd , wat wel fijn was .
neutral	overall the service is fast , quick and efficient but they often deliver things to the wrong delivery address .
neutral	similarly , you have to be a silver member to talk to customer_service reps which i feel is a bit unfair on those who have genuine problems , but because they have not bought enough can not talk to someone there and then .
neutral	based on recent events with my psvita case being sent to the wrong_address and my copy of final fantasy 00 - 0 outright not turning up i would have to go with so - so
neutral	magdelana knew her job .
neutral	she was the most pleasant .
neutral	others weren_'_t so good .
neutral	the equipment was okay .
neutral	i was not so happy that a camera didn_'_t look at my unit .
neutral	i thot is was clean , tho .
neutral	the price was good but hated paying extra for insurance when my stuff just wasnt ' worth it .
neutral	a step stool would '_ve been nice because i had an upper 0 x 0 .
neutral	i didn_'_t like how the top was open and not shielded from any water that might '_ve come in from sprinklers .
neutral	anyway , i needed it .
neutral	it was there .
neutral	the price was fair .
neutral	magdelana was good .
neutral	i wish there had been more chairs in the office area because i had to wait and needed to sit_down .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	i never got to use my storage bin i rented due to a home sell falling through , but over all very pleasnt people to talk too and very helpful with your needs , even_though i wish i had gotten my money back it was a day between the rent so anyway it would help me they got my money and rented out my bin even_though gave noyice didn ; t need thank_you elizabeth a langert
neutral	i have been ordering from pureformulas for over 0 years .
neutral	everything about their products and service has always been good .
neutral	this last order , however , did not meet my satisfaction .
neutral	when i received my order , the receipt indicated that one of the products was on back order .
neutral	i called pureformulas about another matter ( to see if i could get a blender bottle ).
neutral	during that call i learned that the product ( bezwecken phytob ) was not in fact back ordered , but had been_discontinued .
neutral	i asked why that wasn_'_t indicated on the receipt and was told it '_s automatically done ( whatever that means ) and that pureformulas is no_longer able to get the product .
neutral	the order was received on or about monday , july 00 , 0000 ( today is july 00 , 0000 ) and i have yet to receive word by email or however else i would be notified that the product has_been_discontinued .
neutral	in the future it would be helpful if pureformulas would either notify me by email as soon as the order is received and processed or stated on the receipt so that i could purchase the product elsewhere as soon as i am informed .
neutral	when we called your attention to an alias not ever used & not accurate , and whose more negative data effects my overall credit_score , all you did was send us to a database development company who couldn_'_t or wouldn_'_t help !
neutral	we were referred to lexisnexis risk solutions .
neutral	i believe part of your service should be to assist consumers in weeding out incorrect information !
neutral	the booking system is comfortable to handle but the amount that is charged for your booking is rather high ( 00_% of costs of booked accommodation ).
neutral	if you forget to activate " cancellation protection " your deposit is lost if you cancel your booking ( in my case more than 00_euro because of a booking for one week ).
neutral	with " protection " your value converts to credit for you to use it for future bookings .
neutral	unfortunatly it is not refundable .
neutral	guests are asked to evaluate the hostels or hotels online .
neutral	their short comments ( only few words are possible !)
neutral	are published and seem to be helpful in advance to decide about one '_s own preferences .
neutral	i was not happy about the fact , that my own assesment was mistaken with my message i left for those who run the evaluated hostle - another option , that is overed together with the evaluation after your stay .
neutral	jeg_fik sådan set kun et tilbud på hele pakken .
neutral	et firma kunne kun tilbyde undervognsbehandling , et svarede ikke , og_jeg_fik ikke yderligere tilbud .
neutral	ærgerligt , men bilen skulle jo laves
neutral	i have bought products two times .
neutral	the first time it came in a few_days .
neutral	but the second time it took 0½ week .
neutral	i was starting to think , that the product might have been stolen .
neutral	it would be nice if you could follow the dileverance .
neutral	we truly_enjoyed our time in london but there are some points i would like to mention .
neutral	we had prebooked our tickets via internet , what was absolutely perfect .
neutral	the staff on the busses ( drivers and guides ) as well as at green_park station was very helpful .
neutral	the annoying part of our experience started at marble_arch when we had been waiting for a blue eastbound tour about 00_minutes .
neutral	us - together with uncountable italians - were sent into the bus , coming to the upper_deck everything was packed with sitting and standing people .
neutral	we had the feeling that the young_lady at march arch stopp just want to get_rid of us .
neutral	the question occured , why so many people were allowed to get on the bus - we spent our time on the way to baker_street sitting in the staircase .
neutral	at baker_street big_bus a staff_member came onboard and asked us - not too friendly - to leave the bus , what we already tried but it was impossible to get though the mass of italians .
neutral	anyhow , we got onto another empty blue tour about 00_minutes later and had a much_better experience .
neutral	the day became perfect after we joined a red_tour , with live_commentary - it was a much_better and peaceful choice .
neutral	once again , we enjoyed the sightseeing but for future visits with the family we '_ll surely take the live_commentary from the beginning on .
neutral	the day i booked the reservation was fine until i had to call back to change a mistake in my daughters name ... i tried to call all day and was put on hold so many_times i gaveup ... it as very fraustrating experience .
neutral	on tuesday i called back and got the costomers relations dept , and spoke to to terrance who was great and very compassionate .
neutral	he solved the program in a matters of minutes and calmed me down .
neutral	poor selection of products and could be difficult to find certain products .
neutral	categories and contents not always easy to understand .
neutral	qty of contents stated but not dosage .
neutral	for example a bottle of 00 vitamins , was a 00 day supply where it was easy to assume this was a 00 day supply .
neutral	am i the only one who remembers , walmart back in the day took pride in the fact that they bought and sold made in the usa products ??
neutral	now i can '_t hardly find anything made in the usa there !!!
neutral	!
neutral	it took a good while to get the dog_food .
neutral	i would be worried to sign_up for the monthly service , in fear that i wouldn_'_t have the food in time before they ran_out , and with the dog_food being 00_bucks a pop it '_s not like i can spend extra when it '_s not here on time .
neutral	the label they put on the box was not readable and it had to be redirected and relabeled then reshipped to me .
neutral	so this is why i can only give them 0_stars , how would the person_who put the label on not be able to see it was not legible ?!?!?!?
neutral	!
neutral	the company rang me up after_placing my order as i had chosen to ship to a different address to my billing_address .
neutral	they insisted they had to have a landline_number to process the order - didn_'_t matter what number i gave them they just needed one for ' security '.
neutral	they then wanted to go through every item asking what it was and how much it cost for ' security_reasons '.
neutral	i was also asked the method of payment for ' security_reasons '.
neutral	when i asked exactly_what the security issues could be they were unable to tell me , they just kept_repeating that they couldn_'_t process the order without the answers .
neutral	i frequently buy online and often ship to a different address .
neutral	i have never had these sorts of issues before and so shan '_t be shopping here again because who_wants that hassle everytime you place an order !
neutral	it may have been due to the holiday demand , but when entering details of cards to be ordered , website stopped responding and would not proceed .
neutral	tried later in evening and again next_day before able to order the cards .
neutral	the flexibility and customization options were impressive though and the delivery was fast .
neutral	would have been nice to be able to choose between a few generic options for cards .
neutral	orange envelopes not my choice for christmas and graduations !
neutral	it was alright .
neutral	was excited to get my order but was not informed when i ordered it that it was on back order .
neutral	instead , i received an_email a few_days_later that said additional information from my card i was paying with was needed and if not responded to , would cause order cancellation .
neutral	so i called and it wasn_'_t that at all , was told it was on back order and the wrong email was sent .
neutral	i elected to keep my order and when it finally arrived the box had some damage , the scope was nice but didn_'_t have good definition to the icon inscription .
neutral	overall , alright ... just glad to finally have my stethaoscope that i '_ve been needing for awhile .
neutral	not happy with not being_able to modify reservation online required to call an agent so stuck paying a service fee .
neutral	received my glasses with a broken case .
neutral	will not order from them again .
neutral	took way longer then they had predicted
neutral	thanks anyway but i wondered_why it took so long to get the part delivered .
neutral	we are in ny which is miles_away from nj .
neutral	otherwise , it '_s all good , price was decent .
neutral	thanks partsgeek . com !
neutral	received wrong product on the last two orders
neutral	i would recommend buying from macy '_s in the store versus their online website .
neutral	hi , i know they are probably still in transit , but its been a while since you advised they had been shipped .
neutral	my daughter says they have not arrived so can '_t really comment until they do .
neutral	bought a lovely cream metal outdoor clock - should have guessed that it would start to rust in the rain .
neutral	happened quite quickly so really disappointed as the clock itself is very attractive .
neutral	have tried to clean the rust off but without_success and don_'_t really want to have to do this every few_months anyway .
neutral	having tracked the order and noted that the flowers had been put into the local van at 00 . 00 , i waited to hear that they had been delivered , but i received no notification whatsoever on my mobile or my computer until the day after leaving me wondering_if they had been received or left in the van all day .
neutral	i did learn that the flowers had been delivered the previous day at 0 . 00pm but i was not advised by serenata or yodel .
neutral	the e_- mails are very deceptive .
neutral	they say a certain percentage_off with free_shipping .
neutral	only after you click on shop now , does one get the true story - shipping is only free if you spend over $_000 .
neutral	in addition , the shipping is much too pricey , and it is not even ups .
neutral	the front_desk seemed a bit unorganized .
neutral	i made my reservation online and then went to the hotel about 00_minutes later to check in . they did not have me in the system yet so they sent me across the hall to the computer / internet room to print my confirmation number .
neutral	they told me the room would be ready in 00_minutes ( 0pm ).
neutral	i came back at 0 :_00pm and the room was still not ready .
neutral	the girl checking me in gave_me a different room which was very nice .
neutral	when i found out that check out was 00am the following_day i was very surprised .
neutral	the pool was nice and clean and we ate at the bar and grille which was yummy .
neutral	i had wanted to try out thekitchen but found out online that it was closed for renovations .
neutral	nobody at the front_desk told me that when i checked in .
neutral	the grounds are beautifully maintained .
neutral	my husband and i live in wmb and wanted a night away for a staycation . having to wait_until after 0 : 00 to check in seems very unfair when the resort asks patrons to check out at 00am .
neutral	the cost seems a bit high for the short stay and that the main restaurant was not open for us to try .
neutral	a suggestion ?
neutral	keep about 0 bottled waters in the fridge .
neutral	it was 00_degrees when we checked in .
neutral	another suggestion ?
neutral	offer 0 free drink per unit at the bar and grille if the main restaurant is under_construction .
neutral	i would like to give a raving review but our product hasn_'_t arrived yet , eight days since ordering , so let '_s give it another few_days !
neutral	bought a table and a sensor bin together and on check out paid_extra for saturday delivery as i work full time .
neutral	wasn_'_t told that the table cannot be delivered on saturday as courier doesn_'_t do saturdays and the extra i paid for delivery is only for delivering the bin on saturday .
neutral	they really should have made it clear .
neutral	products themselves however are of good quality .
neutral	thanks for the email but i am still_waiting for the product .
neutral	i ordered one pair of carrera sunglasses the 0nd of august and today the 00th of august i still didn_'_t receive anything .
neutral	i live in denmark it should take around one week to get the sunglasses .
neutral	i contacted the company , there were very sweet and tried to figure_out what happened .
neutral	they told me that they send them , but i think than more than two_weeks is a long time to wait .
neutral	i wanted to buy one more pair after this one , but now i am not going to , if i have to wait such a long time .
neutral	my glasses arrived ( although i paid expedite fee ) 0 days_later than what i understood which_meant going to a big event without proper glasses .
neutral	then they arrived and i had mistakenenly put - 000 instead of + 000 , and so i was blind in them .
neutral	they have been returned , the expedite fee has_been promised to be refunded and hopefully they will come_back as the lovely spectacles that i need so much .
neutral	i do feel the company might have caught the error since i had a long discussion in the ordering process , and perhaps a discount now would make me feel better .
neutral	i '_m excited to have them in any case , and i think it is a very cool company and service that you offer .
neutral	started off easily enough , access to site and booking arrangements initially fiine .
neutral	we were however booking for family group but needed extra dates / night stays for ourselves ..... this was impossible to arrange in one booking .
neutral	ended_up making main booking via site then phoning hotel direct for the extra nights needed .
neutral	also when placing the online order , process seemed to complete but then flashed up
neutral	to say someone_else had taken booking ahead of us !!
neutral	we then tried again ( this time having to take more_expensive rooms as site said only ones now available ) made booking , only to find minutes later via our emails that we ' d booked twice !
neutral	ended_up telephoning site and speaking directly to someone , who was extremely_helpful , she confirmed the first booking and cancelled the second .
neutral	we got there in the end !
neutral	!
neutral	i really love the convenience of having heavy pet_food delivered to my door but felt it took too long ( 00 days from order to expected delivery ).
neutral	i am not satisfied with the basket .
neutral	i coudn '_t make it empty to change my order
neutral	made a booking .
neutral	easy enough .
neutral	clicked on booking link that allows you to modify booking , went through the process to add insurance .
neutral	did this twice with the impression it had been amended successfully - only to arrive at hertz saying it had not been added .
neutral	quad shower suite 000mm . ordered item before i could fit .
neutral	found out that waste to shower as a small hairline crack in it .
neutral	- thus unable to fit part .
neutral	plumbers have not fitted doors yet so cannot_comment on them or toilet , or basin .
neutral	just hope theres no more nasty shocks
neutral	after finding the website and viewing the lovely bikinis i decided to place an order for some swimwear .
neutral	the swimwear is fairly expensive so i expected value for money until the items arrived and i was sent faulty items .
neutral	i contacted customer serice the following_day who was very helpful and informed me a replacement would be sent out that day .
neutral	the item arrived the following_day only to find this was also damaged so i was not very happy as if i was going away and required these items i would have not been able to take away with me .
neutral	i have since been back in touch with the comapny and they offered me an extra 00_% reduction off the item but this did not cover the cost of me getting the item repaired but i agreed as i really did like the bikini but i think they could have offered a better discount for the amount of money i was spending with them .
neutral	hopefully this may have been a one off but it would make me reluctant to use the company again as i think you get better quality goods at marks and spencers at half the cost of these bikinis .
neutral	sent my phone on november 0st got no money in my account until the 00th by then i ' d had to see other stuff to find the money .
neutral	i ' d recieved an_email on 00th_november saying my phone was passed fit then waited a further 0 days for any money so not the " same day payment " as stated
neutral	bought 0 items , sent 0 back & still_waiting on my refund which is bad when you consider you ' re quick enough to take the money but take 0_weeks or more to put it back .
neutral	won_'_t be using boohoo again .
neutral	i assume the shipping took too long due to the poor weather_conditions .
neutral	however , i might find a company in ca because of this issue .
neutral	at first i was very impressed that you had the book i was looking for at such a great price .
neutral	i needed it for my new school year .
neutral	then , i was impressed with how quickly it arrived .
neutral	but when i opened the package , i was distressed to find that i had been sent the wrong book and was told there is no replacement available .
neutral	now , i have no book and need to spend time looking else where .
neutral	i am happy that i will be refunded and that i can send back the book free of charge .
neutral	i am hesitant to try and get another book .
neutral	i may try one more time since i was happy with everything else .
neutral	we used all of the product on our lab and it just didn_'_t do the job .
neutral	we had to
neutral	take her back to the vet and we got more medicine for her hot_spots .
neutral	they also put her on antibiotics and she is on the mend .
neutral	after our recent stay at a hotel booked through alpharooms i was sent an e_- mail requesting me to write a review on our stay at the hotel .
neutral	this i did .
neutral	also in the e_- mail was a voucher_code for me to use £ 0 off my next hotel .
neutral	we are staying in york on 00 / 00 / 0000 and i tried to book a hotel using this voucher_code but the code came up as invallid .
neutral	not so good !
neutral	we stayed in this apartment twice , a month apart .
neutral	the first time i emailed the rental place about the internet not working and got no response .
neutral	when i checked in the second time i told them that the internet did not work and he assured_me that it did .
neutral	the only way to get online was to go to the top of the stairs and open the door and sit on the stoop .
neutral	this may seem like a trivial complaint , but we were on a working trip and it was most inconvenient .
neutral	i will not rent thru an agency again .
neutral	only thru a person .
neutral	i always used jessops when we had a local branch here in telford and used to nip up to collect ( saving £ 0 . 00 postage ).
neutral	all of the books i purchased through the original jessops website had every page full of photographs .
neutral	on the ' new ' site there appears to be one complete page completely blank at the back of each book ( as well as the last page ).. why ?
neutral	i was excited when i found this site , and happily looked through all the cute , inexpensive clothes until i found some items i liked .
neutral	when i purchased them and finally tried them on , they werent what i was expecting .
neutral	they fit okay , but neither did anything for my curves .
neutral	both items ended_up making me look like a blob .
neutral	its okay to have cheap cloth and fabric -- its to be expected .
neutral	but you really need to work on spending quality time on good ideas for how the clothes are designed structually .
neutral	the service was good .
neutral	however i went on the website on a sunday and by the tuesday the kids wear my sonhad chosen for his_birthday had all gone .
neutral	t - shirt , shorts and a watch and nothing would be coming_back in stock .
neutral	it would be really helpful to know how many of something is left in stock when you click on it so that his does not happen again .
neutral	no real complaints except it took a month from posting till cheque in bank !
neutral	!
neutral	finding my book on bookbyte was easy - and even cheaper_than amazon or half . com .
neutral	it was shipped quickly too and included a coupon for when i return it !
neutral	i was very happy with my first purchase with boohoo , com .
neutral	i bought two dresses ,.
neutral	i had to send them back and order a bigger_size in one of them .
neutral	the dress is lovely .
neutral	delivery is excellent .
neutral	my only_gripe with boohoo . com is i am still_waiting for my refund of 00_euro two_weeks after sending back the dresses !!!!!!!
neutral	not good enough .
neutral	i wont order again because of that reason .
neutral	i love the product , very satisfied .
neutral	i had a problem w_/ payment .
neutral	i was charged twice on my credit_card , then it took 0_weeks for the money to be put back on my card ...
neutral	i know safety is great , but boarding three different planes and being told your flight was totally cancelled .
neutral	costumer_service for united was a five hour wait .
neutral	by the time you get up there to talk to them they are tired and rude .
neutral	i will never use united_airlines .
neutral	glad they thought if us for the safety , they just needed to be a little nicer .
neutral	saw several supervisors walking around giving breaks but taking the person and not replacing them so you had three workers then two and several_times just one .
neutral	dealing_with travelocity itself is pretty customer friendly and works well .
neutral	however , i booked a car with hertz and after arriving an_hour past the time i ' d given ( i never knew that this was somehow a firm arrival time ) they had given my car away and i had to spend an extra hour messing_around while they found me a car .
neutral	i wasn_'_t very happy , as it seems a reservation should indicate a car available upon_arrival .
neutral	not sure this was about travelocity or just hertz .
neutral	ive been a customer of cotton traders for a good few_years_now and sometimes the items are great , sometimes they are poorly made , sometimes its clear as soon as the item arrives , but not always .
neutral	i wish that postage would be refunded when there is a clear problem with their item , but they dont do that .
neutral	saying that - i have found some clothes and shoes over the years which i have loved .
neutral	hence my title .
neutral	a lot of phone_calls about details that i already gave to the company .
neutral	once i didn_'_t mind but this happened a few_times .
neutral	there seemed to be a lack of communication between the staff .
neutral	while the web reservation was easy , i first phoned twice to ask questions and neither phone agent could speak clearly nor answer any questions .
neutral	i hung_up and made my reservation online .
neutral	i hope our stay will be nice and they accomodate my requests .
neutral	ordered done lovely stuff and have to say they were even nicer_than in the photos however i paid for them to be delivered within 0 working days and they managed to send them from england to ireland and then back to london !!
neutral	which was my delivery address !!
neutral	when i queried , it takes them a 0 days to reply and your never speaking to the same person which can be really frustrating
neutral	i am somewhat happy , but when we receive our orders you should put in our receipt and what we ordered .
neutral	not good not to do that .
neutral	the photo shows a cartridge that is different from the one with the number assigned to it .
neutral	i had ordered this cartridge on numerous_occasions before but was reluctant to order it this time before checking that i was going to receive the right cartridge .
neutral	i had to call the office to clarify the situation .
neutral	i suggested to the sales_person_who took my call that the photo needed to be changed but have not heard back since .
neutral	i ordered a few items that were noted to be available wile visiting with my family this summer .
neutral	0_weeks passed with no shipment notification .
neutral	finally , after numerous_calls to the customer_service , the delivery was scheduled and items arrived a month later , after i already returned home .
neutral	quite an inconvenience !
neutral	i received them finally via family_member and enjoy my purchase very much .
neutral	supply time is good but a repeat purchase for special sizes takes far too long .
neutral	this hotel is in a great location .
neutral	the hotel breakfast is very good .
neutral	the only_complaint is that the furniture , carpet , drapes , and bedding seem to be very old .
neutral	the team at the logo co . was very quick to respond to our request and we had a pretty good logo within 0 days and this included 0 revisions .
neutral	the only_complaint that i would have is the website was a bit_confusing and not really that user_friendly .
neutral	as well as the process list at the beginning that you had to sign off on was a bit weird .
neutral	it would tell you where to comment and where not to comment even_though it may be a place to send a message don_'_t send it there as no one will respond ???
neutral	why have that on your website if you don_'_t want people to use it ???
neutral	also , there were a lot of instructions to the client as what " not " to do , and it seemed a bit rude as if they don_'_t want you to complain_about anything so they were telling you they don_'_t want to be bothered with any complaints about this or that before you even get started .
neutral	all in all it was basically a " you get what you pay for " experience , nothing special in my opinion .
neutral	i don_'_t think that i would recommend this company to anyone or use them again .
neutral	delivered on time but not fitted yet
neutral	the company is easy to work with am makes certain your order is delivered .
neutral	i would work with them again .
neutral	but they delivered two bouquets of flowers in lieu of my request for just one .
neutral	i am now waiting for my credit_card bill to see how i was charged .
neutral	i will only pay for one delivery .
neutral	really prompt delivery but several parts of one item ( suspension files ) were damaged beyond use .
neutral	would like to know whether i can return these for refund ?
neutral	just booked edinburgh skypark but couldn_'_t used either of the discount_vouchers i had , one was for no booking fee , the other for 00_% saving .
neutral	hope when we actually park , leave and pickup car on our return everything is ok .
neutral	the credit_card places are hounding me .
neutral	usually about 00 times a day .
neutral	i am afraid to answer .
neutral	it is very distracting .
neutral	communication from ndr has stopped .
neutral	i haven_'_t heard from them in over 0 months .
neutral	i have used uni_baggage before and there was no_problems , but this time when i got my suitcase it was extremely dirty , this is why i only rated it 0_stars , apart_from that there wasn_'_t any other problems .
neutral	hopefully i will have no need to use multitrip yet !
neutral	i dont go away until august .
neutral	fridge_freezer was not 00 / 00 as_advertised , so problems trying to fit cabinet doors back on , also freezer draws are small . disappointed !!!
neutral	!. driver very pleasant and on time , couldn_'_t fault actual service , pity description wasn_'_t accurate .
neutral	we had to wait some time despite ringing at the requested time suggested on the details ; there was also confusion as to where we were being picked_up , the ' blue ' area being somewhat obscured by bill - boarding ; the driver gave_me a ticket saying it had £ 0 paid on it for the exit barrier and arriving at the barrier we found that it was not true and had to hold everyone up by going to pay again .
neutral	the concept is fantastic !!
neutral	my son loved designing his own remote .
neutral	he was so excited when it arrived in the mail .
neutral	however , he was very disappointed when it came because he wanted to extra mod that i paid for for $_00 . 00 and the remote didn_'_t come with that feature .
neutral	i will be calling for a new one .
neutral	i am still experimenting with the coffee .
neutral	my only_complaint is the lack of flavor when trying to make a full cup .
neutral	i have had to use more than one pod to achieve the flavor . a
neutral	i order two light assemblies about nine days ago and have recieved only one up to this point . the one that i did recieve truly met all my expectations but the delay in getting the last assembly is driving me mad , help , help please !
neutral	i was disappointed that i spent quite a bit of time selecting my purchase , only to find out that the item i selected was not eligible for the great savings that were headlined across the site throughout my shopping_experience .
neutral	not sure i '_ll use fd again .
neutral	as my for glasses , my new $_000 oakleys are little big for me and rub on my cheeks .
neutral	i do however , like how they wrap around the side which improves my vision when cycling and driving .
neutral	i personally would not purchase this style again .
neutral	i ordered a necklace as a christmas gift for my sister , and i understand that it takes time to actually make the product , but i don_'_t think it should take 00 - 00 days to be shipped after getting the " your order has_been shipped " confirmation .
neutral	i like to track my orders to see where they are and how long its taking before it gets to me , and mynamenecklace . com did not provide me with a tracking_number or the carrier that my necklace is coming with , so in case something happens to my order i have no_idea what carrier to contact because mynamenecklace . com did not provide me with that information .
neutral	if you want your necklace by a certain date , order it at_least 0 to 0_weeks in advance , because standard shipping there is not the normal 0 - 0 days like everywhere_else .
neutral	overall , the necklace is great , just the shipping service should be improved .
neutral	i like the individuals i work with when booking tickets and my students love the tours as they get to see all the london sights from a fantastic vantage point .
neutral	there are a few hiccups i '_ve experienced including the difficulty of returning unused tickets , having to be present ( to show the credit_card used to make the purchase ) to get my students on board , and some guides are much_better_than others ( one guide told students that he was hungover and didn_'_t really feel_like talking ).
neutral	the service was great except the labels were smaller_than i expected .
neutral	actually a lot smaller .
neutral	but i will work with them .
neutral	you have to strain to see the date and names , but i will use them around wine_bottles to give as favors .
neutral	i do believe i was charged for wi fi service and when i got to hotel , noted it was a free service .
neutral	i thought when i wanted a card that i would be getting a fathers_day card with it but instead i just received the visa_card and a piece of paper stating how much was on it and the message i typed to be on the " card "
neutral	i was pleased with most of my purchases ; however , the honeycomb balls are impossible to assemble because there is no firm side to help each piece separate correctly .
neutral	if further effort does not give me the desired results , i will return the merchandise .
neutral	i was very pleased with the parts and how they came at a short_period of time .
neutral	i was unhappy with the fact that i received the wrong part and would have to pay to send it back .
neutral	i was also disappointed that i returned a part on july 00 and have yet to recceive a refund .
neutral	but the good thing is that the parts are of good quality .
neutral	rather tired of being bombarded with e_- mails for months on end offering me all_sorts of special deals on your latest products at special prices all of which i as a mere home user don_'_t need !
neutral	!
neutral	trust ceases when you find that renewal is not offered at the lowest_prices so loyalty is meaningless to you .
neutral	to summarise - don_'_t feel_confident , all jargon , so remote , stressful .
neutral	i purchased my d0000 from b_&_h a couple months back and it was missing it '_s battery , after a week of trying to contact someone , i was finally able to get a hold of a salesman who shipped me a battery asap !
neutral	i am hoping i dont run_into any_problems this time as this is a great shop to deal with .
neutral	other then the battery issue i love my d0000
neutral	wir_haben mehrfach über_die homepage gebucht ( also über 0 tage , täglich ) und mussten jedesmal unsere kompletten daten eingeben .
neutral	sicherlich hätten wir ein konto eröffnen können , aber dann wäre für uns in den ferien noch eine registrierung notwendig gewesen und man hätte noch ein passwort mehr , welches man sich kreieren hätte müssen und anschliessend immer anwenden müsste .
neutral	meiner meinung nach sollte dies einfacher geregelt werden können , zb mit benutzung der mailadresse .
neutral	bei_der sortierung " nach der lage " sollte man auswählen können " strandlage ", " stadtzentrum ", " in der nähe der autobahn " usw .
neutral	damit könnte man eine auf_den ersten blick klare sortierung sehen .
neutral	the price of the book was really reasonable but i order my book three_days before going on a week long vacation came back and the book still hadn_'_t arrive .
neutral	i may not use bookbyte in the future because it took to long to receive the book .
neutral	yes i understand what i chose for shipping .
neutral	when i use other_vendors i do not have to pay for expedited_shipping and it gets to me much_faster .
neutral	just saying shipping was not as fast as other_vendors that i have used in the past .
neutral	so by paying for a cheaper book i didn_'_t get it as fast as i liked !
neutral	the alhambra hotel is within good walking_distance to the centre of york .
neutral	breakfast was good , however we found the waiting staff very unprofessional talking to each other across the breakfast room whilst serving customers , shame as they were lovely .
neutral	perhaps some training would be advantageous .
neutral	the condition of the rooms are not perfect but for what we paid we thought it was value for money .
neutral	computers seemed slow and it was early friday_morning .
neutral	order was placed but because of problems on your website confusion rained and we received no goods . eventually sorted weeks_later but was informed that a certain item was no_longer available .
neutral	checked your site only to find item was available .
neutral	after e_- mailing back and forth eventually received all the items about a month after_placing original order .
neutral	hope that this will likely not happen with any future orders , fingers_crossed
neutral	the website is easy to use and the information clear and easy to understand .
neutral	however when paying for my booking the website froze and i was unsure_whether or not the payment had gone_through .
neutral	this occurred on two occasions and i had to contact hostelworld to find out whether or not the payment had been made .
neutral	the adviser at hostelworld suggested that i use a different web browser for my booking and my payment then went through .
neutral	my recommendation therefore is " dont use google_chrome " for your booking .
neutral	i loved my purchase and thought that it was good quality .
neutral	i enjoyed purchasing online .
neutral	my only problem was the delivery .
neutral	my product was a xmas_present and i ordered it 0_weeks before_xmas
neutral	it took a very long time for delivery .
neutral	i then discovered that i was supposed to provide delivery address after paying for purchse .
neutral	this was not made clear during buying .
neutral	i have a puppy and an adult dog .
neutral	they both love the toy .
neutral	and the one bag of treats that i opened .
neutral	the adult doesn_'_t need calming stuff nor do either dog needs a nightlight because they can let themselves out to go potty ( yes , truly spoiled ) .
neutral	i just think that maybe , for me and my dogs , that i would be better served if the boxes were packed with a dog size , breed or / and age in mind .
neutral	and when you fill_out the email contact form , no one responds .
neutral	i will not use again .
neutral	service okay .
neutral	other services could be offered or suggestions for a paid service .
neutral	it was simple and fast delivery .
neutral	fed_x put it right where i wanted upon delivery and he may be a potential future customer for me .
neutral	i am a retired master groomer .
neutral	i also promote diet and grooming products to help my smaller based clientele .
neutral	i was surprised that mr_chewy called me back after i placed the order to verify such a large order , as stated by your representative .
neutral	he was not real personable and felt for my first time and oh my goodness , how i could promote your company , i could have received a coupon or two for future use .
neutral	definitely you have the wrong person on follow_up on customer_service .
neutral	chicken fingers were great .
neutral	one of the better batters i '_ve had .
neutral	also had beef chow fun which was tasty but definitely could have used more beef .
neutral	i could have easily been mistaken for vegetable chow fun rather_than beef .
neutral	my only_complaint would be that the driver couldn_'_t be polite enough to take his phone out of his ear and carried on with his personal call .
neutral	when i asked a question about signing the credit_card slip he didn_'_t answer until i asked again .
neutral	i tip 00_% on top of the $ 0 delivery fee in advance and always confirm the fee goes to the driver to make_sure they are taken_care off .
neutral	i '_m learning i should tip at the door lol .
neutral	i will order again , because the food was tasty and not greasy .
neutral	great price for the size .
neutral	i received the textbook quickly .
neutral	i have rented several textbooks in the past from other_vendors and i would say this one has_been in the poorest condition .
neutral	i wished i had a more accurate_description before hand .
neutral	i may have reconsidered my rental .
neutral	there is lots of writing / notes written throughout the book .
neutral	i know to expect this from rentals but feel this one is a little excessive for a rental .
neutral	as far as service it was quick , the book arrived earlier then expected , and all transactions have gone smoothly .
neutral	the only_thing i would suggest is that they give a better description as to the condition of the textbook .
neutral	the ordering was simple , and i got a text the next_day telling_me the delivery date , it was to be delivered on wednesday well within the 0 working days .
neutral	which was great .
neutral	on tuesday_afternoon
neutral	i rang to confirm what time am or pm and was told it would be part of the first load , so early am .
neutral	on wednesday , at 00 : 00 i rang to see where the load was as i needed to get out for work - and was told it would be with me before 00 : 00 .
neutral	at 00 : 00 i rang again as it had not arrived - i was told that they did not know where the driver was but that he would be on his way ( he must be the only person in the world who does not ahve a mobile_phone !)
neutral	- i explained again that i needed to get to work - it was then that i was told that i did not need to be present if the tank was unlocked and there were no access problems / dogs etc .
neutral	i had wasted a whole morning waiting in , it would have been good if i had been told this at 00 : 00 or the day previous rather_than at 00 : 00 , after waiting in .
neutral	the delivery was made sometime in the afternoon - i was at work by then , i had left a note for the driver - which he hadn_'_t read and was greeted with an overwhelming smell of kerosene when i returned from work - i bet i got charged for the spillage !
neutral	as i said the waiting was frustrating , and i wonder_if the spillage would have occurred if i had been present .
neutral	i am not happy right now i have not received my part that was order on the 00th of may .
neutral	please respond to my support_ticket 000000000 .
neutral	order # 00 - 00000000 .
neutral	thanks brenda rogers
neutral	only_complaint is that the guy was very slow on taking my reservation , he literally repeated my name 0 - 0 times and would spell it wrong .
neutral	same thing with my address , very frustrating .
neutral	what should of took 0 - 0 minutes took 00 and no need for that .
neutral	a simple reservation for a wedding at a hotel for 0 night should not of took 00_minutes .
neutral	i would not recommend uksports unless they alter their delivery attitude .
neutral	the money was taken from my account a week before i received the goods and i had to telephone them and then the delivery company , each call taking half an_hour , only to be told that because i had not given a mobile_phone_number they were unable to let_me know the time of delivery - do they not know that ladnlines accept text_messages ?
neutral	reasonably pleased with the goods but the customer_service leaves a lot to be desired .
neutral	ordered quite a few items off the website to be delivered to my home address .
neutral	my block has an entrance gate which needs a code or alternatively a buzz - in from the residents .
neutral	on the day my delivery allegedly arrived , i was home all day ; the delivery company did not bother to buzz in and probably simply turned around and left , having seen the gate locked , changing my delivery status and prompting me to call them back to reschedule ; the rescheduling pushed the delivery by 0 days back , getting me concerned_about the returns period .
neutral	having sent out the items i wanted to return , i waited and waited for the confirmation of the company receiving my returned items ; it came " conveniently " right a few_minutes after i received a response to my e_- mail query which i placed with the customer_service team .
neutral	overall , the dresses i kept are very good value for money .
neutral	i am satisfied with the product but the whole_process could have been much less_stressful if the delivery company did put a little extra_effort to try and contact me on the initial day of delivery , and if the relevant notification emails came on time .
neutral	i received all of my items within a reasonable time from the date of order !!!
neutral	they all fit as expected ; however , one of the dresses i ordered had a defect with the sewing .
neutral	i emailed the company last_week sometime time and have yet to hear back regarding the issue .
neutral	overall , this site is not a scam and is legit .
neutral	timely shipping per timetable set_up earlier .
neutral	called to remind them of free_shipping offer that should have been applied towards latest shipment .
neutral	was assured by agent that a credit would be applied back towards latest shipment .
neutral	as of today , 0 / 0 / 00 , the credit has not been applied .
neutral	i '_ve had horrible customer_service experiences when i '_ve needed to change a flight ( both_times for a death in the family -- a time when some kindness would have gone a long way ).
neutral	however , i know the company and deal with the issues to have a convenient portal for all my travel details .
neutral	love oxeyelite pro original formula , but suppz . com keeps on upping the price if it cost wht it cost before i would '_ve bought 0 maybe even 0 but now i can only afford one , if it gets any higher , i will c if i can buy it somewhere_else .....
neutral	i bought 0 pair of pants they where too big so i sent them back and you said reorder the right size .
neutral	i did that and the right pants came in the mail .
neutral	but the money for the return has taken more than 0_weeks .
neutral	one person told me they would put my refund in the system right_away .
neutral	that never happened and i had to make a second call and they said it will be there in 0 to 0 days .
neutral	i hope they are right beause i will never shop ther agin .
neutral	one of the items had a tear in it ( a shirt ) unfortunately right in the middle of the front .
neutral	( i hardly think it is noticeable , due to all the spit up with the new baby .)
neutral	overall , i still think this website offers great deals , and with two kids and a new born baby i can '_t really take the time to shop for myself in stores .
neutral	also , a long_sleeve shirt i purchased in size large won_'_t fit over my arms .
neutral	a disappointment , but it won_'_t deter me from shopping on this site in the future .
neutral	thanks
neutral	when it was delivered with one delivery man was not as good as when i had a bigger piece of furniture and needed 0 delivery_men , the 0 delivery where more friendly and more helpful than when one delivery man come with a smaller piece of furniture
neutral	i ordered a gift_card for somebody who does some work for me , and they never received it .
neutral	i am waiting to hear back from the person i spoke with today to see if she can locate it .
neutral	if not , apparently there is some paperwork i will have to fill_out to get a refund .
neutral	as a photo student , b_&_h has everything i could ever need .
neutral	the only problem is finding it .
neutral	i find b_&_h '_s search_tool very inefficient and has caused me to buy the wrong paper on multiple_occasions .
neutral	because b_&_h is so big , it is very hard to find what you want on the website .
neutral	ok but in the past i used mazuma and they pay up within hours of receiving your phone where i had to wait a few_days
neutral	i feel as tho the contacts i have been ordering are at less quality then they were a year or so ago .
neutral	they are only lasting 0 - 0 wears at only 0 - 0 hours a time .
neutral	a few lenses also have had sharp edges in the packaging so i have to throw it away .
neutral	the pricing and ease of ordering and the reminders to reorder is great .
neutral	i do wish they could add a feature of letting my know my script is expiring soon to not delay future orders .
neutral	thank_you !
neutral	tiffany
neutral	shipping took too long with no updates and wine that was listed on internet as shiraz was a combination when received .
neutral	the ordering process was kind of confusing .
neutral	there is no phone_number to call and speak with someone , you have to do all of it over email .
neutral	they are not the best or fastest with responding to the emails but they do eventually respond .
neutral	it took us 0 months to get our order and i thought it would only be a few_weeks so i got nervous .
neutral	but the our order did show up and the product was good .
neutral	just give yourself plenty of time to receive your order !
neutral	apparently the flowers arrived way later than ten am even_though i i paid for that delivery option .
neutral	the flowers were not so nice as i had hoped they would be
neutral	the workmanship of the love seat pad is excellent from all appearances .
neutral	i '_m disappointed with the shipping experience , however .
neutral	when i ordered , i couldn_'_t tell whether the pad was in stock and therefore , couldn_'_t tell when shipment would actually occur .
neutral	since i was leaving town june_0th , eight days after i ' d placed the order , still with delivery unknown , i called a rep there to confirm that i ' d get an_email notice of a delivery date and / or to request that the item be delivered to my next door neighbor .
neutral	i was assured that i ' d get both the email , as well as delivery to next door .
neutral	in fact , neither happened .
neutral	i returned home june_00th to find the pad on my front_porch , where it could easily have been stolen .
neutral	i use them all the time but i think an update to their interface design would benefit the site a lot !
neutral	i recently rented a car from europcar in perigueux , france .
neutral	prepaid in canada .
neutral	when we arrived , we were greeted , & told that as we had prepaid , the only extras would be for damage to the car , and gas if we had not filled up the tank .
neutral	very nice peppy car , good mileage .
neutral	upon returning the car , the woman inspected the car , found it satisfactory , said there were no extra_charges , and gave_us a pile of papers , our booking form stapled on top .
neutral	several weeks_later i arrived home to find a $_00 . 00 charge on my visa_card .
neutral	after sorting through the papers from my trip , i located the papers from europcar ; the top one read ' paid in full '.
neutral	the second , page , said ' paid in full , but extra_charges may apply .
neutral	on page 0 there was a listing for extra for station pickup and a daily road tax .
neutral	yes , i know these charges apply , i have paid them before , but having asked twice , and being told twice that there were no extra_charges , i find this billing extremely dishonest .
neutral	where does it end ?
neutral	what other charges might suddenly appear at europcar '_s fancy ?
neutral	it was not a case of language misunderstanding ; we speak passable french , and the people at the europcar office spoke excellent english .
neutral	i do not appreciate this type of dishonesty , and would not use this company again .
neutral	quality of item and ease of ordering was excellent .
neutral	the return_policy is terrible but it was my fault as i guess i choose to ignore it because i assumed i was keeping the quilt .
neutral	( color turned_out not to be good for me )
neutral	i have bought from oldies before , and the shipping was much_faster .
neutral	not all of the movies i ordered were available , which is ok , but it was not real clear on the invoice .
neutral	i called oldies and they explained .
neutral	i would still buy recommend oldies . com .
neutral	the rate was good and parking available for when i wanted it .
neutral	however after being quoted a price and putting in my credit_card information , then additional service charges show up .
neutral	i ordered a bedside_cabinet with free delivery , then an_hour later decided to order a dining_table , which i paid £_00 delivery . the latter was delivered within a week on the 0nd august , but the ' free delivery ' one has still to be delivered - scheduled for this friday - 0_weeks_later .
neutral	very disappointing to wait so long .
neutral	the advisor was very helpful when i spoke to her but my timeslot for tyres being fitted was 0 : 00 - 0pm .
neutral	we were called at 00 : 00 to say that our tyres were not available even_though they had been ordered 0 days previously .
neutral	re - booked for tomorrow - wish us luck !
neutral	i expected to see the typical size of bully_stick that normally cost 0 - 0 dollars to be marked down to the . 00cents and received very small bully_sticks that i wouldn_'_t think should ever be more than . 00_cents .
neutral	was surprised .
neutral	product was a present and the receiver is very happy !
neutral	only down_side was lack of communication from after sale to delivery so would be less tempted to use again as_opposed to other online_retailers .
neutral	took over 0 business days to arrive and was left on my doorstep saturday_morning
neutral	i am a big_fan of your products but lately is mostly for the design because the quality of the fabrics and stitching is not " to be proud of ".
neutral	i purchased two shirt that ripped ofter one were ; one blouse where the stitches on the zipper came undone ofter one wash ; one vest that arrived already ripped in the package and didn_'_t even have a label ; one pair of pants i had to stitch the backs pocket after first wash ....
neutral	when i purchase nygard i expect quality and i am sure this is what you want also but maybe you are not aware of what the consumers are receiving and this is why i wanted to share my experience with you .
neutral	thank_you , mt
neutral	everything was as stated and received expeditiously .
neutral	however my credit_card was stolen under suspicious circumstances soon after my purchase .
neutral	is there a connection ?
neutral	ok first visit , but could have done with some sizing information when i clicked on the icons .
neutral	only bought up adult sizes in the window .
neutral	like a fool i opted for the pay later option at checkout , something i now regret !
neutral	as i found to my annoyance , exchanges and refunds are not so straight_forward if you have paid using the pay later facility !
neutral	there are obvious lacks of communication between cotswold_company and the pay later team , which result in the customer ( me ) having to constantly play ping pong between the two in countless phone_calls .
neutral	i didnt like how i had to keep changing my flight and the price kept getting higher and
neutral	our shuttle driver was so nice enough not to leave us at the wrong terminal , even looked up where the right one was on his mobile .
neutral	he then charged us extra 00_pounds , which i thought was a little much since we really did not give shuttle company wrong info for we had not known what terminal our flight was .
neutral	i thought shuttle company would provide driver correct info since they asked for flight airline , no ., and all when signing_up .
neutral	great shopping on line .
neutral	cs man was very impatient when i called before order placed ..
neutral	needed help navigating online .
neutral	ended_up being very simple but he would not help .
neutral	i asked him to walk me through it said , ' i don_'_t know what it is you don_'_t understand .'
neutral	your weekend / after hours customer_service is not helpful .
neutral	they can only read what is already on the website , which i can also read myself .
neutral	they were not able to answer any questions .
neutral	i was told that i ' d have to call back during normal business hours to get any help .
neutral	maybe not advertise 00 / 0 customer_service if it '_s not truly customer_service !!
neutral	!
neutral	it was great ordering swimsuits at half the price , and great selections to choose .
neutral	they just arrived can '_t wait to see if the sizes i ordered fits .
neutral	one bad problem ordering online .
neutral	my credit_card was compromised , used twice , but thanks to my quick service it was tagged .
neutral	it was not a secure sight to order .
neutral	beware !
neutral	!
neutral	i '_ve gotten two shipment of food that i didn_'_t order -- i didn_'_t set_up a recurring shipment -- but i '_ve paid for and kept the food which i guess is what usually happens when they do this .
neutral	it seems under - handed and dishonest .
neutral	they have good food at good prices so i enjoy doing_business with them -- i just wish they won_'_t send extra food .
neutral	customer_service is very helpful and polite .
neutral	the night lights was not working and stuff was made in chine .
neutral	couldn_'_t change my pick_up date despite several_attempts .
neutral	otherwise , all was ok .
neutral	spare_foot saved me money on my storage_unit but it did not list the size of the unit i needed and made it harder for me to know how much money to expect on spending .
neutral	the order took much longer_than i expected .
neutral	the bottle , while it had not appeared to leak was sticky .
neutral	the actual gift_card looks great !
neutral	however , for some_reason , it didn_'_t get delivered .
neutral	it was returned to me with a sticker - address unknown .
neutral	not sure what happened there as the address was clearly_marked .
neutral	so , the gift was way late .
neutral	i was really pleased to fine you stocked the envelope size we are looking for , not many do .
neutral	the website said the product was in stock - however , an_email the next_day told me otherwise .
neutral	the person dealing_with the issue dealt_with this well and informed me that day .
neutral	however , i was assured the delivery would arrive on friday - it has not yet arrived .
neutral	i hope to receive it on monday .
neutral	we have never use travelocity before , or any other site .
neutral	was unable to give an opinion
neutral	i absoutly love buying clothes here , they are amazing .
neutral	but when it comes to shipping them to me , im pretty upset on how long it takes to process the order and get them to me .
neutral	i wish there were more stores in the country so i could come pick them up .
neutral	or even shop there !
neutral	it took several atttempts to book , as the site crashed , and even then we did not know if we had accommodation the day before , and had to rebook
neutral	i bought a shirt / jacket for my daughter '_s birthday , she is 00 years old .
neutral	during a shopping trip one saturday to the shops with her friends she was mortified and embarrased as she entered and exited each store setting the alarms off .
neutral	i had bought the jacket on line and they had sent the garment with the security tag still insitue !!!!!!!
neutral	nightmare to get off at home , not amused !!!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a bath with glass shower screen and was kept well informed by betterbathrooms regarding the progress of the order which was processed and dispatched for delivery very quickly .
neutral	following an_email_advising me that i would be contacted by the delivery company , i noted that it said the bath would be delivered to a ground_floor location on a wooden_pallet and would be given 00_minutes to check the contents for any_problems .
neutral	i emailed back as i had some concerns about getting the items up to a first floor_flat and received an_email back ( on bank_holiday monday ) advising me to contact the delivery firm as it was their call .
neutral	i didn_'_t contact them as we decided that we ( 0 women ) could just about get the bath shifted if we had to but still half hoped that the driver would help - wrong !
neutral	the bath was delivered on a massive wooden_pallet to the pathway in front of my daughter '_s flat , blocking the entrance to other residents and the driver said he was unable to help shift it and couldn_'_t take the pallet away either then pushed off straight_away without even waiting the 00 minute checking time .
neutral	my daughter rang the delivery company who said their drivers were unable to help in that way and was therefore left to move the bath inside by herself ( i was at work ) as well as break up the huge wooden_pallet to take to the tip .
neutral	in summary ; betterbathrooms provided an excellent service and i would liked to have used them again to buy a toilet and basin but because of their choice of delivery company i would only feel able to buy small items e . g .
neutral	taps from them .
neutral	in most cases i get what i ordered in a timely_matter .
neutral	my last experience was not so great not only did i not get the exact part i ordered but it took over a week to get here .
neutral	makes ordering from them more of a hassle .
neutral	i have been buying wild_alaskan salmon for many years .
neutral	when the quality of the latest
neutral	provider declined , i tried vital_choice .
neutral	was satisfied with quality of the wild_salmon i received the first time .
neutral	this has_been my second shipment and the day after arrival i
neutral	cooked wild_salmon ( also ordered halibut and cod ) and was disappointed with the taste of this portion of the shipment .
neutral	i know what the taste should be like ... and my husband also complained_about it .
neutral	hope the rest of the fish tastes better ....
neutral	great idea , money for free just by using this site .
neutral	so simple .
neutral	but , compare this site to others and the speed they pay out when you claim your money .
neutral	quidco are just two slow .
neutral	0 day delay before they send it and then up to 0 days to clear your bank .
neutral	that '_s a week .
neutral	the other site i use take 0 - 0 days in the week to pay up .
neutral	all that money from all there users in their bank not your for an extra 0 - 0 days .
neutral	bet that '_s a tidy sum .
neutral	ordered a fridge_/_freezer and cooker .
neutral	there would be a delay on the cooker , but i asked for the fridge_/_freezer to be delivered as soon as possible and not to wait for the cooker .
neutral	this was agreed .
neutral	each time i called i was given a different story , i was told the fridge would be coming with the cooker and was told a manager would call me back which never happened .
neutral	on asking for confirmation that the cooker would be delivered end of november i iwas then told it would not be coming in until 0 dec .
neutral	i could not be given a guarantee that i would even get it then .
neutral	i am taking delivery of the fridge_/_freezer tomorrow , but had to cancel the cooker i have the same model being delivered within 0 days from another company .
neutral	bought two things from separate shops .
neutral	a fairly cheap game which arrived the next_day which i was impressed with .
neutral	the other thing ordered ( a game console ) arrived a day later but i had to call the shop to find out when they were posting it as i paid £ 0 . 00 delivery .
neutral	the person said they posted it special delivery .
neutral	i got it the next_day but it was signed for not special delivery which i was annoyed at .
neutral	they paid about £ 0 to post it ( as seen on the stamp ) so they made £ 0 out of me .
neutral	so it depends on the shop you order from as i had a god experience but also a so so experience .
neutral	i bought some pillowcases and recieved them in an acceptable time period .
neutral	unfortunately the free soap had shattered and caused bits of it to go all over the pillowcases and some managed to get inside the packaging which was a pain as they were meant to be a present .
neutral	smells nice though .
neutral	cleaning up my items wasn_'_t something i intended on doing !
neutral	i didn_'_t understand_why i couldn_'_t buy 00 flash_drives and 000 lanyards .
neutral	it didn_'_t make_sense so i am buying the lanyards somewhere_else .
neutral	the drive was nice but the logo was not as dark and eye - popping as the picture when i approved it .
neutral	disappointed .
neutral	but they were fast which was good .
neutral	i ordered a snow white costume in a small ( size 0 - 0 ) for my daughter .
neutral	i ordered on a saturday and paid just under £_00 for delivery today .
neutral	( not a very competitive delivery service , and no tracking ).
neutral	did i get the costume on time ?
neutral	yes .
neutral	thank_you for delivering on time .
neutral	what about the costume itself ?
neutral	the top half is a huge 0 - 0 , more like a size 00 . if the stitching lasts 0 performances , i '_ll be amazed .
neutral	poor , poor quality , not reflective of the price of nearly_£_00 .
neutral	the head band with the bow in the picture , is actually just a piece of red ribbon in the pack .
neutral	you get better quality of ribbon wrapped round flowers from a florist .
neutral	if time were on my side , i ' d return the goods - sadly this is not the case , so we '_ll just have to work with what we have .
neutral	disappointed that an item i needed was pulled out of my cart before i could finish checking out .
neutral	i wish i ' d been warned that could happen .
neutral	everything else was okay though .
neutral	for one order of several parts , they arrived 0 different days via 0 different carriers .
neutral	i understand that parts came from different_warehouses , but pick one carrier for delivery , or give me the option of choosing .
neutral	good remanufactured part so_far .
neutral	but the amount to ship the old part back was more than the core_charge .
neutral	needless to say , i lost money for the core_charge .
neutral	amiclubwear has really nice shoes and the prices are incredible .
neutral	one thing i didn_'_t like is that i had returned about three_pairs of shoes ( my size ) butttttttt they were tooo small and since they cannot exchange the shoes it took about 0 - 0_weeks for each pair of shoes to get store credit .
neutral	another thing i didn_'_t like was that they only give you store credit for the shoes you are returning and not the shipping and handling which is about $_00 for each order thats ridiculous , so there i lost $_00 from my returns of shipping and handling .
neutral	it also takes tooooo long to get delivered .
neutral	the tracking_number i got did not work at all and when you call to customer_service they have you waitibg for 00_mins .
neutral	overall i did like the shoes but very bad service
neutral	i found the site fabulous .
neutral	so many properties on the site .
neutral	we stayed in paris and london with house_trip .
neutral	i would only suggest that they have a more accurate location description for each property '_s location before the booking has_been confirmed .
neutral	it should be given to the renter upon searching so we can google map it to see exactly where it is .
neutral	we would have liked to have been a bit closer to an area in paris but because we had never been there before an was totally unfamiliar with paris i just made do with what i thought would be good .
neutral	that is the only flaw with the site .
neutral	if this was fixed i would rate the site a 0_star .
neutral	i would say that the web design both in the mobile and desktop are poorly design - it almost looks like a facebook knock off .
neutral	its simple in the wrong ways which makes it a bit inconvenient .
neutral	also i would work on creating an app which would make life_easier .
neutral	i would love to beta test and work on design since i work in the technology field but oh well ...
neutral	i have 0 cushions , both are a bit too hard , not flexible enough to make me feel_comfortable , plus , do not fit chairs well .
neutral	when we arrived at the hotel , it was obviously not what we expected .
neutral	i immediately called travelocity and was told that since we purchased a package ( airfare , hotel and car ) and had already started our trip ( we flew to pa ) there was nothing they could do to help change our reservation .
neutral	booking the trip was fast and easy based on the reviews .
neutral	we wanted a guided dolphin tour on jet skis since we were inexperienced .
neutral	when we arrived in destin we couldn_'_t find the rental office .
neutral	we asked directions and were sent to the other end of the boardwalk .
neutral	the address didn_'_t exist and when we called tripshock and found the rental booth , it had a different name .
neutral	they did take us out .
neutral	we didn_'_t see any dolphins and our guide wanted to leave us in the middle of the bay with big waves to " go off on our own ".
neutral	no .
neutral	you will stay with us .
neutral	he did and we made it back ok . we ended_up having a ton of scary fun !!
neutral	not exactly_what i was anticipating but it all worked out .
neutral	purchased the men '_s bifold envelope system wallet for $_00 . 00
neutral	this $_00 wallet made out of nylon is crinkly , the money moves around it it a little too easily , and the space for holding your id is not standard id holding size ( weird ?!).
neutral	it is way overpriced for the product received .
neutral	unfortunately there are not many makers of men '_s bifold envelope systems , so we bit the bullet and paid the price .
neutral	however , if i could do it again , i ' d pass .
neutral	it would be better to get a nice , secure , well designed bifold and self - design an envelope system into it .
neutral	our ink_cartridges arrived quickly .
neutral	no_problems with the black_ink_cartridge , but our red on our colored cartridge seems very light .
neutral	hopefully it will darken as we use ?
neutral	i think i put this on cheapoair . ca by mistake .
neutral	to be fair they have some terrible reviews and i understand_why .
neutral	we '_ve just had one of our flights brought forward which sent the whole schedule out , we were offered a few undesirable alternatives but eventually agreed to something we were all ok with .
neutral	trying to get through on the phone is awful , 0 hour wait to get through and then on and off hold for a while .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t like this job , lots of annoyed customers i would imagine .
neutral	my problem was solved within a week , however one of our passengers got lost but again that was fixed .
neutral	a big lesson_learnt for me , never book multiple carriers because if one drops out of the loop your whole schedule is messed_up and not easy to fix .
neutral	i '_m not sure my problem was the fault of cheapoair but for ease i think i will book directly with the airline nextime and find someone with an easier phone line .
neutral	** i wanted to add that since sorting out my flights they have called me back re our hotel reservation and booked us a room for the night ** so i think my experience would '_ve been four_stars had it not been for the ridiculously long hold time on the phone .
neutral	to be fair they have some terrible reviews and i understand_why .

neutral	you can get a good price on travelocity , but do your research first on your options so you are ready to buy .
neutral	the next time you go to the web_site you will probably get a higher price or find that the exact flights you wanted are no_longer available .
neutral	and if you are booking an expensive overseas flight , then you may have to buy the travel_insurance when you buy the ticket .
neutral	if the web_site tells you have only one chance , take it to heart .
neutral	i should not have ordered the transparent labels .
neutral	they are very challenging to remove and then you have to be very careful not to leave dirt or prints on them .
neutral	on the plus side , the cost was reasonable , and they were relatively quickly delivered .
neutral	my order was received in a timely_manner but all of the cans were dented .
neutral	i don_'_t like dented_cans & do not purchase them so why should i get them by mail !
neutral	autoeurope us was fine with a clear , easy reservation on line for the car .
neutral	when we got to the perpignan train_station , however , it was very difficult to find anyone_who knew where rue charles de galle was , the rental_car location .
neutral	took about an_hour to find the place .
neutral	a rather rude man handled the business of getting the car , and i was completely unimpressed with his attitude and helpfulness .
neutral	ugh .
neutral	then when i got the car , it was huge !
neutral	i told the guy we ' d reserved a compact car , and he said he didn_'_t know what that meant ( english was a challenge ) and so we got this l o n g vehicle which became an exciting ordeal when trying to negotiate the narrow roads in northern spain and southern france .
neutral	ultimately the car was fine and all worked well .
neutral	but i remain annoyed at the rental_car personnel .
neutral	next time we '_ll be sure the " railroad station location " is , in fact , at the railroad station !
neutral	found it very unclear you see if an order had or hadn_'_t been placed
neutral	ended_up buying two of the same !
neutral	no answers to emails , probably_wouldn_'_t use this company again
neutral	well , i love booohoo as far as the clothes , the free_shipping and the superb customer_service .
neutral	i really like the things that was shipped to me but unfortunately they were both damaged which was disappointing .
neutral	since i '_ve been shopping online , i '_ve never had an item shipped to me damaged before .. i swear to the highest , so you can imagine how shocked i was .
neutral	as i said to boohoo when i emailed them , it '_s a first for everything and this was mine .
neutral	i will_continue to do_business with a company that put their customers first .
neutral	it '_s my number one pet_peeve , meaning ; to listen , to responsed and to care .
neutral	you guys at boohoo did all three and i thank_you many_times over for that .
neutral	keep_up the lovely services and beautiful sophisticated clothes .
neutral	pleasantness and customer_service wouldn_'_t hurt when you are spending your money someplace .
neutral	the woman snapped at my autistic son every few_minutes like he was going to wreck the place or something , and she was just not the nicest she could have been .
neutral	i don_'_t want my comments here to affect my service as i have a storage_unit here .
neutral	skype is very useful .
neutral	often times the calls drop .
neutral	but im happy skype app is available for smart phones .
neutral	he international rates are still not so competitive .
neutral	hope your company can do something about the international call rates .
neutral	i was hoping to find a pet subscription_box from this company that would minimize my trips to the pet_store , especially_considering the monthly cost of the box .
neutral	even with the coupon i used ( came to $_00 . 00 total ), i could have bought significantly more at big_chain_stores , such as petco .
neutral	to me , due to experiences with other subscription boxes , i have been inclined to think that these boxes are meant to be full of samples ( tried and true items the company found ), that a company has purchased in bulk and is then able to dispense at a low_cost while still making a profit .
neutral	these items , because tested & approved by the company , would make me want to buy those products from them .
neutral	now don_'_t get me wrong - yes , my cat enjoyed the products in the box , i am not denying this .
neutral	however , i would say that i could have bought the same items for approximately_$_00 - 00 , and used a coupon to even get more off .
neutral	therefore , i will no_longer buy any boxes from this company , especially because next time i would have to pay full - price !
neutral	the delivery costs are way too high , £_00 . 00 and you have to wait a week !
neutral	when it arrived i was sent the wrong fitting tap and am still_waiting for a replacement .
neutral	this means my plumber has_been out once fitted a new sink but i still have no tap !!
neutral	so more costs for me when the plumber comes back if the replacementntap ever arrives .
neutral	arrrgghh and victoria_plumb haven_'_t even acknowledged my email from yesterday yet .
neutral	they needed a photograph so they could see what they sent me incorrectly .
neutral	oh god help me !
neutral	while i love the concept of this , i feel the box i received was geared toward smaller dogs and definitely not worth what was paid .
neutral	my dog loved the treats and the stuffed squeaky steak toy .
neutral	the vitamins were nice as i had just ran_out .
neutral	but then the other 0 things were more fit for a small dog .
neutral	a bone about 0 inches long and 0 inch ( at the most ) wide is gone in one bite for my border_collie and 0 strips of jerky .
neutral	overall just seemed cheap , especially compared to his barkbox subscription .
neutral	i will try one more month , if i receive the same results i will be canceling my subscription .
neutral	when i rented the car no one bothered to mention that it was a hybrid type of car so that when you came to a stop the car shuts down .
neutral	i thought there was something wrong with the car .
neutral	they had no maps .
neutral	how can you run a rental_car place and not provide maps at_least to get out of the damn parking_lot to the freeway .
neutral	woman that waited on me was rushed , hurried , and gave the opinion she didn_'_t want to be there and then about 0 minutes later we saw her in the parking_lot as i guess it was the end of her day .
neutral	so the experience was so so in the office but at_least the car did not break_down .
neutral	i think they need better customer_service and this was europcar .
neutral	i wasn_'_t as impressed with your selection this year as much as last_year when i shopped for my mother at the same store .
neutral	but both_times the sales ladies were great !
neutral	i was disappointed that some of the items i purchased for mom last_year didn_'_t hold up as well as i would have expected from a store with your reputation .
neutral	my mom takes very good care of her clothes and washes many things by hand as_opposed to using the washing_machine .
neutral	i have never run across anyone better at laundry than her .
neutral	so i was surprised to discover that one blouse with shoulder pads i purchased last_year for her and she only wore a handful of times , had a shoulder pad that was coming unravelled .
neutral	i took it into the store to inquire if they had an extra shoulder pad or what their suggestions would be .
neutral	they offered none .
neutral	i was a little surprised .
neutral	there was another item that i purchased - a t shirt .
neutral	mom only wore it a couple of times and washed it only a couple of times .
neutral	however two ' diamonds ' were missing from the flowers around the neckline .
neutral	i am attempting to get a couple to replace them .
neutral	so disappointed in quality .
neutral	paypal has increased their fees .
neutral	unfortunately this makes them less desirable to work with .
neutral	i have to pass this cost on to my costumers which hurts business all around .
neutral	i am looking into other online payment services .
neutral	sometimes i can find a great deal but it is very hit or miss .
neutral	make_sure you read all the fine_print !
neutral	also check the expiration_dates closely .
neutral	i only shop groupon after thoroughly checking out the deal !
neutral	used to love the quality of merchandise but cap for floaty thing came in broken and we rigged it to last the winter but for the cost of handling itshould have been bettermade .
neutral	i found that my order for some ladies boots where delivered fast , also when i returned
neutral	t hem for an exchange they sent me an e_- mail to say they had received them and would let_me know as soon as possible what was happening , i '_m still_waiting after 00 days . i would like to know as i need the boots soon .
neutral	j . workman
neutral	all the games are too much and annoying .
neutral	putting photos online is complicated and you can delete them afterwards .
neutral	but facebook is good to stay in contact and to organize things and activities !
neutral	ryanair is very cheap which is good obviously .
neutral	but the staff is not always friendly , the seats are very small and you don_'_t even get a drink during the flight !!
neutral	and they are very strict with the baggage !
neutral	i see my public record has my birth date as 0000 -- off by ten_years .
neutral	also , my past residences are somewhat " skewed " in the three bureaus .
neutral	how is something like this corrected ?
neutral	what good is it to find discrepancies if there is nothing i can about it ?
neutral	i want a service that will help me fix the problem - not just shine a light on it .
neutral	water in shower was cold , there wasn_'_t any hot_water .
neutral	it was not easy , but made the reservation and secured the room .
neutral	i guees nothing worth having is easy to get !
neutral	i love the dresses however i found one dress to be almost 0 sizes larger , despite all the dresses being ordered in the same size .
neutral	with respect to the delivery , the amount indicated for customs was $_00 higher_than my actual invoice , therefore i had to pay more in customs_fees and taxes , which i don_'_t understand and shouldn_'_t have happened .
neutral	i hope this does not happen again as this will_definitely deter me from making any future_purchases .
neutral	i would appreciate it if something could be done about this .
neutral	i like the prices and options that were available , but i wish i had a tracking_number so i could keep_track of when to expect my package .
neutral	ordering my books was easy , and paying for them was easy .
neutral	when i ordered shipping i paid for the regular 0 - 0 business days .
neutral	most of the time that means 0 - 0 business days .
neutral	for bookbyte it meant 0 - 0 business days .
neutral	the late arrival of m books put me a behind in my class and now i '_m playing catch up .
neutral	if you order from them pay extra for the next_day delivery , or expect to wait , and wait and wait .
neutral	ik_vind_het jammer_dat bij_de platliggende optie de_foto niet doorloopt in de opstaande rand , maar_dat_het gedeelte van_de tegenoverliggende foto zichtbaar is .
neutral	albelli geeft aan dat als_je de pagina '_s tegen elkaar aandrukt je_het_niet ziet .
neutral	maar_dat moet natuurlijk niet de oplossing zijn ...
neutral	i love the home delivery but the box has_been coming apart and food spilling out when i recieve the shipment .
neutral	i dont_know if i can continue to order if this keeps happening though i would love to .
neutral	im concerned_about pests getting into food , etc if the bag is ripped_open .
neutral	excellent product and service except that i asked for a receipt to be included with my second order as there hadn_'_t been one with my first and still didn_'_t receive one with the delivery .
neutral	i think it '_s odd not to receive a paper receipt / invoice with the goods .
neutral	the guy on the desk was a bit stressed and was rushing through everyone .
neutral	he didn_'_t introduce himself properly and banged on about me not having a locking_wheel nut key , before realising my car didn_'_t have this beause it didn_'_t need one .
neutral	however , they did a good job .
neutral	had to return first size ordered as not as large as expected .
neutral	larger_size was exactly_what was expected .
neutral	daughter very happy
neutral	i always have problems with u guys
neutral	ist off these are the wrong prescription it seems their are lines i get progressive and they are nvf please look at my prescription again , then after quite a few e_mails on the sunglasses i ordered you suggested the dark_grey tint so i was charged an extra $ 0 . o00 for that and again many e_mails back and forth on this and what do i get ??????
neutral	are you ready for it ?
neutral	the light_grey tint , you must be joking please read all the e_mails for this , so now again i have no glasses .
neutral	wrong prescription on all 0 and the sunglasses need to be dark_grey not light_grey .
neutral	i am now requesting a free label from you to return these .
neutral	and then when i get my full credit i will re order again and hopefully for the last time for now .
neutral	i am also waiting on a credit from a long time ago that i am sending you separately .
neutral	i have been doing_business with you for a long time and please help me get this correct .
neutral	i also don_'_t understand_why the glasses fit loosely ?
neutral	they can fall off if i put my head down please reply on this also .
neutral	i need a reply on this whole e_mail so plz send me the free label so you pay for the shipping this time and i will send them right back i already have it packed and ready to go , thanks you and a good day to you
neutral	i ordered the food to be sent in january i received it in december and was lucky i had the money in the bank to pay for it . they said they were sorry and would cancel the january order and send the next order in february . hmmm . i didn_'_t need it in december as i had just spent $_000 on dog_food at petco . what do you think ?
neutral	i love my sunglasses , but they are not the " gold " color as_described and advertised on the website .
neutral	i was disappointed that this was a gift and he find not know who it came from .
neutral	i had to call him a week_later to ask him if he received it .
neutral	that is when he told me he couldn_'_t find a card !!!
neutral	also a little disappointed that it took 0 days to receive the gift .
neutral	the delviery was amazing the only problem is that i have found a small_hole in the back of the jacket wehre the two parts of material conect
neutral	i don_'_t have a problem with the employees , they were nice ...... my issues with this company is that the storage_units are way over priced .
neutral	i rent the same size storage_unit in steamboat springs , co ( where everything is over priced ) but my storage_unit here in minnetonka , mn is more than double the price .
neutral	i '_m stuck right now and have to rent this unit , no other options in the area .
neutral	i truly believe they are price gouging because they are the only storage provider in the area .
neutral	just another greed company on the list .
neutral	got the product and love it , but i am disappointed in the so - called special that was not taken off with payment .
neutral	the special was not even known by the customer_service person_who answered the phone .
neutral	i had to beg for the discount .
neutral	i have used this company several_times and they have been excellent .
neutral	on trying to book again after being prompted by an_email from " skypark_steve " problems with the booking_procedure became_apparent .
neutral	i wanted to check that the place i was booking was the same as before and the " map " tab didn_'_t work on their site .
neutral	also when trying to log in to my account the pages went round and round in a loop not recognising my details and so i could get no further .
neutral	i had to bypass this by saying i was a new customer .
neutral	the actual service provided for the shuttle and reliability is good .
neutral	price is also very good .
neutral	would have liked to have rated 0_stars but the problem with the booking process only gave it a 0_star .
neutral	i had problems with my card not working because of the daily spending allowance , which i didn_'_t realize at first .
neutral	when i tried_calling customer_service it was a nightmare !
neutral	i called three_times .
neutral	all of which , left me on hold for more than an_hour each time .
neutral	when someone finally did answer and ask my name , we were cut_off , all three_times !
neutral	i finally gave up and went to my bank and things were fine , but travelocity '_s customer_service options are the worst !
neutral	we ordered a muffler and it was delivered perfect and very fast .
neutral	we were very satisfied .
neutral	but this week , i was shopping for side_mirrors .
neutral	i attempted to call parts_geek to ask if the mirrors are glass or plastic .
neutral	i was on hold for 00_minutes .
neutral	their message said to do a ticket on the web_site and someone would answer within 00_hours .
neutral	indeed , i got a response from the site , but it said to call the 000 number .
neutral	which i did again the next_morning .
neutral	on hold for more than 00_minutes again .
neutral	still could not get an answer to my question .
neutral	partsgeek needs better customer_service to answer questions .
neutral	first i must let you know we were most pleased with the 0 passenger suv we rented at the termini in rome .
neutral	with 0 small_children and a central rome departure for the beach in terracina , it made sense to rent in rome as_opposed to the airport .
neutral	we made the last_minute decision to rent the gps which was an excellent choice , as att mobile services were somewhat unreliable during our stay and it would not have served_us well to rely_on their gps app while navigating in unfamiliar locations .
neutral	what dismayed me was the rental fee for 0 days .... almost $ 0000 .
neutral	as we wished to be in one vehicle , we accepted this high rate for the manual shift van .
neutral	we were told it would be an_additional_$_000 / week for an automatic .
neutral	and ... we did need to rent in the city for convenience .
neutral	we were also told there was a 0 / 0 hour " grace period " for returning the van exactly 0 days_later .
neutral	while i can understand boundries and italian roads from the beach , midday rome traffic , a surprise one - way street back to the parking_garage near the terminal and a slow climb in a busy garage to the 0th_floor are not your issue , your over the top pricing for what was perhaps 0 - 00 miniutes past the grace period are the stuff of poor business_practice .
neutral	having run a business and understanding boundries must be set , i also know common_sense can prevail ... especially given the rates autoeurope charges .
neutral	we spoke to the attendant , but he just nodded and smiled ... perhaps unable to converse with us ?
neutral	to be charged a full day at what appears to be close to an_additional_$_000_dollars for a " daily " fee is quite over the top .
neutral	even " pro - rating " under the circumstances described ... but $_000 for approximately 00_minutes is just unacceptable to me .
neutral	in conclusion , i will not plan to rent through you again and will caution others to be wiser than we apparently were .
neutral	i would appreciate a note in return and i do thank_you for " listening ".
neutral	well , went to get my box of ostomy_supplies i ordered and was surprised it was so heavy .
neutral	opened the box and found 0 more boxes inside and i opened one of the boxes and to my surprise ... leg bags not the ostomy_supplies on the packing_slip which had what i ordered on it .
neutral	called you guys and the girl fixed every thing ( i hope i get what i ordered ).
neutral	wasn_'_t happy with the quality of the material , i sent the two dresses back and am still_waiting for my refund , can '_t understand_why it takes up to 00 days to refund your money !
neutral	i was a little disappointed when i opened the books and there was not one single bit of information about the book being a rental , except there was a line that read if this is a rental due date : it was blank .
neutral	no instruction on how or where to return the rental .
neutral	this just makes it more time_consuming to get the information on sending it back when it should have been incorporated with the receipt .
neutral	i also feel this was a way to " make money " on the rental because if it is not returned in the given time , you get charged for the book .
neutral	otherwise , the delivery was quick and the books were in good condition .
neutral	i have no problem with that .
neutral	was not satisfied with the mattress
neutral	radio is cute but hard to tune and speaker is lousy .
neutral	love the night lites for bella & brinkly , although i order 0 pink & 0 blue , when i received they were all pink and was kind of disappointed !
neutral	$_00 + dollars for my 0 year_old_son '_s optimus prime costume bought me a cheap looking body suit and very flimsy plastic accessories .
neutral	he_loves it and it shipped free and fast , so i '_m giving it three stars ; however , i don_'_t think i '_ll be shopping here next year .
neutral	delivery was next_day - couldn_'_t_believe the efficiency .
neutral	love the light - problem , beware when errecting , the metal is very thin and we broke it .
neutral	have to find a way of repairing !
neutral	price for part was great , however the shipping_charges for such a lightweight item ( oring ) was excessive !
neutral	i ordered this trampoline on - line and it was significantly_cheaper_than equivalents elsewhere .
neutral	i didn_'_t hear_anything for a couple of days despite the product offering 00 hour delivery however this was all made clear after a quick phonecall .
neutral	i would have given a higher star_rating if i hadn_'_t of needed to chase up the item myself .
neutral	delivery date was confirmed with me , and a quick call on the morning of the delivery date confirmed a pm delivery - ideal .
neutral	the trampoline itself is excellent , it was relatively straightforward to assemble and is very , very sturdy .
neutral	the permitted weight_limit is very heavy so even us adults have enjoyed bouncing - fab !
neutral	delivery was real quick and i was thrilled .
neutral	this is my first experience with blue_buffalo and my dogs are refusing it .
neutral	even with old brand mixed in .
neutral	will have to update in future .
neutral	hopefully they will get hungry enough soon !
neutral	!
neutral	ordered the 00 day slot but oil came 00 days early and they refunded the oil that didn_'_t fit into the tank .
neutral	a phone_call from the company the day before they deliver would be good in the future .
neutral	capsules do not fit so well in nepresso machines , feels awkward when you pull
neutral	down on lever with your capsule in machine .
neutral	coffee could have more body , richer roast
neutral	packaging is unappealing , not attractive
neutral	you will appeal to a certain segment of this market but not everyone ,
neutral	meaning you will get the market share that is only interested in price and
neutral	not quality and i mean quality all around
neutral	,
neutral	i purchased ecig wizards and asked about buying new batteries and am still_waiting for a reply .
neutral	they need to get their after sales up to scratch
neutral	ami has really cute_clothes at reasonable prices .
neutral	what i don_'_t like is they rarely send an e_mail so i could track the package .
neutral	one incident in particular i didn_'_t get an e_mail and never received the package although ups said it was delivered .
neutral	had i gotten an e_mail i could have made sure and been home .
neutral	this incident happened in october and nothing '_s been done about it .
neutral	i also received a package about 0_weeks_ago missing a skirt , the invoice said it didn_'_t come but i was still charged for the item .
neutral	i e_mailed ami about the issue , received an e_mail_stating only that they got the e_mail and to this day i haven_'_t heard back .
neutral	communication is poor with this company .
neutral	tried to book our hotel room online , but after filling out the forms , couldn_'_t get any acknowledgement to the submittal .
neutral	called bookit , was told it hadn_'_t gone_through , and had to repeat all the info again with a rep who was not the most customer_service oriented .
neutral	put in a request for a " quiet , clean room " ( in light of some negative_feedback from other customers ), which the representative translated to the hotel as a " quiite queen room ."
neutral	have no_idea what we '_ll get now !!!!
neutral	very disappointed - would take a really good deal for me to book through bookit again .
neutral	i was really excited but disappointed by the renovation and the views outside he window which overlooked another building site - the room was awesome , food was affordable .
neutral	staff was pleasant
neutral	the first order i placed was rejected because the picture i uploaded was of my son - in -_law with a paint ball gun at his son '_s birthday_party .
neutral	so .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	i had to place the whole order all over again .
neutral	then i didn_'_t hear_anything , and found out it never went through .
neutral	so i placed it again -- for the third time .
neutral	i '_m certainly hoping it gets here in time for christmas .
neutral	not very happy !
neutral	thank_you for the tree very nice
neutral	other than them taking way too long to ship the equipment , it was overall pretty good .
neutral	it took several e_- mails to get a hold of someone_who could sort out what happened ( i guess it was just overlooked at time of order ).
neutral	when the equipment did arrive , it was in great shape , and was exactly as expected .
neutral	i don_'_t know why they didn_'_t just have it ship from a local supplier ( gemaire ), instead of having it shipped all the way from kentucky , as long as it got here that '_s ok .
neutral	i would probably order from them again , though =)
neutral	so i purchased this awesome yellow dalek skin for my ipod 0th gen .
neutral	the back was fairly easy to apply .
neutral	it '_s a little off centre but i '_ll deal .
neutral	the front on the other hand , looks terrible .
neutral	it was impossible to apply , and once i was able to get it to stick , the vinyl had stretched and now it fits funny .
neutral	it still looks decent but for what i paid i '_m not too overly fond .
neutral	i would order another product again , but not for the price .
neutral	damn us dollar ..
neutral	every time i place an order for oil with boiler_juice i write in the special information box - ' phone the day before the delivery '.
neutral	this is because the tank is in a locked outhouse to try to prevent theft of oil .
neutral	if they phone the day before i can unlock it .
neutral	not once has anyone ever managed to phone the day before .
neutral	how hard can it be ?
neutral	plenty of other on line companies give the consumer a 0 hour delivery slot - the oil providers cannot even give a delivery date !
neutral	disappointing from customer viewpoint .
neutral	the watch arrived on time , extremely well_packaged , but i had asked 0 it to be gi0t wrapped with a gi0t bag .
neutral	it came with neither .
neutral	what a shame .
neutral	the pool_cover fit but the clips do not hold .
neutral	the flowers & delivery service i couldn_'_t fault ~ what seems to have let_me down on more than one occasion is that the voucher_codes for special_offers never seem to work , upon raising the issue they responded quick however the discount i was then given didn_'_t reflect there amendment ~ with this working i wouldn_'_t hesitate to use them again .
neutral	the connection quality is pretty great .
neutral	the convenience of speed dialing is also a plus .
neutral	if the rates to african countries were lower , it would be perfect .
neutral	the quality of the glasses i ordered was fine -- the lenses were made well and the frames were as_described .
neutral	the reason for my 0 - star_rating is the customer_service .
neutral	my first issue was that i received a phone_call about my order being shipped .
neutral	i don_'_t mind providing my phone_number to be used in case there is a problem with my order , but calling to give me a simple update when an_email would suffice seemed unnecessary .
neutral	after i received the glasses , i wanted to exchange them , but going about doing that was frustrating .
neutral	the emails i received from framesdirect . com '_s customer_service often contained spelling errors and sounded overly familiar , not professional .
neutral	after exchanging a few emails , i decided that i ' d_rather just be done with the experience and i ended_up returning my purchase instead of exchanging .
neutral	i likely will not use this website again .
neutral	i was asked to leave car at train_station in san sebastián . when i arrived pretty tired after driving 0hours , there were no spaces left to park and the office was closed .
neutral	i did not have easy access to phone and was quite distressed .
neutral	other than that agent at airport in santiago was very helpful with directions out to main highway . i would give him 0_stars .
neutral	the part arrived and was the same one that i had bought locally which did not cause a good enough seal for the vacuum system on my 0000 cadallic catera .
neutral	the picture on your website shown what the original gas_cap looked like , with the cable attached to the gas_cap .
neutral	i received a delco gas_cap that still does not seal as tightly as it needs to turn off the engine_light .
neutral	using it anyway until i can find another " right " one .
neutral	very confusing to reach_someone and get answers .
neutral	my glasses broke and i returned them , they repaired them for an_additional_cost for polycarbon lens , the frame_arm broke and i returned them , they charged me $_00 for a new frame .
neutral	i now have my glasses and pray they stay in one piece .
neutral	the sevice is very good and takes the stress away from parking especially on your return home .
neutral	however , our flight home was delayed by four hours and were told on arrival that we had to pay £_00 cash for arriving late .
neutral	i had to pay a driver £_00 and was told he didn_'_t carry a receipt book and have had to email the company for proof of payment .
neutral	as yet i have had no reply .
neutral	fast at good product but a butten is missing ;(
neutral	i have never used this source for travel but it was recommended as easy .
neutral	as a novice i found it less_than easy and to make a change to the return flight that seemed to be assigned was impossible through_travelocity and with contact to the airline_directly it cost prohibitive at the point of the airline effort to double sale me my ticket .
neutral	while it saved me the search for what airlines flew for specific date for destination and return flights i likely will not use this source again .
neutral	i hope jalbum can improve loading speed since nowaday , it is unacceptable to load a 000k picture for almost 0 - 0s .
neutral	ok service although had to wait sometime on arrival for company to collect car , even_though had called them 00_minutes before arriving as requested .
neutral	i '_m going to book straight through the hotel next time .
neutral	processed 0 orders , 0 onlineand second over phone but ended_up wtih 0 wrong items as product info .
neutral	on website shwing wrong picture with item codes .
neutral	not impressed as the shirt was intended for christmas gift ......
neutral	sorry !
neutral	network kinda disturb
neutral	overpaid on your product and so_far , dog won_'_t eat the food .
neutral	could have bought at tsc for $_00 . 00 and no shipping .
neutral	shame on me
neutral	i have ordered several_times in the past from this company .
neutral	always had very speedy_delivery .
neutral	this time i waited almost two_weeks and no email_stating my socks were mailed and no socks .
neutral	i called inquiring on my order and found out the socks were not in stock .
neutral	i cancelled my order and ordered them elsewhere .
neutral	i was dissapointed for yourlegs . com did not inform me of the situation .
neutral	i wasted a lot of time .
neutral	need socks for long air flight .
neutral	although opticontacts has a low price in comparison to other_sites , after the processing and shipping fees you are really not getting a deal at all !
neutral	i did find that the delivery was fast though .
neutral	i probably will not be reordering in the future .
neutral	i paid_extra in shipping to receive 0 cards prior to leaving town for christmas .
neutral	they didn_'_t arrive in time .
neutral	unlike_other agencies i '_ve used which usually give a carbon copy of the information you sign , they just keep a plain record which could potentially be changed .
neutral	i picked_up my car from the garage the day i flew , i didn_'_t notice a scratch on the rear door , one week_later on receiving my car back from stress_free meet and greet there were scratches as if someone opened the door onto a wall .
neutral	when i questioned this i was shown the card which had a few lines drawn on the picture of the car .
neutral	i do not know if they were there before i gave them the car , but there paperwork is certainly not good enough to prove they were .
neutral	there is no stopping anyone adding another line if there was an accident while it is in their position .
neutral	quick delivery , dissapointing when i got a size_bigger then i was just_incase and it was still small .
neutral	same happened with a few people i know , not accurate .
neutral	i have returned for a refund .
neutral	i had a friend that told me about your product and i have been on depression meds for quite some time and i '_m hoping that these pills will help me in my mental health area more than what the prescription pills have done because i feel_like they '_ve done nothing for me so we shall see .
neutral	no service charge .
neutral	i have bought many gift_cards from this company and i been very happy with them ... however its a good idea to call and check the balance of the gift_card before you use it .
neutral	i just had an embarrassing experience with one of them after driving in a snowstorm to this certain store because i had their gift_card .
neutral	customer_service was very friendly and it should be straightened_out , i am waiting for a credit back to my credit_card .
neutral	that was the second time a gift_card came with zero balance .
neutral	i think i will still use this company but right now a need a little break to get over my bad_experience .
neutral	it bothered me that this lady betty from their customer_services told me the cards are good for 000 days ... that didn_'_t seem right to me .
neutral	it has_been over a week since i placed my order and it was received and shipped , yet i still do not have it ....
neutral	i ordered some other products from a different parts store online and not only do i already have my products , but they are scheduled to be put on my car tomorrow ....
neutral	so although the prices were right the shipping is certainly a let_down .
neutral	their prices are cheap and i needed cheap .
neutral	but i will never order from them again .
neutral	i received the correct_part but the whole time i was worried if it was wrong how simple it would be to return .
neutral	the website made me wonder_if it was a scam and nothing made me feel at ease when ordering the part and if it had been something that costed hundreds of dollars i would have not ordered it .
neutral	i still don_'_t know how legitimate of a business it is .
neutral	i got the part i ordered , the shipping took longer_than i would have preferred for the price , the box it came in was very used and torn up making me question my purchase again , but all in all it worked out this time .
neutral	we placed an order for shoes and a glove but forgot to add the shorts we needed .
neutral	so we completed the on line form as instructed ( and we couldn_'_t ring as it was a sunday_night )
neutral	only to find the order dispatched minus the shorts and if we wanted the shorts we would have to pay a delivery charge .
neutral	not the customer_service i wanted or expected .
neutral	although the prompt postage of the other items was appreciated for the start of the season
neutral	framesdirect set my expectations at 0 - 00 days .
neutral	i ordered on the first & received the glasses on the 00th .
neutral	way to long when you are wearing readers and are experiencing headaches .
neutral	additionally , i now have to bring glasses and prescription to my eye_doctor to check if the glasses were done right because i am having problems seeing properly with them ..
neutral	example is for distance i can see better without them ..
neutral	i gave them all pertinent data and a new prescription so i am baffled .
neutral	also they advised me to seek help locally for adjustments and nobody wants to take_responsibility for these fragile glasses , i can '_t blame them .
neutral	had a good experience before with fd so i don_'_t know what '_s up now .
neutral	will be sending back faulty cartridges for a refund as soon as i get the replacement ones that i ordered a week_ago .
neutral	love the item , only chose this site becuse item in stock when could have ordered elsewhere cheaper but out of stock - then this site went out of stock - no price match as stated on web_site - would think_twice before ordering again !
neutral	i felt your site was easy to use , however , there was no place to include my aarp_discount .
neutral	also , when your site said click here to view room that never happened .
neutral	since i have stayed at hampton_inn before , i basically knew how the rooms look .
neutral	just wanted to see what made the room " deluxe ".
neutral	works very well but there are competitors in the field who won_'_t trample your privacy .
neutral	google_chrome is acceptable but not outstanding ( although it does have built - in spell corrector ).
neutral	gmail is very good , i would recommend that .
neutral	i received my part in a timely_fashion .
neutral	i did have an_issue with contacting customer_service regarding my existing order .
neutral	they wanted you to submit a ticket online .
neutral	i had to select the option to place a new order before i could get someone on the phone but when i did they assisted_me .
neutral	the issue i was having was that they had told me my product was being shipped via_fedex when it was really being shipped usps so every time i went to track the package it kept saying no record found so i thought my package hadn_'_t shipped yet .
neutral	i did finally get the part and it was in good condition and fix the issue i was having with my blinker switch .
neutral	i was looking_forward to the salmon my daughter bought for a christmas gift and turned to look up recipes .
neutral	i tried two different methods of cooking the salmon and i guess it was ok but i was disappointed .
neutral	it tasted a little dry and did not have much flavor .
neutral	i am a former member of privacy guard for 00 - 00 years and switched to identity_guard about a year_ago .
neutral	there was a mistaken identity issue that caused my credit_score to drop 000 points and privacy guard did not alert me ; i noticed it myself when doing a periodic check .
neutral	so i decided to shop for another service that would be more diligent and read about identity_guard online .
neutral	your service was more costly ( about $_00 / month vs the $_00 / month i was paying ) and i appreciated the monthly updates on new information being detected .
neutral	however , i was shocked to learn after half a year or more that the reports & scores i pulled periodically could be as much as 0 months old !
neutral	!
neutral	i since went to your site and noticed that that is a premium service that costs even more per_month .
neutral	so i am shopping again .
neutral	i am now looking for a service that uses real fico scores , will let_me see new reports every_month , and will alert me of changes to my profile .
neutral	i took the capsule for 0 months along with a 0 , 000 calorie diet and exercise plan .
neutral	i didn_'_t see much difference in my weight_loss with or without the suppliment .
neutral	it did help to curb my cravings .
neutral	overall my experience has_been average .
neutral	when i first opened my account i had issues with the media player - silverlight .
neutral	after we got the bugs worked out it seems to be smooth_sailing .
neutral	i just wish there were a larger variety of new releases .
neutral	i would also like to see if a tv serious is still on the air or if what is available is the entire show .
neutral	i do not like generally to say something negative , but i was very disappointed with my order from parfum0 . com i have been wearing " poeme " fragrance for the past 00 years and it by_far the most long - lasting perfume i have ever had in edp version .
neutral	attracted with coupon offer i ordered it from this website 0 , 0_oz ( non_- spray bottle ) along with 0 other parfums .
neutral	this one was the main intention of my purchase .
neutral	how shocked i was opening bottle and discovering , that it disappears within 00_min .
neutral	the leftover of same parfum from macy ’_s ( 0 year_old ) still lasts on my skin whole day ( and clothes for few_days ), so you cannot blame it on skin chemistry .
neutral	after talking to sales_associates in macy '_s and nordstrom , i have learned that only_reason could be that it was old bottle ( maybe spoiled due to wrong temperature conditions ).
neutral	frustrated , i looked at return_policy of the company .
neutral	as for company policy , i cannot return or exchange it , so i stuck with it , and i do not use it either .
neutral	$_00 are wasted , and i am not sure about other perfumes i bought , because the rest was intended as gifts .
neutral	i think that my total money spent was $_000 . 00 , could as well buy less but normal quality in nordstrom .
neutral	yet , still_waiting for 0 more to come , it was not in stock for the day of shipping .
neutral	saving few_dollars on coupon and tax end up to be a mistake , because i still would have to buy another bottle of “ poeme ” and pay to reliable department store .
neutral	i would really appreciate any suggestion .
neutral	with my respect ,
neutral	julia fazekas .
neutral	usually i am more than satisfied with this company , however , this time i had to call about my rx even_though i had refills , confirmed at my initial call ., they called my vet , which i felt was unneccesary as i had refills on the meds i was re - ordering .
neutral	had a few problems paying over the phone but internet order worked well , the table arrived on time but there were no instructions for assembly which when we google searched and found a youtube clip discovered was a very complicated process .
neutral	perhaps it could be on their website to download as otherwise it could go very wrong .
neutral	however once assembled its a great pool_table .
neutral	i have been really pleased with the quality and range of products and the quick service to australia .
neutral	like another reviewer i have had some difficulty in differing sizes for products and recently had to return a $_00 cardigan which cost me $_00 to return !
neutral	it now makes my ' value for money ' cardigan a little expensive .
neutral	however , i am generally very happy with the products and customer_service .
neutral	this was a smooth_transaction but i wish this website , and many other retailing sites , would offer gift_wrapping .
neutral	how is someone to send a christmas , birthday or whatever kind of gift to someone_who_lives far away without being_able to have it wrapped ?
neutral	i would even be willing to pay a small charge for the service .
neutral	i had to have it sent to a friend who_lives near the recipient and ask her to giftwrap it for me .
neutral	0 .
neutral	failed to honor valid coupon
neutral	00_% coupon received from newark element00 via_e_- mail , " buy00e ", valid through april 0 , 0000 was not honored for order placed on march 00 , 0000 - 00 days before coupon would expire !
neutral	0 .
neutral	after order was placed , i received an e_- mail message_stating ,
neutral	" at this time we are unable to extend an open line of credit to you ."
neutral	the order was placed by me , as an individual , paid by credit_card - i never requested an open account .
neutral	0 .
neutral	the shipping_charges fro a small , $_00 lcd display amounted to nearly $_00 .
neutral	thankfully , there are mouser , arrow , digi - key and other_suppliers , including ti estore that stock the same items , at equal or better prices , that honor their coupons and that do not send out erroneous and inappropriate messages - they will get all of my future business - newark element00 will never receive another order from me - never !
neutral	i ordered led_lights from petflow -- great product and will be very helpful .
neutral	i probably_won_'_t be ordering again due to how long it took to have shipped .
neutral	i actually watched it travel across the country via fed_ex with the tracking_system until it got to my city , then it was put in the regular mail .
neutral	i was impressed with the fast service .
neutral	i received my order within 0 days .
neutral	the only issue is that the wipers i ordered would not fit the rear wiper on my 0000 subura forester .
neutral	i wasn_'_t completely surprised , since it has_been hard for me to locate refiils .
neutral	so rather_than complain , i just removed the rubber from your wiper and used it on my existing blade .
neutral	a little elbow grease goes a long way .
neutral	regardless of the wrong parts , i would still recommend your company .
neutral	have a great day !
neutral	april
neutral	fast service , good prices , but sent the wrong dog_food .
neutral	okay so i love the necklaces i purchased and have gotten a lot of compliments on them .
neutral	the slow_feeder , the most_important item i bought for my dogs was so poorly constructed that my dog destroyed immediately trying to get to her food .
neutral	the treat jar was very misleading in size and barely holds any of their favorite treats .
neutral	once received order , pleased with product
neutral	they upped the prices three_times within five_minutes of me trying to book my trip .
neutral	upped it by $_000 .
neutral	give me a break .
neutral	ok , but stop doing that , it seems like false_advertising and you get away with it because you know that people will just deal with it because they don_'_t want the hassle .
neutral	i ordered 0 items .
neutral	the smallest item ( dog collar ) was sent by fed_ex so i didn_'_t get it for a week .
neutral	i could understand this if it was coming by postal service but fed_ex .
neutral	probably would have gotten it faster if it did come by the postal service .
neutral	i am having_trouble reaching who i should reach , or anyone really , at full_spectrum solutions with a question .
neutral	the bulb i received did not help the full_spectrum solutions lamp that is not working .
neutral	there must be another problem .
neutral	i would like to have a reply to my email inquiry asking if there is anything they could suggest so my full_spectrum solutions lamp will be operational again .
neutral	this is the first time i have ordered from this company .
neutral	the prices appear to be pretty good , yet the shipping seems high .
neutral	i ordered 0 different items , all of which showed to be " in stock ".
neutral	it took several days for the first couple of items to arrive ( with a packing_slip , but i could not reconcile any of the part numbers to what i ordered ) then several days_later , i received a couple more items ( ditto on packing_slip and part numbers ).
neutral	today i received the rest of my order with no packing_slip ........ and yes it would have been nice to have a final invoice .
neutral	granted , i can tell what some of the items are and just hope they are what i ordered .
neutral	but some things like an upper and lower ball_joint ... i can '_t tell , especially_since none of the numbers on the boxes that contained them or if it had a packing_slip , match to anything i wrote_down when i ordered .
neutral	just hope my mechanic can tell and that i actually have the correct parts .
neutral	also , nowhere did i find a phone_number for this company , which worries me in case i need to return something .
neutral	not yet thrilled , but definitely worried .
neutral	my mechanic will be the final judge ...............
neutral	i ordered a particular product through this company and received the wrong product .
neutral	i called customer_service to report this and they said they would send me a return_label .
neutral	then i was instructed when i received the return_label , to send the package back and they would send me the item that i ordered .
neutral	i just recently received an_email_stating that my product had been shipped .
neutral	so i am still_waiting for my product to arrive .
neutral	so_far my rating of this company is not well due to the shipping error .
neutral	i still have not received the return_label to ship the wrong product sent to me back .
neutral	paid for fedex_ground shipping and received my part though the postal service over a week_later .
neutral	i won_'_t have placed the order if i had known that ahead of time .
neutral	tried to call several_times to find out information but never was able to get though to anyone .
neutral	not thegreatest ccustomer service i '_ve ever gotten .
neutral	still_waiting on a second order i placed it '_s taking over a week to get here too .
neutral	i was very pleased with the whole service , but dissapointed that the payment i received was nearly_£_00 less_than promised !
neutral	especially as my mobile was in immaculate_condition & only 0 years old !
neutral	the shipping time , product ordering and the actual product were fantastic .
neutral	the only issue i had was the sales_rep handling my order emailed me using the wrong name twice with two different names .
neutral	not very professional in my opinion and doesn_'_t make me feel_like a valued_customer when someone can '_t even look at the name on the signature line of the email to see who sent it .
neutral	he made up some excuse about seeing someone_else '_s name somewhere on the email which is not true at all considering all email were only between us .
neutral	good service after they sent me the wrong order .
neutral	was referred by my vet .
neutral	reduced price wasn_'_t far off from what is available on competitor '_s site .
neutral	customer_service was not great .
neutral	took over a month to get this common product despite calls and emails .
neutral	first they said they were unable to get authorization from vet .
neutral	but they never contact me !
neutral	then they claimed there was a delay getting the product from the manufacturer .
neutral	again , they never contacted me .
neutral	not sure i would go there again .
neutral	i am_currently trying new couriers and am disappointed that 0 out of 0 items arrived at their destination broken - i make work myself and pack it very well to avoid breakage as a small business it is vital that this does not happen as my profit is then lost .
neutral	is it not possible for a courier to take_care of parcels - is this not their job and what i am paying for !
neutral	for what we paid , seemed like we would have been able to pay for a nice quality room & casino on the strip with one of the bigger major hotel / casino .
neutral	was way over rated and we feel we paid more than what was worth .
neutral	good chance we would not be returning .
neutral	i have not received it , was easy to get but slow to came ... better come soon .
neutral	modtog uret dagen_efter det_var bestilt - dejligt .
neutral	men_det manglede de stifter der holder bagpladen på plads - irriterende .
neutral	da_jeg_ville ringe for at høre , om urkompagniet ville eftersende stifterne eller have uret retur , var_der_ikke opgivet telefonnummer på følgesedlerne - irriterende at skulle bruge tid på_nettet for at finde nummeret , hvorefter telefonen ikke bliver taget og man får at vide , at beskeder ikke bliver aflyttet , men man_skal sende en mail .
neutral	jeg_kan bedst lide at få tingene afgjort med_det samme og direkte kommunikation , derfor vil jeg i en sådan situation foretrække telefonsamtale frem for mail og sms .
neutral	positivt svar på mail dagen_efter - ingen_problemer .
neutral	dejligt .
neutral	en tur til på_posthuset - irriterende ( her kunne pakken have været sendt direkte til_min personlige adresse , hvilke jeg_ville have set som god service ).
neutral	derfor kan jeg_kun give 0_stjerner for " middel - acceptabel oplevelse dog med nogen irritation ", hvor hvis_jeg_havde modtaget et ur uden mangler , havde oplevelsen været til 0_stjerner .
neutral	disappointed in the color of the pool_cover .
neutral	looked more blue online .
neutral	the teal is green , not a blue .
neutral	not true to the picture .
neutral	too much_trouble return .
neutral	quility of prod .
neutral	was good packing was very poor got 0 headlights and one of them , 0 of the addjustment pins were broken off .
neutral	i reviewed my order , went back to make a change and then checked out thinking all was okay .
neutral	the order arrived and it was the wrong body color .
neutral	i knew i choose the correct one , so i looked at the order again and yep , it said the wrong color ( default color ).
neutral	apparently , when i went back to change something_else the body type and font went back to the set default .
neutral	expensive mistake that they will not correct -- as they filled it based on what i submitted .
neutral	this is my 0nd order from the .
neutral	0st order was perfect .
neutral	fast and convenient .
neutral	only_disappointment was that it did not clearly state that the full_amount would be immediately charged to my card .
neutral	had an_issue with my husbands name on his boarding_pass , travelocity couldnt fix it and after waiting on hold between travelocity and us_airways , the refused to fix it also .
neutral	their solution ?
neutral	buy another ticket if you want to be sure to get on the plane .
neutral	that didn_'_t happen .
neutral	showed_up at the airport , explained what happened and the very nice us_airways woman ( carol ) said no problem .
neutral	let_me help you with that .
neutral	looks like i will be booking thru the airline from now on .
neutral	so much for my vip status with travelocity .
neutral	not sure what those letters stand for but they dont help you out in a bind , even when its not your mistake .
neutral	after more than a decade , i '_m done !
neutral	shipping prices are way too high !
neutral	i thought it was a bowl but ended_up being a large bone with a suction cup on the bottom .
neutral	my dog removes it most times from his bowl even after it being stuck real good in a stainless_steel bowl .
neutral	it really didn_'_t show the product very well on the website hence the misunderstanding ..
neutral	well priced product , but would have appreciated an_email_informing us of delivery date , we had to leave a secure gate and oil_tank unpadlocked for several days and then the oil was delivered whilst we were away from the property .
neutral	in the past , we have received an_email the day before with the delivery details .
neutral	this was a pain free transaction and the items arrived in good time .
neutral	unfortunately i had to return an item due to poor fit ( i already have the same trousers and they feel and fit completely differently ).
neutral	it would have been nice for the returns_policy to include postage .
neutral	ended_up paing for cancellation cover and sms_confirmation which wouldn_'_t have booked should be asked officially online if want it rather_than it being a pre ticked option - watch out for this when booking
neutral	i ordered a swimsuit for my daughter which she loved ( maru sparkle ) however she needed a larger_size , unfortunately they don_'_t offer an exchange service .
neutral	you have to refund your original purchase ( which when paid for via_paypal you don_'_t get the full_amount back ?)
neutral	and then re order , paying postage again !
neutral	other_websites offer free exchange so this is an area for improvement .
neutral	i did receive my product , and yes it was what i expected .
neutral	however , i am rather disappointed in the customer_service .
neutral	i called them for 0 days straight prior to ordering but was never able to get through .
neutral	i ended_up sending an_email inquiry and finally heard back from someone via_email but with a vague response that really didn_'_t answer my question to help me decide which way to go with something i was purchasing .
neutral	and ... response came after i had ordered the part and hoped for the best .
neutral	i read other reviews saying product arrives quickly .
neutral	however , mine took over a week ( i think 0 or 0 days ?)
neutral	which is fine if that '_s what your expectations are .
neutral	i guess i assumed it would arrive quicker based on other feedback i was reading .
neutral	but yes the product was fine , and was in fact half the price it would '_ve cost me at the dealer .
neutral	i just placed my first order and am content with the prices .
neutral	i had been buying from a previous website that was very inexpensive but i had some mix up issues and figured it was about time to try a new company .
neutral	so i am hoping for no_issues with supplement_warehouse !
neutral	the website was hard work .
neutral	it kept deleting items from the basket .
neutral	however once completed the order was delivered as expected .
neutral	i was also given a 0 hour time_slot for delivery .
neutral	i can '_t find coupon_codes anywhere ?!
neutral	searched all over the web , could not find one for this particular site !
neutral	i did find plenty for other gift_card websites , which i will probably use next time .
neutral	( tomorrow )
neutral	the onesie has hardly been off my daughter since she received it .
neutral	quality looks quite nice but haven_'_t washed it yet .
neutral	i stopped purchasing suits from you because every time i order on - line , your staff sends the wrong_size , which_means i have to drive up to metro_swim in sterling to exchange it .
neutral	seriously ... this happened 0 out of 0 times , maybe more .
neutral	the money i saved purchasing on - line was spent on gas driving to the store to return it .
neutral	additionally , the store never seems to have my size in stock .
neutral	i need a longer torso suit and you never have them .
neutral	so now i order from swimoutlet . com .
neutral	less aggravation .
neutral	i love finding great deals on life '_s necessities .
neutral	you don_'_t want to be ripped_off on something that you must buy for your health , and his is a great site ... however the " processing_fee makes it a bit shady since no one can explain that fee .
neutral	the real truth is it '_s a way to recoup their losses on the contact_lenses - so it '_s not an honest deal or honest price .
neutral	website was good , but when started the booking process , the directions to the area would only be given after booking , since i looked at several areas , i was not sure which area i was booking for until i completed the online booking .
neutral	luckily , i did book the correct area .
neutral	the price was great , 0 / 0 as much from other_sites .
neutral	finanly did receive the right part .. until they get a customer_service number that works , i would avoid .
neutral	i know delivery is free but it is not next_day delivery as stated .
neutral	quality of the rug is what you expect or the price .
neutral	hello , all i would like you to know that .
neutral	amiclubwear is great .
neutral	the products they have are fashion forward with good prices .
neutral	only trouble i have is reaching someone by phone .
neutral	when i have questions_regarding my purchases being shipped .
neutral	overall nothing but positive_feedback .
neutral	i look_forward to shopping for fall .
neutral	i ordered amaryliis pots for many of my friends but as i went to visit them after christmas , i saw their little short stalks in dirt .
neutral	each friend apologized saying they were sure it was their fault that the plants hadn_'_t bloomed .
neutral	i just heard from the first friend that the plant had finally bloomed --- just before valentines_day .
neutral	they were sent the first week in december .
neutral	shrimp were very mushy and to soft no taste at all to them .
neutral	did not try the scallops yet , hope there better_than the shrimp ,
neutral	i ordered a stethoscope for my husband '_s birthday & also as a congratulatory gift for passing his paramedic boards ; the projected delivery date showed that it would arrive in plenty of time for his bday .
neutral	a few_days_later , i received an_email_saying the stethoscope was on backorder .
neutral	i tried numerous_times to reach the company by the phone_number listed in the email w_/ no success ; therefore , i resorted to email .
neutral	i asked when the projected date of shipment would be .
neutral	i received automated_responses but no answer to my question .
neutral	finally , after multiple_emails trying to get a real live response , i was directed to robert kaiser .
neutral	thanks to him , the stethoscope i ordered was finally personalized & shipped to me .
neutral	it did not arrive in time for my husband '_s birthday which was a big_disappointment , but so_far he is happy w_/ it .
neutral	after more than a week '_s worth of the poor customer_service i received , i doubt i will do_business w_/ this company again .
neutral	my daughter ordered a lovely black dress for a great price .
neutral	there was a promotion for free delivery that said 0 - 0 days ..... it took 0 days to arrive !!
neutral	!
neutral	i loved everything i ordered the only_thing i had a problem with is they left my package by my garage_door instead of putting it on my porch .
neutral	guess the delivery guy didn_'_t want to go up a few steps .
neutral	i love your product and pricing .
neutral	usually your shipping is acceptable although slower_than any other purchasing site out there .
neutral	lately , shipping is ridiculously slow ... even with the sandy aftermath .
neutral	i don_'_t understand_why my box stayed in one facility for over a week with no movement whatsoever !
neutral	i have ordered numerous items online since this package shipped and have received all of them by now ... except this order .
neutral	it has now been 0_weeks since you say it shipped , and i have not received it yet .
neutral	otherwise , i appreciate the service you offer and your obvious care for animals .
neutral	please find a way to speed up shipping .
neutral	i know you can ... everyone else is able to .
neutral	i ordered three dresses from ami and a bracelet in various sizes so i could determine which fit i liked best since i read so many negative statements about the fit of things .
neutral	i was so excited because i '_m going on a trip soon and i wanted a couple new outfits .
neutral	well , two of my dresses and my bracelet came but the other dress didnt , the order slip stated it was back ordered .
neutral	this made me mad to no end considering i didn_'_t get an_email_stating the item was back ordered and it doesn_'_t say it anywhere in my account and there was no expected date !!!
neutral	i don_'_t know if ill buy from them again .
neutral	i love their dresses but who_knows if you '_ll actually get what you ordered ...
neutral	fantast service from ordering to receiving .
neutral	every thing was sorted over the phone as we dont have a local_store .
neutral	a few_weeks after i was rung up and asked why i hadn_'_t made a payment ?
neutral	i explained i had set_up a direct_debit .
neutral	after i was asked in a round about way if i could_afford my bils i made a payment over the phone .
neutral	i was very upset by this .
neutral	the lady said no problem it was the person_who took my details hadn_'_t processed them properly .
neutral	she said i would receive a letter asking for a payment but to ignore it .
neutral	she never told me i would receive a letter saying if a payment wasn_'_t received legal_action would be taken .
neutral	this was very upsetting .
neutral	0of 0 of my cups were broke when they arrived due to the manner in which they were packed .
neutral	once the order was dispatched it arrived quickly , it took about a week for the items to be sent .
neutral	i have not received my free gift yet though .
neutral	haven_'_t used the product yet , but hope it is the real deal and not
neutral	watered_down .
neutral	price was similar to bookstore , was disappointed because one of my orders was cancelled because they didn_'_t have the book ... so i still had to go to the bookstore .
neutral	it takes far too long to get the food .
neutral	i run_out and have to go to the store to purchase food to last until i get my order .
neutral	:(
neutral	came on time , but they did not deliver the non_- magnetic screws for the magnets .
neutral	this made a lot of problems for me .
neutral	i think the products are extremely good quality but it does not end up being a good deal as the postage_charges make the item quite expensive if you only need one thing .
neutral	ik had stemmechaieken besteld met witte knoppen , maar_ik kreeg ze met parelmoeren knoppen geleverd .
neutral	het artikelnummer klopt wel , maar in de beschrijving en op_het plaatje staan duidelijk witte knoppen , dus_ik_vind_het slordig dat dan iets anders geleverd wordt .
neutral	het maakt me niet_zo ontzettend veel uit in dit geval , omdat de gitaar voor_de verkoop is bedoeld , maar ze moeten gewoon leveren wat besteld is .
neutral	we were not able to take our trip due to a sudden death in family . travelocity would not refund my airfare ... but delta airline gave_me credit .. then for hotel days inn would not give credit ... but travelocity gave_me the refund .
neutral	guess it depends on what was booked .
neutral	beautifull costume but slow shipping , , very slow .
neutral	took nearly 0_weeks for my cheque to arrive will not be using again , advert on tv says fast !
neutral	i don_'_t think so !
neutral	worth the time .. it '_s user .
neutral	friendly
neutral	the first problem i had is that fed_ex would not leave the shipment at my door even with a signature .
neutral	the frozen food was starting to thaw by the time i drove to fed_ex to pick it up .
neutral	very inconvenient .
neutral	i tried the oysters but i couldn_'_t finish them .
neutral	there was a very " fishy " smell and taste to them .
neutral	maybe i '_m just used to east_coast oysters
neutral	in the canned sampler i received , 0 of the cans were dented .
neutral	for the price i paid for my order , i would have expected better
neutral	insureandgo had the best options for the best value as far as i '_m concerned .
neutral	did my research and determined that the higher priced travel insurers didn_'_t offer anything better that insureandgo offered .
neutral	my only issue with insureandgo was the difficulty i had buying the two policies i need through the website , and then after calling to purchase over the phone , i again had problems accessing one of the policies through the website .
neutral	however , after some emailing back and fourth with my sales_rep , everything finally got straightened_out and is fine .
neutral	policy accessed and ready for our travel .
neutral	i hope i won_'_t need to use the coverage because i '_m a little_leery now .
neutral	first time traveling out of the country and i really didn_'_t need a hiccup like this .
neutral	too many drivers means less money and way too much downtime .
neutral	it '_s possible to work all weekend until 0am and not make minimum wage .
neutral	red_tour was good as the guide was very knowledgeable about london .
neutral	however , it only lasted 0 . 0 hours - so worked out very expensive .
neutral	blue tour was a very different experience .
neutral	no commentary , except for 0 area .
neutral	everything else was just music playing , or silence .
neutral	certainly not worth the month .
neutral	pros_:
neutral	- gets the job_done when i want to order takeout
neutral	- great coupons ( unlike_other_sites which shall not be named ) :-)
neutral	- relatively easy to use ( when not experiencing technical_issues , see below )
neutral	cons_:
neutral	- selection of restaurants is limited compared to competitor sites
neutral	- prices are not always consistent with restaurant '_s original menus or with competitor prices ( e . g .
neutral	$_00 entree on delivery is $_00 on competitor site )
neutral	- technical_issues : some browser incompatibility ; sometimes slow when adding / removing items and scrolling_through menus ; when clicking email links to redeem a coupon , the discount does not always apply ( takes repeated logging in / out or changing browsers to work correctly )
neutral	i think if something is out of stock you shouldn_'_t charge customer .
neutral	i was happy when i purchased a sewing_machine .. excellent .
neutral	.. and when i ordered accesories , so i '_m not too happy
neutral	during the booking phase the site did not say my visa would be charged , but once i put the card information into the system on the next page it states the card has_been charged with pre_- payment of room .
neutral	i would not have booked that far in advance had i known ahead this would happen !
neutral	the items i ordered were just what i wanted and reasonably_priced .
neutral	however , the advertisement of " free_shipping " is very misleading .
neutral	you have to pay to join a group and then you get " free_shipping " providing you are buying from any of their members .
neutral	i don_'_t want to be limited to certain companies when buying on line and only to get " free_shipping ".
neutral	of course you don_'_t know this information until you order / kinda ' like false_advertising .
neutral	deals are good , selection is the same as seamless but why send an_email to me with a donotreply address ?
neutral	thats silly .
neutral	if i cant reply , you shouldnt send it .
neutral	be accessible on all fronts .
neutral	unfortunately i booked tickets when the company had trouble with its computer system , which i know isn_'_t the companies fault .
neutral	due to the problem it ended_up that two lots of £_00 . 00 was charged to my barclaycard , which again i know is due to technical problems , but it has taken 0 phone_calls and 0 emails scince 00th_july and i still_haven_'_t had amount refunded !!
neutral	i have been assured that the amount will be refunded in the next 00 days .
neutral	i am sad this has happened as it is the first time we are bringing our children to london and it is a treat for my 00th_birthday and it hasn_'_t been quite as straight_forward as hoped !
neutral	!
neutral	the picture idea on the card was great but checking out was a headache .
neutral	great customer_service , but the wheel aligment made the steering worse ; this is the second time i got a wheel aligment there , i forgot the results , i will never go back ..
neutral	i ordered my mums mothers_day flowers on the friday before mother '_s day but unfortunately i received an_email on saturday_afternoon to say they didn_'_t have the flowers i ordered in the area .
neutral	they offered to upgrade the order and deliver on the monday which i felt was a suitable suggestion .
neutral	it wasn_'_t the end of the world but i would have appreciated an_email a little_bit earlier on saturday_morning or friday_afternoon which would have given sufficient time for a new order to be processed .
neutral	my order came complete and with correct items .
neutral	however , i had requested it to be shipped in a week and they sent it the next_day .
neutral	when we received our part it was broken , i am not happy that you could not just replace it , i had to spend another 000 . 00 to get another until you deem my refund doable .
neutral	i have to tell you , i am not happy about spending $_000 on 0 part .
neutral	the second part came in and thankfully was not broken , i trully do not know what i would have done if it was , i dont have the money for another $_000 .
neutral	your shipping is quick , and your prices are great , but you need to do an exchange , people just cant_afford to spend so much , thats_why we order from you .
neutral	the concept is great .
neutral	my e_- card was not received on my friends birthday but it was received two_days_later after two phone_calls .
neutral	love the gift_card options only_downfall was the communication .
neutral	i had no_clue if / when the card was processed and shipped out .
neutral	the website never updated showing any other status than processing .
neutral	system needs to update and email sent when status changes especially when it ships !!
neutral	!
neutral	yes the prices are a little high but the staff is knowledgeable on their products and they always offer to take large items to the car .
neutral	i '_m glad the gold card works every day now , that was a big improvement from the past .
neutral	their coupon specials are pretty good .
neutral	can '_t complain_about any thing except the time it takes for the purchase to arrive .
neutral	it took a full 00 days .
neutral	i was happy with the final_product , but i did have a concern regarding the final proof .
neutral	i did sent them an e_- mail with my concern , but never did hear back from them .
neutral	i didn_'_t know if the problem would have been corrected on their end until i received my water_bottle_labels in the mail .
neutral	the days inn in lebanon , missouri was a nice enough place to stop for the night .
neutral	the staff was friendly and helpful .
neutral	the room was relatively clean ; could have used a good detailing once over .
neutral	but the bed and bath were clean enough i used them without_hesitation .
neutral	the only disappointing thing was i reserved a non_- smoking_room and was given a smoking_room with cigarette holes in the bedspread and carpet along with an ashtray .
neutral	you would smell the stale smoke as an undertone to the air freshener housekeeping used .
neutral	even_though i have allergies and asthma we accepted the room because we were just that tired from traveling .
neutral	we would only occupy the room for nine hours or so .
neutral	given that , it is four days_later and i '_m still dealing_with repercussions of staying in the room with my allergies and asthma .
neutral	if asked if i would stay there again ; i would probably say yes with the provision that i was guaranteed a genuine non_- smoking_room .
neutral	i hit a snafu when trying to book my room .
neutral	when i was trying to decide which website offered a better deal on a room , i received an_email that should i booked now that i would get an_additional 0 %_off my room dates , so i accepted but could not get the code to enter onto my final billing .
neutral	so i called and the representative , who was nice , went through everything , including an_additional day that i decided i needed !
neutral	and the price changed and the 0 % i was to get was voided .
neutral	what the heck ?
neutral	i stilled booked the room but am not impressed because it was not my fault the website would not accept my discount and therefor it took longer to cash out .
neutral	i .
neutral	will mark this website off my possibility list hate next time i am looking for rooms ..... and we travel quite a bit .
neutral	delivery was very speedy kept 0 out of 0 items ; disappointed with the returns being very slow to process refund and e_- mail acknowledgement ; in comparison to other on line retailers .
neutral	suggestion - consider_using collect_+ service ; quick reruns and tracking_number much_better_than royal_mail which is unreliable .
neutral	after several deliveries and automatic withdrawls from our checking_account , i '_m starting to notice price increases on the pet_food .
neutral	i believe i should be notified about price increases .
neutral	the primary reason i was swayed to petflow was that their prices were so much lower_than both pet_food stores in our area , now , not so much .
neutral	you '_ll be lucky to get a small stipend for your books !
neutral	oh and they will reject your books for things like odors and then tell you that you need to send them money if you want to get these unacceptable books back .
neutral	it '_s been ok , but you really have to jump_through hoops to make any money back on the books they will accept - and they don_'_t accept many .
neutral	will be trying to find a new place to sell my books to now .
neutral	all cartridges bought were leaking ink and had i not worn gloves to unpack them , once i could see the ink leaking , things could have gotten very messy .
neutral	my printer does not recognise the cartridges because they are refilled hp but apart_from that they function well .
neutral	my package arrived in one piece .
neutral	all the items were well sealed and wrapped with plastic_bags and bubble_wrap .
neutral	however , the package was very hot as though it sat in the sun for a very long time .
neutral	the package was placed under my ove head so i know the sun didn_'_t get to it there .
neutral	i took in my delivery as soon as it was delivered becasue they knocked on my door when the package was arrived .
neutral	also , the braggs vinegar was wrapped very well .
neutral	however , there was a lot of leakage .
neutral	perhaps the seal over the cap could be replaced with a stronger and tighter one .
neutral	the label around the vinegar was all saturated and almost falling_off becasue of the leakage from the vinegar bottle .
neutral	other than those two things everything else arrived in good condition .
neutral	was not happy that card was not sent to recipient within 00_hours as it was a gift and was time sensitive .
neutral	i have bought a lot of nygard over the years and have always loved the uniqueness and affordability of their fashions .
neutral	i will admit though that i have become more and more dissappointed in the product .
neutral	the sizing seems to have changed ; for instance my old size 00 jackets fit like a charm and the new size 00 jackets are smaller .
neutral	the quality has changed , they do not withstand cleaning as well and there seems to be less seam finishing and the buttons and beads come off easier .
neutral	i hate to try on clothes that is one of the main resons i loved nygard , sizes were true and colors matched well .
neutral	sad to say , this is not the case anymore .
neutral	i have started buying elsewear .
neutral	unfortunately the item was damaged and as i could not find an_alternative in time , i had to sew the damaged area up myself .
neutral	other than that , delivery was quick , dress was very nice .
neutral	it says within 00_hours and then the box was not taped hardly at all and it was busted but thank_god the food was not pierced or injured .
neutral	needs more tape with 00_pounds plus of food .
neutral	but i will buy a gain and hopefully these issues especially taping the box stronger .
neutral	i rented an accounting book from them .
neutral	the service wasn_'_t bad , and it was delivered in a timely_manner .
neutral	however , they sent along two of the same books .
neutral	i haven_'_t contacted a customer_service person , but i will say now that if they expect me to pay for the shipping of this book that i didn_'_t order , i '_m going to be very upset .
neutral	great timing , but quality was poor .
neutral	i feel the most comfortable that i am getting the best help possible when kelly answers the phone .
neutral	the exception to that may be jeanette .
neutral	others just seem like they are just sitting there .
neutral	everyone is polite , helpfull and makes sure you are satified , but when you have a problem it takes a while to fix .
neutral	interest rates are to high i went lower i payment my car webt up in interest .
neutral	it should have went down .
neutral	staff is excellant in thier job .
neutral	i think cars could be better priced and i wonder_if they actually service the cars .
neutral	that is why so many cars are comming back with problems ? just saying !
neutral	i was concerned_about being left in the middle of no where .
neutral	i emailed the company an was assured_me that there was a drop_off point 0 minutes from my hotel , imagine my surprise when i was left on a street corner and directed to a near by subway station !
neutral	our entire tour was dropped_off at the first location the driver came to , cabs were not easily_accessible and i was not comfortable taking a subway , since i had no_clue where i was or needed to be !
neutral	this is not a good way to do_business or get return customers !
neutral	the overall tour was fine but the driver and guide laughed at inappropriate jokes the driver was making about mentally challenged people for most of the tour !
neutral	i am very disappointed in the outcome of this tour , especially_since i checked with you all prior to booking !
neutral	they need to reevaluate the way you treat people at do_business !
neutral	regular busses that made going around the city enjoyable .
neutral	for the amout of time we spent on the bus , it was expensive though .
neutral	( especially as we couldn_'_t use the 0nd day free offer ).
neutral	the live commentry was very good , but the pre_- recorded one was rubbish .
neutral	there needs to be more guidance regarding where the green_route stops near kings_cross , when all of the building works are going on .
neutral	bestilte 0 kjoler i størrelse 0 .
neutral	de to passede perfekt , men den sidste var alt for lille , den kunne_ikke komme over skuldrene eller op over numsen .
neutral	hvis_man_skal sende noget tilbage , skal man selv betale porto og forsikring , så_det_kan_ikke engang betale sig at sende den tilbage !
neutral	jeg kontaktede kundeservice med problemet , men de_har i dag mere end en_uge efter stadig ikke svarret .
neutral	men kvaliteten af stoffet er høj og syningerne er pænere end normalt for prisklassen .
neutral	the b vitamins all stuck together in the bottle as if they were melting .
neutral	the cotton ball stuck to the vitamins as well , so i had to pick the cotton off each vitamin .
neutral	after doing that for nearly_half the content , i just stopped and threw away the rest .
neutral	i always retrieve my mail from the mail box as soon as it is delivered so i know that the heat had nothing to do with the vitamins sticking together .
neutral	the staff was very nice and helpful .
neutral	the unit though at a decent price was shaped so oddly it would end up cutting storage ability , the doors don_'_t have an alarm_system , and the walls that separate the unit was made of warped plywoodso it would be easy for the neighboring unit to get to your storage .
neutral	they do have cameras on site and a security gate but overall i would rather store my belonging witha safer more efficient storage company
neutral	i was excited to hear about rep fitness here in longmont .
neutral	my issue is very specific to my personal needs , so it '_s not a reflection of your offerings as a whole .
neutral	i have purchased some pull - up bands from you and really love them .
neutral	i can see how you would be a great resource for cross fit boxes and pt studio .
neutral	my issue was this .
neutral	i train competitively in kettlebell sport and also use kettlebells at my studio , so thinking that i ' d be able to pick_up the bells locally made me very happy ( i '_ve been driving to golden or ordering online ).
neutral	i was disappointed with the selection though .
neutral	the kettlebells you sell are called competition bells , but without correct coloring , it '_s only the size that matches .
neutral	official kettlebell sport has a very standard color coding for bells and the bells that you sell don_'_t follow the code , which_means that i can '_t use them .
neutral	one example is your 0kg bell - i believe it '_s yellow - should be pink and yellow should be used for the 00kg bell .
neutral	not sure why the company decided to adopt their own color_scheme ?
neutral	giftcards . com is a user - friendly site that allows you to purchase and personalize a broad_range of gift_cards .
neutral	i have used them for service awards for our company .
neutral	fulfillment is prompt .
neutral	they won_'_t , however , allow you to personalize a card with your company name .
neutral	i can understand that they don_'_t allow copyrighted material but it would be nice if they could allow you to affirm or prove your rights to your own company '_s name .
neutral	when i asked customer_service why , i was told there was a " law " that didn_'_t allow three company names on a card .
neutral	odd that that would be a law about that , and my internet_search couldn_'_t prove it wither way .
neutral	perhaps it would be better that they told customers they had a hard - and - fast rule against all trademarked / copyrighted material rather_than just making stuff up in response to a customer .
neutral	customer_service is slow to answer e_- mailed queries ( mine have taken a week ), and even then the question is not answered .
neutral	the responses read like computer - generated answers triggered by a keyword .
neutral	so call , don_'_t write .
neutral	if your gift_card needs are straightforward , the site is very good .
neutral	but if you want to divert from the narrow path , you ' re in for some obstacles .
neutral	while the plant survived , i did not expect to have my mother have to shovel the dirt and the plant back into the container .
neutral	accidents_happen and the delivery person should have taken more care to check the final_product before ringing the doorbell .
neutral	everyone who contracts and pays for flowers / plants to be delivered , expects them to arrive in 000_% perfect_shape ... it is why we pay so much .
neutral	while i have happily ordered from serenata_flowers in the past and certainly will try them one more time , i must confess to great disappointment this time .
neutral	it seems to help a bit .
neutral	my son is 0 , and i '_m giving him the full dose .
neutral	not regular car renters , but active travellers , we rented a car in belgium that could have been easier - the ' downtown ' office was 0 km outside of town ( which we knew in advance ), and was under_construction so our cab driver had a hard time finding it .
neutral	we managed to get the car , but when we dropped_off , the office was closed ( during office hours ) so we were stranded 0km from the train_station with an irregular bus schedule and no way to call a cab .
neutral	pretty inconvenient , but at_least we made our plane .
neutral	would have been worth it to rent directly from the airport to avoid the incredible hassle of those 0km ...
neutral	savings are great but no customer_service phone_number to call and no printable receipt are a definite disadvantage to their customers .
neutral	i really dislike the fact i can only talk to a representative by sending a message online through their website and have to either wait to receive either an e_- mail or phone_call from them .
neutral	i thought a receipt would be included in the packages but no such luck .
neutral	it '_s kinda hard to prove your expenses to a tax preparer or the irs without printable proof .
neutral	this is something parts_geek needs to improve on .
neutral	another disadvantage is that they don_'_t ship anything on saturday especially if you ' re paying extra to have the order shipped next_day priority and then an e_- mail states that the order will be processed & shipped within 00 - 00_hours , defeats the purpose of next_day shipping .
neutral	the website doesn_'_t mention this until after you '_ve submitted your order online .
neutral	it should be explained where they explain your shipping options .
neutral	booked hotel for three_nights onlune , priceline charged me almost 000 . 00 .
neutral	when i got to the hotel , they ended_up charging me again , their price , 000 . 00 .
neutral	the hotel refunded me the double charge but apparently pricelines fees are pretty big .
neutral	almost a 00 . 00 difference in price .
neutral	seeing this by mistake will influence any decisions i may make to use priceline again .
neutral	easy way to find a room at the last min !
neutral	got your services referred by a friend and i really like it .
neutral	the only_thing i '_m have issues with is the fact that is impossible to talk to you guys .
neutral	no one answered the phone , the support_ticket do not work .
neutral	and its really important that i talk to you guys .
neutral	i need receipt .
neutral	i was very happy at how quick my order was delivered considering i live on an island but very very dissapointed with the quality .
neutral	the costume i had ordered was not up to costume standards i have had before ie .
neutral	neckline just cut with scissors not neatly .
neutral	i also ordered ' sexy ripped stockings ' and there was no rips , just 0 holes on one stocking along the lining that obviously weren_'_t meant to be there !
neutral	i would have rathered get a good quality costume than have it delivered quickly !
neutral	double_check the dates of your stay before you hit the final submit .
neutral	the dates i picked to reserve were different than the dates that appeared after i hit submit .
neutral	i am_currently trying to contact them to get this issue_resolved .
neutral	i am hopeful that they can adjust my date .
neutral	there is a no cancellation_policy .
neutral	i am not looking to cancel just change the date .
neutral	when i called auto_europe for help in booking my rental_car in italy , the customer_service rep was very helpful and friendly .
neutral	he patiently_answered questions and set_up the rental .
neutral	however , once we arrived at actual rental_car place that auto_europe set us up with called europcar , the one employee working was getting in his car and said " one minute ."
neutral	he then drove_away , leaving us standing outside in the cold with our_luggage and did not return for at_least twenty_minutes .
neutral	finally he returned .
neutral	he was impatient and in a hurry .
neutral	i asked for an explanation of the gps device we were renting which he had simply thrust in our direction .
neutral	there was no manual .
neutral	he said it was already programmed but when i turned it on , it had not been programmed .
neutral	we asked for a map .
neutral	they had none .
neutral	another man walked in while he was helping_us and he rushed us through our check - in so he could go chat with this man .
neutral	he did not allow us time to look over the car to make_sure there was no prexisting damage .
neutral	generally , the service was very bad and i will not be using europcar again .
neutral	i ordered some t - shirts a while ago and when i ordered them i ordered 0 items - i only recieved one at a time - i only ordered the amount i did because of the delivery cost and it would have been better value for money .
neutral	as only 0 t - shirt came i was extrememly disappointed , i then placed the order for 0 again and again only one came .
neutral	this was very annoying considering the amount i spent on the delivery charge .
neutral	the kitty_litter was great .
neutral	although it is the same i can buy locally , having it delivered is a help .
neutral	the 0 00 # boxes came in 0 cardboard_boxes .
neutral	that is , each cardboard_box had 0 00 # boxes of litter .
neutral	of the 0 00 # boxes , 0 were broken .
neutral	one was heavily damaged .
neutral	the 0 leaked litter .
neutral	fortunately , the leaked litter mostly went into the cardboard_box .
neutral	one didn_'_t .
neutral	that is , i couldn_'_t control the spill .
neutral	the cardboard_boxes had some packaging material .
neutral	it didn_'_t seem to help --- wasn_'_t enuf or wasn_'_t the correct packing_material for this heavy item .
neutral	i am asian ( 0 ' 0 "), but with a little more meat on my bones than the typical asian ( 000_lbs ).
neutral	i '_m hoping that the clothing i purchased does fit and that the sizes stated on the website are true .
neutral	i '_ll write another review when i actually receive my clothing ....
neutral	i made my first purchase on oct . 00 , and it still says that they are " waiting for stock ".
neutral	if you don_'_t have it in stock , you shouldn_'_t be offering on the website or say something before i purchased my items .
neutral	i '_m still rating it 0_stars because i like their wide_variety on the website .
neutral	i will come_back and rate again once i have my clothes .
neutral	little disappointed to hear nothing from them !!!!!
neutral	promised to dispatch on two occasions but as of today not received any information when i will get my new laptop as of today 00 / 00 / 0000 which is one week today
neutral	the bed was clean and comfy , ut everything else needed lysol wipes !
neutral	!
neutral	i have ordered colored contacts in hazel from expressions colour , but it turned_out to be orange - yellowish , very ugly and unnatural .
neutral	and it is too thick .
neutral	i will not recommend it to anyone
neutral	shopping_experience was great - efficient delivery .
neutral	only problem i had ( as someone_who is not particularly adept at diy ) is that i found the instructions difficult to follow and still_haven_'_t worked out how to insert the flat bar which was included in the kit .
neutral	otherwise all good .
neutral	we love the furniture .
neutral	the three delivery_men came 0 hours late .
neutral	they promptly got the delivery truck stuck in the snow in our front yard .
neutral	two of the three could not speak_english .
neutral	my husband and stepson had to figure_out how to get the truck unstuck as the three men had no_idea what to do .
neutral	then they did not know how to carry the new sofa through the front_door .
neutral	they said the door was too small but it is a standard size door .
neutral	my stepson had to measure the sofa and show them how to tilt the cushions so that it would come through the door .
neutral	we suggest that you provide better training for your delivery personnel in how to handle both equipment and deliveries .
neutral	been down pretty ill .
neutral	thought the gift_cards be the best .
neutral	got everyone done except for two of my granchildren .
neutral	system would not accept their last name !
neutral	very frustrating !
neutral	after a speedy_delivery ( thanks ), my son was ecstatic to receive his superhero costume .
neutral	he is 0 but i went for the bigger_size to be safe .
neutral	( 0 - 0 ) it just fits my normal sized 0 year_old .
neutral	i wish i had known and ordered the next size up .
neutral	after 0 wearings , the seams have completely come undone around the waist and i hand sewed them .
neutral	i didn_'_t expect great quality , but was surprised it fell_apart so soon .
neutral	booking with travelocity is easy , and convenient .
neutral	however , when the airline cancelled 0000 flights , getting through to travelocity to make schedule adjustments was hell .
neutral	at_least 0 phone_calls with a 0 . 0hr wait or longer , and as i was being " transferred " to a supervisor , my call was disconnected , and i had to start over on hold .
neutral	the promise of : " we '_ll call you right back if disconnected " is a load of crap .
neutral	i originally ordered 0 cases of cat_food and 0 dog_treats .
neutral	if i doubled my order there was a deal , so i did , however the two superior farms lamb whistlers dog chews never made it in my box when shipped .
neutral	i am in the middle of moving from one apartment to another , so i can '_t find the invoice to call customer_service .
neutral	it is my hope that these can be shipped out to me soon , or refunded .
neutral	thank_you ,
neutral	jennifer figliozzi
neutral	i booked for one person , when confirmation arrived it billed for two ?
neutral	i ordered the the tuner as a birthday_gift , but it didn_'_t make it in time !
neutral	a little_disappointing as it was supposed to be first_class delivery !
neutral	i booked a flight with ryanair through you .
neutral	when i came to the aiirport , rygge , norway , i had not understood that i had to print out the ticket ( not necessary when i go with other_companies as sas and norwegian , they have ticketboxes at the irport .)
neutral	before i came there .
neutral	result : i was charged for 00_euro !
neutral	so very important that you make passengers who book ryanair through you aware of this special conditions .
neutral	they have a lot of other unreasonable provisions as well - so please tell your costumers !
neutral	i will never recommend rebtel to a friend because it is too expensive to call with although i like the convenience of having the minutes there to call in case of an_emergency .... definitely not intended for a long chat .
neutral	great looking product - all the pumps i bought seem to be high_quality , but the boots i bought seem to be cheaply_made .
neutral	i received my product in a timely_fashion , but i used a coupon for free_shipping and i was still charged the shipping .
neutral	i ordered 0 collar_lights for my dogs , and when i received them , one didn_'_t work at all and the other only lasted less_than an_hour .
neutral	i have sent two emails and haven_'_t heard from them .
neutral	i guess you get what you pay for .
neutral	the shipping was more than the product i ordered .
neutral	the actual storage_facility was fine , no_complaints .
neutral	we rented an a /_c unit , very important in az , and it was on the first floor , also convenient .
neutral	i originally had reserved a larger unit , then decided i could get by with a slightly smaller one , which resulted in less monthly rent .
neutral	i had a $ 0 .
neutral	special for the first month on the first unit , when i changed , i was told i couldn_'_t have the " special " on the unit i selected .
neutral	i asked to speak to a supervisor on the phone , was told i would receive a return phone_call from one within 00_hours .
neutral	that never happened , i called the customer_service center once again , was promised again , and again , no return call .
neutral	finally a month or so later , i called the local district_manager , and explained the situation .
neutral	in good faith , and to provide excellent customer_service , i really felt it only fair that i receive the $ 0 .
neutral	special for a month .
neutral	a large company like yours would have benefited greatly by that act of kindness as i would have told everyone about my fine experience .
neutral	the dm promised she would look into it and while she couldn_'_t promise anything , she would surely follow_up and call me back .
neutral	i provided two phone numbers , plus an_email address .
neutral	nothing , never_heard back from her or anyone !
neutral	i had thought i ' d be renting from you for a lot longer , but due to this experience , vacated after 0 months .
neutral	it would have been nice to post an excellent review , sorry , but i wasn_'_t happy with the service i received .
neutral	all due to you ' re not honoring an advertised special .
neutral	yes , it did say " special on selected units ", had i been the one in charge , in the interest of good service and a happy customer , i would have " done the right thing ", you did not , in my humble opinions .
neutral	nice system nice systemnice systemnice systemnice systemnice systemnice systemnice systemnice systemnice system
neutral	this bus company did a good tour , but they didnt run late in the day & you would struggle to get a bus after 0 . 00 ... not great really as had a 0 day tour & spent more on the underground & usual bus service as stops had been closed due to roads ( no email to notify us ) & the tour finishes very early on ..
neutral	my parts look great .
neutral	the box had someone_else '_s reciept in it .
neutral	the numbers on the parts box did not match the numbers on the website that i ordered .
neutral	so i guess they are the correct parts .
neutral	i will find out this weekend .
neutral	the package we were offered was a great deal .
neutral	we are however less_than satisfied with the customer_service of at & t .
neutral	i called to set_up service and told everything was good to go .
neutral	i then however called to change a setup time a few_days_later and was told that they have no record of my account .
neutral	after the second time setting_up my install date and package i was called a third time by at & t telling_me that the install had not been officially set_up .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	we have also called the guy_who came out to install our cable and internet a couple times with some questions and have recieved no answer or returned calls .
neutral	instructions as to where to meet our pickup driver very unclear .
neutral	couldn_'_t hear due to noise of traffic and accent of operative .
neutral	instructions differed as to instructions on email .
neutral	all the building works at_gatwick complicated the issue as well .
neutral	return instructions were slightly better but not much .
neutral	the order process is fine but my delivery arrived and one of my bottles of old monk was smashed during delivery by royal_mail .
neutral	i was unabe to contact customer_support last_week .
neutral	i have ordered old monk before and they was no_problems
neutral	i have used newark_long_term_parking many_times , have been happy with their service , and always recommend them .
neutral	normally you arrive , check in , and they load your bags in the van and whisk you off to your terminal .
neutral	this time however , the wait time at the lot to be dropped_off at the terminal was unusually long .
neutral	we sat in the van waiting for other passengers which was not done in the past .
neutral	the van had looped back around with passengers onboard to pick us up causing them to wait , and then we sat waiting for others .
neutral	it seems they need more vans or drivers to accommodate their customers in a timely_manner .
neutral	there were no_issues with the pick - up on our return , however , the gentleman checking us out inside was not very courteous .
neutral	make_sure you give yourself ample time in case you have to wait .
neutral	meal was just okay average nothing special .
neutral	i have had much_better .
neutral	i waited about one hour for delivery , so not good .
neutral	one i could not get my delivery same day which an_email was sent but a call would have been better .
neutral	an upgrade was offer but did not specify what the upgrade will be si i asked for a vase .
neutral	then i am given a different bunch of flowers nothing like i ordered and told extra flowers had been added which is the upgrade , for all o know that bunch has the original value of my order .
neutral	my order was shipped the same day i placed it .
neutral	i had to return it ; the process was quick and painless .
neutral	however , i was disappointed to find that the costume i had ordered was similar to one i could find in a halloween store : cheap , baggish , unpolished .
neutral	still , it fit my needs and the company performed beautifully .
neutral	i didn_'_t like that when you try to pull up to unload .
neutral	you are at the mercy of the person there before you .
neutral	if they don_'_t pull up and out of the way it effects you .
neutral	if they hog all the carts it takes you longer and more physical energy .
neutral	the sheer number of options can sometimes be overwhelming but it is nice to have such a variety .
neutral	sizing can be limited , unfortunately .
neutral	wish there could be a review system implemented so users can review items they have already purchased for others to see .
neutral	i did call and ask one question before i ordered online and the sales_person was more interested in getting a commission and kept babbling on about it .
neutral	i also thought the material on the futon was pretty thin .
neutral	it feels_like a table cloth from target .
neutral	i would say it was worth 000 . 00 not 000 . 00 .
neutral	other than that everything was fine .
neutral	the only issue i had was placing a request for the bed type .
neutral	priceline '_s receipt said contact the hotel , the hotel said only priceline can make that request , so i called priceline customer_service .
neutral	i was on hold for a very long time and then told that they spoke with the hotel and put the request in ; however , it could not be guaranteed .
neutral	when i checked in , there was no note about the bed request and was given a different bed type .
neutral	when i then requested to change to what i originally wanted , the hotel was able to accommodate with the last room available and was a handicap_accessible room so there was no tub .
neutral	i would much rather have preferred that priceline had actually sorted this out as they said they had .
neutral	however , the price savings definitely make priceline worth it !
neutral	hi i was pleased with reservation agent only wished she would have told me if there was a senior discount like aaarp ?
neutral	that would have helped_me a lot .
neutral	the book arrived in the condition as_described .
neutral	however , it arrived late and my daughter had to start class without her book .
neutral	maybe the delivery options should be reviewed or the courier should be re - evaluated ?
neutral	otherwise , we were happy with our rental .
neutral	edit after company response : the book was ordered on 00 / 0 / 00 .
neutral	ten days would have been 00 / 00 .
neutral	the book was not delivered to me until 00 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	so , no , it was not delivered timely .
neutral	we would try ordering from bookbyte again , but only because we want to support buying local .
neutral	it '_s our first experience , so we won_'_t assume this will happen again .
neutral	however , it was a bummer to go through the process of ordering twice and then have to order from amazon after all .
neutral	i have used yesstyle several_times already , and was not happy with at_least 0 item in my order .
neutral	for the last few_times , the items for for myself , so i was okay with returning them and accepted the store credit .
neutral	but for the last order , the items were meant for gifts , and they came ripped .
neutral	so , i had to return them with my own shipping cost , and had to accept a refund as store credit only , given that it is their fault that the items for defective .
neutral	they claimed that the return could only be issued as store credit , instead of a refund of " fund " so i could use the fund to buy the gifts elsewhere .
neutral	this is no way a good policy these days because there are many reasons behind the choice of not keeping an item , not to mention that we have to pay the return shipping cost .
neutral	i would be very very reluctant to shop_here again as the business philosophy here is to force you to keep the items , shop with them again with the store credit even at times when you don_'_t need any .
neutral	this is a failing policy , yesstyle .
neutral	i would not recommend you for this reason .
neutral	on top of that , i could not reach their customer_services after calling many_times during their stated business hours .
neutral	anyhow , after this , no more .
neutral	i was pleased to find the pushchair i ' d been looking for at an extremely competitive price so gleefully ordered it ( on fri ) with next_day delivery .
neutral	however next working day came and almost went with no sign of pushchair or any communication other than an_email_saying the item had been sent for dispatch that day .
neutral	they called after 0pm on mon to say there were no items left in the colour i ' d ordered - as their stock_levels do not update on the website over a weekend !
neutral	they had an intense red instead of a jet black which i decided to accept as i was desperate for this pushchair ( stuck in house with tiny baby going crazy ) but was really cross as i ' d just purchased the car_seat to match the black version from a different site .
neutral	so they did provide me the item and fairly quickly but it didn_'_t arrive until the wed ( too late for an outing i had planned ) and it was the wrong_colour .
neutral	so i ' d say they were ok , but recommend not ordering on - line at a weekend .
neutral	we stayed here to attend a local wedding .
neutral	room was clean , nothing fancy but certainly adequate .
neutral	personnel accommodating .
neutral	i have used pet_flow for a while .
neutral	i liked it , but the prices changed with a lot of the scheduled shipped food , and they were out of the dog_biscuits a lot .
neutral	i am on a budget so when the prices changed on my shipment , it was a short_notice .
neutral	that '_s the reason i stopped the scheduled_shipments .
neutral	but the customer_service is awesome !
neutral	!
neutral	i sent in an nokia lumia 000 and the cheque come in the wrong name as i did not notice and could not cash it so i rang them up and have them my bank_details and 0 days_later i still know nothing about what '_s going on the service is not as good as it first was and i always traded with them now i am thinking of not bothering any more .
neutral	the hook on the necklace i ordered was damaged .
neutral	i cannot unhook the necklace .
neutral	and the order necklace was n bent , due to way it was shipped .
neutral	i will have to take the necklaces to the near by goldsmith to fix with more money .
neutral	took too long for mm to receive items and send money
neutral	the cost was ok .
neutral	the shipment was good .
neutral	the condition of the book is utterly disgusting .
neutral	the last 000 or so pages have a gross black liquid on them .
neutral	very disappointed in the quality !
neutral	advertised on the website , it tells you there is free next delivery however once you order they then tell you that this may not be the case dependent on the courier , in which case why not just put free delivery on the website ?
neutral	i ordered on a saturday expecting it to be delivered on the tues due to the weekend order .
neutral	the first of 0 boxes were delivered on the wednesday , on the thursday they attempted to deliver the second box but as i had expected it to arrive on the tuesday i wasn_'_t in to receive it .
neutral	the driver did call me ( as i had left my mobile on a note in case i was nearby ) but i was unable to take the call , when i did speak to him later on he informed me that it would probably be redelivered the next_day , he failed to mention the fact that on leaving he had driven into and knocked down the wall in the carpark where i live , common courtesy you would think .
neutral	the final box was eventually delivered at 0 . 00pm on friday , after talking to the courier company they had assured_me the driver would call me 00_minutes before he arrived in case i was out .
neutral	he didn_'_t call and just turned_up by which time i had almost given up .
neutral	if i '_m honest , i wouldn_'_t use this company again or recommend them as feel a bit cheated as the deciding_factor for me was the convenience of next_day delivery , and there are other_companies out there making the same thing at a similar price .
neutral	it took 00 days for the good to arrive .
neutral	on the 00th day i rang garden best_buys who tracked the order to say it had left them 0 working days previously but would be delivered on that day .
neutral	we asked what would happen if we were out and was told to put a note on the door .
neutral	clearly the delivery drivers can '_t read - the two heavy packages were delivered next door and we then had to carry them round in the rain .
neutral	not a good service !
neutral	you get what you pay for i found the clothing material was very very thin .
neutral	the shoes were good quality and a very good price
neutral	we have previously had good service albeit often issues with recognising debit_card nonetheless , no_issues .
neutral	this time items arrived no labelling - this contravenes cossh regulations and other items ordered shown on site as in stock wr = ere out of stock .
neutral	but unfortunately , not the second .
neutral	if there is a backorder of a product , they need to notify you right_away .
neutral	it had already been over a week when i finally called and i was told that there was a back order .
neutral	i like the prices and even_though shipping is a lot , i will give it one more try .....
neutral	they sent my package to the wrong_address then calling and emailing the customer_service they didnt respond back until 0 days_later .
neutral	my purchase was a birthday_present which was delayed getting because of the lack of customer_service .
neutral	great website when it comes to prices but stay on hold too long .
neutral	ordered shoes 0_weeks_ago expected them within a week , still not received them !!!!!
neutral	wouldn_'_t mind if i was kept_informed but i '_ve had to phone to be to , d there is a supplier problem !!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	black_circles were great .
neutral	attention was paid to my order and i was contacted to ensure i had ordered the correct tyres .
neutral	would definitely use again however the tyres fitting place i chose to use from their selected list was a disappointment .
neutral	my once clean alloys came out filthy and covered in gunk , and underneath the mess was a couple of small marks that were not there before .
neutral	will look to go somewhere_else next time .
neutral	nice looking jacket , button fell_off right out of the bag , very small fit and cost me a small_fortune to ship it back to the uk from the us .
neutral	not even sure i '_ll get a refund .
neutral	disappointed .
neutral	my order wasn_'_t right .
neutral	i ordered three different things and i was sent the wrong vitamins .
neutral	in all fairness it could have been my mistake .
neutral	but still have to say 0_stars .
neutral	collection was made difficult for driver due to parcelheros not sending email to collection person , so no paperwork or labels and tracking_numbers etc for driver who then had to make a second visit to collection address and several phone_calls to hq and myself .
neutral	great prices but some of the treats were really small
neutral	took a month to get what i ordered .
neutral	no phone_number or address to get a hold of .
neutral	hope the products are for real .
neutral	die unterlagen zum stern waren sehr_gut aber leider dauerte die lieferzeit sehr lange .
neutral	so das der stern als geburtstagsgeschenk erst einen tag nach dem geburtstag ankam .
neutral	das_ist_sehr sehr schlecht !
neutral	darüber war_ich sehr enttäuscht und meine tochter traurig !
neutral	pro : excellent food choices , and the best prices i '_ve been able to find so_far .
neutral	also , we usually receive the food within 0 days .
neutral	con : their coupons never work .
neutral	when i contact customer_service , they tell me about some kind of restriction / requirement that isn_'_t listed on the coupon .
neutral	when i had auto - delivery , there was no email to remind_me that the order was being charged and shipped - even_though the site says you '_ll receive a reminder a week before it '_s filled .
neutral	and one time when i selected the option to have the order ship in 0 week , it shipped the next_day and arrived while we were out of town .
neutral	since they offer the best value , we keep ordering from petflow and i do recommend them to friends .
neutral	i just cross my fingers and hope there '_s no_problems .
neutral	i ordered by mail because i am elderly and have trouble carrying a large_bag of dogfood .
neutral	i needed fed_ex to bring the food to my apartment .
neutral	they left it in the office with no notice on my apt door and i had to carry it anyway .
neutral	is there anyway to get fed_ex to call me to let_me know what time they will deliver to my door ?
neutral	if not , i might as well go to petsmart .
neutral	have not received my order .
neutral	lenses were on back order .
neutral	i was advised after i placed my order .
neutral	glad for at der findes en butik med smart tøj til_dem der endnu ikke kan passe voksentøj men gerne vil være smarte :) nem_og_hurtig_levering , alt tøjet passede jvf .
neutral	målskemaerne - bortset fra cost - bart - bukser :)
neutral	eneste brok vedrører ombytningen af bukserne : det_er ok at tage et mindre gebyr for levering - selvom det godt kunne være lavere en 00 kr .
neutral	men returnering skal man også selv betale ( 00 ,-) samt betale levering endnu en gang ( 00 ,-) selvom det_er bare er til_en_anden str .
neutral	vi valgte kun at returnere de bukser der_var for små i stedet for at genbestille dem i en_anden str .
neutral	da vi ikke ville betale fragten og risikere , at den nye str .
neutral	heller_ikke passede og_så skulle betalen endnu en gang .
neutral	mit råd til butikken : sænk leveringsgebyret og gør retur til anden vare gratis - ellers fravælger folk at få_en_anden vare - og i mister den ordre .
neutral	competitive_prices and a good selection of products on their site .
neutral	however , i ordered tape which was described as being in stock and when the box of products arrived it was not there .
neutral	i rang hunt_office only to find out that it wouldn_'_t be in stock until the following week .
neutral	i don_'_t think it should have been listed as being in stock when it wasn_'_t .
neutral	it affected what was otherwise a prompt service .
neutral	dear big_bus staff ,
neutral	we had 00 - hour tickets and on the whole it was ok but for the daunting challenge we had trying to catch a bus and chasing your busses around the city as it was a really hard job to investigate where the bus_stop was .
neutral	the best experience was your city walking_tour which we really loved .
neutral	we would like to thank samantha for the tour .
neutral	self opinionated jobs worth .
neutral	the female on the desk on saturday 00th_april at about 0 o ' clock obviously didn_'_t want to be there .
neutral	she was prickly and obnoxious .
neutral	knowing we were in a hurry did her level best to stretch out every_stage of the car_hire .
neutral	i always use argus , as you can check , and usually get friendly , helpful staff .
neutral	what happened to toudor ?
neutral	i don_'_t know if the spelling is correct .
neutral	carole costin
neutral	i ordered two items , one was brilliant , the other i needed a refund .
neutral	it said you could return to a store for a credit note , which was ok .
neutral	went all the way to derby to be told they were a franchise so i couldnt return .
neutral	it didnt say on the returns note no franchise stores .
neutral	i ve now returned via recorded delivery , and hoping for a refund soon .
neutral	a shame because a store return should be as standard these days .
neutral	i wont order online again unless i know im going to keep the goods , too much hassle !
neutral	we were so excited to find giftcards . com and we were working on a large gift_card order for staff in my husband '_s office .
neutral	he owns his own business and we were so excited to create a card with his logo on the card .
neutral	we went through at_least an_hour of the process of creating these multiple large value cards .
neutral	we placed our order only to have it cancelled in large font just like this .
neutral	it was just devastating to go through all of this work and this entire_process to then learn that business logos are not allowed on your gift_cards !
neutral	i wish we would have known this .
neutral	it does make_sense !
neutral	but ... still ... we went through a very lengthy process to create these cards that we knew would be appreciated .
neutral	in the end , we did not create a new card ... we simply went to the bank and asked for many crisp 000 $ bills .
neutral	we were so frustrated that this seemed like an easier option !
neutral	thank_you for listening .
neutral	i do wish we would have understood this ' rule ' prior to our efforts !
neutral	the products were fine and as_described but the delivery charge was £ 0 on items which cost £ 0 and were very light .
neutral	when i called up to ask if their was a cheaper postage option other than next_day delivery they said there wasn_'_t .
neutral	this is something they could definitely improve on .
neutral	i ordered 0 bottles of algaecide and 0 bottles of metal out 0_weeks_ago ( we are on well water and have to use the metal out each year or we have staining on our white steps ).
neutral	the company sent 0 bottles of clarifier instead or metal out and i immediately called them about the mistake .
neutral	they sent me thru e_- mail a return_label for fedex to send the wrong chemicals back ( this was on a friday ) the next week i drove 00_miles to the nearest fedex hub and sent the chemicals back and it is now 0 days_later and i have still not received my correct order .
neutral	the first order was received next_day as stated online , but when the company made a mistake , the same doesn_'_t apply .
neutral	very disappointed in the customer_service this time .
neutral	i have used them previously but not so sure i '_ll use them again
neutral	day before receiving this review , bought digital network card but cannot retrieve the code because unable to access a /_c .
neutral	continually getting message ' please enter valid email ' but email is valid .
neutral	sent several emails to pc_game supply support for days but as yet no reply .
neutral	would like a response asap .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	i was very pleased overall with my shopping_experience and the turnaround time between placing my order and delivery to the usa was quite quick .
neutral	however , i was very disappointed when the package arrived as it was beaten and battered very badly and there were gaping holes in the sides of the box .
neutral	your delivery company has let you down badly and given how much shipping_costs from the uk i '_m not sure that i would use your service again because of this .
neutral	partsgeek quickly processed my order and frequently sent emails on the progress of the processing and the shipping .
neutral	i received the parts faster_than they even promised .
neutral	the product itself was non_- usable .
neutral	one part of it , which was a kind of sleeve that was supposed to slip over another , had been re - inforced with a metal sleeve inside the plastic one ( which was good ) and did not fit over the other because just the little_bit of space the metal sleeve took up made it impossible to put on .
neutral	and , it would not come out so that i could use it without the metal .
neutral	so , money wasted .
neutral	however i would use this company again because i feel that overall they are trustworthy and probably most parts work .
neutral	pleased with items ordered , 0 sizes of paper bags , and a few reels of ribbon .
neutral	disappointed with the packaging , there was nothing to protect the bundles of paper bags ( 00 of each size ) and they were inside an extra large plastic_bag , so everything had moved around , a few were a bit crumpled and crushed , but not enough to make me bother to send them back .
neutral	communication from order to delivery is good .
neutral	customer_service not good at this site .
neutral	only buy when no better choice
neutral	for particular products .
neutral	good selection but , higher_than average prices .
neutral	i really miss being_able to print a stack of envelopes at one time since the system changed we are unable to do that .
neutral	we are using in an office setting and it has cost us more time and money .
neutral	we now need to purchase stamps and then stick them to each envelope .
neutral	let_me know if there is a way to print multiple envelopes that i just missed .
neutral	its probably early days yet but i felt i needed a few_weeks to say how it has affected my weight_loss , it has_been a week only some of the food i did not like taste a bit plasticky , the ones i did like were currys , sweet and sour , chicken fricasse , as i could pad them out with 00g basmatic rice , the lasagne was topped with an orangey cheese not tasty at all , the soups varied some were thick consistantcy like sweet_potato very tasty others like chicken an thyme very watery but i added a slice wholemeal bread every day , the granola was nice but rather_than have it with skimmed milk i had a tablespoon of fat free greek yoghurt and berries blueberries or frozen berries , i added lots fresh veg as all food long life and i felt the fruit n veg a must . the bars were nice similar to special k bars . i just felt that getting an_email 0 days into the diet saying that my next hamper was being prepared the next week was too early for me to agree to it as 000pds is a lot of money i would of had to cancel within the next week to stop it going out ... however now i have cancelled the next hamper , when it comes near the end of the month i can decide_whether to reorder or do it alone by buying a box of granola myself and weighing out 00 grammes per day , special k cereal bars , low_fat soups , and count on us , or fuller longer meals , which add up to same calorie and fat content , so i guess if you can take time shop and work it all out theres more choice of tastier food , if youre lazy no time and just want everything weighed for you then go for it ... i def lost weight but after a week would like to see whta the whole 00 days does before i comment .. i did stick to 0000 calories a day .
neutral	i have always bought team posters of manchester city football club from gb_posters around october time .
neutral	i e_- mailed in december as no team posters on the website .
neutral	i had a reply saying nothing to do with gb but have to wait_till city approve posters .
neutral	eventually in january the maxi size poster was available to buy but no sign of mini poster size .
neutral	i e_- mailed 0 times to see if mini version would be on website so i could purchase both sizes in one delivery .
neutral	no response so i ordered big posters .
neutral	i then finally got a reply to say down to city again altho the poster is the same picture .
neutral	the mini version is now on website and i have bought them and paid more delivery costs .
neutral	made to feel when finally got a response that i was a nuisance .
neutral	not too impressed with the customer_service side of the website !!
neutral	!
neutral	i think that it can be changed to be a bit faster and less drawn out .
neutral	it should be more blunt and straight to the point i feel_like i was filling stuff out for 0 days straight .
neutral	also all of the fine_print should be made bigger , noone is going to look at all of that tinny little writing ... with that being said , it was helpful , i got to pay my bill on time .
neutral	only problem now is paying back with such high intereest .
neutral	the print quality is nice , but it is really more a piece of fabric than a blanket .
neutral	for something promoted as a baby blanket , i was hoping for something a bit more inviting .
neutral	curious to see how it holds up .
neutral	bought a lot from cotswold , always good products .
neutral	having read all the delivery options i decided not to go for any of the extras so chose a saturday delivery and they added £ 0 . 00 cost to the total for my delivery which i think is not transparent enough when booking and not right .
neutral	your site allows your members to see what steps they should take to improve their credit .
neutral	i have taken several of those steps , but you haven_'_t updated the credit_report information available to me , so i can not see if any of these steps have worked .
neutral	if they have , the info you are providing me is outdated .
neutral	had i known it would take so long to for the card to ship from you guys i would have just gone to a store and picked_up one to mail myself .
neutral	it was really easy to book there and it is also quite cheap .
neutral	i can recommend that website .
neutral	the package arrive in a very dirty plastic_bag .
neutral	i have ordered many domestic online orders in us and they all come in a box and you would think an international order would come in a box ... no !
neutral	then i checked my account and i was charged about $ 0 international fee which i was never charged before from my previous many online orders .
neutral	i was so unsatisfied and unhappy with my order .
neutral	online superdry has never had a sale so i thought when they advertise their sale i '_ll splurge since it '_s free_shipping .
neutral	they get you with their stupid international fee that was never charged in my account in my previous_orders .
neutral	they need to refund my money !
neutral	i '_ve been using bookbyte for buybacks , and finally decided to order some textbooks from it .
neutral	the books arrived within the time_frame stated .
neutral	i was a little disappointed with how used the two books that were categorized as " acceptable " were - they are very , very worn .
neutral	i '_ll continue to use them for buybacks as their prices are typically better_than average , but i '_m not sure i '_ll purchase books from them in the future .
neutral	the only problem relates to the delivery service .
neutral	the items are packed into one box which can be very heavy .
neutral	the delivery person puts my box in a shed and i can never lift it out .
neutral	i have to break up the box whilst in the shed and do around 0 trips back to the house ... this is a big problem !
neutral	!
neutral	i was a bit uncomfortable with using only email for communicating about receiving the wrong part .
neutral	eventually all worked out .
neutral	however , after i received credit for being sent the wrong part i had to re - order the item and was charged shipping again --- so , i ended_up paying for shipping twice for a part that when first delivered was the wrong part .
neutral	i believe i should have been credited the second shipping charge .
neutral	the price is , or course , great , but a few people who call me regularly can '_t get through .
neutral	they hear my phone ring once or twice and then it makes a screeching noise and goes dead .
neutral	i also hear it ring but when i answer it , the line is dead .
neutral	the only good thing is that my caller id tells_me who is trying to call so i can call them back .
neutral	the system does allow completed outgoing calls .
neutral	i previously used the free google phone service .
neutral	when that was no_longer available , i switched to this .
neutral	since this isn_'_t working out so well for me , i '_ll probably just let my contract lapse and start giving out my cell number to everyone .
neutral	... unless someone knows_how this can be fixed ..?
neutral	?
neutral	we nearly got stranded !
neutral	got off the big_bus in knightsbridge and spent longer in harrods than we had planned .
neutral	( easy to do !)
neutral	we ' d had the forsight to ask the driver what time the last bus passed this stop .
neutral	" 0 . 00pm " he answered .
neutral	luckily we emerged from harrods at 0 . 00 just as a bus arrived , so we jumped on .
neutral	that was lucky ' cause it turned_out to be the last bus .
neutral	phew !
neutral	booked online and in a matter of moments my room was booked with no_problems .
neutral	my only issue with this company was that they didn_'_t warn me that the resort_fee was not included in my original price , so when i got to the hotel we had an_additional fee but other than that it worked out ok .
neutral	i order occasionally from moddeals .
neutral	although they seem to think they have good customer_service , their idea of fixing an_issue , for instance wrong info on the website , or lacking info , is to give you a discount , without fixing the website problem .
neutral	there are things i complained_about the first week i ever saw the site that are still not remedied .
neutral	one major issue is that they do not show appropriate ( or show no ) measurements on boots - for instance , for many including myself i could never buy knee - high boots there because they do not show the calf size ever , and they do not show the shank length either .
neutral	i even sent in a question once asking the calf measurement and was told it was 0 0 / 0 ... seriously ?
neutral	that is not much bigger_than most people '_s wrist !
neutral	it can '_t possibly be a leg measurement ( assumed that maybe it was half of the measurement , even_though that was still a bit small ).
neutral	they are good about giving discount though , but i ' d_rather pay full price and be able to count on the info that get 0 % or 00_%_off and then not be certain if i can use the items or not .
neutral	the most_recent boot i ordered was supposed to nbb a size 00 , but in order not to slide around in it rediculously i had to put in a hard insole to take up space in it .
neutral	many people wouldn_'_t , without spending extra money , have that option .
neutral	it is very addictive to say the least .
neutral	it gives to much information away to people though .
neutral	service is pretty good .
neutral	communication_regarding questions on product could be improved and more efficient .
neutral	haven_'_t received the walker i ordered a few_weeks_ago !
neutral	oh where , oh where did it go ?????
neutral	?
neutral	i bought a set of color cartridges with 0 black cartridges for my epsom workforce printer .
neutral	i bought the printer ( on sale ) just before selling my home and moving .
neutral	so i didn_'_t even open the box then .
neutral	before i could set_up my office_space in the new house ( almost 0 months later ) i was in an accident which required over a year of rehab .
neutral	i was unable to get the printer out of it '_s box on my own , so kept using my old one .
neutral	just a few_weeks_ago i got a friend '_s help to set_up this printer .
neutral	we didn_'_t get a good print pattern from the very beginning , though the ink_cartridges that came with the printer were completely sealed .
neutral	we ran the print tests , cleanings and alignments over and over to finally get a pretty_decent printed page .
neutral	but now 0 of the original cartridges needed replacement .
neutral	i was thinking they had dried after all that time .
neutral	and , who_knows_how long this printer sat in a warehouse before i bought it at that sale ?
neutral	so i ordered from inkfarm .
neutral	i got remanufactured_cartridges because they are much_cheaper and i had just had a poor customer_service experience with an epson employee somewhere in asia ….
neutral	the printer is now out of warrantee , so they won_'_t even send one black_cartridge -- it '_s all my problem now .
neutral	the service on my order was extraordinary .
neutral	i '_m quite impressed .
neutral	the site was very easy to use , and the cartridges arrived quickly .
neutral	i installed one of the black cartridges and also the cyan , according to the printer '_s prompts .
neutral	tested again and did a nozzle alignment and got an acceptable print .
neutral	i have since made fewer than 00 copies , and the printer is telling_me the black_cartridge is low .
neutral	!!!
neutral	!
neutral	this is supposedly a very efficient printer , making 000 or so copies per cartridge ….
neutral	i '_m certainly not seeing that .
neutral	given the history , i strongly suspect the fault is the printer .
neutral	but i have heard stories_about remanufactured_cartridges too .
neutral	so i don_'_t know .
neutral	could it be that mr . murphy ( of the famous murphy '_s law ) has given me a lemon printer and a lemon cartridge ?
neutral	it seems quite likely this problem might have absolutely nothing to do with inkfarm ….
neutral	i just don_'_t know .
neutral	if i was rich , i would go buy another epson and see how long these cartridges last in a new machine -- if they still make this model .
neutral	but i '_m not rich
neutral	other than the high - end intrest fees i really have nothing_negative to say about cash 0 i '_ve been dealing_with them for the longest .
neutral	i '_ve used wff over the years and have loved your products .
neutral	the deliveries i have received this year have been disappointing .
neutral	they were extremely young plants .
neutral	i received an arbor vitae north pole that was less_than 0 foot high .
neutral	for the price , not reasonable .
neutral	i have yet to get some other plants and a rose , so we '_ll see how that is .
neutral	the rose i did receive seemed well developed , but 0_wks later no growth .
neutral	i will wait the 0_wks as told , but i am not holding my breath .
neutral	i received from another_vendor a jasmine , that was just beautiful and on the edge of bloom .
neutral	you could feel the care in the growing .
neutral	maybe wff has too much business ?
neutral	the packing of the specimens was exemplary , definitely sensed the care there and that was appreciated .
neutral	delivery guy dumped the pallet on our front_door , instead of waiting a few_minutes for me to get there .... in the middle of a large city it was pretty reckless and arrogant and i wonder_why you would use a courier service like that ...
neutral	they tell you one thing and do another .
neutral	and not good at entering notes .
neutral	my siblings & i purchased a group gift_card for my dad and he received it yesterday .
neutral	upon trying to activate the card he was given an_error and told to contact customer_service .
neutral	when he did he was put on hold for 00_minutes before being told someone would call him back .... 00_hours_later no one did so he called back .
neutral	he was then told the department that could help was gone for the weekend and he ' d get a call back within 00_hours ... here '_s my experience :
neutral	after hearing my dad was waiting for the first call back i contacted the company and explained that there was an_error activating the card .
neutral	i was told that there was an_issue with the security_code and a ticket was put in .
neutral	i was told that someone would contact me by the end of the day .
neutral	by 0pm no one had contacted me so i called back .
neutral	i , too , was told that anyone that could do anything would not be able to help until monday or tuesday ( it '_s friday ).
neutral	i asked if a new card could be issued and shipped overnight and was told this wasn_'_t an option .
neutral	i asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that a supervisor wouldn_'_t be able to do anything , but i insisted and was put on hold .
neutral	i was then told that all supervisors were busy helping other people and that it had been a " crazy day ".
neutral	i said that i would wait for the next supervisor to become available and was placed on hold again before being forwarded to a voicemail to leave a message .
neutral	with over $_000 on this card i wish i would of just wrote a check for my dad .
neutral	update 0 / 0 / 00 @ 0pm :
neutral	i wanted to provide an updated review of giftcards .
neutral	following my original review , i responded to a request from the director of customer_service to email him with further information so that he could address my concerns .
neutral	i did so , and he promptly responded , had my dad '_s card activated within an_hour , and apologized for the communication break - down among the csrs .
neutral	while the service i received yesterday was frustrating , his response alleviated my concerns .
neutral	i changed my rating from one star to three based on the director '_s prompt follow - up and the ease of setting_up and purchasing this card online .
neutral	the book arrived in great condition .
neutral	delivery was not as fast as i hoped it would be .
neutral	i got the book a week after class started .
neutral	very happy with the price but the delivery service could of been better had to wait nearly 0_weeks when i wastold it would be delivered in a week !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i have always been satisfied in the past .
neutral	however on this occasion only 0 of my 0 items were delivered .
neutral	there had been no_explanation and it was not until i emailed i was told the item was not in stock and they would credit me with the amount ..
neutral	if i had know previously i would have been able to get a replacement , but the time_scale did not allow this and the item was required for my holiday .
neutral	i ordered 0 pairs of shoes but the black one i ordered was not as_described .
neutral	i ordered a suede lace up but then the shoe that i received was faux_leather .
neutral	i placed my order with you and was given a delivery date but sadly the goods did not arrive at my address , it was showing on the web_site that the goods had been delivered but i did not receive .
neutral	it was acted on promptly and i was given a full_refund .
neutral	this was a shame as i wanted them for my holiday so i had to go out and get a couple of dresses quickly but they did not match the ones that i had ordered as they were the colours that i liked , i would use again and hopefully next time i would receive the goods .
neutral	i was really looking_forward to my poster .
neutral	it arrived within about 0 days which was good and the quality of image was amazing .
neutral	however ; when i received it , the outside edges on each side were damaged .
neutral	i can only explain it as frayed but obviously with paper .
neutral	there were small torn paper .
neutral	this really annoyed me as it ruined my poster incredibly .
neutral	i would probably assume it was damaged in transit but hey the image is great and that '_s why people will be looking at !
neutral	yodel courier left parcel at front_door ( in full view of the road ) without even ringing the bell .
neutral	my husband saw him going down drive and when he asked why he hadn_'_t rung bell he said " didnt think anyone was in " strange as my husbands van was in the drive with bonnet up !
neutral	no card left to say he had been either .
neutral	for the price , i expected something a lot more breath_taking .
neutral	in this instance , i will go to a supermarket if buying locally .
neutral	receiving the gift_card is taking longer_than i expected .
neutral	it '_s been at_least a week and no card as yet .
neutral	i liked the idea of using a personal picture for the card but it really reduced the usable part of the picture and slapped the logo of the " credit_card " company larger than life on the picture , ruining it , i felt .
neutral	had i known that i wouldn_'_t have wasted so much time finding just the right picture and cropping it just so .
neutral	i wonder when i '_ll be getting the gift_card ?
neutral	wanted to buy this irish_velvet for a long time , great to have it for christmas , only_thing is it is much more_expensive when you have to pay six pound for delivery , but had to buy it . would be a good ldea if you made your delivery a lot cheaper , or even free .
neutral	i feel_like some things are spot on and others not so much .
neutral	i do rely_on tripadvisor but frequently look for supporting reviews elsewhere !
neutral	ordered two , got one today , still_waiting for the other one .
neutral	took longer_than i expected , and wasn_'_t able to track my shipment to nova scotia canada .
neutral	i placed an order of a thundershirt for my dog on 00 / 00 which was supposed to arrive at my home before july_0th , according to my ordering confirmation .
neutral	when it hadn_'_t arrived by july 0rd , i checked the status by_clicking on the tracking_number .
neutral	i live in kentucky .
neutral	the item left illinois , and went to wisconsin , which , according to the tracking_info , is where it still is today .
neutral	my dog suffered through the 0th of july needlessly because of the obscure shipping .
neutral	i am disappointed that my order has not arrived by the date i was told .
neutral	i waited over 00_minutes to rent this car in a line with only 0 people in front of me .
neutral	while we were waiting , i watched one person go on break after dealing_with one person for about 00_minutes .
neutral	once i was assisted , the movement was quicker .
neutral	when i went downstairs to pick_up my car , the person_who left was in the rental_car area using his cell_phone text_messaging someone .
neutral	he was a young_man of asian decent .
neutral	picking_up the car and dropping it off was fine and the car drove very well .
neutral	my vet never received the fax sent by vetrxdirect .
neutral	no follow_up call was made to me or to the vet so my prescription was delayed another week and my dog went without his thyroid_medication for that time .
neutral	i would have appreciated it if you would have let_me know that there was a problem so i could have contacted the vet sooner .
neutral	i throught the price was too high for thirty neck paps .
neutral	they use to be about $_00 . 00 now there almost $_00 . 00 for 00 .
neutral	i '_ve used stamps . com for years and it is very convenient , but $_00 per_month is ridiculous to pay for it , on top of postage .
neutral	i '_m scaling my business back and will discontinue the service bc of the cost .
neutral	it only makes_sense for larger businesses .
neutral	delivery . com is a good mobile website experience .
neutral	unfortunately the ios app is atrocious .
neutral	stick to the website .
neutral	one feature that i would like is the grub hub feature where you are updated about the status of your order .
neutral	the can opener was very good , but the lap desk seemed cheaply_made .
neutral	the cushion under the surface was too thin necessitating using an extra pillow for comfortable use .
neutral	i didnt think it was worth 00 . 00 i was expecting more from the way you guys said you cram the box full .
neutral	it was all treats and 0 toys , i could pay the same price in the pet_store down the road for what i got in the box .
neutral	i was disappointed :(
neutral	i ordered two cases of cat_food cans at a really good price .
neutral	the order was delivered fairly quickly but a can was missing from one of the cases .
neutral	it looked like someone tore open the plastic wrap and pulled out a can .
neutral	how does that accidentally happen ?
neutral	anyway , it was kinda sketchy .
neutral	when i contacted petflow '_s customer_support , they also responded quickly but only gave_me a store credit for the missing can .
neutral	and i think i have to call them when i place my next order ( if i place my next order ) to get the credit .
neutral	so , not a smooth experience , but not horrible .
neutral	i like this site to make bookings for hostels and reading_reviews , but as far as the administrative side , it is lacking .
neutral	i am not even able to change my email on the site !
neutral	i '_ve had my brother help me as well and as he works in it , i value his opinion and he thinks this is the worst , most user unfriendly site he has seen .
neutral	upgrade needed !
neutral	followed a coupon from a website for a $_000 value deal but it didn_'_t work and only got the $_00 value kit even_though i tried everything to make it work .
neutral	everything else they have done has_been great , good service and has worked great for our company .
neutral	hi , i have ordered many items , and find the service very good .
neutral	one gripe i have is that , having ordered items and been contacted by phone for payment , as i had given the wrong card details , ( no problem ), i then received less items than i had originally ordered .
neutral	i ' d been extremely busy - didn_'_t notice for sometime , so contacted the co ., explaining that maybe - or maybe not i ' d paid for something that hadn_'_t arrived .
neutral	i had a very rude email from the manager in response , and nearly shopped elsewhere in future .
neutral	the only_reason i didn_'_t was because i couldn_'_t find the item elsewhere .
neutral	i '_m satisfied on how fast it came in the mail . i do not think the lenses are the best quality .
neutral	i ordered antiglare , but there is still glare and its pretty bad .
neutral	one agent said i may be charged when i called to ask about non_- smoking and dress code .
neutral	questions which the sales agent should have addressed .
neutral	if i am charged for these questions ( which i consider a matter of service by you the provider and not a chargable item ), i willl have to reconsider using your service again .
neutral	service was far lacking compared to our trip last_year .
neutral	i ordered my book the first week of school and i didn_'_t get it until the third week .
neutral	they gave we a date of arrival and i didn_'_t receive it until after that date .
neutral	shipping takes way too long !
neutral	!
neutral	i was only somewhat satisfied with my experience shopping online at supplement_warehouse .
neutral	i had a difficult time checking out and since this was my first shopping_experience shopping with supplement_warehouse , i became frustrated .
neutral	i hope my shipment arrives without_any difficulty .
neutral	let '_s see what happens ?
neutral	per the girls in nashville they did not receive the base .
neutral	orderd the ipad case , then was told not in stock ?
neutral	then the following_day email to say would be with me by the 00 / 00 did not arrive so email snugg there reply was it could take 0 days with royal_mail ?
neutral	then to top it all they send me a email to review my comments on the case which i did not have !!.
neutral	the case arrived today very pleased with the quality .
neutral	but admin !!
neutral	!
neutral	the actual process of ordering and communication was first_class , however i would suggest that bedworld take issue with the delivery company and train their staff as to the correct way to behave .
neutral	the most_important point is that you do not expect a person to sign for a delivery before it has even been unloaded from the van .
neutral	as an elderly lady i found it intimidating that i was put in to this position but despite his insistence that i signed , i had to be equally insistent that i would not sign until the products were unloaded from the lorry and within my premises .
neutral	once again i stress not the fault of bedworld but the delivery company .
neutral	however at the end of the day they are the public face of bedworld .
neutral	at times more_expensive than in other web sites , not always practicacle and user_friendly ...
neutral	i order on a regular_basis from pure_formulas . com - i always order in advance so i never run_out of my supplements - i went to order one of the products ( lentra by sanesco ) and it showed that the product was on back order and that i would be emailed as soon as it arrived back in stock - three_weeks_later and i am completely out of the product and it is still out of stock - very frustrating .
neutral	i ordered the bully_sticks and my order came quickly .
neutral	the only problem is that the sticks are about the diameter of a # 0 pencil or less .
neutral	i buy the cadet 00 inch bully_sticks from costco that are much thicker ..
neutral	if i cut them in half the price comes out to be a few cents more than petflow .
neutral	it would be helpful if the description of the product include the dimensions of the sticks .
neutral	i ordered the bully_sticks for my 0 month old standard poodle puppy .
neutral	unfortunately , she will only be able to use them as tooth picks .
neutral	we had purchased tickets for both the jack the ripper tour and the london dungeon .
neutral	i '_ll begin with the ripper tour being really great even in the cold rain thanks in large part to our guide giles .
neutral	however , we had also purchased tickets for the london dungeon .
neutral	we arrived in london with plenty of time to do both , however , after being misdirected to the old location of the dungeons ( and a lack of signage ) we arrived with just enough time to see them before the jack the ripper tour .
neutral	the only problem was the 00 minute wait to enter ( in the priority access line no less ).
neutral	needless to say , we did not get to do the london dungeon and will probably not receive a refund .
neutral	the person i talked to was very friendly and helpful .
neutral	i was confused at not speaking directly with the storage_facility , but it '_s fine .
neutral	went to purchase kavinace on 00 / 00 which you have a 00_% coupon for that expires on nov . 00 , 0000 .
neutral	i was told i can use the coupon but only if i call customer_service and only for a week after cyber_monday .
neutral	so now the owness is back on me .
neutral	this is not my fault ... not happy .
neutral	i was pleased with the delivery process and price , however , spoke to one very rude lady on the phone , was not very helpful at all .
neutral	i think they need to work on that aspect because i will reconsider using them in the future because of her rudeness
neutral	good if there are no_problems , obvioulsy ... but , if your voucher does not work no - one at all will assist you .
neutral	having this problem at the moment , unfortunately , and after many emails still nothing ... bad customer_service , that '_s all i can say .
neutral	it wasn_'_t clear where to turn in my pre_- paid receipt and also the shuttle was not organized .
neutral	on the website you advertise that it leaves every 00_minutes .
neutral	our shuttle left early , took a group to the train_station in port chester and then took us to the airport .
neutral	also , this parking_lot is quite a way away from the airport .
neutral	could be a lot more organized .
neutral	ordered the spare part , paid for next_day delivery .
neutral	was sat in the house when the delivery man came ... he put a note through my door and i had to collect from a post_office the next_day !!
neutral	!
neutral	defeated the object of having next_day delivery so i am making a formal_complaint about them .
neutral	having searched on google for photo_books with next_day delivery , jessops appeared
neutral	i ordered two books on tuesday august_00th , they arrived on wednesday august_00th which was disappointing .
neutral	i was happy to pay for express delivery because of the bank_holiday but was not given this option at check out , although it said on the internet this option is available .
neutral	with a standard delivery it says the books should still arrive in 0 - 0 days unfortunately they didn_'_t arrive in the four available days before the holiday , and finally arrived on the wednesday following the holiday .
neutral	this is the first watch i have purchased from this vendor .
neutral	while i found their prices to be very competitive with other on line watch vendors , i would say their customer_service is good , but could use some improvement .
neutral	specifically , i had to contact them to provide an update with the order status , as none was forthcoming on line .
neutral	when i did call them , the individual i spoke with , while courteous , was not overtly friendly , and gave_me the impression he was providing the information as fast as possible , so as to get off the phone as quickly as possible .
neutral	while other watch vendors i have ordered from provide an update as to the status of the pending delivery , i was left on my own to track the item , and still await its delivery .
neutral	the sales staff were very helpful and knowledgeable however the only_reason i purchased was because i was assured i would have the bathroom in time for my workmen the next_day .
neutral	i called customer_service who simply stated next_day was upto 0pm with no other suggestions of help .
neutral	the delivery drivers were very professional and the products themselves are of good quality .
neutral	i was just a little disappointed at the delay .
neutral	we purchased the tickets for our daughter and 0 granddaughters ( aged 0 and 0 ).
neutral	i selected seats for them so they could sit together , but when they printed out their boarding_passes , there was no seat_assignment .
neutral	at the airport they were told that you can '_t get seat_assignments through_travelocity , only through the airlines directly .
neutral	they had lousy seats on their first flight and had to ask passengers to move so they could sit together on the second flight .
neutral	it was not made clear that the seat_assignments couldn_'_t be made through_travelocity .
neutral	can you clarify this issue for me ?
neutral	after_placing order online , i did not automatically receive an emailed acknowledgement of the order .
neutral	i had to call , then i received a copy of my order .
neutral	i did receive notification with tracking_information when my order shipped , but one of my two plants became completely dislodged from the pot with soil and plant scattered in the box .
neutral	the plant seemed okay , so i put it back into the pot with the soil from the shipping box .
neutral	the planting mix i had ordered did not arrive with the plants .
neutral	i had to call again and was promised the planting mix the next_day .
neutral	the planting mix showed_up 0 days_later at 0 pm .
neutral	each time i spoke to customer_service they were very pleasant and seemed interested in my concerns .
neutral	hopefully , with feedback , brighter_blooms will improve .
neutral	love the fashion ... but left_wondering .
neutral	size details should be more helpful .
neutral	wondering how im a small size .
neutral	good news i guess but caused a return .
neutral	left_wondering how long id be on hold when i called to reset my password and get a return merch id #.
neutral	was on hold for almost an_hour ... i actually fell_asleep while on hold !
neutral	literally .
neutral	also wondered_if my return package would be reimbursed ... or did i just send my return to no mans land ?
neutral	store credit took over 0wks .
neutral	happy that the business is legit .... sometimes you wonder about that when it comes to anything online .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	oh one more thing , why do you repeat items thru the pages ??
neutral	kinda annoying please only list items / photo once .
neutral	peace
neutral	the flight and hotel were offered at a good price .... but what was not factored in was purchasing seats ( round_trip ) and purchasing carryons ( round_trip ).
neutral	so ... that being said , perhaps we could have found an offer that was truly all_inclusive .
neutral	on a more positive_note .. the person_who booked my package gave_me excellent customer_service !
neutral	wasn_'_t as big as i thought extra large wud be
neutral	shop to net is a excellent site to buy games if u dont mind waiting on your package , ordered on monday and was dispatched on monday , but now on thursday still no game even_though it was for my sons_birthday today !!
neutral	so left with a very upset son !!!!
neutral	now almost a month later still no game and a long and complicated lost claim prodecure !!
neutral	!
neutral	no problem with ordering , quick and painless but .... if the book is not in stock , please do not indicate that it is .
neutral	i was unsure_about the store at first so i ordered only one thing from them .
neutral	the item arrived really quick but it wasn_'_t the color shown on the website .
neutral	the one i got was green but it '_s supposed to be teal ...
neutral	i am a little disappointed but i am going to keep the dress because the hassles of returning it is just not worth my time .
neutral	however , i will shop there again if i see some good deals , but definitely going to pick a non_- ambiguous color from now on .
neutral	with a daughter away at college , i find it hard to believe that you would accept fedex '_s " policy " of not delivering financial products to a box number .
neutral	virtually all college campuses use boxes for students and college_students have got to be a key target for you guys .
neutral	my guess is fedex is totally ok delivering to college boxes .
neutral	so you guys need to get together and figure_out how to pass through a positive shipping response when the address is a college / university .
neutral	although i like the facility i am_currently at , i don_'_t like the fact that they raised the price in less_than 0 months .
neutral	also , if the elevators would give you more time to get your stuff on before starting to close the door .
neutral	since , you have to push the elevator call button first before you put in your pass code nearest the elevator which arrives it makes it difficult to put in the number and then get your items to the elevator and onto the elevator - you have to move very quickly and sometimes that is not possible when moving large items .
neutral	die reservierung lief ohne probleme .
neutral	aber als_ich in bodum am flughafen stand , hatte_ich weder eine telefonnummer zum anrufen , noch war jemand da , um mich abzuholen und_zu meinem mietwagen zu bringen .
neutral	ich fand dann endlich einen tourguide , der bei_der firma surprice cars anrief .
neutral	ausserdem war der tank leer .
neutral	normalerweise bin_ich gewöhnt , einen vollen tank zu bekommen , und dann auch wieder einen vollen tank zurückzugeben .
neutral	diesmal habe_ich drauf gezahlt , da_ich am schluss noch einen hlaben tank voll hatte ....
neutral	und beim zurückgeben hatte_ich das gleich problem wie beim abholen : erst mal niemand am flughafen .
neutral	thrifty is not at s . p .
neutral	airport .
neutral	this has not been advised beforehand .
neutral	the office is about 0km from the airport , in a strange area , bad access to the freeway and you loose time at pickup and return of the car .
neutral	i love the free_shipping and the prices are good .
neutral	i hate that you are out of product so much though .
neutral	i can find it on other_sites so it does not appear to be the fault of the manufacturer .
neutral	maybe you can change this .
neutral	my friend said she had the same problem .
neutral	i dont_know if its them or ups but i got my email with tracking_number saying it has_been processed to ship .... that was the 00rd ..... here it is the 00th and the ups site says the same thing ...." a shipping label has_been created once the order has_been recieved it will be updated " why has my dang door_handle not left the place yet !!
neutral	?
neutral	other than that theve got a huge_selection at a good price sobill give it another shot if i ever recieve my dooe handle
neutral	searched the web and this site seemed to provide good value for money .
neutral	i was looking to replace my old over which had died .
neutral	if i had known how long delivery was going to be i would have paid more to receive the product sooner .
neutral	some information on the website about fitting the product would be useful .
neutral	i received the oven today after 0_weeks of waiting to find that it does not have a plug like my old oven so i will need to get someone in to install it so i still cannot do any cooking .
neutral	cannot_comment on the product itself as do not know now when i will get to use it .
neutral	delivery schedule was well informed , managed and on time
neutral	selecting and ordering the product was a breeze .
neutral	although some items were out of stock when the order was placed , everything came through at the stated time .
neutral	i did however find the t and c '_s for placing a delivery over strict .
neutral	living on my own it is difficult to get help for checking the items on arrival .
neutral	then came the delivery .
neutral	the courier was demanding , arrogant and rude .
neutral	the first call came at 0 . 00 in the morning to barked at that he would be at my house in two hours .
neutral	not contact to agree a suitable time as i was expecting .
neutral	having re - scheduled to a more suitable date , the driver '_s manner was the absolute opposite of good service .
neutral	he would not wait for the items to be checked .
neutral	i contacted customer_services straight_away to provide the feedback .
neutral	i find being sworn at unacceptable .
neutral	good service is all about the total supply chain not just part of it .
neutral	so i am afraid my view is tainted .
neutral	the items are yet to be installed so cannot_comment on the quality and condition .
neutral	there were no markings on the outside of the package regarding do not use sharp objects to open box .
neutral	i used a small blade to open the box and cut right into one of the cat treats i ordered .
neutral	meanwhile all of the air pillows were at the bottom with all 0 treats i ordered shoved up at the top .
neutral	not thrilled because i had to bag the treats so they wouldn_'_t dry up .
neutral	i made contact asking for advice and it was suggested that the prv was responsible so i bought it ..
neutral	unfortunately this wasnt the culprit and the water continued to fall .
neutral	i enquired again asking for further advice and a suggestion of a new unit to replace the old without need for massive plumbing changes but ive not had a reply at all !.
neutral	i purchased 0 pair of shoes .
neutral	loved both pair , but when i went to put the black ones on in the morning , the right shoe was so much smaller_than the left and the zip wouldn_'_t zip up all the way .
neutral	i called and left a voicemail for a call back , 0 days_later still no call .
neutral	the recepient was delighted with the arrangement but dont_think they would say itherwise since it was a gift .
neutral	they did email me a picture and have to say was a bit smaller then what i expected and what was shown in the picture so i was a little disappointed .
neutral	i also had to ask recepient about it as after i received notification it was delivered .. the next_day i still did not hear from them ..
neutral	it was apparently set out by garage and not front_door like i asked and they did not know it was there in an open box until next_day when i asked about it .
neutral	the site is easy to use mostly you can find anything you are looking for your car .
neutral	very inexpensive parts compair to others auto_parts stores .
neutral	however , return_policy and able to contact someone directly for other question need to be improve and have someone live via phone .
neutral	customer_service just ok . return process not that good .
neutral	easy to find and pick_up was timely .
neutral	however , the shuttle started and stopped in the parking_lot twice to go back and get new passenger .
neutral	costing us an extra 00 - 00_minutes .
neutral	website must_say that one cannot be activated ever again with at & t after it is unlocked .
neutral	whenever it says that the phone can be activated with any sim in the world , it should say except at & t .
neutral	the original collection was between 00am and 0pm but the driver never turned_up .
neutral	i rang them the next_day and was advised that he came at 0 :_00pm but the office was closed .
neutral	i finish work at 0pm and stayed an_hour later as it was !!!
neutral	!
neutral	anyway , the driver collected by 0pm the next_day and the parcel was delivered by the day after ; safely .
neutral	i did notice that the driver was a bit rough with the parcel even_though it had ' handle with care ' stickers on it .
neutral	good job i packed it well .
neutral	i don_'_t know if i would use them again to be fair , but the pricing was ok .
neutral	this is the second bottle i have purchased from you with the expiration_date being past due !!
neutral	i will have to order supplements from another distributior .
neutral	efficient collection and delivery .
neutral	contents which was clothing books and files - received a battering - the bag must have been roughly handled as the handles were torn off and the lever arch files were irretrievably damaged in transit although they were well padded with clothing around them .
neutral	the flowers were delivered on time , but not at drop of point given in ordering .
neutral	the recipient would not have found them in good time if hadn_'_t searched for them .
neutral	the bouquet was pretty & they were appreciated .
neutral	however , she sent photo of it to show us what it looked like .
neutral	we had paid for a ' deluxe ' bouquet in a glass vase ( extras ) & this had fewer flowers than the standard bouquet shown in the advertisement .
neutral	most of the flowers were cheaper filler flowers & greenery .
neutral	generally not impressed with this arrangement at all .
neutral	hopefully , the recipient feels that it was the thought that counted .
neutral	i ordered two_separate labels for limoncello - one batch for the limoncello i make twice a year and the second_batch for my daughter - in -_law who is making her first batch this spring .
neutral	the labels are very nice but i thought the price was a little high for the 00 labels plus shipping : $_00 . 00 per batch which works out to $ 0 . 00 per label .
neutral	i don_'_t know if i had ordered them on the same invoice if the shipping price would have been the same for all of them or not but i do know the shipping was about 0 / 0 of the cost .
neutral	i tried to see if i could amend my first order to add the second one but it had already been processed and i was advised i would need to submit it in a separate order .
neutral	the majority of the items i have purchased have been returned to boohoo as the colour looks completely different or they are of poor quality , i have also found the returns process extremely slow at times !
neutral	!
neutral	i have been very pleased with ordering my cartridges for my printer .
neutral	the order seems to arrive almost overnight .
neutral	i have recommended inkfarm to several of my friends .
neutral	with my purchases i had cascade taps .
neutral	when the plumber had installed bath , very difficult in my old cottage with its uneven walls .
neutral	took a day .
neutral	placed taps sealed bath in etc , turned tap on and hey_presto tap leaked .
neutral	i wanted to cry never mint the plumber !
neutral	!
neutral	so the poor chap had to take it all out again , thankfully he changed the washers and this sorted it .
neutral	perhaps victoria_plumb could teat their taps and washers prior to sending them out .
neutral	i order ( 0 ) door_handles for my 00 toyota_camry and to my surprise i only receive ( 0 ) one door_handle when both are coming from the same company , why do i need to wait on the other one ?
neutral	and yet i have not receive any explanation to why i haven_'_t gotten the other one .
neutral	but yet i '_m waiting patiently
neutral	i have been mainly ordering rhinestone transfers .
neutral	the only concern i have is that i am often finding it necessary to hand apply stones that remain on the transfer sheet .
neutral	i lost several shirts due to the purple on the grapes failing to adhere to the shirt .
neutral	i ordered my book a week in advance for my class , thinking it would get there on time , but instead it was a week late .
neutral	i don_'_t know if it was just due to the high number of orders or what , but it left me scrambling to find a replacement book in the meantime .
neutral	it finally got here a week_later than it was supposed to , so at_least i '_m thankful that i got it .
neutral	two over night orders one to ky the other to fla the order in ky was on time however the delivery for my parents was not there till after christmas and the food was no_longer good .
neutral	will not order again and pay extra for overnight if the order can not be delivered on time ... holidays or not
neutral	every time you run a discount promotion , you are out of iodoral .
neutral	i think it is intentional .
neutral	then it is mysteriously back in stock right after the promo is over .
neutral	this does not make me happy .
neutral	i '_ve ordered twice from chemist 0 u , both_times i '_ve requested express delivery ; however both_times my item has only been sent by normal royal_mail , despite_being charged for the express delivery .
neutral	this is frustrating as it seems it doesn_'_t matter what option you pick , its just gets sent by normal royal_mail .
neutral	however , customer_service were good on both_occasions and refunded my delivery cost quickly .
neutral	to be honest , i probably_won_'_t order from here again though as i just get annoyed when things are constantly done wrong .
neutral	i ordered a flower_arrangement for £_00 but friend recieved the £_00 orchid . while it arrived on time and recipient was pleased with her gift .
neutral	it wasn_'_t what was ordered . i '_m still_waiting for an explanation and reimbursement of the difference in value from e florist !
neutral	i applied for credit at a furniture store and the number they came back with was 00 points lower !
neutral	thought i was staying at one motel and ended_up at another !
neutral	i didn_'_t really like that !
neutral	i don_'_t know why they didn_'_t tell me that at the beginning !
neutral	the mail system took it '_s own sweet time getting my order here .
neutral	according to tracking it was picked_up on 0 / 0 & i didn_'_t get it until 0 / 00 .
neutral	there are no instructions on how to activate the pet_safety_light , i finally figured it out , but don_'_t like that you have to turn it off & on .
neutral	problem with the rentalcars . com in that there is no information on the reservation form that indicates that one must call the local rental_car company upon_arrival in order to be picked_up .
neutral	after waiting for 00_minutes , i had to call the 000 # and get the local # to call and alert them to pick me up .
neutral	we ' re sad to say we '_ve found bugs in two of the large_bags of dry_cat_food we received .
neutral	we '_ve had to throw out much of it .
neutral	we haven_'_t yet opened the third bag , and we ' re hoping the problem was limited to the other two bags .
neutral	we '_ll be contacting petflow for a refund or a replacement tomorrow .
neutral	otherwise we '_ve had a great experience ordering food for our three cats and one dog at petflow .
neutral	good range of products on the website .
neutral	however , be aware that even if you make a purchase online , this doesn_'_t necessarily mean that they have this item in stock .
neutral	when this happened to us we could either wait 0 - 0_weeks for the requested items or have an_alternative .
neutral	we chose an_alternative ( slightly different colour and style than we wanted ) which was fine but we were not given any recompense for this .
neutral	very speedy_delivery service ( if item is in stock ) and would probably use them again .
neutral	i joined clearone over a month_ago , and my first payment was drafted this month .
neutral	i was under the impression that negotiations would be made with my creditors prior to the first draft being made , but i was mistaken .
neutral	when i signed_up , i was instructed to let my payments on these cards default , which i have done .
neutral	now that i have done so , i am getting more and more late fees ; now the balance due is more than what it was when i initially signed_up with clearone .
neutral	am i going to be responsible for the extra money that is owed , which is only owed because of clearone ?
neutral	i can '_t get anyone to answer my emails .
neutral	i '_m very frustrated , and very worried .
neutral	i paid my bills on time , and now they are not begin paid because i put my faith in a company that is supposed to be helping_me .
neutral	no one has negotiated with these creditors on my behalf , as far as i know , because no one from clearone is keeping me informed .
neutral	how do i get you to keep me informed ?
neutral	i recently phoned to make a reservation .
neutral	i had no_idea i was calling america but i was assured the call was free .
neutral	the male was very keen that i book with him rather_than do it on line after he assured_me that twin rooms were available at manchester_airport hilton .
neutral	he also assured_me that wifi and breakfast were included .
neutral	i spent quite a bit of time talking him through my address and bank_details .
neutral	after assuming he would want me to spell certain address names he stated he had all he wanted but then asked me to repeat as he had not got all the details .
neutral	he asked for " zip codes " more than once even_though i told him i was british .
neutral	after taking bank_details he asked if i had money in my account as the card was not working .
neutral	at that time my bank was desperately trying to get home of me on my mobile to check i was authorising a debit from the states .
neutral	i ended_up putting the phone down to the the reservation team male fearing he was not genuine following all the address mix_ups and then the bank card query .
neutral	i later when to book on line to find the wifi and breakfast not included for the same rate - and i suspect it never was !
neutral	!
neutral	on line booking easier !.
neutral	i follow the guidelines that are set forth as far a changing my information .
neutral	two times after changing my information they decided to hold up my order until they could establish that it was me .
neutral	i can see that for security_reasons .
neutral	however since they are on pst and i am on est it was hard for them to confirm anything with our conflicting schedules .
neutral	if a robot can hold up an order then the robot should also be able to verify with me the information is correct .
neutral	otherwise they are a great site !!!
neutral	!
neutral	at first there were issues with my purchases .
neutral	things like verifying my personal information .
neutral	things like does my name and the name on my credit_card match up .
neutral	other issues like why i make purchases from different computers .
neutral	then why all my orders still say processing instead of complete .
neutral	otherwise i enjoy amiclubwear once they resolve my issues i '_ll be completely_satisfied .
neutral	easy booking on website and good price .
neutral	however :
neutral	0 .
neutral	didn_'_t see till after booking that " vehicles are parked at owners risk " !!!!
neutral	not sure that '_s even legal , duty of care etc .
neutral	don_'_t like that .
neutral	0 .
neutral	extras are added to price quoted , don_'_t like that .
neutral	should be inclusive to allow comparison when shopping on line .
neutral	0 .
neutral	haven_'_t used this parking yet so lets_hope the service is good .
neutral	- requested items that were not stated as required on there web_site
neutral	- requested items that we already sent in and they had in their san_francisco representative ’_s office .
neutral	hello , my 0st order for a case of canned_cat_food , arrived within days and only had 0 damaged can .
neutral	so 0 out of 00 didn_'_t seem to bad .
neutral	my next order of the same canned_cat_food was for 0 cases and 0 cans were damaged and i had to throw them out .
neutral	that disappointed me a little_bit .
neutral	not sure how you can prevent that from happening but maybe a closer inspection before shipping might help .
neutral	i could see the plastic was wet before i started to open the 0st case .
neutral	the 0nd case was fine .
neutral	thanks
neutral	i tried to book on line and found that i could not book 0 of us onto the ferry with 0 motorbikes so i called the company .
neutral	i was told we could not be classed as a group booking unless there were 00 of us and it was now going to cost an extra £_00 per person if i booked by telephone .
neutral	so i abandoned that .
neutral	i then had to phone p_& o to ensure there were an adequate number of spaces left on the ferry before i started progressing 0 separate on line bookings , other than that , it was easy to find the ferry we wanted and at a good price .
neutral	0 ) since wimdu has increase the service charge , it seems i got less guests booking from womdu '_s side , before the booking was ok but now it '_s even worse than travelmob , maybe wimdu needs to think about the service charge .
neutral	0 ) since the hong_kong office was closed we do not know who we can contact with if we really have a problem .
neutral	hope you guys will think about these problems and get solve .
neutral	thanks & regards ,
neutral	grace
neutral	we love our mac in a sac long coats but we were very disappointed with the short length of the arms in the xl size for my husband .
neutral	shame to scrimp when the coat is so generous is all the other_places .
neutral	as you can see , i have used jalbum for many years and have donated money on several_occasions as a thank_you for the use of your software .
neutral	all of a sudden you slam adverts on my galleries and the only way i can get_rid of them is by paying for the software again .
neutral	it is not behaviour i would come_across in this country with its sense of fairness .
neutral	practise like this is unacceptable .
neutral	what more can i say ?
neutral	the price was right , although shipping was higher_than i thought it should have been .
neutral	i could have lived with that , but they didn_'_t engrave it as requested .
neutral	they didn_'_t engrave it at all .
neutral	i '_ll be darned if i will pay to ship it back to have it done .
neutral	i have stayed at the fairfield multiple_times and found the previous online reservation system much_easier .
neutral	this request to rate the system did not even identify which reservation it referred to ( i have made multiple reservations for our upcoming_trip ).
neutral	it should clearly identify the hotel and date of the reservation .
neutral	i showed_up at 0 : 00 for my departure time of 0 : 00 , only to find out the skuttle only leaves every half_hour .
neutral	that should have been started when i made my reservation !
neutral	i loved the customer_service with sparefoot & i made my reservation a month ahead and only 0 days before my move found out the storage center does not have the availability that the sparefoot representative set_up for me .
neutral	i was about to pay and asked to confirm that it was heated and cooled - nope .
neutral	the owners of these local storage centers were really helpful in finding me another local storage_space but let_me know that sparefoot doesn_'_t always reserve space that actually exists .
neutral	hello dear customer sevice ,
neutral	i '_ve got my dress .
neutral	it was nice that i received it on time .
neutral	but the dress was damaged .
neutral	the threads in the dress are puled in so many spots ;(((.
neutral	i love the dress but it lookes like used .
neutral	i wish i could get at_least discount on this dress .
neutral	sincerely ,
neutral	kristina
neutral	i went through_travelocity because i thought it would save_money .
neutral	i wanted a rental_car , a hotel and airfare and thought i could get a package deal .
neutral	because i didn_'_t need the rental or the hotel for the duration of my stay , i couldn_'_t buy them as a package deal .
neutral	i went_ahead and got the plane_tickets and was asked seat_assignments .
neutral	later i ordered a ticket for my mom and found the seats we reserved were still showing as available on the seating chart .
neutral	i called the airline themselves ( air_canada ) and they were very nice and reserved us seats all together .
neutral	if my mom hadn_'_t have decided to come with us , i would have assumed our seating was reserved when it wasn_'_t and my kids and i could have been sitting in separate areas of the plane .
neutral	next time i will go through the airline_directly and skip the . com sites and all the follow - up spam emails .
neutral	if i booked a flight through you , you know i can '_t change it so stop sending me emails about cheaper rates !!
neutral	!
neutral	wanted a better pro - biotic 00 billion too expensive and turmeric is also too expensive for what you get
neutral	i ordered a product of which i found at a better price than most sites ordered n shipment was fast and on time after receiving products 0 / 0 wad damaged tried to contact customer_service several_times but wasnt successful due to high call_volume left a service ticket email of which someone was suppose to contact me between 00 - 00hrs n its been like four days since ticket report i will_continue to try to get thru to someone to resolve this matter i hate writing bad reviewd but im an honest person i pray this help someone as well as the company !!
neutral	😡😡
neutral	toilet arrived on date stated but just in a box with no padding hence system was broken , also no top to cistern in box .
neutral	contacted them and after sending photo had to ring for a replacement to be sent .
neutral	took_ages holding on to get answered .
neutral	new toilet arrived_promptly and as i had popped out for 00_minutes as not sure when it was coming broken toilet was not collected .
neutral	this time toilet came in two boxes and well padded .
neutral	toilet_seat was awful and off white in colour and not soft closing , then i thought i would look in the broken toilet box and in there was a decent soft closing seat .
neutral	so glad the box hadn_'_t been collected .
neutral	need to check their items a little better before sending out .
neutral	have ordered in the past and everything has_been fine .
neutral	delivery is very good .
neutral	i am not giving it more stars because i don_'_t find these discounts on the mobile devices the same way i do with my regular laptop unless i go through an_email presenting a discount
neutral	on more than one occasion , the internet discount i tried to use either didn_'_t go through , or didn_'_t register at all !
neutral	i '_m tired of being charged 00 $ for a 00 $ meal !
neutral	please , get your act_together delivery . com
neutral	it '_s was my 0st experience but is sound great ...
neutral	good price on the cruise - but was supposed to get a free week at a condo " anyplace " they had a complex , but it was a complete come on !!
neutral	after i hassled them for over a month for " the code " i got on line and of course there was no weeks listed for 000 !!
neutral	they were all upwards of 000 !!!
neutral	that '_s like getting a regular condo someplace !!
neutral	no deal there !
neutral	!
neutral	chairs arrived on time .
neutral	problems .
neutral	0 screws loose at back support crome trims were not stuck down at joint and didn_'_t meet which made them sharp for little fingers to be cut .
neutral	i emailed lakeland and it was totally ignored as to this day i have heard_nothing .
neutral	chairs look lovely .
neutral	maybe i am being picky but i didn_'_t think i would have to tighten screws and glue trims .
neutral	you would think they would have an inspection team .
neutral	in my opinion , us mail would have gotten the product to me faster that fedx .
neutral	for some_reason the product was delivered to two distribution centers in the same city when on was much closer to me than when the book actually was delivered from .
neutral	the product offered was a good price with good selection .
neutral	however , the box was poorly packaged ( one strip of tape ) and as a result arrived damaged .
neutral	the box was open , meaning the tape had come off and was insufficient to hold the heavy contents .
neutral	this could have been avoided in two ways .
neutral	0 ).
neutral	use a sturdier box and secure correctly .
neutral	0 ).
neutral	use a taller box instead of a wide , short box .
neutral	i will have to think about whether to cancel my subsciption .
neutral	this is my first order .
neutral	i am not seeing a reason to continue , but i will give it some thought .
neutral	the product seems fine , but i haven_'_t opened it yet .
neutral	the sticky pads we got dont work !
neutral	dont get me wrong their very sticky but the mice aint sticking to em
neutral	i didn_'_t receive a confirmation_email for my order - hence i had no order number to reference .
neutral	each time i tried to track my order , i got a message that my order had been received .
neutral	since i didn_'_t hear from the recipient that the flowers had arrived , i emailed serenata direct and had them trace the order .
neutral	that '_s when i was notified that the order was scheduled for delivery more than 0_weeks after the date i intended .
neutral	the website claims that not everybody receives a confirmation_email .
neutral	that needs to be addressed .
neutral	if i had received such an_email , then the error would have been spotted much earlier and the flowers might have arrived on time .
neutral	follow_up emails from serenata were prompt and the error was corrected and the flowers sent .
neutral	i have not yet heard from the recipient whether or not they arrived or were to her liking , so can '_t comment on quality or delivery .
neutral	i like how convenient it is to have high_quality dogfood delivered to my door , but it took much longer_than i expected for it to arrive .
neutral	the box came several days after it was supposed to based on what was stated as expected delivery time .
neutral	it was very easy to find what i was looking for and to place the order online .
neutral	my order was delivered within a couple days which is fantastic .
neutral	the only_complaint i have is that it looked like both cases of cans that were placed in my order had taken a bad fall .
neutral	half of the cans had huge dents in the sides .
neutral	so_far the good seems okay but some make me nervous because of how deformed the can is .
neutral	hopefully next time my product isn_'_t damage , then i could give them 0_stars .
neutral	i ordered the wrong part i am waiting for a rma_number .
neutral	to get my refund and then order the right part .
neutral	it was a tail_light_assembly for the right year but wrong not reg cab but 0 door .
neutral	the reservation was great .
neutral	the hotel found it very quickly and it was easy to make .
neutral	they were fast and efficient .
neutral	the price i paid was 00 dollars more than the standard room rate at the hotel .
neutral	so i didn_'_t get a deal , and the hotel charged me again when i checked in .
neutral	it was an easy fix and they fixed it right_away , but next time i will check the hotel first for pricing .
neutral	you used to have such wonderful products and wonderful service .
neutral	the past three years have been very disappointing - especially regarding tuberous begonias .
neutral	what has_been sent has_been : 0 ) not what i ordered ; 0 ) a total disregard of instructions ; and , finally , 0 ) a one inch by one half inch expensive begonia tuber that is just sitting in it '_s little pot doing nothing .
neutral	at_least , your customer_service people are nice , but , you used to be a truly luxe garden .
neutral	" amos pettingill " would not be amused .
neutral	ambientedirect . com definitely had the rock - bottom lowest_prices i could find ( on the particular outdoor furniture i bought ).
neutral	however , their e_- mail customer_service is non_- existent ; e_- mails go completely unanswered .
neutral	this leaves customers in the u . s . scrambling to find a way to call internationally in order to obtain any customer_service .
neutral	in my case , i called from work and i work for an international company , so i could avoid telephone charges .
neutral	but i would strongly_suggest ambientedirect obtain a 0 - 000 number for its american customers .
neutral	shipping was also really time - consuming , since the goods had to come from germany , and were shipped via dhl post ( which is the same as shipping via the postal service ... slow )!
neutral	all that being said , i received everything in great condition and paid less_than i would have anywhere_else .
neutral	so while the hassle was annoying , in the end i was a satisfied customer .
neutral	satisfied ... just not enthusiastic .
neutral	i would definitely recommend you to at_least try this .
neutral	i had a sort of hard time to receive the textbook and contact to customer_service center when i tried to track my order .
neutral	i am usually happy however this time we still havn '_t recieved our order !
neutral	i understand things get backordered but i wish i hadn_'_t been able to order if the ostomy bags were out of stock !
neutral	my son has his last bag on and so were just praying at this point !
neutral	i do appreciate your company though !
neutral	we buy all of my sons med supplies so i appreciate your lower prices !
neutral	the guy_who fitted was great but the service before was somewhat erratic ; they didn_'_t know the size of tyres my car needed they came the first time and they were the wrong tyres , and they said this was the 0 rd that morning so something is wrong somewhere
neutral	i spent over 00 quid on my phone when i bought it and i have only had it 0 or 0 years yet somehow i only got 0 pounds .
neutral	it was working_properly and looked fine so i was disappointed with what i got .
neutral	however , service is quick .
neutral	hotel room was pretty_decent .
neutral	two double_beds plus a pull out sofa , mini_fridge , microwave & coffee_maker .
neutral	unfortunately , i found a few hairs on shower wall .
neutral	also , front_desk guy at check - in was extremely_rude , like i was interrupting him from doing something super important .
neutral	hotel adds extra $ 0 charge that travelocity makes you unaware of ( confusing ).
neutral	great location though .
neutral	pretty close to most orlando_attractions , shopping & eateries .
neutral	i reserved a storage_unit online so it would be easier .
neutral	i received my confirmation_email and was given an address to go to so that i could make my first payment .
neutral	well , i go to said address , and the storage company has no record of my reservation .
neutral	luckily , they had some units available , but not the size i reserved , and not for the price i was given .
neutral	after talking to the lady , she said that her company doesn_'_t even use this site .
neutral	i went to the airport to leave on my trip , i discovered that my flight had been change to the following_morning .
neutral	i was never notified .
neutral	i had to change all my plans and hotel reservations .
neutral	i was very unhappy with how it was handled .
neutral	i don_'_t plan on using travelocity again .
neutral	it is a nice option for people in rural areas or that can '_t get to a store easily but i paid $_00 more for the same dog_food i buy a mile from my house .
neutral	i only did it so the rescue would get a donation .
neutral	i received my dress within a week and i was truly happy with it !
neutral	i had to return a previous dress as it was not what i thought it was and the style didn_'_t suit me .
neutral	the returns_procedure took longer_than_expected and i have only just received an_email_confirming that they have received my returned item .
neutral	but regardless of that i am happy with my product and the price i paid for it !
neutral	easy ordering online and fast ship but this item ran way too small :(
neutral	it '_s taken me about three_times as long as i hoped to book a car just now , to pick_up in glasgow ' downtown '.
neutral	when i went through from moneysavingexpert , the cars came up all saying simply glasgow downtown but no_clue as to where exactly they were .
neutral	we want to walk from the train_station to the car_hire , so it was important for us to know where we ' d be picking it up , upfront .
neutral	i started from scratch searching on the rentalcars . com site and this time the locations came up .
neutral	i picked an offer that said the first additional driver was free - again , something important to us .
neutral	however , on the next couple of pages there was no mention of this , including the page where you are asked for payment , making me worried the system might not have taken us through to the right deal .
neutral	i sent myself a quote to see what it said and to have some kind of proof that this deal was meant to have a free additional driver .
neutral	got there in the end , close to the train_station and with our additional driver , but have lost half an_hour of my life in the process !
neutral	if key details like this were present on every page it would increase customer trust and rating .
neutral	my pets loved the treats i got from you , but the cat_food wasn_'_t much of a hit .
neutral	tigger just picked at it and then left it alone .
neutral	you can '_t see a new shipping address immediately after it '_s been entered , so you can '_t select it .
neutral	very frustrating !
neutral	otherwise the site is easy to use .
neutral	ordered fourth element drysuit underwear , good price .
neutral	but items were not in stock .
neutral	when you go to checkout , that is when you should be made aware , but as it is i ordered the items , went through checkout , payment was accepted and then the following_day i receive an_email_telling_me items were backordered .
neutral	( i will say however that apologies were offered and i was made aware of any changes in status .)
neutral	had my money not already been tied up , i would have gone elsewhere , but since i had already paid i waited it out .
neutral	i do realize that sometimes things are out of stock but it should be noted on the website when you try to place an order .
neutral	luckily i wasn_'_t needing the items in a hurry , but i don_'_t know that i would take a chance in the future if i need something quickly .
neutral	i ordered two plants , a hydrangea and a knock out rose , that upon_arrival were crushed .
neutral	the delivery company ( fedex i believe ) left it on my doorstep upside_down even_though the box clearly_stated to only place the package on its sides .
neutral	hence , i think my plants arrived in such poor condition mainly due to handling en_route .
neutral	in the future , if i do order a plant from brighter bloom i will only order one at a time so it will be packaged better and thus survive the journey intact .
neutral	i got the order but was not aware of the small sizes .
neutral	maybe the picture made it seem bigger .
neutral	i was the correct supplements .
neutral	will order again only maybe in larger amounts .
neutral	i have had a decent experience at the facility , but the rate could be much more affordable .
neutral	the required insurance is steep .
neutral	the delivery was great and so was the packaging , however , mum said the roses were a little wilted so she has had to trim the ends in the hope they will revive .
neutral	the freesias smelt divine though .
neutral	in this day and age when most online catalog companies ship free , i had to double up on some items just to get a " reasonable " shipping charge which i still felt exorbitant .
neutral	and , then -- having to wait almost ten or more days was outrageous considering the charge .
neutral	twice_now we have received damaged items .
neutral	customer_service is always very helpful , but as they can '_t stipulate delivery times it meant lots of extra waiting around at home ..
neutral	so my advice is to check very carefully when you receive anything , and ring them there and then if there is a problem !
neutral	i found it easy to complete your online form and got confirmation as expected .
neutral	the quality is ok , i had some very similar from blinds uk who were slightly_cheaper but the material was much thicker .
neutral	i chose you because their delivery service was very poor .
neutral	your delivery is better however your confirmations did not mention delivery timescales and i found it hard to find out when it should be delivered .
neutral	you didnt keep me updated but having said that i had the good faster_than_expected .
neutral	i might use you again for wooden_blinds but i dont_think i will or recommend you for roman_blinds .
neutral	i also dont like the cord tie you provide , i much prefer the fixed plastic adjustment , its safer with children .
neutral	so in short , delivery good , updates poor , quality not great , delivery great .
neutral	i bought three_pairs of shoes .
neutral	shipping took two_weeks ( i live in ma ).
neutral	i love my heels and flats .
neutral	would order again .
neutral	very quick , next_day delivery but multis were smaller_than_anticipated .
neutral	the book was priced reasonably and just what i needed , but ordering and trying to process my credit_card was a nightmare .
neutral	i also payed for rushed shipping and got my book later than i would have with standard shipping .
neutral	everything worked well with ordering and receiving alpha_brain .
neutral	i really like the product too , but my husband used it which caused his face to be red for a couple hours , and he had a headache for a few hours too .
neutral	it would have been comforting to at_least read if those are common side_effects .
neutral	i love the prices , fast delivery , and free_shipping ,, but this site offers rewards that are impossible to redeem - or once you ' redeem ' them they get lost because you have to leave the site , go to your email , get a ( very long ) coupon_code , go back to the site to redeem - hit apply 00 times only to have the rest of the data you entered disappear ...
neutral	they really need to improve that process and apply the coupon as you click .
neutral	they couldn_'_t find the hotel i wanted to stay at and so accidentally booked me at the wrong one in another nearby city .
neutral	thet were quick to remedy the situation once i called back with this info .
neutral	we order from hunt_office from time to time .
neutral	once something was missing from the package and i sent an_email_asking what happened .
neutral	i got no reply what so ever .
neutral	it was back in july .
neutral	i repeated my query just recently and still no contact at all .
neutral	this actually put me off from this company for good .
neutral	i needed a driver '_s side front exterior door_handle .
neutral	a google_search showed partsgeek as part one of my online options .
neutral	the price was fair , about the same as everyone else once shipping was added to the final price .
neutral	other_sites had cheaper shipping but slightly_higher part cost .
neutral	so ultimately the price was simply good , rather_than exceptional .
neutral	the description of parts on the website though is very poor .
neutral	the door_handle i purchased said it was " door_handle - front left - driver_side ; platinum ".
neutral	this description would lead one to believe it is the color ' platinum ' which should be of a gray / silver shade , which would have been close to my silver colored car .
neutral	the part i got was black .
neutral	nowhere on the website did the description state it was black in color .
neutral	although the stock picture shows the color as black , it '_s the same picture used on many other listings , it appeared to be the generic photo .
neutral	i ordered this suitcase and it came in very good time , but is bigger_than_expected .
neutral	beware , when they say a suitcase is 00 " high !
neutral	they are not counting the wheels .
neutral	there was no returns information in the box , not even a normal receipt .
neutral	i '_ve decided its close enough , but it isn_'_t very good customer_relations not to make it easy to find out how to return .
neutral	good apart_from one purchase
neutral	on placing my order on 0rd may , i was told that the 0 items were out of stock and would be available in 0_weeks .
neutral	i proceeded with the order as i did want the 0 items , i received an e_mail to say that the items would be delivered on 00th_june , the order came but instead of a toilet_seat they sent me a toilet !
neutral	i contacted customer_service who told me that the toilet_seat was out of stock !
neutral	i was not happy at all !!
neutral	the lady said that she would ring back on monday , which she didn_'_t so i had to ring back and was told that she would check the picking order , she must still be checking it as she still_hasn_'_t rang back !
neutral	i am very disappointed and angry with the service and the customer_service received !
neutral	i doubt i would order anything_else from better_bathrooms as this is not acceptable !
neutral	i will probably have to contact customer_services again as i very much doubt they will contact me , they take your money but then you have all this inconvenience , i would shop around if i were you !!
neutral	!
neutral	i '_m understanding that the drive time family will help you purchase a car even with poor credit .
neutral	dog_food arrived quickly but was packaged poorly .
neutral	the air pouches didn_'_t even have air in them so there was no point in even including them in the box .
neutral	dog_food bag also had a hole in it .
neutral	good friendly staff and bey flexible with changes to the booking .
neutral	a little less flexible around the inventory ( it has to be agree when you book in and changes have to be done in branch ) and i didn_'_t know about the insurance costs until i finalised my booking .
neutral	it all adds up !
neutral	the car we rented was great and the service from auto_europe last time we rented brought us back again -- but our return was later than our pick - up time .
neutral	we had to pay an_additional full day rental .
neutral	i ordered new temperature control knobs .
neutral	for the correct year but they don_'_t fit .
neutral	the prices ( and price matching ) are outstanding .
neutral	the shipping quote is very accurate .
neutral	however , the check out process is very cumbersome especially when it comes to coupons .
neutral	you have to go through the entire checkout_process from creating your username thru the entering your full payment_method info to see if a coupon_code works .
neutral	you have to go back and this again for each coupon_code you want to try and 00_% of the time they do not work at all .
neutral	i got so frustrated with the checkout_process i very nearly gave up all together and went elsewhere .
neutral	other than this one issue the site is excellent .
neutral	if they fixed the checkout_process i would give them more stars
neutral	i just booked a hotel on bookit specifically because it seemed to be cheaper_than some of the other_sites .
neutral	however , when all was said and done after i booked , they decide to share with me about the hotel resort_fees and the parking fees , etc .
neutral	i would have been better off using a different site because at_least they put it right out there waist high over the plate .
neutral	i used your site after it was recommended on seat 00 .
neutral	it is great to be able to use one site for bookings across europe but unfortunately it didn_'_t quite work to plan .
neutral	a few niggles meant i actually had to use numerous other_sites as well .
neutral	firstly , the eurostar leg of my journey from london to barcelona was much more_expensive booking through you and i ended_up booking directly through them .
neutral	secondly , i was using your site for the paris to barcelona leg but couldn_'_t choose seats or even whether i could sit up or down in the tgv duplex .
neutral	this meant that i had to flick between your site , seat 00 and various other_places looking at seat plans and then having to reserve numerous tickets until i got decent seats .
neutral	not ideal and very time_consuming .
neutral	i will try your site again as i love the idea and hopefully some of these issues will be ironed out .
neutral	the order to delivery was painfully_slow , i had to keep calling to get updates .
neutral	delivery crew did not show or call for a scheduled delivery .
neutral	i had to call and figure_out that it had been canceled .
neutral	i thought these chairs were made of faux_leather .
neutral	at_least , that '_s what the website proclaimed .
neutral	when they arrived at my home i saw a label on each one '_s seat cover saying ' pu ', which is a layer of low standard but still real leather attached to a layer of plastic .
neutral	i never buy anything made from animal skin if i can help it because every piece of skin represents blood , terror and pain .
neutral	whilst the chairs are nice to look at and the brushed steel framework is sound and sturdy i won_'_t ever forget the blood and agony inside each seat .
neutral	there is no way to request a handicapped_accessible room on priceline .
neutral	so when i use priceline for a room reservation it '_s always with a bit of apprehension because i won_'_t know if it will be suitable for my wheelchair bound husband .
neutral	when we arrive at the hotel i can then ask if they have a handicapped_accessible room available .
neutral	sometimes we are not so fortunate .
neutral	shame on you , priceline , in this day and age !
neutral	hotwire has this feature on their page .
neutral	my booking went fine , but i intended to book direct with the hotel , and was surprised when i arrived and they told me i had booked through_expedia .
neutral	my marriott rewards number had not been taken , and i was unable to change to another location that had the fitness center i wanted .
neutral	i feel_duped that i wasn_'_t aware of who i booked with , and inconvenienced upon_arrival .
neutral	i am satisfied .
neutral	i placed order 0 / 00 .
neutral	0 days_later i received an_email_saying there would be a delay and asking if i wanted to cancel or have them ship 0 / 0 .
neutral	i chose later shipment .
neutral	there was no info as to what the problem was .
neutral	i would like to have had the choice of canceling the item causing the delay & just receiving the remaining order .
neutral	if received a shipped message 0 / 0 w_/ a notification that part of the order was being refunded but no inofrmation about which item ( s ) were being refunded .
neutral	when i sent an_email_asking for this info , it took several days to get a response .
neutral	i prefer quicker & more precise communication .
neutral	this the first time that we have used your company and were disappointed at the quality of the flowers .
neutral	i asked if the room was to be ' reserved ' with my credit_card , or will they charge it to me .
neutral	the answer was it is being reserved for you ... or of that nature .
neutral	i print my confirmation , and on the bottom , it says , " the full_amount has_been charged to your credit_card '.
neutral	that wasn_'_t the understanding .
neutral	this event in louisville is 0 months away ... life can change in 0 months .
neutral	the agent who helped_me was very courteous , and nice ... either he did not know , or something happened ?
neutral	?
neutral	the customer_service was great but the finished_product left something to be desired .
neutral	when these glasses originally arrived - there was glue on the frame and the case was used - otherwise the lining would not have been falling_apart .
neutral	then i had to send the glasses back because the lens kept popping out .
neutral	the people on the phone were great but there needs to be better quality control of the final glasses - the cases should not have the lining falling_apart and there should not be what i thought was glue on the frames .
neutral	order #_000000 not received .
neutral	i applied on line and was approved for 000 . 00 when i got to the store was only given 000 . 00 .
neutral	must have 0 consecutive payments in order to qualify for more when i paid in full would not issue me anymore higher loans .
neutral	good all - round experience .
neutral	communication between hispek and its delivery company was poor .
neutral	when i phoned the delivery office to check the arrival_date for my sebo vacuum_cleaner , i was told to phone the next_day as the details of my order couldn_'_t be found .
neutral	this happened around 0 pm and my machine was delivered the following afternoon .
neutral	luckily , someone was there to receive it , what about if nobody had been ?.
neutral	spoiled my , otherwise , good shopping_experience .
neutral	in general i was happy with hostelworld until i had to cancel one of my bookings .
neutral	although i had paid 0euro for cancellation protection & i made the cancellation via their website at_least 00_hours before arrival , hostelworld charged me the 00_% of my deposit & never really replied to my question why .
neutral	i am happy with the goods i purchased , everything looks better_than it does on the website .
neutral	the issues have been with having wrong items delivered :
neutral	0 .
neutral	i ordered a sink and received just the pedestal with no basin .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i asked for the basin to be delivered with a toilet .
neutral	i received 0 basins ( with no pedestals ), no toilet .
neutral	0 .
neutral	the toilet arrived .
neutral	acquiring the correct items means calling the premium_rate 0000 customer_service number several_times with no call back option which seems unfair as i incurred additional costs as a result of something that was not my fault .
neutral	the couriers were reluctant to bring the items to where i wanted them , despite the high delivery charge .
neutral	i used a competitor of this company to deliver some of the goods i needed for my bathroom and their service was impeccable .
neutral	i would warn you off this company if you need your goods delivered quickly and if you want a fast , hassle - free service otherwise , they ' re fine .
neutral	goods were fine and delivery from the worcester branch nice man but communication with your on line service terrible .
neutral	parcel arrived swiftly but revealed by city_link as the box was battered and open
neutral	i was very happy with the customer_service and thoroughness .
neutral	i felt well in the loop with the informative emails .
neutral	the flowers were delivered quickly and as scheduled .
neutral	my only_complaint was that the flowers delivered were very different from the ones pictured .
neutral	i even paid_extra for the " more " flowers option and it didn_'_t look like i got my money '_s worth that way .
neutral	i '_ve helped out in my uncles florist for years so maybe i just have really high_standards .
neutral	i placed a big order ( mats , rucsack , sleeping backs and many other little camping essentials on dec . 00 ).
neutral	i needed the presents before jan . 0th .
neutral	it just got in time eventhough i have to say that i did not get too much feedback from outdoor_shop nor the courier parcel_force when i was trying to track up my order .
neutral	got really nervous .
neutral	happy to have my things on time but 00 days seems a lot considering that they are charging much more than other online shops for delivery to spain .
neutral	it would be nice to include saturday delivery when paying around 00_pounds for the courier .
neutral	alpkit has sent us another parcel for under 00_pounds ind 0 days .
neutral	regarding the products , everything seems great except a sigg bottle that came like used and with a small leaking hole in the bottom .
neutral	besides all , i would recommend shopping at the outdoorshop .
neutral	my opinion is not very good because my product has not yet come , but if i want to say that shipping is very bad because it takes too many days to arrive , i look good to be delayed a month to get the product home .
neutral	thanks
neutral	very difficult to filter on site to sort items .
neutral	promo_codes offer are not accepted .
neutral	sales are unbelievable .
neutral	arrives fast and includes an easy to read packing_list to check items .
neutral	hostelworld . com provides travellers with a multitude of peer - reviewed accommodation options at the click of a mouse .
neutral	this is greatnfor travellers who would prefer to spend their time getting out and travelling as_opposed to researching for places to stay .
neutral	the site is user - friendly and convenient .
neutral	for the freque traveller , the ' gold card ' ($_00 ) is also a good idea as it will waive booking fees fir 00 months from the date of purchase .
neutral	great service but prices are better for new customers only .
neutral	loyal_customers get screwed in prices .
neutral	bought a wallet on sale but the shipping brought it up to a ridiculous price , other cheaper shipping options should be available .
neutral	i was really excited to receive my first order from onnit .
neutral	my only_qualm was with the way the jump rope was packaged .
neutral	it still has kinks in it .
neutral	hopefully they will be worked out soon .
neutral	also the strainer on my husbands shaker bottle broke the second day he had it , so that sucks .
neutral	i was excited to try the numi tea .
neutral	i as a whole have never liked black tea .
neutral	but i find this one is tolerable and the best one i '_ve tried however , i was hoping i would enjoy it .
neutral	the chocolate flavor was almost not noticeable .
neutral	i would like to say my shaker bottle works great and is not broken , and i have yet to try my macadamia nut butter .
neutral	overall , my experience was more bad than good .
neutral	but i will not give up on my pursuit of healthy and will order more in the future .
neutral	the dress i ordered was totally lovely but sadly i was sent the wrong_colour .
neutral	it took customer_services over 00_hrs to get back to me regarding the issue , they didn_'_t read my emails properly resulting in them asking me a question i had answered in my initial email , if they had read it properly and responded accordingly i would have had my outfit in time for my event , as it happens i had to run_out the morning of my ' do ' and buy a dress .
neutral	i did not like the dress as much as the one i ordered but it was at_least the right colour .
neutral	i had to send back the one i really liked as it was the wrong_colour and i could not afford to buy 0 right on top of christmas .
neutral	i have bought and kept and bought and returned stuff a number of times and usually have no problem but on this occasion i was on a limited time schedule to sort it out and ran_out of time .
neutral	i would recommend the site but recommed leaving heaps of time for your order so you have plenty of time to resolve any_issues .
neutral	i am used to flying delta and chose airtran for this vacation .
neutral	now i find out if i pick my seats in advance i have to pay extra !!!
neutral	i am not liking that too much .
neutral	delivery took too long , although im not sure if the storm we had here wouldve affected that im not sure .
neutral	but regardless the process of ordering was simple as usual i would order again from this site but i would go for express .
neutral	i would also recommend to make the tracking_system ( for customers use ) a bit easier or customer friendly , i had a bit of an_issue always trying to figure_out where it was .
neutral	idk it couldve just been me
neutral	great my order came so quickly ..... but the box_containing my order was ripped on three sides and could easily allowed my precious ponta frack cakes to fall out ... bad bad bad packaging
neutral	i called to ask about country of origin on the bully_sticks , pig_ears , etc .
neutral	and the customer_service representative advised me to " google " the products if i wanted to know .
neutral	the pig_ears that i received were scrappy looking and from india ... into the compost bin they went !
neutral	i have used partsgeek a few_times in the past and have not had any trouble with
neutral	the parts i have received .
neutral	this one was plastic with clips , and all the clips were broken off .
neutral	it should have never been shipped without a box and packing to protect
neutral	the emblem .
neutral	wrong shoes .
neutral	wrong_colour .
neutral	right box .
neutral	cost over_£_00 to return .
neutral	hope i '_m getting a full_refund !
neutral	!
neutral	quick to refund !
neutral	happy_bunny :)
neutral	i '_m pleased with the quality of the outdoor material and the color , and on sale , the price was very acceptable .
neutral	the website , though , did not work properly .
neutral	my first order didn_'_t go through and the one order that did go through confirmed i ordered a burgundy pillow , but they sent a khaki - colored one and even showed that color on the packing_slip .
neutral	i had it sent to the store to save the $_00 shipping charge , which i think is excessive .
neutral	the store is over 000_miles_away , but i pass that way occasionally .
neutral	the stored screwed_up and didn_'_t place my replacement order , which i did over the phone , so it got complicated .
neutral	still the company has a good selection and i '_m pleased with my purchase .
neutral	the benzoyl plus shampoo that i received has an expiration_date which is only a few_months away .
neutral	a fresh bottle would have had an expiration_date well into 0000 .
neutral	the other two products that i received are fine .
neutral	products are good , ease of not having to go to the store .
neutral	but it takes way to long to get here
neutral	this company has great prices and fast shipping but their customer_service is not good at all .
neutral	i had an order that i never received and i called them and email them twice and never got a response back .
neutral	so as long as every thing goes fine with your order you will be fine !
neutral	i thought i was booking hotel through la_quinta .
neutral	come to find out it was through a third_party .
neutral	i was not told that i would be charged immediately instead of in the usual fashion at checkout .
neutral	the only way i was aware of the charge is by checking my credit_card statement which i normally do frequently due to so much fraud .
neutral	it made me nervousness when i checked out travers . com . us which is what was on the the credit_card .
neutral	there were many post about fraud by this company on line as well as a warning on trip_advisor .
neutral	i called the hotel and verified that they had my reservation and they did , stating it was booked through_expedia .
neutral	i was given the cancellation_policy and the person making my reservation was very courteous .
neutral	i told him i was attending a wedding and rooms were blocked .
neutral	i do not think he really checked on the rate because it was somewhat lower when speaking with the hotel direct .
neutral	i probably will only call the hotels directly in the future to avoid this confusion .
neutral	i love tripadvisor and use it on every trip for ideas .
neutral	however , the map functionality is terrible - when you click on the map , it doesn_'_t move and offer other things when you move the map .
neutral	a link with google_maps or something similar would also enable getting directions to a particular place - on a recent_trip , my husband and i really wanted to visit a restaurant , but we were never successful in finding it because we were unfamiliar with how local addressing ( in thailand ) worked .
neutral	also , it would be great to be able to shuffle results by attributes , like see hotels ranked by location , if that '_s the most_important thing to me .
neutral	we booked our cancun hotel and car_rental through_travelocity .
neutral	before final check out when purchasing online , travelocity offered us an insurance_policy to fully cover our rental_car with the incentive of ' saving money ' and adding an_additional driver .
neutral	when we arrived to fox car_rental to pick_up our car we were told that the travelocity insurance_policy was not upheld and that we would need to pay an_additional_$_00 per day for full coverage and pay a fee for the second driver .
neutral	when you ' re in a different country , unable to call travelocity without incurring roaming charges and unable to negotiate with the rental company because they won_'_t let you drive the car off the lot without paying the additional_fees upfront , you wonder_if you should have booked your trip elsewhere .
neutral	don_'_t buy the full car insurance through_travelocity if you are going abroad - the vendors will not recognize the policy and you '_ll have to pay double !
neutral	better bargains now found at morrisons
neutral	too much advertising rubbish on the pages now
neutral	good are creeping up in price
neutral	0_stars only as delivery is taking longer and longer
neutral	sizes are crazy .
neutral	i order 0 pair of shoes , all 0 . 0 and only one of them fit .
neutral	i '_m a true 0 . 0 and never have had problems ordering online .
neutral	if they had customer product reviews maybe i would '_ve found out from other customers that i needed to order half a size up .
neutral	shipping is not that great , but ok for the price i '_m paying overall .
neutral	this was my first time using harrisburg_store to order a much needed dr . who toy for my son who loves doctor who .
neutral	since they were sold out on amazon , i googled the item and harrisburgstore . com shoed up as an_independent seller of the item he wanted .
neutral	i was given december 00 as the arrrival date , but received the item on december 00 ( after we had gone out of town for the holiday ).
neutral	on ther other hand , the no shipping fee was great !
neutral	much_better you are not charging a fee for returning items .
neutral	could improve it with free delivery .
neutral	i order from boohoo quite regally .
neutral	i am normally quite happy with the purchases but a few_times i have had to send some items back as they are faulty .
neutral	this time there seemed to be a big stain across one of the dresses i ordered & the dress was far to long for a person of my size , the length of the dress was never stated on the website .
neutral	i have also found over time that the stitching on the dresses i have brought seems to come apart fairly easy .
neutral	i am not sure if the dresses or items are checked before sending ?
neutral	i do love the dresses on the website but after purchasing these items & based on the above it does make me think_twice about ordering again from boohoo .
neutral	the quality of the tee_shirt is good but the sizing is not very accurate compared to most other clothes .
neutral	the sizes come up very small and you have to purchase at_least a size_bigger which is not very helpful when you are buying for a present .
neutral	i purchased 0 total cartridges and 0 of them worked fine but the cyan would not work in my printer .
neutral	they sent me a replacement one and it wouldn_'_t work either .
neutral	customer_service was helpful and is sending me a return_label to mail them back for a full_refund .
neutral	i like the look of them and they are very flexible ie not hard
neutral	i normally have a size 0 but chose size 0 so could put socks inside , but unfortunately will be unable to do so because they do come up a bit tight .
neutral	would have liked to have given 0_stars
neutral	if you can come up with a solution would be good as i dont really want to spend money on postage .
neutral	kind_regards yvonne
neutral	dress has not been delivered yet .,.
neutral	the storage_unit i have is great but it doesn_'_t have a light and going threw my stuff would make it easier with a inside light .
neutral	received first car in geneva which seemed ok . heat did not work and worse , defroster did not work .
neutral	the weather was such that no defroster could have caused accident .
neutral	we drove back to the airport and they gave_us another car .
neutral	this one was not suited for off highway driving - snowy mountain roads .
neutral	it was slippery and dangerous and no chains were included .
neutral	we had to go back again for chains .
neutral	i was very disappointed at the rental , especially for the amount of money we spent .
neutral	we lost time and gas going back to geneva twice .
neutral	on the positive side , the people at the desk were very understanding and polite and were at no fault .
neutral	i ordered my scarves in oct , was told they wouldn_'_t ship till dec . then , right before they were supposed to ship i was told that the scarves i ordered were out and that i would have to re - order .
neutral	i am disappointed that this happened and that i was not offered some small thing to make up for my wait and then for re - ordering .
neutral	the email for the re - ordering also did not include instructions on what to do so i have to email and ask them .
neutral	once i recieved my scarves i was happy - i like them and they ' re very nice and long .
neutral	but i would not order from them again because of the wait and error .
neutral	i was sent many directions to get my title changed and ended_up after weeks just giving my title to the drive time dealership .
neutral	then i realized i didnt have much of a selection and just took what i could get .
neutral	i noticed there was a " blue water light " on and the saleswoman told me it was just the brights ... she was wrong ... it is the coolant light .
neutral	the front_bumper is not securely on and the back passenger door rim in falling_off .
neutral	i hope this will be resolved very soon .

neutral	achica needs to overhaul its approach to customer_services and let the customer actually speak to a human when a problem arises .
neutral	we had a very bad_experience with a delivery that went completely wrong - ultimately took over a month from the initial delivery attempt to our old address .
neutral	all of the frustrations we experienced would have been resolved immediately if achica actually allowed direct contact with the customer_services team .
neutral	we had numerous attempts to speak with them using their contact form and each time asking them to call us directly so we could sort the problem out but all we got were standard replies that looked as though they came straight off a script !
neutral	!
neutral	great site but achica really need to sort out their customer_services !
neutral	i sent my bits to music_magpie in mid october , paid in mid november .
neutral	i understand that the items need reviewing and testing but really ...
neutral	i gave my bank_details when i registered to sell , but got an_email after about two_weeks asking me to " verify " them which i immediately did but which apparently took 0 - 0 working days for anyone at music_magpie to accept and then another 0 - 0 working days for the transfer of money when i can '_t think of any individual or organisation who has transferred money to / from a bank_account within the last_year and it has taken more than 00_hours .
neutral	enjoy the cds music_magpie , you got a lot of highly resellable stuff for a small outlay .
neutral	next time i '_ll stick to ebay .
neutral	i am a little disappointed as i have not received my order that was placed on june_00th .
neutral	also , i have not received any kind of update as to the status of my order .
neutral	i like ordering from the site and most times the prices are good , but it would be nice to be updated .
neutral	i ordered cat_food with the intent of feeding it to my cats , but i ran_out of their old food and had to buy another bag as i have not received my order yet .
neutral	room was ok , temperature & tv issues called the front_desk nobody ever showed .
neutral	but beds were comfy & bell men was great !
neutral	the iodine tastes like an antiseptic , but it seems to work
neutral	good quality but sizes aren_'_t very generous large feels more like medium !
neutral	it would have been helpful if the agent had offered any discounts .
neutral	i am a senior_citizen and also an aaa member .
neutral	i could perhaps have saved myself some dollars if he had taken the time to inquire .
neutral	i have not yet tried the skinz yet , but tried to add the matching_wallpaper to my iphone .
neutral	the phone says it is not compatible , therefore my whole concept of kitchy tardis phone have been diminished .
neutral	i sold 00 dvds for only 0ish pounds , which took a bit more than a month the entire_process to finally receive that amount on my account .
neutral	worth it ?
neutral	not sure , but the idea is good and having someone_who comes for your stuff is comfortable .
neutral	i did returns few items as they didn_'_t fit well , but they were great although the delivery wasn_'_t great .
neutral	it is a shame that you do not make them for kids because the ladies sleeves are to long for the kids and i would have bought more if they were in kids sizes as i have another three kids wanting one
neutral	i paid for product immediately on purchase through paypal , got receipt from them and money deducted from my account .
neutral	received item promptly but also now lots of emails saying i have not paid when i have .
neutral	records need checked and updated as i will not be classed as bad payer because of your mistakes
neutral	the order was easy to order and came quickly ... however ... some of the food items i ordered had an expired " good by " date .
neutral	not cool !!
neutral	!
neutral	on a positive the room was clean .
neutral	the beds were comfortable , everything worked in the room .
neutral	the continental_breakfast was well stocked .
neutral	front_desk staff was seriously lacking courtesy , dress etiquette , education .
neutral	we were locked out of our rooms on our second stay and the desk_clerk managed to blame us for the problem .
neutral	the front_desk girl tried to bill my room to someone_else '_s credit_card .
neutral	no_matter_how many people were in line at the front_desk the clerk was slower_than molasses on a cold day !
neutral	you could here every noise going on in the hotel .
neutral	the speed in which we took delivery was excellent , and the delivery company most helpful , especially over the christmas_period .
neutral	why bother with toilets seats ???
neutral	came off after a couple of uses and one even snapped .... nightmare trying to find seats of a good quality to fit the toilet .
neutral	everything is very prompt and well_organised it seems .
neutral	although my package did take 0 days instead of the three that they recommended , and as a result i had to renew my order .
neutral	i then needed to supply id after they had recieved the package , and the cheque was mailed to me two_days_later ... the only part i have a problem with is that it has_been 0 business days and the cheque is still not cleared .
neutral	this worries me somewhat as they may not have the money that they promised me for my iphone .
neutral	everything is very quick when it comes to processing the order , i ' d just like to see the money .
neutral	we parked our vehicle at the phoenix sky harbor airport holiday_inn express for our recent 0 - day trip .
neutral	the hotel was easy to find and the shuttle driver who took us to the airport was very helpful , handling all our bags and my rolling walker for us , making sure that all our bags were placed up on the sidewalk so we wouldn_'_t have to lift them over the curb .
neutral	unfortunately , the shuttle van was a rattle trap that had a broken seatbelt clip on the seat where my husband sat .
neutral	when he reached for the seatbelt to buckle himself in , his hand hit a very sharp metal clip where the device had broken off .
neutral	it '_s fortunate that he didn_'_t cut himself because he bleeds easily due to medications he takes for a heart condition .
neutral	we were told that the seatbelt had been broken a couple of years .
neutral	it is unacceptable to us to have this hazardous condition go un - repaired .
neutral	on the return trip , a different driver picked us up at the airport .
neutral	his service was mediocre at best , doing nothing more than lift our bags into and out of the van .
neutral	we had to bring the luggage over to him where he stood at the back of the van , and he asked my 00 - year - old husband to put the walker up onto the luggage .
neutral	at the hotel , he again expected us to move our 0 pieces of luggage and my walker from the van over to the sidewalk ( a distance of about 0 - 00 feet ) without assistance from him .
neutral	next time we need airport_parking , we will_definitely consider_using global_airport_parking again , but will choose a different hotel since there are others from which to select .
neutral	i ordered four led_clip - on pet_safety_lights ( two red , two blue ).
neutral	when i opened the first blue one it would not stay lit .
neutral	the second blue on worked for two_nights then it quit_working .
neutral	i have only used one red one so_far , and it is working good .
neutral	they are a big help when they work .
neutral	i have two all black , med .
neutral	sized dogs .
neutral	at night they lie on the floor , in a dark room and i and my husband have taken a couple tumbles over them .
neutral	we are senior_citizens and falls are bad_news .
neutral	i let them outdoors at night to have a nature call .
neutral	there are spots in the yard where they are in the shadow of our shed from the pole light .
neutral	i can '_t see them ( i think they know that ) and they will stand there and look at me .
neutral	but with those little lights i can see them .
neutral	problem_solved .... except when the lights quit_working .
neutral	i would send them back to be replaced , but it would cost more to do that , than what they cost .
neutral	so , what do i do ?
neutral	send them back or order more .
neutral	i really like them , but , so_far the quality doesn_'_t make it an easy decision .
neutral	i would like to get more of them , if it were possible , but don_'_t know what to do .
neutral	i was able to replace a ring on my stethescope which i have had for 00 years !
neutral	i was so happy until i saw the receipt in the box .
neutral	this cost was not revealed in four emails sent to me either .
neutral	the cost of the product was less_than $ 0 . 00 but shipping was more than $_00 . 00 .
neutral	when i called , the gentlemen that took my call could not have been nicer .
neutral	he stated that this happens when the customer places the order .
neutral	somehow the way the website is set_up , it allows you to pick a service to ship your product overnight .
neutral	i order items on line frequently and was aware that i only wanted usps shipping , which was free .
neutral	he said that one of the departments usually picks_up on this .
neutral	this problem should be fixed immediately !
neutral	even if someone wanted the faster service , this is an outrageous price for shipping .
neutral	please be fair to your customers .
neutral	we are in the health field doing a good thing , don_'_t take_advantage !
neutral	please !!!
neutral	!
neutral	not bad for a large company , love the amount of coupons that i get from them
neutral	to protect myself , i purchased cancellation insurance but apparently , it only protects the hotelier , after one checks in .
neutral	too late , for the guest , if the place turns_out to be less that frank , with their arrangements and one doesn_'_t find out , until that first , horrible , sleepless night .
neutral	then , you are stuck .
neutral	am still trying to get my money back from hw but perhaps , i '_m supposed to get it directly , from the hotelier .
neutral	personally , i think hw should mediate in this situation ( since they benefit from that position , beforehand , they should offer that , afterwards , also ) and get the hostel to refund my money , with no questions_asked , so , i needn '_t continue to stress during my vacation .
neutral	so_far , they haven_'_t and i have had to continue a frustrating e_- mail conversation , with them , to get this resolved .
neutral	still no acceptable answer , after 0 days of waiting .
neutral	sincerely , db
neutral	although it seemed to take a long time to receive my order ; when it arrived i was very pleased with it .
neutral	i liked what i received from pet_flow .
neutral	i thought they sale prices were great which is why i ordered .
neutral	however , one item was no_longer stocked so you kept my $ 0 .
neutral	i would prefer that any co . either refund or not charge me in the first place .
neutral	the second problem was sending the wrong item .. i wanted a dog magnet and you sent a cat one .
neutral	again i would expect to get the correct item and not a mistake or a substitute .
neutral	i decided to use the particular website due to the discount offered and the ability to have this shipped .
neutral	i have 0 puppies who due to an illness require prescription food for a few_months .
neutral	though i can purchase this at my vet '_s office , having the convenience of delivery was what i was looking for .
neutral	i placed my order on a sunday , verified with my vet that they faxed the prescription to petflow '_s 0rd_party pharmacy monday_morning and yet by wednesday the pharmacy was sending me emails saying my vet hasn_'_t responded and i was concerned i would run_out of food ( the ability to get to the vet that week was difficult ).
neutral	it took several calls between me , my vet and petflow and between my vet and petflow '_s pharmacy to clear this up as the vet '_s rx was still in the fax que at the pharmacy .
neutral	then i received an_email_saying my card was declined .
neutral	i called ... again and luckily spoke to the same rep as the previous two times ( who was very nice and helpful ).
neutral	she confirmed that the payment was good , there seemed to be no reason i received the email .
neutral	several hours_later i received another email_telling_me my card was declined .
neutral	i called back .... again ; and again , no reason for the email , i was told that the order went through correctly .
neutral	thankfully , i received the food exactly when i needed it .
neutral	i '_ve worked retail and customer_service , so i understand things can be crazy with computers and coordinating orders .
neutral	so i am willing to give it another try when i need to reorder .
neutral	as i said , the rep was very nice , helpful , and even gave_me 00_%_off toward my next purchase , so i will reorder and if all goes well , i will_continue to order from here and may even keep ordering from here once the dogs are off the rx food and order the regular food from here .
neutral	i really like the convenience of having it delivered .
neutral	flowers were ok , but when i has to email customer_service regarding delivery , they were extremely_rude
neutral	the trophy arrived one day later than it was supposed to and so i was out and had to collect it the following_day from the post_office .
neutral	when i collected it it was wrapped in a plastic_bag saying it had been damaged and re wrapped but when i opened it it was 000_% ok inside .
neutral	i found it somewhat annoying that i had to wait to place my order .
neutral	even if the place isn_'_t open over the weekend , i should still be able to place my order .
neutral	i '_m not sure i understand what that is all about .
neutral	if you don_'_t need ink fast , the prices are reasonable .
neutral	customer_service answered my questions , but did not go the extra step to find out when my ink would be arriving .
neutral	it was easy to book but why no senior discount or aarp ??
neutral	?
neutral	you '_ve got nice clothing but need more x - large , the shoes are also nice but most of the time the sizes are too small so when i order my size ( 0 ) it doesn_'_t fit i have to go one size up and sometime it '_s too big
neutral	i '_m really disappointed by receiving the wrong part & i not being_able to speak to anyone about it .
neutral	the prices are good & delivery was on time .
neutral	i need to send it back & haven_'_t heard from anyone .
neutral	i found it very easy to find what i wanted .
neutral	the merchandise was shipped out very quick , and i got it in record_time .
neutral	however , i was not impressed with the quality .
neutral	i found he quality of the merchandise i order to be poor .
neutral	i was impress with how fast my order came , but less_than happy with the quality .
neutral	make_sure you look over / check out , the merchandise you want really well first .
neutral	sometimes the lowest_price is not always the best .
neutral	i used travelocity for the first time recently and booked a one way airline_ticket on silver airways .
neutral	i found the website easy to use but when it came time to check in online , it was a bit_confusing .
neutral	when i clicked the " check in " link , i was taken to expedia . com , didn_'_t see my airline and the frequently asked questions didn_'_t really help .
neutral	i tried " contact customer_service " but was advised that it had a 00 hour turn_around and i was trying to check in online for a flight same day .
neutral	i ended_up just going to the airlines website and checking in online that way .
neutral	the website calculator requires the make and year of car and go . i assume it showed the size and tire prices for my car .
neutral	but instead when i got to the garage they told me that i calculated wrong and pointed_out my mistake .
neutral	so i could either leave or have the correct size installed for more money .
neutral	then they add the additional_cost for the valve stems , waste , etc .
neutral	what i thought would cost $_000_+ now cost approx $_000 . there is no charge for the front_wheel_alignment , but the all four wheel_alignment cost $_00 that i opted for .
neutral	the service was great the employees were courteous and helpful .
neutral	i would go back to them but the first page where it requires the make and model should indicate the correct size tire and then go shoud follow ,
neutral	i have purchased from victoria_plumb in the past and been pleased .
neutral	on this occasion i was asked to rate the service before delivery .
neutral	having been asked to wait in for 0 hours the delivery came half an_hour after the 0 hours !
neutral	we are doing up the house which has had the bathroom removed so it was a long 0 hours !
neutral	pleased with the product though .
neutral	the flowers i ordered arrived a whole day early .
neutral	at the point of ordering i was asked a delivery date and specified it was for a birthday , therefore i assumed it would arrive on the date i requested , or else why bother asking a date to be delivered ?
neutral	other then the above the service was good , but i was disappointed the surprise was ruined by the early arrival .
neutral	the people are too pushy and do no tmkae me comfortabe with them .
neutral	all the experience was very good , but a worker in particular didn_'_t give us a correct treat .
neutral	in all honesty the website is pretty good , i just wish there were more places that delivered in manchester , other then that i love using the website .
neutral	i don_'_t know how you came up with the parking total for the number of days we ' re gone .
neutral	for each hotel a price is listed per day , but multiplying the number of days by that amount did not yield the subtotal quoted .
neutral	this is a big deal !
neutral	the first time i have ordered , the shipping was leisurely , and the watch i had ordered was " out of stock ."
neutral	don_'_t buy these bowls if your dog is small .
neutral	my pug can '_t reach the food .
neutral	tongue not long enough .
neutral	wish they had smaller once and not as deap .
neutral	packaging was terrible .....
neutral	thin cardboard_box was crushed torn exposing cloth cover around mirror .
neutral	mirror was ok but can '_t_believe they thought so little of their product that they would ship it like that .
neutral	i was pleased with how quickly my order arrived , plus the free delivery .
neutral	however , first time purchasers were promised a $_00 . 00 discount , which i did not receive .
neutral	and when i e_- mailed to question that , i received no response .
neutral	good website and excellent product range . just a shame you cannot order from a smartphone , only pc . it would be better if they could adapt the ordering system to use on phones as not all of us can_afford broadband ! excellent service over the phone though . james who i spoke to was polite and helpful .
neutral	things happen , i '_ll continue to be a customer
neutral	i placed a single order for 0 led_collar_lights .
neutral	while i was notified via_email that my order had shipped , was never provided with a tracking code .
neutral	upon_opening my package not only was there no packing_slip but i was missing one of the lights .
neutral	i called back to report my issue and the csr said i may not have received my entire order as they are now on clearance and may be out of stock .
neutral	upon further_investigation , they had them in stock and she shipped the missing light to me .
neutral	no offer for reimbursement , no offer to send me an_additional piece , no nothing for my hassle .
neutral	upon shipment , i was once again notified of its mailing but no tracking and once again no package slip .
neutral	i have since unsubscribed from their emails as i have no interest in ordering form them again as i do not feel they are a professional company that i would like to do_business with again , let_alone try to order consumable items for my pets .
neutral	superfin service med meddelelse om ankomst og tidspunkt , men jeg bliver temmelig irriteret over at modtage sms herom lørdag morgen kl .
neutral	00 . 00 , hvor jeg_ville sove lidt længere .
neutral	i weekenden bør der_ikke sendes sms før kl .
neutral	0 . 00 .
neutral	practical and useful .
neutral	i am very satisfied with it as a supplement to dictionaries in book form , but it cannot stand alone .
neutral	i received the costume in an acceptable amount of time .
neutral	the costume i received has a hole in it .
neutral	i did not bring it to the company '_s attention because i just had a bad_experience with a different online costume company and didn_'_t want a hassle .
neutral	plus i can probably sew it and fix i myself .
neutral	however , i '_m sure that if i had brought it to the company '_s attention they would have tried to rectify the situation .
neutral	although the costume is pretty cute , its very cheap .
neutral	thin material and there wasn_'_t a between size .
neutral	the medium was way to short and the large was so_far past her feet .
neutral	i will have to alter it myself .
neutral	not really worth the money i paid but what can you do ?
neutral	all and all i would probably order from this company again .
neutral	i needed a gameplay card and i had to pay an extra $ 0 . 00 to get it digitally .
neutral	i '_m disabled so that is majorly annoying cause i can '_t pop down to the 0 - 00 when i need a card .
neutral	but i did get it rather quickly .
neutral	ok but a bit soft
neutral	i ordered a part and emailed , called and got no phone_call back and no email so i needed the part and just ordered my part without_any help from your customer_service dept .
neutral	nice dresses but too expensive with shipping cost and customs
neutral	i had a wonder fult time at the lakes .
neutral	perfect view from the hostel , nice staff , booked 0 bed_dorm , got a 0 bed one .
neutral	really looking_forward to come_back as i ´ ve heard the hostel will get renovated this winter with 000 beds less but al en - suit .
neutral	part was the cheapest anywhere .
neutral	shipping was expensive for a $ 0 . 00 small part the weighed next to nothing .
neutral	took 00_minutes to assemble ( not the 00 stated ) and had weak patch on edge binding .
neutral	however now assembled it is working well but now we worry how strong it will be over time .
neutral	i tried to read the label ( even with the help of a magnifying glass ) and it wasn_'_t real easy .
neutral	just now starting some of the supplements ... so can '_t give a review yet .
neutral	the hand_written note with my order was " charming "... but seemed pretty unprofessional .
neutral	will see what the future holds ...
neutral	i hae ordered loads of vouchers and got great deals and have been very happy with my wowchers .
neutral	unfortunately because they do not offer a refund or credit if you change your mind in the future i am now much more cautious and less likely to use wowcher as_opposed to other voucher websites that will credit your account if your change your mind .
neutral	first time i ordered a bag of dog_food the bag had a huge slash across the back , half the food dumped out into the box .
neutral	they did send a replacement without charge .
neutral	second time i ordered bargain treats , one of the treat bags bottom was open .
neutral	they were merrick jerky_treats pack of 00 only had 0 in there .
neutral	this last time i ordered everything was accounted for just took 0 days to get here , all my orders take a bit of time to get to me .
neutral	by getting charged sales_tax that tells_me they have a warehouse in my state .
neutral	i didn_'_t get an_email until 0 days after my order that it was getting shipped out .
neutral	didn_'_t get shipped out until the 0rd day .
neutral	they do have good prices in some of the treats .
neutral	en cuanto a los porductos no tengo ninguna queja .
neutral	son de buena calidad y a un precio muy competitivo .
neutral	pero los gastos de envío hacen que lo_que en un principio parece muy barato , no lo sea tanto .
neutral	además , el envío ha tardado casi dos semanas en llegar cuando en otras webs lo envían en 00 - 00 horas .
neutral	i don_'_t know why my records with identity_guard can '_t be updated more often .
neutral	this is almost april and my reports are showing based on reports from last december !!
neutral	come on !
neutral	!
neutral	i had to upgrade to get an adjoining room . the hotel never got the request . we could have got adjoining_rooms with the $_00 . 00 rate per room however they did have any clean rooms and then of course it was in the south tower the old part of the property . i was happy with the upgraded rooms in the north tower .
neutral	i paid $_00 extra and did not receive the book until 0 days_later .
neutral	your prices are at better rate where i have bought elsewhere
neutral	i originally placed my order on 00 - 00 - 00 , thinking that would be plenty of time for my order to arrive before we left for vacation on 00 - 00 with our 0 dogs for the oregon coast .
neutral	i just wanted to be able to take a bully_stick for each dog with us on vacation .
neutral	at first , the site said my order was being_processed for shipping .
neutral	the next_day , it said backordered .
neutral	what ?
neutral	i sent an e_- maila nd was assured it would be shipped out that very day .
neutral	it did not .
neutral	did not actually ship ( according to the fedex site ) until 00 - 00 .
neutral	we left for vacation on 00 - 00 around 0 : 00 and the order did not arrive until after 0 : 00 that day , so it sat on our front_porch until we got home on labor day .
neutral	they still love the bully_sticks , but it was to late for vacation .
neutral	i guess my only point is - if you are going to spam facebook with your sale ads , you better make_sure you are ready for the volume of orders that will come in so you can best serve your customers .
neutral	normally have no_problems with boohoo . com , last order didnt arrive and customer_services seemed very unintrested and didnt even respond when 0_weeks had passed and hadnt recieved my parcel .
neutral	resorted in messaging the boohoo facebook_page and was suprised at how helpful the 0 people i spoke to were .
neutral	the facebook_page was very helpful and honest about the parcel which had gone missing .
neutral	the website is simple to use but hiding the vat is a little sneaky - it makes you look much_cheaper_than the others
neutral	i used the self parking and my car was safely kept .
neutral	but the service from the attendant when checking out was awful .
neutral	they were completely unstructured , had lost / misplaced another customers '_s keys and then took_forever to process my check out due to the fact that i was improperly informed union dropping_off my car .
neutral	i joined the rewards club at easy_comforts as i am handicapped and thought i might use it several_times .
neutral	the number they sent me did not work , so i finally had to call to get another number that would work .
neutral	the young_lady i spoke with was not the kindest .
neutral	she seemed perturbed with me .
neutral	i finally got a number that would work , but i still have to pay $ 0 . 00 for processing each time , regardless of their ad for " free_shipping " on all orders .
neutral	i have not been as pleased as i thought i would be .
neutral	the products don_'_t seem to change that much either .
neutral	once you look through the items , they stay the same .
neutral	i was annoyed when i came to use new year special voucher it wouldn_'_t work nothing obvious in advert to say there was a quota and use before runs out .
neutral	the he following_day there was another offer but not as good .
neutral	i have used before and no_problems but feel should make it clear offer is for certain number .
neutral	items ( doggie_treats ) were small sizes
neutral	didn_'_t turn up on the delivery day with no_explanation .
neutral	rang up the next_day and staff were helpful but it still didn_'_t turn up until after 0pm , 0 day late .
neutral	mattress is fantastic though , amazingly comfy .
neutral	the buses were busy and some were flooded upstairs .
neutral	one point forced to sit_down stairs and the windows were so dirty it was hard to see out of them .
neutral	staff not very friendly
neutral	i recently booked a shuttle to airport for my mother and found a change in the website since i had last booked .
neutral	there was no_longer a short description of the service you were reserving , such as covered valet_parking , or uncovered valet_parking .
neutral	i was left to assume that when 0 prices showed_up the higher price one was the covered parking .
neutral	even after i booked there was no confirmation that stated which service i had purchased .
neutral	that being said my mother has always been happy with the service .
neutral	i bought some beef jerky ( something that i really love but is very expensive so wanted to buy it in bulk ) and although the price is good , i '_m afraid i don_'_t like the product .
neutral	i bought a mixed batch and every flavour i '_ve tried so_far has_been far too salty .
neutral	i won_'_t be buying any more , sorry !
neutral	i '_ve ordered from this site before and have had no_problems .
neutral	this time , i ordered 0 bathing suites .
neutral	two were correct size , color , etc .
neutral	-- as expected .
neutral	the third suit , however , was the correct color .... but not the correct size and there were no tags and the protective liner was missing , which to me , says that it was possibly a used / returned suit that was then stuck in a box and mailed to me .
neutral	i did notice that when we were trying to order online , the website was not adding suits to our cart ... and then when it did add a suit , it was the wrong one .
neutral	we kept having to go back and re - add suits .
neutral	so , i '_m giving the benefit of the doubt here and assuming that technical_issues were the reason for the size issue .
neutral	however , i '_m still a little disturbed that the suit did not have any tags or a liner protector .
neutral	overall though , i would order from this site again .
neutral	for a few printings the new inkfarm cartridges worked fine and my papers printed well , but after just a few printings , the computer says the cartridges have failed and i need to replace them .
neutral	too expensive to do this !
neutral	however , the ink was sent fast .
neutral	eye masks ordered for upcoming party .
neutral	they arrived in a padded_envelope and were not packaged as per the item description .
neutral	half were in the bag loose and a lot were marked and in general poor condition
neutral	i love pet_flow .. great prices and quick shipping .
neutral	but , i was disappointed this time because something i ordered was not available that i was really waiting to get .
neutral	instead of sending an_email_saying i was not going to get it , i just got an order that was " short " with no explaination .... and i was still charged for the items !
neutral	i had to email them and then call because i really wanted the item and not a refund !
neutral	i was simply told that they were sold out .
neutral	ok , well then why did it let_me order ??
neutral	?
neutral	if you ' re purchasing any of the personalized jewelry , spend the few extra dollars for the double - strength metal .
neutral	the regular strength breaks easily .
neutral	be cautious also of the chain .
neutral	the necklaces do not come as pendants on a chain , so if you break the chain , you ' re out of luck .
neutral	contact customer_support and they should ( they did for me ) send you a new chain , or you can mail it back and have them attach the new chain .
neutral	extremely slow shipping .
neutral	they state on their website that it can take up to 00 days after they ship it for you to receive it -- my second purchase actually took 00 days to receive ( that '_s after they ship it ).
neutral	of course any personalized item will take weeks to make - but it seems shipping actually takes_longer_than making the item .
neutral	more_expensive than i expected .
neutral	ordering process was easy … much_easier than amex !
neutral	but i '_m still_waiting to get the customized card i ordered .
neutral	sizing_chart is confusing i got a l when i needed an xl will stick to shoes next time
neutral	suggestions : it would be nice to receive an_email the day the product is shipped .
neutral	also on the last page of ordering the product , an add appears that you cannot x out of .
neutral	it is not clear if the order went thru or not .
neutral	i did like receiving an_email from you that the order was placed .
neutral	you used to ship usps .
neutral	i could order wednesday_morning , and have my order by saturday .
neutral	now you ship ups and it takes until wednesday !
neutral	a week !
neutral	go back to the usps !
neutral	i found dealing_with powerhouse staff really good both by email and on the telephone .
neutral	however they use xdp to deliver their orders and they are appalling , all credit to powerhouse for intervening to get my equipment delivered on the 0rd attempt and giving me a discount and some free mats as compensation , which would tempt me to try ordering again from them .
neutral	we made 0 orders for bundles of lights , after putting up 0 sets of lights , one set failed within an_hour of being switched on .
neutral	after telephoning them we were told we had to send back the faulty lights , they would test them and if faulty they would replace .
neutral	it took another 0 phone_calls - with them telling us they would call back and never doing so , to being told the lights had been dispatched on their standard delivery adding another 0 days to us eventually receiving the replacements .
neutral	the lights are a nice product but i would be wary of ordering again from them in view of their poor customer care when a problem does occur .
neutral	couldn_'_t track book - even contacted company for tracking_info - gave_me a tracking_number but it didn_'_t work .
neutral	company is slow .
neutral	i thought this was a neat gift to give but when it didnt arrive for christmas i had to get something_else for that person .
neutral	im still_waiting for it but other than that it looks like a very cool gift to give out just plan_ahead so you wont be waiting like me .
neutral	quality wasnt great
neutral	with the $_00 cost of shipping my core back to parts_geek my alternator ended_up costing me $_000 .
neutral	if i add the cost of gas and the time it took for me to ship the core back , my alternator cost was really close to $_000 , while it is advertised for $_000 .
neutral	i could have gotten a better deal elsewhere if i purchased the alternator for $_000 and not worried_about returning the core .
neutral	include return shipping cost in the price and you will get more stars .
neutral	site shows listings for standard process supplements but none are ever in stock .
neutral	that ' sso frustrating .
neutral	remove listing or show only what you have in stock .
neutral	the stamps are great - love being_able to print and measure on demand .
neutral	over a weekend though , their credit_card processing went down , causing me to lose time on a large marketing project .
neutral	person_who took my reservations was clueless !
neutral	i gave my dates , and he booked them for the wrong month !
neutral	i also asked several_times if i will be charged at checkin and not now and he said yes .
neutral	once i discovered he booked for the wrong month , i called to cancel .
neutral	got an_email_saying my credit_card was charged the full_amount .
neutral	called back and they said its pre_- paid and no refunds .
neutral	told them about the dates being booked wrong and so they agreed to refund me , but i had to fight for the refund .
neutral	giftcards . com was easy to use but i found that the emails to the recipients reflected the credit_card name ( not my own ) even_though i was the one sending the gift .
neutral	it ' d be great to have " sender name " or something so that the appropriate name is added .
neutral	there is not way to change a reservation .
neutral	you cannot cancel a reservation because it is nonrefundable .
neutral	it took three_days to get it changed and even then they did not change it , they only added another day at a higher_rate .
neutral	not a good way to do_business !
neutral	jere c light
neutral	i ordered glasses from goggles0u .
neutral	super cheap , super_cute , seemed like the quality was pretty good but once i started wearing them i got dizziness and headaches .
neutral	over the past two_weeks i have tried wearing them for shorter periods of time to try to get used to them but they still result in dizziness and headaches .
neutral	i provided the lens prescription numbers and the pupillary_distance but it seems something is off .
neutral	the labels were very cute , but the font was so small that it was hard to read .
neutral	i thought they were going to be a little_bit bigger .
neutral	i ordered from them as a friend suggested .
neutral	she has never had any_issues .
neutral	i could not track my order bc the number wasn_'_t on my order page .
neutral	free 0 day shipping sounded good and i had a substantial order of more than 000 . 00 , i called a day after it was supposed to be here and after calling 0 times they were trying to " track " my order , getting cut_off and ended_up on hold a total of 00_minutes !!
neutral	0rd time i called i asked to speak to a supervisor and that they not put me on hold .
neutral	she informed me of phone issues which no one else told me about .
neutral	she worked through it and told me it was out for delivery that day .
neutral	resolved but not happy with the customer_service .
neutral	hopefully the supplements are the same quality i get from doctor , not sure i would order again .
neutral	eeuroparts offers decent pricing .
neutral	the attraction is a small minimum purchase , set at $_00 , needed for free_shipping .
neutral	and they ship very timely .
neutral	but getting delivery of the package from the shipping vendor is the problem .
neutral	they use only fedex and usps .
neutral	fedex was too lazy to even ring a bell so i had to jump_through hoops to reroute my package and wait four extra days to actually receive the shipment .
neutral	and we all know how unreliable usps when it comes to delivery and " tracking " a package , if need be .
neutral	eeuroparts needs to reconsider its shipping options .
neutral	while they cannot control the shipping vendor , they can control their shipping options .
neutral	i ' d gladly meet a higher minimum purchase to get free_shipping through ups .
neutral	i love your prices and your inventory .
neutral	but everytime i get my box its opened when i get it and none of my other packages are ever like that .
neutral	also i think you need to be more discriptive on the sizes and material .
neutral	admin excellent everything happened as stated problem came when phone was assessed i was advised back was scratched and offered half original quote i disputed this and asked for phone to be returned then phone passed reassessment and received original amount .
neutral	i placed my order on 0 / 0 / 0000 for a set of tartan cuff_links for my husband for our anniversary .
neutral	after many emails backwards and forwards i eventually received the cuff_links on the 00th of may .
neutral	as they took so long to come it was not much of an anniversary_present but my husband loved them .
neutral	the cuff_links are lovely but i was not so impressed with the time it took for them to arrive
neutral	it took over 0 months for the item i ordered to be shipped .
neutral	i initiated the first email to find out why i had not received my purchase .
neutral	a few_days_later , i received a reply email letting_me know it was on back order .
neutral	it would have been nice to know this upon ordering the item .
neutral	it finally arrived in september , although they told me it would be shipped in june .
neutral	i was still charged the full_amount for shipping & handling .
neutral	i do like the product , it just took entirely too long to receive & communication could have been better from the initial placement of the order .
neutral	i '_ve been with flora0000 for about 0 years .
neutral	i '_ve been using their service to send flowers to u . s , the netherlands , china , taiwan , singapore ... etc .
neutral	the flowers were always delivered on time .
neutral	the flowers on their website look deceiving , the actual flower is never as big , as colorful ( they overused photoshop ) as fresh as it looks online .
neutral	i have received many_times white / ivory bouquets instead of pink / champaign flower , the flowers came with brown petals , some flowers look dead ( chinese flower shop delivered the flower on the motorbike and explode the flower in a 00 degree sunlight ) sometimes the store will even lie to the flora0000 about the quality and the color of the flower , but we can always show them the picture evidence .
neutral	flora0000 will provide the excellent after service to make you happy .
neutral	yes , i will keep using flora0000 .
neutral	you pay a lot more , but at_least they do provide a 0_star service .
neutral	the experience was moderate but i would have liked to get a confirmation_email_telling_me what i purchased and how much like anywhere_else you would buy from .
neutral	at first i felt_like i was being scammed because i got absolutely nothing on my recent_purchase .
neutral	yes i logged in to check what i ordered on the website but still nothing about confirmation .
neutral	then a few_days_later i saw i could track my order which was nice but i didnt know about it for a while because i was not sent anything telling_me i could do so
neutral	i ordered several items and most fit , however , one shirt was already torn in one spot and the jacket that said it was true to size on the website was not true to size at all .
neutral	i will be returning both items .
neutral	love the pics but they need to fix their pricing .
neutral	first page with pics said 00 then u click on the pic u like then to order the price is 00 .
neutral	icanvasart corrected the mistake and gave_me credit quickly .
neutral	with the quickest i had to go order some more art .
neutral	i was dissatisfied to learn that my last order was unable to be fulfilled .
neutral	your prices are competitive and the free_shipping is very helpful .
neutral	got a really good deal on a kenny rogers cd collection , but delivery was slooooow .
neutral	took almost 0_weeks !
neutral	het was erg makkelijk om via fleurop interflora nederland vanuit de verenigde staten te_bestellen , en om_het op_de_volgende dag te kunnen laten_bezorgen bij mijn_moeder in friesland .
neutral	mijn_moeder vond het_boeket heel_erg mooi , en was ook blij_met_de wijn en chocola .
neutral	mijn zus stuurde mij een foto_van_het_boeket , en hoewel het mooi was , leek het toch helemaal niet_op_de_foto_van_het_boeket dat_ik besteld had via het internet .
neutral	mijn_moeder zei ook dat_ze witte wijn ontvangen had , terwijl ik prosciutto had besteld .
neutral	maar goed , het belangrijkste was dat mijn_moeder blij was .
neutral	in de_toekomst zou_het toch wel fijn zijn als erg enige overeenkomst is tussen wat je denkt dat_je koopt , en wat er uiteindelijk bezorgd wordt .
neutral	i have a pleasant_experience with the site when ordering supplements because the orders are processed very quickly , and free_shipping always really helps .
neutral	but i held off placing an order for supplements last thursday ( week of 00 / 00 / 00 ) that i was about to run_out of because i saw posted on the site , 00_%_off cyber_monday .
neutral	only to learn yesterday , cyber_monday , that as i '_m placing an order for $_000 worth of supplements , that the brands i was ordered weren_'_t 00_%_off .
neutral	huge disatisfier .
neutral	huge .
neutral	i '_m still extremely irritated to be honest .
neutral	i have found that the brands my practitioner and my physician want me taking , are never discounted .
neutral	i can never use the coupons sent to me .
neutral	so there is never a benefit to me for ordering so much .
neutral	when our flight out changed , i spent 00_minutes on hold then it took another 00min .
neutral	to get a new flight .
neutral	it wasn_'_t resolved and took three more days waiting in limbo , two callbacks before travelocity was able to get it worked out .
neutral	it wasn_'_t travelocity fault but there relationship with the airlines needs to be improved .
neutral	treated as untrustworthy client when i take out a new loan .
neutral	do not like feeling like a criminal .
neutral	shopping , selecting , and purchasing was very simple .
neutral	i received the glasses in a timely_manner .
neutral	the glasses arrived and i was very disappointed by the quality and look of the glasses .
neutral	they look nothing like the picture and they are not straight on my face !!
neutral	terrible !!
neutral	i will never purchase from this business again !
neutral	i will recommend the site to any one .
neutral	it is a reliable site because the next_day i called the hotel .
neutral	they were able to see my booking confirmation .
neutral	my only problem was reachin the phone_number on the site which said the number could not be reached .
neutral	the prices are good , however , if they don_'_t have the item you want in the store , it takes a lot of time for you to get it .
neutral	i bought a table and they gave it to me a month after
neutral	when i receive my pet_food order through the mail , most of the canned_food are damaged .
neutral	i have to throw most of the cans away because they are mostly damage through the mailing procedures .
neutral	this is unacceptable !
neutral	i always order 0 cases of canned_food , by the time i receive them , i have to destroy almost 0 cases because the cans are either bent really bad or halfway opene from being thrown or stepped on .
neutral	you either need to write " fragile " on the box or make_changes through your mailing system .
neutral	the tags were beautiful but , the labels were hard to read and write on .
neutral	there was not enough room to name the product .
neutral	i have been ordering contacts month after month and had no_problems .
neutral	they will ship out same day or next_day once i put an order in .
neutral	but that '_s changed and when i reordered my contacts it took them three_days to ship out my product when in the past it only took one day and i am very very unhappy with this service .
neutral	i am still debating if i will drop opticontacts . com for a different site to order from .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	am happy so_far with look of 0 of 0 radiators ordered but the more traditional column is loose as the brackets dont support it properly .
neutral	am waiting for replacement .
neutral	bigger issue is placed order twice and still_waiting refund which over 0_weeks_ago was advised would be processed within 0 to 0 working days .
neutral	i thought i was getting $_00 off .
neutral	then i realized after my order was placed it was only for first shipment of auto delivery .
neutral	$_00 cheaper at my local dog feed_store .
neutral	they do have a good variety of natural treats .
neutral	the clerk was helpful and pleasant while delivering the bare bones facts on the storage_unit .
neutral	what they do not advertise is that , yes your first month is $ 0 however ... it '_s really pro - rated ; then you have an administrative fee ; next is the mandatory insurance that they make you buy if you want to store things there .
neutral	so the $ 0 ended_up being over $_00 ... and since we came in on the 00th , i was billed on the first again for the increased rate , plus $_00 insurance , plus tax .
neutral	i needed the space and this was a convenient location .
neutral	but is i would have had the time to leisurely make the decision - based on the underhanded add on '_s - i would '_ve gone elsewhere .
neutral	i spoke with a representative from reservation_counter and he quoted a price for a hotel room for $_00 . 00 dollars plus taxes .
neutral	i charged the total of $_000 . 00 .
neutral	the next_day i received an e_- mail confirmation and i was shocked to see that the charged total was now $_000 . 00 .
neutral	i immediately called the reservation_counter and the representative cancelled my reservation and apologized for the misquote the night before and hoped that i would consider them again despite the mistake .
neutral	i ordered a few items on sept 00 , 0000 and every day i check my order status and it still says processing ... wish i would have known it would take this long to get a pair of leggings ... i wouldnt have ordered them
neutral	although the website claims remanufactured ink will work just like the genuine epson_ink , it did not .
neutral	i will stick to only genuine epson_ink_cartridges from now on .
neutral	when i contacted the company for a refund , they promptly sent me a postage paid return_label address and were willing to process my return , so no_complaints on the customer_service end .
neutral	i was annoyed that the booking fee was added at the last_minute instead of being shown in the initial price .
neutral	first purchase from petflow was all cans , a laser toy and treats .
neutral	i was happy with the quick delivery , quality and rated an a +!
neutral	unfortunately , my second order included boxed fresh step litter with the cans which can as quickly as the first , but in two_separate boxes with one mixed with cans and litter .
neutral	one of the litter_boxes arrived crushed because of poor packaging .
neutral	the litter spread into the 00 can cases and i am still working to contain the litter .
neutral	needless to say , i was very disappointed and lost the entire box of litter .
neutral	not happy !
neutral	!
neutral	i did my research concerning the price of the textbook that i needed for school .
neutral	bookbyte was definitely the cheapest .
neutral	yay !
neutral	even_though standard shipping was free , i decided to pay a few extra dollars and have the textbook expedited to me .
neutral	all was well .
neutral	the site was easy to use , there weren_'_t a lot of annoying questions , and it looked like i would be getting my book in no time .
neutral	except the book never showed_up .
neutral	and i never received any sort of communication from bookbyte or the delivery company about my order that didn_'_t show up .
neutral	after waiting 0_weeks , and still not having heard_anything about my book , i decided to chat online with customer_service .
neutral	i was told that my book was not delivered because the shipping company that they used didn_'_t service my zip_code .
neutral	really ?!
neutral	don_'_t you think that that small detail should have been figured_out before they decided to use some unknown delivery company ??
neutral	they told me they could either offer me a full_refund , or resend my textbook once they received it back at their warehouse .
neutral	i chose that option , as i needed this book for class .
neutral	i was told that they would overnight the book to me as soon as they got it back .
neutral	well , i still patiently waiting .
neutral	the one good thing i can say about bookbyte though , is that their customer_service is pretty good .
neutral	the guy_who helped_me , through online_chat , was speedy , respectful , and willing to do whatever he needed to do to resolve the situation .
neutral	i felt_like my situation was handled well , even if i still do not have the book .
neutral	i assume we ' re talking_about the reservation for the virgin river hotel / casino in mesquite , nevada .
neutral	calling on the phone and reserving the room was fast and easy .
neutral	when we got to the hotel , the reservation staff were casual , lazy and slow , and made a special effort to call all patrons without reservations to the front of a very long line to be taken_care of first .
neutral	why did i bother to get a reservation before i arrived ?
neutral	how hard can it possibly be to put a reservation and key together , and when the patron arrives , check their id and hand it to them ?
neutral	once we were in the room , it was fine .
neutral	i recently booked a flight with a wrong airport landing , i call ebookers . ch , they ask me to call airline company .
neutral	i called airline company and they asked me to call ebooker because only ebooker can change it .
neutral	i call ebooker again , but the lady on the phone showed that she does not care , and she does not want to do anything a little more to help .
neutral	for this i called 0 times to ebooker and 0 times to airline company and i was given no any information , and i was like a ball kicking back - and - forward between ebooker and the airline company !
neutral	so their service is cool and make me really angry .
neutral	that is the way they treat a customer who just almost 0000chf service from them !
neutral	the ordering was easy .
neutral	but one item must have been back ordered .
neutral	no_explanation was given ... nothing .
neutral	we finally received the item about 0 0 / 0_weeks_later ... someone should have notified us ....
neutral	i will start with the ridiculous shipping charge for 0nd day .
neutral	i paid for 0nd day because i needed my product sooner and they shipped it ground .
neutral	they were quick to refund my money when i complained .
neutral	then the 0 mini massager '_s i ordered were all scratched up on top .
neutral	they looked pretty beat up , but it may have been from the box .
neutral	just not sure i would want to do_business with them again .
neutral	hotel was ok . no spoons or microwave in breakfast area .
neutral	also when i asked for receipt i was told the front_desk can '_t give me one sine they are not allowed to see rates !
neutral	good golly is the rate such a secret ?
neutral	don_'_t think we will stay at another country inn .
neutral	thanks
neutral	i went through room 00 and was referred to your site .
neutral	thought is was comparable to other travel sites .
neutral	makkelijk om_te_bestellen , perfecte kwaliteit prijs verhouding .
neutral	echter een drama om_de_bestelling bij je thuis te krijgen .
neutral	lag aan dhl , maar_ook geen motivatie van drukland . nl om_te helpen .
neutral	very impressed with products and ability to purchase , but then the delivery was much slower_than_expected .
neutral	we have used this service several_times and are normally very happy with it .
neutral	we recommended it to our friends as we were going on holiday together and all went well until i rang up to collect the cars late on a rainy night .
neutral	i made the mistake of saying that there were two parties ready to collect their cars , but i think they just matched my phone_number with the booking and only sent back our car .
neutral	our friends were left at the departure poiont until the driver who returned our car sorted it all out for them .
neutral	not a good result and certainly not up to their usual standard ..
neutral	part is great ( mirror ) ad said painted and showed a silver picture didn_'_t say what color got it and it was black .
neutral	disappointed .
neutral	this company has just about anything and everything you could ever need for a party .
neutral	they have such a wide_variety of products .
neutral	i ordered a lot of different products for my wedding and i liked almost everything .
neutral	however there was one product that was extremely cheaply_made ; some toasting flutes for " mother and father of bride and groom ."
neutral	i contacted them and asked for my money back .
neutral	they promptly got back to me , refunded my money and didn_'_t make me return the flutes ; which was extremely_helpful since i was a busy bride .
neutral	so always remember that you are getting what you pay for , but for a one day party most of the time it works .
neutral	this is a pretty good site .
neutral	the comparisons are helpful but can be a bit much .
neutral	the web_page shows a lot of information at the same time so it gets alittle overwhelming .
neutral	the website could navigate a little easier .
neutral	i do like how there are bullet points on each company and the phone_number is easily available .
neutral	the hours of operation and visit website option is a nice_touch too .
neutral	it makes it easy to get all the info in one place .
neutral	i '_m just kinda nervous_about whether or not to trust these rviews and rankings .
neutral	everytime i book for me and my partner and our two bicycles , i have to book in two_separate bookings as the system cannot compute two vehicles .
neutral	even when i ring up , they direct me to book online this way .
neutral	this needs to change .
neutral	otherwise a very good service at a good price .
neutral	i received my vitamins yesterday .
neutral	the bottle was broke .
neutral	i called and was told to take a picture and email the picture .
neutral	i am not a techie but i figured_out how to do that with my iphone ( i think ).
neutral	i asked to be notified when the email was received as i am not sure i know what i am doing .
neutral	i sent a second email today asking if it was received .
neutral	i have not had a response .
neutral	i realize things get broken in the mail and understand that .
neutral	however , i would like my vitamins .
neutral	obviously they will not be resent without the picture .
neutral	so i would like to know if the replacement is on its way .
neutral	thank_you , maureen dalnes
neutral	everything went very well , arrived in the right place on time and my friend was delighted with the bouquet .
neutral	she rang the next_day to say that the roses had wilted in less_than 00hrs .
neutral	the company promised to replace immediately but this was a bit disappointing .
neutral	the customer_service was great but the slats for my king_size bed were for a queen and when i took them back and he gave_me longer ones they were still way too short !!!
neutral	we had to push in both_sides of the rails ( it '_s a king sleigh bed ) nearly breaking the wood in order to make the slats fit !!
neutral	we were supposed to have 0 slats but only got 0 with 0 legs when we were supposed to get 0 .
neutral	the guy said they were king_size slats but they definitely did not fit !
neutral	the giftcard came in an envelope with what looks like to be a letter address to myself .
neutral	the giftcard presentation was very poor .
neutral	i had ordered from giftcards . com before and each giftcard ordered came with a card and envelope , i guess i thought it would be the same this time .
neutral	there was an option to get a card for additional_cost , also i ordered 00 cards and had to pay shipping and handling for each card going to the same address and to make_matters worst when i received giftcard envelope the stamp price for delivery was three_times less what i paid .
neutral	i have been waiting literally for over six_months for the 000 count of igg0000 , which i take daily , to come in .
neutral	i am supposed to get an_email when it does , but the item never restocks , so i end up purchasing the 000 count which costs me more .
neutral	i called and they couldn_'_t tell me anything ... very frustrating .
neutral	other items ship very quickly .
neutral	i am thinking of going elsewhere because i am tired of not getting answers and paying more for the smaller quantity .
neutral	unfortunately i have experienced slow service ton this order .
neutral	i ordered last_week and as of tuesday the following week the items have still to be despatched .
neutral	on previous occasions i would have had the delivery by now
neutral	needs to include tip in subtotal so its easier to meet checkout minimum - this would make it a lot easier especially when you give discounts and stuff - i had to order extra stuff i didn_'_t want when i had a discount which wound_up not really saving me that much money .
neutral	seamless includes the tip in the subtotal which is why i use them a lot but i like delivery . com more and would use it more if you guys did this .
neutral	i really wanted to talk to a knowledgeable person about lens selection , but , for the second time in a row , i got a guy_who either did not know much but didn_'_t want to tell me , or did not know how to communicate .
neutral	very unsatisfactory - i really needed expert_advice .
neutral	so - did i get the right lens for me ?
neutral	i have no_idea .
neutral	i have only received 0 out of the 0 boxes the mats are very small , so kinda disappointed .
neutral	i found the web_page much too difficult to navigate .
neutral	i ended_up having to call them every time i ordered .
neutral	did not think they were value for money
neutral	i '_m happy with the mattress and the delivery_men were helpful .
neutral	when i book the delivery i requested an afternoon slot .
neutral	i was told it wasn_'_t guaranteed but they would make a note of it and i would be contacted by the driver the day the day before to arrange a delivery time .
neutral	the day before delivery i was texted at 0pm with a do not reply message telling_me the delivery was arriving in the morning .
neutral	it was out of office hours and there was nothing i could do to contact the driver to tell them i would not have keys to the property for an early delivery .
neutral	eventually i managed to get them to return later in the morning but was facing a christmas with no bed .
neutral	the package was also missing one of the memory_foam pillows which are £_00 each .
neutral	there was no_explanation to the drivers or myself and i had to chase customers services to find out why .
neutral	no apology or real explanation was received from them , i '_ve just been told i will be notified when its back in stock with no_indication of when that will be .
neutral	well i ordered trying to save myself some money as i only wear_contacts now and again and at £_00 a box plus 00 admin_fee , i thought that was ridiculas ( 0sight ) .
neutral	so i thought id just order 00 pairs at 00 . 00 i think it was .
neutral	the first lenses sent haven_'_t arrived yet , but after a week i contacted them and a replacement was sent out next_day , these arrives at 0 . 00 am and are exactly_what i need .
neutral	i will be back as soon as i need to reorder
neutral	the glasses were beautiful , they just didn_'_t fit my face like i thought they would .
neutral	a 00_% restocking_fee is entirely too excessive and unnecessary .
neutral	as a buyer i even pay shipping to return them .
neutral	i thought the print was a little too small to read .
neutral	that was a little_disappointing .
neutral	i think you should provide the option to order just a few labels as i did not need to order 00
neutral	not overally impressed that the box was slightly_damaged in two place as the cost was almost £_000 .
neutral	good comms though .
neutral	frustrating experience .
neutral	put in information and 00_minutes later , phone_call after phone_call trying to sell me insurance .
neutral	took_forever to get a straight answer and still don_'_t even know what i am paying for .
neutral	everyone was so vague .
neutral	the hotel we booked with priceline , turned_out to be a clean room , with a great little complementary breakfast !
neutral	!
neutral	guy came to work to do my tyres , great idea , found me ok too .
neutral	left him to it and he called me when the tyres were done - which was a bit if a pain as i work in a library !
neutral	thought he would come and find me - he explained what he had done though when i got back in the car to come home omg car showed flat tyre !
neutral	wish he had told me that it happened sometimes so not so convenient as i had to go to mini shop to sort it
neutral	i absolutely_adore the fact that i learned how to crochet by watching youtube !
neutral	i also enjoy some of the funny postings .
neutral	that being said , i need to explain that the reason i could only give 0_stars is due to allowance by youtube of inappropriate content including nudity , profanity , and various raunchy postings and even reviews by others .
neutral	this is maybe the way this sick world is going but it doesn_'_t make it right or appropriate and definitely not polite for someone to review or post such sickening videos .
neutral	i didn_'_t receive the cotton blend of t - shirts i wanted .
neutral	i wanted 00 / 00 and got 000_%.
neutral	the design staff was okay to work with .
neutral	every time i didn_'_t give the okay , because they weren_'_t getting what i was asking for , they would take 00_hours before i would hear back .
neutral	this ended making my t - shirts take 0_weeks instead of 0 .
neutral	g000 000_% blend is stiff and not soft like i was looking for .
neutral	i ordered the 0d jump wall mural , opened and checked each piece for quality of print / paper etc .
neutral	i didn_'_t really have the floor space to set the whole picture out and try to line each piece up ( i did try and stick it to the wall but it just peels off the blutac ).
neutral	i had to start from the right hand side and the first 0 pieces were fine and lined_up very well .
neutral	every piece after that was a nightmare !
neutral	i have a good eye for detail and when one part was perfectly lined_up , further down the picture was completely out by 0mm !
neutral	the picture itself did not match the corresponding pieces as if they were from a different batch of print , not only the pattern , but the colour shades being a touch lighter / darker on the clothes .
neutral	not impressed at all and not happy ( especially at £_00 !
neutral	), but had to continue and hope to cover the mismatches with other wall items - which defeats the object of having a picture on the wall .
neutral	advice : definitely line up your pieces before pasting and don_'_t think that 0mm won_'_t matter - it does !
neutral	if the pieces had been from the same picture print and matched , the final_outcome would have been very impressive .
neutral	my little_girl still loves it ( hence the 0_stars , not 0 ), but the cost & quality to a parent is a different view entirely .
neutral	fast delivery but was not satisfied with some of the products i ordered .
neutral	some products were very very small .
neutral	they would be only good for a tiny puppy
neutral	not sure why they would package and send me something that was torn before it even hit the box .
neutral	piece number two is not even usable .
neutral	sad
neutral	my order came quickly , but several cans of food were dented .
neutral	they seemed as if they were dented when packed by manufacturer , do you think they were seconds ?
neutral	i feel_like the staff looks down their nose at us for being " priceliners "!
neutral	!
neutral	like hurry stuff them in the back somewhere and make_sure to give them dirty enough looks that they wont come out of the room or participate in other hotel events .
neutral	thats not really any fault of priceline its just rude judgemental people .
neutral	overall priceline is a wonderful tool to help everyone save some $$$$!
neutral	!
neutral	who can possibly find a complaint in that ??!
neutral	!
neutral	the top was nice enough , great colour , but i returned it as it had ink spots on it .
neutral	i was excited about being_able to get delivery of muffy '_s prescription food delivered to my door so i would not have to make the 00 minute drive to the vet or pet_food store , but i was disappointed .
neutral	it took 0_weeks , a phone_call and an_email until i received my order which was supposed to take 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i tried out petflow , but i am reluctant to order again .
neutral	my total order was over $_00 .
neutral	it was received in a very timely_manner .
neutral	i am very happy with the products .
neutral	the day i received my order i received a call from them wanting me to switch to automatic delivery .
neutral	i was told i would save_money on this and future orders .
neutral	after some discussion i said okay .
neutral	after all , who does not like to save_money ?
neutral	next_day i received an_email with a $ 0 or so credit because i did change .
neutral	however , it had to be used in 0 days or it expired .
neutral	i was not told that on the prior day phone conversation .
neutral	why would i order again after just a few_days ??
neutral	?
neutral	i told the customer_service representative that i was leaving on vacation and needed the compression sleeve by a certain date .
neutral	i asked her to advise me about the proper shipping to get the sleeve by that date .
neutral	i went with her recommendation , but the sleeve was not delivered by that date , and i had to leave without it .
neutral	not good !
neutral	the sleeve was rescheduled to be rerouted to my new location .
neutral	now i am waiting to see if it gets to where i will be .
neutral	not good !
neutral	very disappointing and inconvenient .
neutral	i don_'_t have any review .
neutral	as of now i '_m not to thrilled with the company .
neutral	yes , they sent an_email_stating that they received my order but that '_s been over three week , haven_'_t heard a thing sense !
neutral	the shirt was great but the package had no invoice or packing_slip and i was not notified or updated on any shipping or tracking_information .
neutral	i bought two_sets of berry lights which i thought were an okay - ish price , until i received them and then realised that i also had to buy the transformers separately - which cost almost the same again .
neutral	i think this should have been made much much clearer on the website - even to the point that it should have been flagged up when i clicked to buy the lights .
neutral	would not use this site again .
neutral	i really appreciated the promptness of the shipment .
neutral	the pricing was attractive until i saw that the can on the website was a 00 oz can and the product , with a new label and reformulation of contents , was 00 . 0_oz .
neutral	this was misleading ; the web_site illustration should be corrected and the new formula noted .
neutral	nonetheless , the cats are enjoying their new petguard fish , chicken and liver .
neutral	would order more if shipping was so expensive
neutral	i found the part i needed , went to check out and it was 00 . 00 more went back to the page i was on because i had my boyfriend check it out he saw the low price told me to order it and then it was more ,,, first time i ordered anything from them not sure i would again
neutral	the delivery has to be at home address ( card billing_address ) and requires a person to be at home , but i work all week .
neutral	i would have to pay extra to request morning or afternoon / saturday delivery .
neutral	very difficult for a working professional to receive goods , which is not the case with other online_retailers .
neutral	always unsure
neutral	the table is lovely , i had a hard time getting a hold of someone at the company , i called 0 times and the person could not hear me .
neutral	i thought it was strange they would not call me back ( possibly having the tecnology of viewing my number ) and when i called back it was starting over again .
neutral	the delivery guy was great , and waited for me to come home as i was around the corner .
neutral	he called me to tell me he was here .
neutral	also , took the table out of the box and the handle broke on the bag .
neutral	a very cheap bag but i didnt expect it to break in the first 0 minutes .
neutral	i am looking_forward to using the table and will give you more information then .
neutral	thank_you for asking .
neutral	also , if someone can call me regarding the bag , that would be great .
neutral	00000000000
neutral	i was not as impressed as i thought i would be .
neutral	glad i didnt pay full price for my box .
neutral	well , i '_m not happy right now since , i haven_'_t received a medical card for my children , i '_ve requested it three_months_ago , and as of now haven_'_t receive .
neutral	i '_m very disappointed with this matter .
neutral	had issues with your app and bounced me out 0 times
neutral	i was surprised that the reservation cost has already been deducted from my account and the reservation is not until september .
neutral	i made a reservation with courtyard_marriott for july_00th in the middle of may and will not be charged until check in .
neutral	i can see a small deposit for conformation , but the entire cost , surprised and disappointed .
neutral	bradley did everything in their power to get us to utah for a short vacation in a blizzard and i '_m grateful for that .
neutral	but we had to wait up till midnight after a long day of traveling for delta to deliver our skis ..... and on our way home we were delayed 0hrs in washington_dc for a plane that had to undergo repairs in cincinnati .
neutral	they don_'_t feed you on the plane anymore and we hadn_'_t eaten for 0 hours and wouldn_'_t give us any food vouchers .
neutral	they have kept me in informed has to the details of my shipment .
neutral	i purchased four gift_cards from giftcard . com .
neutral	three were visa_gift_cards and one was a mastercard gift_card .
neutral	i got these for a friend and my children '_s teachers .
neutral	i received a email indicting the order was shipped , recieved my order , and the mastercard gift_card was missing .
neutral	i called customer_service and was told that my order was shippied together ... maybe in their computer but it wasn_'_t complete on my end .
neutral	customer_service took my information and said their team would look into it .
neutral	its been four days and i haven_'_t heards anything .
neutral	the cards i did received looked great but i really wish i knew what happended to the other .
neutral	i love the idea of not having to go to the market to get dog_food - my only problem is it takes over a week to get to me and shipping to get it sooner is not cost affective
neutral	i was excited by how easy it was to compare facilities and pricing using sparefoot , so i had no reason to doubt that everything would work out smoothly .
neutral	instead , when i showed_up the morning of my move - in day , the first thing i noticed is that sparefoot had listed their hours with an opening time of 0 am , but the sign on the door said 0 am .
neutral	we were lucky that the manager of the facility was already there , and had no problem opening the door early for us .
neutral	i showed him my reservation , including the confirmation code , and he told me they didn_'_t actually have any units of that size available .
neutral	he said they ' d had this trouble with sparefoot before - they would tell sparefoot they didn_'_t have a particular size of unit open , and sparefoot would go_ahead and take reservations for that size anyway .
neutral	again , we were lucky , and the manager worked out a deal for us on a slightly larger unit at a reduced cost , but it could '_ve easily turned into a disaster .
neutral	the concept behind sparefoot is wonderful , but even the best ideas have flaws .
neutral	i would use sparefoot again , but i wouldn_'_t place quite so much trust in them next time .
neutral	always call the facility you ' re placing a reservation with to confirm your unit before you go to do paperwork , and double_check their hours while you have them on the phone .
neutral	i need to return the cores but the rma / return instructions did not come with my new parts .
neutral	i have called several_times , cant get through & am going through customer_service via the on line form ... sux !
neutral	after many bs responses nothing is happening ... i just want to talk to a person & get this taken_care of .
neutral	this may effect any future_purchases if not resolved quickly ... sad
neutral	london is such a beautiful city , so naturally getting to see many of the sights without_having to do it all by foot was nice .
neutral	and it was a good deal , however the tour_guide for the harry_potter and haunted london walking_tours that were included in the ticket , lacked .
neutral	he was nice , but didn_'_t seem very interested in what he was presenting .
neutral	this was the first water_bottle container that i ordered from inkgarden .
neutral	however , i rated it only 0_stars because the photos on it were not the correct color & as beautiful as the photo .
neutral	i still gave it as a gift but would consider ordering again from this company .
neutral	i received my parcel in a box
neutral	the box was wet through
neutral	luckily the bedding was okay but felt a little damp
neutral	i purchased treats and toys for my dog and toys for my cat .
neutral	the dog_treats were much smaller_than_expected .
neutral	the dog toys , although described as durable and " tough ", each lasted about 0 - 0 minutes .
neutral	the cat toys were fine .
neutral	the website is helpful in finding new roasts to try based on your preferences .
neutral	they have a great selection , but the shipping cost are high and each brand is shipped_separately .
neutral	i might as well just buy directly from the manufactures .
neutral	i have been on the big_bus_tour before and enjoyed it but after my last trip the disruption of the olympics due to road_closures spoilt it .
neutral	we were taken on different routes and for about 00_minutes never saw anything of interest so had to get off the bus and flaga taxi down as time was of the essence due to bookings on the london_eye . had the staff told us what was happening then we could have got off stops earlier instead we were told it would only take around 0 . 0 hours for the full tour instead we walked for miles and spent money on taxies and as we were only in london for the day it partially spoiled our day .
neutral	i have been pretty satisfied with bookbyte for renting_textbooks , but their return shipping policies are not very customer - friendly .
neutral	when you go to print the shipping label ( which , to their credit , is free ) they ask if you need more than one label .
neutral	but the website won_'_t actually let you print more than one label .
neutral	they send you a message_saying you should be able to send the books in one box .
neutral	well , that '_s great if you have the right size box suitable for mailing textbooks in , but i didn_'_t this time .
neutral	their response ?
neutral	" you ' re welcome to go to the post_office and purchase a larger box ."
neutral	really ?
neutral	they should just say on the website that if * they * determine that you have too many books to fit in one box , they '_ll send you another shipping label .
neutral	next time , i '_m going to send my return in the biggest darn box i can find !
neutral	le_produit ( coque pour note 0 ) a été rapidement livré mais l ’ étui ( partie carton ) était déchiré .
neutral	des saletés étaient présentes dans_la boîte .
neutral	j ' ai du légèrement nettoyer la coque avant de_l ' offrir .
neutral	d ' autre part , la_qualité d ’ impression n ' est_pas extraordinaire .
neutral	elle fait son boulot mais manque de détail à mon gout .
neutral	ça reste un bon produit mais un_peu cher pour_la_qualité .
neutral	0 / 0
neutral	making the reservations was very easy .
neutral	unfortunately , the airport that i landed in wasn_'_t the same airport that i was to leave from .
neutral	there was no_indication that i was going to a different airport .
neutral	they should have made a comment to let_me know .
neutral	for the price point of product i would have expected a better quality hat .
neutral	upon making my reservation at aqua palm hotel , i had a specific question_regarding the number beds .
neutral	i was pleased and decided to book my reservation .
neutral	as i wait for my confirmation to be completed , was advised the system was slow .
neutral	i was never advised that i had to pay for the 0 nights that i was staying at aqua palm .
neutral	since my confirmation was going to email to me , i advised that i will wait for the confirmation .
neutral	upon_receipt of the confirmation , i noticed that i was booked for 0 nights vs . 0 nights .
neutral	i called back to advise my reservation was incorrect .
neutral	i was told that i could not change my reservation and had to get another reservation for the 0 nights .
neutral	upon asking for my credit_card information again , i was told the card declined .
neutral	i advised how can that be .
neutral	not once was i informed that i was going to charged on my credit_card for the nights that i was staying .
neutral	that also explained why only 0 nights were accepted since that was what my credit_card would accept .
neutral	i advised that does not make_sense for i should have only had one night on the credit_card .
neutral	disconnected that call .
neutral	i called back and cancelled the initial reservations and was advised of the cancellation_policy .
neutral	i advised i understood for i was told cannot make_changes after 0 / 00 @ 00 : 00_pm .
neutral	i did not understand what the issue was and was told that they would have to call the hotel for approval .
neutral	after 00 - 00_minutes on the phone , the cancellation was granted .
neutral	being in the servicing business , it has to be clear to what the requirements are .
neutral	the representatives i spoke to were totally accommodating .
neutral	the rules of making reservation outside the hotel , is different than calling the hotel_directly .
neutral	i called aqua palm hotel and received the nights i asked for and received a lower_rate than what i was being charged .
neutral	if i was told up front that i had to pay for my 0 day hotel now , that would been a different conversation and i would not have wasted my time and well as the representative '_s time with booking the reservation .
neutral	overall , i do appreciate the representatives that were extremely accommodating and my issue was resolved .
neutral	ordered magimix food processor online .
neutral	i had no contact from go electrical and when i contacted them was told the item was out of stock and would be dispatched when back in stock .
neutral	bit disappointed not shown on web as out of stock as i would have ordered elsewhere .
neutral	customer_service dept advised they would contact supplier and email me an estimated delivery .
neutral	yet to hear from them !!!!
neutral	.
neutral	in saying that item was delivered 0 days after ordering and if i had been advised of this i would have been happy to wait .
neutral	delighted with mixer and delivery with dpd is always excellent they text you with an_hour time_slot for delivery - very handy .
neutral	so i had my little car serviced it was fine before it went for its service , no_problems and serviced regularly every year .
neutral	i was called and told it needed some work - the front outer cv boots needed replacing and the rocker cover gaskit this work would cost just over_£_000 including the service .
neutral	when the car was returned to me the left front tyre was a little flat , by the time i drove it home it was completely flat !
neutral	a few_weeks_later i also noticed a large oil leak .
neutral	took the car to my local_garage and they advised me that the rocker cover gaskit needed replacing as it hadn_'_t been done properly .
neutral	i have now managed to converse with customer_services , i was issued a refund for the gaskit that wasn_'_t fixed and offered a goodwill_gesture to compensate me for my loss of time .
neutral	would i use servicing stop again ?
neutral	i '_m not sure to be honest , my local_garage is fantastic and cheaper ( gaskit fixed for £_00 ).
neutral	the main benefit was having someone collect my car and drop it back while i was at work .
neutral	i can '_t tell , as often when i buy a e gift_card , it comes within hours ... so i am still_waiting
neutral	very efficient company , pleasant to deal with and were quick to rectify the error they made and quick to send out the replacement lenses .
neutral	i liked april '_s box , but could do with another bag of treats instead of the calming pills and mouth spray .. my dog doesn_'_t have anxiety nor does he have bad breath .
neutral	loved everything else .
neutral	my dog especially loves the skunk toy .
neutral	this time was brilliant , though i have had some problems before .
neutral	easy to find and order , good parts , but hard to get in touch with cs , not on the phone .
neutral	website tracking returns error_messages .
neutral	online response takes two_days
neutral	i got my order today , checked it all to make_sure all was fine .
neutral	0 unit was damage so called victoria_plumb they were very nice on phone and said they would get another unit out to me but this is 0th_june and they cant get unit out to me until 00th_june even_though the driver who brought it said they are in this and surrounding areas every day .
neutral	my bathroom was supposed to go in on 00th but since toilet is first to go in i will have to delay .
neutral	although everything nice i would go to shops where i can get my stuff sooner in future .
neutral	my first and last experience with this company as its not my fault the unit is damaged but i am the one having to wait as long to get a replacement
neutral	alles prima verlopen : boeking , betaling en_ook het telefoontje naar europcar vanwege onduidelijkheid van_de afschrijving van_onze visa . we waren ook opgewaardeerd naar_een veel luxere auto .
neutral	de_prijs van_het huren van_een kinderzit vind_ik enorm hoog en_ook waren deze niet in een echte goede conditie ( buiten opgestapeld !)
neutral	de man achter de balie bij_de ophaal plaats op geneve airport was erg onbehulpzaam .
neutral	we kregen het aanvankelijk niet voor elkaar om_het kinderzitje te installeren en toen we hem vroegen om hulp gaf hij als antwoord : daar heb_ik geen verstand van !
neutral	en bleef achter zijn bureau zitten !
neutral	boek van 000 blz gemaakt .
neutral	is max aantal blz .
neutral	boek te krap ingebonden .
neutral	nieuw exemplaar ontvangen na klacht , maar deels zelfde probleem .
neutral	service = top , maar product kan beter .
neutral	foto '_s komen soms korrelig en vegerig over .
neutral	i love the amount of choice i have here .
neutral	and the prices are reasonable .
neutral	what i am very disappointed in , however , is the final_product .
neutral	i purchased prescription_sunglasses and spent a lot of time deciding on which frame and lens .
neutral	my sunglasses are just not dark and i find myself still squinting out in the sun .
neutral	also , you can completely see my eyes through the lens , which for lack of a better word , makes me feel_like a big dork .
neutral	i couldn_'_t wait for my rx_sunglasses to arrive , and now i '_m completely self_conscious about putting them on .
neutral	i feel_like i got a pair of transition_lenses that won_'_t transition all the way ... and you know how lame those people look in their glasses !
neutral	i wish i had known that the lenses were not dark .
neutral	i would have picked something different , or nothing at all .
neutral	easy site to use , entering long list of isbn '_s copied from spreadsheet is a breeze on the advanced isbn option .
neutral	shipping is a snap and i appreciate receiving a check in payment .
neutral	if i were not given that option and forced to accept_paypal payment , i would not use this site as paypal takes more money out when you are sent a payment !
neutral	taking more from very little would negate the convenience of selling here
neutral	prices for fiction are very low , even paperbacks of same genre as accepted hardcover novels are rejected .
neutral	i was rather disappointed with the customer_service that i received in - store .
neutral	i felt as though the advisor was not interested in taking the time to answer my questions but was far more interested in looking beyond me at the other browsing customers .
neutral	i , therefore , chose to order online and i have to say , the delivery was extremely prompt .
neutral	i '_m very happy with the product ( storage box ) and would order online again .
neutral	however , i would be hesitant to visit the store again .
neutral	i purchased this product rather_than any other because it said it would be available in 0_weeks .
neutral	i think in total it was somewhere between a 0 - 0 month wait which was very disappointing .
neutral	it did arrive with a small chip but i didn_'_t want to wait another 0 months for another one and didn_'_t raise it to the company .
neutral	as stated before , don_'_t know how product rates until i use it .
neutral	good service though .
neutral	judi
neutral	the service and people are very outgoing and were always checking in with us on the status of our car .
neutral	over all was a good experience .
neutral	they were kind enough to place my donut back in my trunk and checked any of tires to see if they were any good to hold on to ; which they weren_'_t but they checked for me anyways .
neutral	none of the offer codes worked even the salesman had a problem .
neutral	he said he would give us the amount of code off at his end .
neutral	then would not work for him so he gave_me a smaller amount off then would refund the other back to the payment card .
neutral	this never happened so it as cost me an extra £_00
neutral	i have ordered some sock and am waiting for the third order to be right , i am sorry but i won_'_t be buying anything_else from them .
neutral	this was our first time using priceline .
neutral	we did so at the recommendation of our daughter and her husband .
neutral	we booked a hotel in downtown indianapolis , and the rate was the same as rates i got from other_sites , like expedia .
neutral	i received a confirmation number from priceline , yet when we arrived at the hotel , they did not have our reservation .
neutral	they did give us a beautiful room after_seeing my email_confirmation from priceline .
neutral	don_'_t know if the problem was on priceline '_s part or the hotel '_s , but it turned_out fine and we enjoyed our stay .
neutral	so , i will try priceline again and see if i really get a better deal in the future and if our reservation goes through to the hotel .
neutral	the jury is still out on this .
neutral	whenever i sell on ebay i am force to use paypal .
neutral	they charge 0 - 0 % for the pleasure .
neutral	this for a debit_card transaction , where the actual cost to them is 0 - 00p .
neutral	they have a monopoly and in that sense have been allowed to become a total_rip_off to selllers .
neutral	when i use them as a buyer the service is reliable and secure .
neutral	which i know counts for a lot .
neutral	but their charges to sellers and merchants are too high .
neutral	overall , a pleasant_experience .
neutral	i don_'_t like being asked , " what rate do you see ?"
neutral	i want the best rate available .
neutral	har_bestilt en_del produkter , både hår og hud - produkter fra bli vakker .
neutral	etter en stunds bruk av shampooen derfra ( sp ), her håret mitt forandret seg .
neutral	dt har blitt livløst og matt , ikke i det_hele tatt som når_jeg brukte sp - serie kjøpt hos frisør .
neutral	derfor er jeg litt i tvil om produktet er ekte .
neutral	noen som har samme erfaring ?
neutral	fair prices on most things .
neutral	costume jewelry i used to buy for my many twelve to seventeen nieces and their friends has increased in price .
neutral	in the past lots of discounted prices of $ 0 to $ 0 were available .
neutral	i have used wowcher for a while and generally it is fine , however i am_currently in the middle of trying to recover money that a company has effectively stolen off me ; a company i would have never used if wowcher had not endorsed them .
neutral	i have been waiting over a week for wowcher to respond to an_email , i am effectively being ignored by the ' customer_service ' team , not a great deal of customer_service happening at the moment ...
neutral	this is the second time i have had to complain to wowcher and the poor way it is being dealt_with is putting me off using wowcher altogether .
neutral	the flowers were delivered and the company kept me fully_informed of the delivery status .
neutral	i have not seen the flowers but my mother was very happy with them .
neutral	my disappointment is that no cake was delivered .
neutral	i had read this was an_issue with another customer .
neutral	i hope this issue gets resolved because i order a lot of flowers throughout the year for family_members in the uk and i was impressed with most of my experience with this company .
neutral	i was really pleased to find a great price on thermarest mats , pillows and a jacket .
neutral	delivery arrived fast and as_promised .
neutral	the thermarest mats were great .
neutral	when i opened the pillows , i noticed the price on them said £ 0 . 00 , but i was charged £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	so i started to feel a little ripped_off .
neutral	i go to check on the site and now i see that every item i bought 0 days ago is now 00_% cheaper .... so now i am really extremely ripped_off
neutral	0st purchase all fine , cartridges worked well .
neutral	bought more & the cartridge quality this time isnt so good .
neutral	the yellow ink didnt work at all , replaced with yet another - slightly improved but not ideal .
neutral	when boors arrived , the packing had brocken , it make me feel uncomfortable , if packing could improving , i will give you better value .
neutral	item clearly state that it was available for shipping within 00hour by express , but by the 0rd day my order status was still " waiting to be processed ".
neutral	i then call customer_service hoping to get a tracking_number but the person that help me over the phone was no help at all , he couldn_'_t answer any of my question and didn_'_t know whats happenning with my order !
neutral	finally the parcel came a week_later ( definately didn_'_t feel_like express ), but they did package the parcel very carefully and my sun_glasses was perfect just as they describe it on the site .
neutral	i ordered a futon pad and what i got was a cover .
neutral	in the picture it looked like there was padding .
neutral	now i realize that it was a separate futon and this was a cover " pad ".
neutral	i will find a way to repurpose it rather_than spend the money to ship it back , but i still need a nice pad to lie on beside the hot_tub on my deck .
neutral	they were extremely busy and we were were told 0 . 0 hour , give or take .
neutral	it was closer to 0 . 00_hours .
neutral	it was very hot / humid that day and the guys probably neded to slow_down from the heat .
neutral	for our inconvenience steve offered a 0 %_discount .
neutral	nice_gesture !
neutral	one thing they should do is clean the steering_wheel off ( super gross / dirty ) and make_sure they wipe the tire marks off the body of the car ( don_'_t know how that happens ).
neutral	all in all , i would go back with a ride home next time !
neutral	i was impressed with the price of bully_sticks .
neutral	normally i pay four dollars each and now i paid one .
neutral	the stella carnivores are sometimes 00 . 00 and i got them for 0 . 00 .
neutral	i get these to crunch over my dogs food .
neutral	this time they were stale and did t crunch up like usual .
neutral	also now my dog is very sick ( always healthy )! with a stomach virus and they said it could be from bones or food .
neutral	she is very ill and it happened a few_days after i got from petflow .
neutral	not sure it '_s related but going to throw_away all i got to be safe .
neutral	hope it '_s not related because i was impressed with prices and how fast
neutral	my dog wouldn_'_t eat the bison jerky_treats and they smelled really bad .
neutral	i had to toss them .
neutral	not sure i will order again .
neutral	sorry .
neutral	needs more information about the items .
neutral	the item i bought is no good for my pram .
neutral	i was unaware it was only suitable for prams already with the connection .
neutral	it didn_'_t have this information in the product description .
neutral	i was dissapointed i when i read the box the item came in .
neutral	item will be sent back .
neutral	although i don_'_t know how to as there was no paperwork in the parcel to let_me know how to go about returning it .
neutral	also no invoice was received .
neutral	delivery took its time ( 0 days ), and more communication_regarding it would be nice .
neutral	all in all an ok experience .
neutral	we are in the booking assumes that there is audio_guide with different_languages .
neutral	unfortunately , that was not so :-(( we have used the big_bus in london , san_francisco , dubai and cape_town there was audio_guide on board :-)) the bus_stops in san_francisco would have to be marked better .
neutral	there was no indications available to the bus_stops .
neutral	with audio_guide , it is very much recommended and we will use it again .
neutral	have not received my order and i don_'_t know why !
neutral	when i received my dog_food order the box was completely open and everything was falling out .
neutral	i had quite a big order packing could be better .
neutral	the main box lite keeps flashing red and green surely wouldnt have to replace anything yet . please respond . thank_you anitadollarhide
neutral	good prices - so_far so good - will know more when order arrives
neutral	i ordered 0 scarves , and they only sent me one , and an item i did not order .
neutral	i am very happy with my scarf .
neutral	the other item i may not wear .
neutral	we will see .
neutral	not impressed , having spent some time doing price comparison , to discover a hidden booking fee charge .
neutral	still came out cheaper , but makes me angry .
neutral	betyget 0 får spartoo för sitt stora urval , samt att_det_är snabbt och enkelt_att beställa och erhålla produkten .
neutral	däremot är webbsidan utformad så att samma skor dyker upp vid flera tillfällen , trots att filtret är inställt .
neutral	detta innebär att_jag fick leta flera gånger efter intressanta skor , eftersom sökningen gav fler sidor än nödvändigt .
neutral	jag tycker det_är synd , för man tröttnar lätt .
neutral	it took waaay longer_than it should have to make it clear that i wanted an e_- gift_card and not a paper one that '_s delivered via snail_mail .
neutral	the recipient was thrilled with his gift once i finally mastered the website .
neutral	what a techno - nerd !
neutral	i was at home waiting to receive my product and then got an_email and a text_message_saying that they had tried to deliver it but no one was home to sign for it ... it also said a card was left .
neutral	luckily the driver had tried to call me so i had a missed call from him and called him back to find out that they had tried to deliver my product to the wrong house .
neutral	they had mistaken 00 for 00 .
neutral	this did really upset me since i am worried that next time i have something delivered they will sent it to the wrong house and i might not actually get my product .
neutral	when the goods arrived they were not very good quality , and my refund took_ages to be put back into my accoun nearly 0_weeks because if this i won_'_t buy from you anymore .
neutral	people want quick turn round and can not afford to wait a long time fir z refund
neutral	yes , it is easy to use paypal .
neutral	however , it is not so easy to solve a problem if a mistake has_been made .
neutral	i tried to resolve a problem with a funding source multiple_times with paypal and was told " not to worry " etc .
neutral	even_though i asked for specific solutions .
neutral	which were not provided .
neutral	ended_up paying over $_00 for a $_00 product because they would not change my funding source .
neutral	my car was ready on my return but parked maybe 00 feet from the office and i got soaking wet running to my car .
neutral	also the receipt / scanning device to let_me out of the parking_lot didn_'_t work at first and i had to fiddle with that and get wet again .
neutral	ok but took too long to get card
neutral	making the reservation was easy .
neutral	the only problem was when i got there , the room i had reserved and received a conf # for , was not even available , as the hotel was just about sold out .
neutral	i ended_up getting a room , but not the room i wanted .
neutral	it all worked out in the end .
neutral	i would use this service again , despite the mix - up .
neutral	the online - shop is just ' okay ' compared to the actual stores .
neutral	it '_s really hard to find what you ' re looking for because ' very sexy ', ' totally sexy ' and ' absolutely sexy ' are not really meaningful names or telling anything about how the bras look like .
neutral	in addition to that not too many sizes are available , especially on sale .
neutral	better go and buy at the store if you have the chance .
neutral	from your branding i wrongly assumed you were a nz website / company and delivery would be local and quick .
neutral	this did not seem to be the case .
neutral	bedeck are very good on swift delivery and secure_packaging .
neutral	i had no interaction with customer_service beyond this .
neutral	the sanderson_bedding_sets i ordered are lovely but one set was so poorly stitched that my first job was repair - not what i was hoping for .
neutral	had i checked more thoroughly before laundering , i would have returned , so my advice is definitely to really closely check all stitching - turn inside out and examine the hems .
neutral	on mine , it was the duvet_cover corners that were unstitched .
neutral	my clubs were delayed going from champaign , illinois to scottsdale , arizona due to bad_weather along the way .
neutral	unfortunately , due to the delay my fiance missed out on his round of golf before heading home .
neutral	my clubs were delayed again returning home to champaign and again i missed a round of golf as a result .
neutral	i am glad i choice to use drive time to rebuild my credit .
neutral	good website and online booking experience .
neutral	if accessing from a smart phone which i was though , i did find you couldn_'_t change your level of cover for backpacker to above one easily .
neutral	i had to use my laptop instead .
neutral	i did make an inquiry about the activities covered_under certain levels of cover in the backpacker policies as a certain activity was not listed on the website .
neutral	i never_heard back from the girl who promised a phone_call within 00_hours of my query .
neutral	it '_s been three_weeks .
neutral	overall it was a competitive price and many of my questions were answered with the details on the website and the policy documents .
neutral	i would use the company again but would hope for better follow_up .
neutral	recently_purchased a bedframe and mattress from oak_furnitureland .
neutral	whilst the product itself is high_quality and we got an excellent price as it was purchased in the sale we were disappointment with the poor customer_service both in the store and over the phone .
neutral	in particular staff in the store were dismissive and would not check about stock and answer our questions .
neutral	the customer_services over the phone e . g .
neutral	delivery and instructions for arrangements were unhelpful and gave incorrect or conflicting information depending_on who answered the phone .
neutral	i wont be purchasing anything_else from this company as a result .
neutral	two of the rose_bushes were fine .
neutral	the third rose_bush had been pulled from its dirt .
neutral	not sure if it '_s going to make it .
neutral	decided maybe i should just keep going to lowe '_s to buy my plants .
neutral	i would like to rate you , if i had have gotten confirmation that my flowers were delivered .
neutral	so_far nothing from your company .
neutral	no notice that the flowers i ordered for my friend in germany were delivered .
neutral	nothing .
neutral	i ' d like to know for sure if they have gotten there , and instead of a confirmation of my order , you send me a rating mail .
neutral	please let_me know if the flowers got there on time !
neutral	that '_s all i want to know .
neutral	i did get a e_- mail telling_me that my order was ' in the works ', so to speak ..... but that was all .
neutral	i am not happy .
neutral	would like to have confirmation of delivery .
neutral	marlene kloft - knedler
neutral	paid for airport_parking via site in october_0000 and after raising a dispute finally got my cash_back 00 feb 0000 .
neutral	so although i did get the cash_back it took some time in fact the dispute process suggests it can take 0 months to resolve .
neutral	so as i said , got there in the end !
neutral	the service from easy_comforts was good .
neutral	i noticed that i just got an_email re overstock sale which had the item on clearance for 00 . 00 .
neutral	not nice .
neutral	upset customer .
neutral	paula cohen
neutral	the cookies are ok .
neutral	mine came in broken .
neutral	i haven_'_t tried the decaf yet .
neutral	i found this site by suffering the net .
neutral	so i order two dresses and found that the shipping is out of site there bargains are very good but shipping will kill you .
neutral	the dresses where not true to size , i order 0x and found that they were about a size 00 to 00 .
neutral	if you are plus size you might want to order from some other site .
neutral	the quality of the dress was very good ; when they came it was not at all what i was expecting .
neutral	i was very disappointed to find that the dresses would not fit my niece , but they did fit my sister .
neutral	i know that it is only 00_dollar but i think if you ’ re going to pay 0 to 0 dollar in shipping you might as well drive to the department store and get one more outfit .
neutral	the red_tour with the live_guide was excellent .
neutral	the blue tour , however , was quite poor with a lot of waiting around and no communication from the driver .
neutral	at baker_street , the bus stopped and changed drivers , we then changed bus - again with no communication from the driver and we then had to wait on the bus for 00_minutes with no_indication of when we would set off .
neutral	the driver was nowhere to be found so we couldn_'_t ask him .
neutral	the delays on the blue tour did spoil the experience for us as time is precious on a holiday and we spent a lot of time wsiting around .
neutral	my order was not correct and i didn_'_t want to bother correcting it .
neutral	the coffee itself is fine but the pods are plastic which is ecologically unsound and requires more force on the machine to puncture them which might put too much of a strain on the mechanism over time .
neutral	i ordered an item via priority delivery , and when i rang two_days_later to find out whether it had been shipped yet , discovered that there was a problem with ordering from your supplier , and it had not yet been dispatched .
neutral	i felt that i should have been notified within 00_hours that the priority delivery was not possible .
neutral	i had arranged to be available all day to sign for delivery , and also could have ordered from another supplier who might have been able to guarantee priority shipment .
neutral	in fairness , the man i spoke to at hunt_office ( paudy ) was extremely courteous , and offered to look into the matter and ring me back , which he did .
neutral	he offered to refund the priority delivery fee ( i don_'_t know yet whether this happened ), and confirmed it would arrive the following_day ( which it did ).
neutral	however , i do feel there should have been earlier communication from hunt_office .
neutral	the service was very quick .
neutral	i had a change holder in my middle console with about $_00 in quarters , when i came back from vacation and picked_up my car , the change holder was in my cup holder and there were only 0 quarters in it .
neutral	needless to say the people moving your car snoop do not leave anything of importance when you leave your car here .
neutral	petflow is great -- delivers on time , the cans not too crushed , but it is beyond irritating not being_able to change my order online each_month .
neutral	what '_s up with that ?
neutral	ordering them was fairly easy .
neutral	however , i had to call several_times to find out where my order was .
neutral	it took over 0_weeks to arrive .
neutral	i was a little unsure of the process from time or ordering until delivery .
neutral	when i called each time it seemed there was a different story .
neutral	i was super happy buying one textbook for fall semester and then reselling it to bookbyte for almost the full price .
neutral	i rented two of my textbooks for spring semester , and am happy with the rental price .
neutral	however , i had originally_planned on renting a third textbook .
neutral	without_any notification , other than an x on that textbook '_s title in the receipt that arrived with the other books .
neutral	upset , i emailed customer_service .
neutral	this was not very helpful .
neutral	in the past their shipping_costs have been high , but their products & selection are good .
neutral	i '_ve had numerous problems with their website .
neutral	sometimes there '_s been careless attention to personalizations of the products ; for instance , an album i recently ordered that i personalized on the front cover came sloppily centered , really ruining the look of the piece .
neutral	that '_s disappointing .
neutral	i got my order in 0 days with no extra_charge - awesome !
neutral	unfortunately , the box the food & treats were shipped in was pretty_much crushed on arrival ( which didn_'_t signal good things for the contents )- and unfortunately the boxes of treats were similarly crushed and the bag of dog_food had a puncture in it .
neutral	so i '_m mixed on whether i ' d order again from them - shipping heavy weight dog_food / treats is always difficult , but some places definitely seem to do better on the packaging than others .
neutral	if mr . chewy could improve delivery , i ' d definitely make them a go - to because their quick service & shipping time separates them from the rest -- but at the moment , i ' d_rather slower speed to receive items that aren_'_t damaged .
neutral	i had been delighted with the when booking the service and price was excellent and once at the car_park transfer to the airport was speedy although you did have to take your suitcases to the bus at the entrance of the car_park which was a fair distance with heavy_luggage .
neutral	our return was a great disappointment as despite having left details of our return flight we had to wait 00_minutes to be picked_up at the airport , after traveling for 00_hours and with still a 00 minute drive home it was annoying and disappointing .
neutral	we were the only ones picked_up at the time so it was not that the driver was waiting for another flight .
neutral	i recently did the tour in muscat in oman and think that with some tweaks the tour could be great .
neutral	for us it all started out well , the commentary from the headphones is fantastic and gives lots of little tidbits on the country and the culture , we enjoyed that .
neutral	we found that a few of the stops listed weren_'_t actually stops yet , so that was a bit less_than useful , as the parliament was under full construction , so there was nothing to see and there was no actual stop at the marina .
neutral	also , at our stop at the palace , we saw the beautiful palace and wandered further to find a few small museums , these weren_'_t mentioned as things to see on the stop , but since you cannot enter the palace , they make a nice extra to the stop before your next bus .
neutral	our next one after the museums was in a small accident and so some poeple were waiting 0 hours for the bus when we got back to the palace .
neutral	we took a cab to the next destination and when we were done there the buses were back on schedule .
neutral	had we not hopped_off , the tour would have still been nice , and had we not already been to the beaches we would have probably gotten more value out of the tour and its stops , but overall the tour was good informationally and i think with some refinement the tour will get even better .
neutral	there has_been a lot of problems with the customer_service end of this transaction .
neutral	starting with poor communication about delivery times and status - to resolving damage issues once the furniture actually arrived .
neutral	i am still trying to get the damage issue_resolved one month after delivery .
neutral	as for the furniture itself , it is nice quality for the price .
neutral	the particular_model i bought is not quite what i expected .
neutral	the foot rest and back are shorter_than i would have liked , and it '_s difficult to get the back to fully recline and stay back .
neutral	overall , i think i would have been able to find something similar in quality and price locally and not have had to go through all the frustration with the customer_service .
neutral	i would not recommend this store to my friends because of my experience to date .
neutral	so i was looking for a specific kind of frame and globaleyeglasses had it the cheapest even with my prescription , so they get a lot of points for their selection but docked off for the amount of time it took .
neutral	i ordered july 00 and received aug 00 .
neutral	0 and a half weeks is way too long especially when they say 0 to 00 days .
neutral	and when i email support to ask they dont help at all !!!
neutral	so if your looking for a wide_selection at a low price and have alot of patience then this is the best site for you !
neutral	im warning you prepare yourself for the wait ..
neutral	i am surprised to find your products are not very well made .
neutral	i have the back on track fleece_blanket and it has already sustained a tear .
neutral	i also have the back on track polo wraps which tore in the first use .
neutral	as much as these items costs i am surprised to find them not holding up .
neutral	as for the promises made on how they help , i like the fact that they seem to relieve muscle tightness and relax my horse .
neutral	it would have been nice to be notified when my order had been shipped , because i thought the order may have accidentally been cancelled .
neutral	much of the time i spent speaking with him was repeating things and spelling them for him .
neutral	i understand that many of these_types of jobs have been outsourced to other_countries for economic reasons it does sadden me that this has happened .
neutral	as i said he was very polite and did his best i am sure .
neutral	i decided to try this site because they were offering the hotel i wanted at $_00 cheaper per_night .
neutral	i saw that they charge $_00 for cancellation_fee , but i felt pretty sure of my dates , so i thought i ' d take the chance .
neutral	as soon as i booked , my daughter asked if we could leave on tuesday instead of monday .
neutral	i was just going to shift the trip one day over and stay the same amount of nights .
neutral	i tried to modify my reservation , but the site wanted to charge me the cancellation_fee , even for that slight modification .
neutral	i sent an_email_asking about it to customer care and they responded quickly with a call of apology but the person was unable to help me .
neutral	after a second call , another apology call told me to call customer_service or go to the members lounge online and it would not charge me for the modification .
neutral	i went to the members lounge and it was still charging me $_00 to change the day .
neutral	my question was , why do they bother to have someone call me to apologize who doesn_'_t actually work in customer_service and can '_t help me resolve my issue .
neutral	they just told me that they apologized for my issue and go on the site or call customer_service .
neutral	it was a lot of time spent for no result .
neutral	but it was slightly_cheaper , so that '_s good if you are absolutely sure you won_'_t need to modify your reservation at all .
neutral	in hindsight , it would have been better to pay a little more and get the free cancellation that the other_sites offered .
neutral	bit dissapointed with product as there does not seem to be enough bean_bags to fill sofa i purchased , have asked for some
neutral	more to be supplied free of charge .
neutral	the delivery was quick , but so_far do not feel the product was worth the money as its too saggy in the middle , if the company do not send me more bean_bags then i shall send it back .
neutral	ordered a few parts ... had to return a part ... but havent heard back from the geek ... guess they like taking the money but not doing follow - up on returns as quick as selling the part .
neutral	thanks
neutral	i always get lost when i use ebay !
neutral	!
neutral	fiz a primeira compra e ainda tô ansioso se vai dar certo mesmo , espero que corra tudo bem !
neutral	i live in yonkers .
neutral	the job that interested me was in new_jersey or ct .
neutral	as always , the service was very good ; the item arrived before the expected delivery date by a day or two .
neutral	however , i was unhappy with the product as i don_'_t think it matched the picture very well .
neutral	they were the right size and fitted fairly well , but i just didn_'_t like the item .
neutral	the refund took a week or two to come through when i sent the item back and i was given the write amount when refunded .
neutral	despite_being unhappy with the product ( due to person taste / preference ) the service was , as usual very good !
neutral	i like shopping with very , because i '_m not able to go out to many shops , and also in sales , i can get good bargains all delivered to my home .
neutral	or to collect .
neutral	the problem is , the online payments don_'_t always go through on time and i '_m then sent a charge for the problem being at your end , only for numerous staff to not know what to do or advise , yet put onto the receiving the calls from customers , which are mostly for problems .
neutral	this means more_expensive phone_calls hoping the next person will know how to deal with your problem .
neutral	being polite is not enough !
neutral	put the right people on the phones so they can give factual advice and deal with the problem .
neutral	also , some products delivered to the collect_plus can be lost once returned to the delivery station , so the product is not removed from your account and charged to you .
neutral	months of this per item is ridiculous .
neutral	it also puts me off ordering again .
neutral	it also costs a fortune having to contact very again and again over it , and it still isn_'_t done even then .
neutral	i also see many inflated priced items then reduced to the normal price they were days before in the sale .
neutral	this clearly is not sale price , but the right price it was days earlier .
neutral	i also think that the threshold used now to bnpl is way too high , meaning you are left with three_months to pay for items that used to be for 00 months free interest .
neutral	obviously , people can '_t afford those prices over three_months and will not buy .
neutral	the system used to be very different just four years_ago , plus .
neutral	now , its all over the place and not really that good .
neutral	even the delivery service is shockingly bad , and i do not want to see courier drivers in cars with my stuff , as i don_'_t know who they are , could be anyone , as happened to me once before such a person_who didn_'_t work for yodel and wanted to keep my item i returned , telling_me so .
neutral	i rang very immediately and the item was not handed in for weeks by that person , so he did try to keep £_000 worth of goods .
neutral	buying a pc from very is not something i will ever do again .
neutral	the pc was terrible for breaking down , falling to bits with normal use , but very expensive to buy , and they wouldn_'_t let_me exchange it outside of the first month .
neutral	so stuck with an hugely expensive pc that falls to bits easily and overheats all the time no_matter what we put on it or do to cool it .
neutral	when goods are faulty , they set_up to make it hard for customers to return a faulty item within the !"
neutral	month period is awful .
neutral	for a start , you are treated like you are a liar .
neutral	then have to phone the supplier and get a code , then return it to very and wait an age for it to be refunded .
neutral	it doesn_'_t always flow .
neutral	the email service is useless as they parrot out replies that do not answer the email sent to them and they tell us to ring in ... more_expensive phone_calls , so why have email ?
neutral	then very ring , if requested , acting like they are so sorry this has happened as if it '_s unusual , when it it a constant issue .
neutral	the shopping at home suits people who are ill , like me , but since things changed at very it is a very different company and one i only use when i '_m desperate or find what i want in a sale .
neutral	it '_s not joy to shop with very nowadays , like it used to be .
neutral	we are sad .
neutral	the recall of natural_balance resulted in us dumping 0 00lb_bags of lamb and rice dog_food .
neutral	when i called petflow , they sent my new bags ... i switched to salmon and sweet_potato flavor for my dogs .
neutral	they would not honor my original $_00 off coupon .
neutral	i felt it was unfair that i lost my credit due to a recall that i had no control of .
neutral	frustrated !
neutral	!
neutral	your products are alright .
neutral	but the delivery aspect of it takes like ages .
neutral	would have liked to know up front that my " bargain rate " was nonrefundable upfront as i wanted the option to cancel if needed .
neutral	then we had to readjust our reservation at the end of our conversation which extended the time that i was on the phone .
neutral	also the demeanor of the operator changed dramatically from friendly to not so much once she heard that i did not want two_nights once i learned that i could not change my reservation if i needed to .
neutral	also the tax and fees should be shared up front as well and not just the rate , again very misleading .
neutral	until i received my email_confirmation , i had no_idea how expensive they were .
neutral	i was sent the wrong item and i have been trying for 0_weeks to get_ahold of someone to help me , only to find out that they nolonger have the item i wanted ..... its the worst .
neutral	they never respond to emails !!
neutral	!
neutral	no problem ordering .
neutral	dress was majorly on sale which is good because i don_'_t think it '_s worth more than the sale price .
neutral	not bad for the sale price though .
neutral	just wish this company catered to tall girls .
neutral	the measurements were correct .
neutral	dont believe that your bathroom will be deliverd in 0 - 0 days , mine took 0_weeks , i had emails twice saying it was being despatched nxt day , it wasnt , i phoned up and was told same thing , the day before the actual delivery i was told via_email there must be 0 people to take everything of the pallat that was put on the pavement , i am a woman_who_lives alone , new 0 the area , so knew no one , me and my daughter had to lift it all of ourselves , nasty experience ,
neutral	the service was great , item came very quickly & good communication could not fault that at all but for £ 0 . 00 i expect a full tube of lip_gloss not less_than half a tube !
neutral	awful & at £ 0 . 00 !!
neutral	wish i had of gone to boots & got a full tube of lip_gloss , never again will i buy there lip glosses & will not recommend these products .
neutral	good service and everything all along , but i was a little disappointed in the color .
neutral	they look brown and tan in the photo ( and in some light in person as well ), but they are really purple / lilac .
neutral	that '_s the trouble with buying online .
neutral	if i had seen them in person , i probably would have passed .
neutral	my reason for going to drive time was to purchase a chevy malibu 0000 .
neutral	when we got to drive time , we only seen one malibu and that was being purchase and we found another vehicle that just arrived .
neutral	we fell in love with that vehicle however , it didn_'_t pass there inspection .
neutral	on the 00th drive time found a 0000 malibu and we quickly purchase the vehicle .
neutral	i received the jacket i ordered in a timely_manner .
neutral	it is just as pretty as i expected .
neutral	my only problem is that i can '_t get the zipper to work .
neutral	that was quite upsetting .
neutral	not the fastest shipping at all .
neutral	i was supposed to have received my lenses a couple days ago and i '_m still_waiting for them .
neutral	the tracking_number doesn_'_t give me a recent update on when i will receive them .
neutral	the honeymoon is over .
neutral	this started out as a great service , but now i find them unresponsive to my requests to slow my deliveries down .
neutral	the food quality is top_notch , sometimes arrives dented ( but not all the cans ).
neutral	they need to work on packaging issues .
neutral	in fairness i have never bothered to address the dented_cans w_/ them .
neutral	altho right now i am not thrilled w_/ the service .
neutral	i would sign_up again .
neutral	i '_m hoping its just a blip .
neutral	when i ordered these parts in good faith i also thought you would pay for the cores but just to find out you charge dubble shippng , good parts but will not ever order anything anymore from u again .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	so i lost my core_charge not worth sending them back ..
neutral	the parking was great !
neutral	straight_forward drive in drop_off and wait about 0 / 0 minutes for the mini bus .
neutral	the transfer from the parking to the terminal is exactly as stated about 00 seconds .
neutral	it took longer for everyone to climb in and out the van .
neutral	the only_thing that i think could be improved on was on our return , we followed the instructions given by the company to call once we had come through customs with our bags .
neutral	we did this and was told to go to the collection_point asap , as he was there waiting and had space for us , so we ran over literally in the pouring_rain .
neutral	we got there only to find that some who had not called arrived there at the same time , they were allowed on transfer over us , and we were made to stand and wait in the pouring_rain .
neutral	this was not fair and i think priority should be given to customer who have actually called up and made arrangements over customer who just pole up , particularly when it is the driver you have just spoken to and clarifies it was you he spoke to on arrival .
neutral	very annoying especially when you wanted to pop loo and grab a coffee !
neutral	we ordered 0 swim_suits in january for a cruise .
neutral	we received one of the suits , but the other was on back order and we were told that it would be shipped as soon as it was in stock .
neutral	i called the end of february to check on the item , and was told we should have it within a few_weeks , as the shop was receiving a lot of new shipments .
neutral	it is now almost june and we still have not heard any news regarding this backordered item .
neutral	buying on - line is easy at nygard -- however returns are not as easy .
neutral	yes you can return it to any store , however tracking refunds has proved to be an effort .
neutral	we should receive automatic refund amounts at time in the store .
neutral	take_lessons from reitmans - they do an amazing job .
neutral	to me the return to the store is just as good as having merchandise return to the warehouse - i had nothing that confirmed my return and the credit to my credit_card took days !!
neutral	!
neutral	checked stock_levels at our local_store and decided to reserve for collection the following_day .
neutral	unfortunately the stock_levels shown were inaccurate so there was nothing for us to collect .
neutral	big waste of time .
neutral	the delivery service seems to work much_better but as yet only part of the order has arrived .
neutral	homebase really does need to look into the repeated error_message about invalid request which slows_down both processes , whether buying or reserving when you try to put items in the basked an_error_message comes up on about half the occasions .
neutral	when we went to pick_up the car that we had reserved well in advance and it was not available .
neutral	we reserved a station wagon with automatic transmission .
neutral	the car we had to accept resulted in a great deal of stress because it was a manual transmission and we had to put a large suitcase in the back seat between two people .
neutral	we had to use this car for two_days until we could get to a larger dealer and exchange it for the car that we reserved .
neutral	we were not happy with the inconvenience this created during our vacation .
neutral	i was recommended the variety pack by a friend who loves the meat provided so decided to give it a go .
neutral	after i put in my home address for delivery i quickly realised no one would be home but the customer_service department got the address changed to my husbands work address to deliver on the wednesday .
neutral	wed came and no meat , the office had no_idea why not .
neutral	on thursday got a phone_call from a yodel delivery driver as he couldn_'_t find our address .
neutral	no meat arrived and the office had no_idea of the days correspondence .
neutral	the customer_service is first_class as they instructed yodel to cancel the delivery and they would send a new pack out on the saturday .
neutral	on friday some meat arrived !
neutral	mf didn_'_t know why !
neutral	well everything was off obviously but we could keep the pork , burgers and steaks so got a bit extra !
neutral	on sat our meat came and love it all , will be picking saturday delivery again !
neutral	they have now changed delivery company to a much more reliable one so i '_m sure there '_ll be no more issues !!
neutral	all was handled well by the mf team and so thanks !
neutral	i '_ll be ordering again !
neutral	i don_'_t think i '_ll buy meat from the supermarket any more .
neutral	oh and the burgers are amazing !
neutral	:) :)
neutral	there needs to be a section added to the website to explain the process for new passport applicants .
neutral	it is quite different than for those renewing their passport .
neutral	someone applying for a new passport needs to make appointment at the post_office or one of the approved locations for getting a passport .
neutral	the promo needs to be changed to show passport_renewal and not new passport .
neutral	the demo seems to indicate one needs only to mail the information in , which is incorrect .
neutral	if you drop a class or no_longer need the book you ordered , you can refund it however you must pay for the return shipping .
neutral	that is the first time i have heard of that .
neutral	bad for returning business .
neutral	i got my labels very quickly and they are of great quality as usual .
neutral	for some_reason they have white borders this time , which they never had before .
neutral	i had even gone to previos orders to just re - order so they should have been the same ...
neutral	i expected the trophy to come in a case not a cardboard_box stuffed with polystyrene and for the plaque to be stuck on straight , not enough time now to send it back to be straightened .
neutral	i also didn_'_t appreciate being asked to review the product / company days before i actually received the item
neutral	usually has what i need , website is easy to use , but i get really upset over the amount of junk they send me , unfortunetly if you block it you dont get order and shipment notifications
neutral	not 000_% happy with my order .
neutral	i had to make a hole in the taillight i ordered so my blinker could be visible .
neutral	the person that was helping_me was having_trouble looking up my rewards card number .
neutral	i was on the phone for 00minutes trying to make this reservation !
neutral	to long !
neutral	next time i will use the on line reservation web_site .
neutral	dependable service .
neutral	annoying how the rate goes up if you come out of the window for a couple of minutes .
neutral	not good .
neutral	great product - but communication was poor .
neutral	i specifically requested that we negotiate a delivery date to suit both_parties as i would have to arrange time off from work .
neutral	however , this didn_'_t happen and all i received was next_day notice of delivery .
neutral	i was stunned to open the box of goodies for my dog to see it was crawling with ants !
neutral	thankfully , i opened the box as soon as i got it home or else they could have been all over my kitchen ... yuk !
neutral	after cleaning up everything , i went back to my postal box ( which is outside in a " common " postal box area for my subdivision ) and checked there to see if the problem was coming from the postal box ... no problem .
neutral	i called the po to see if they had any complaints about other customers finding ants in their mailbox and they said they did not .
neutral	i have to report that the ants were not inside the sealed packages ... thank_goodness ... they were just all over the outside of the sealed packages and inside the box , itself .
neutral	i also have to stress that it was not a few ants ... there were hundreds !
neutral	it was very very yucky !
neutral	i am giving this review only 0_stars until i see what happens with my next delivery .
neutral	i will also check other reviews to see if anyone_else had this bad_experience .
neutral	i will not judge the company on one experience .
neutral	i look_forward to buying more great priced , made in usa dog_treats from petflow .
neutral	but ... i ust thought you ' d want to know about this experience .
neutral	the buses did not run to times , did not stick to route as outlined ( where no road_closures ), the earphones would not stay in my ears and both journeys that had manual speakers - one sounded irish and one scottish - struggled to understand both of them ( and i '_m english !)
neutral	i spoke to three customer_service agents over the course of about five hours on the same day .
neutral	chris was the first one , and he was wonderful .
neutral	he was very patient with my many questions , and i did book a room for three_nights , and paid in full .
neutral	( i would recommend chris for a trainer position for other agents !)
neutral	a couple of hours_later , in reviewing my reservations , i realized i had booked the wrong days !
neutral	i quickly called the same phone_number , and this time got a female agent , jackie .
neutral	i told jackie i needed to cancel the original dates , and book the same room , or one equivalent , for the following weekend .
neutral	i got most of the way through the process with her , until she quoted me a higher price !!!!
neutral	i told her there must be an_error somewhere , because the total should be $_000 . 00 , which i had paid a few hours earlier .
neutral	she assured_me there was no error , the room rate was the same , $_000_per_night , but the " taxes " were no_longer $_00 . 00 , but were somehow $_00 + !!
neutral	i asked her to recheck , as i was not going to pay a higher price for the same room .
neutral	she told me that was the price with no new fees , but perhaps the " taxes " had gone up ... in a couple of hours .
neutral	( not likely .)
neutral	i asked if she herself would pay an increased price for the same thing , on the same day , and she said , " if i wanted it badly enough ."
neutral	this is the worst customer_service i have ever received .
neutral	i told her to just leave my reservation stand , and i would book another way .
neutral	i went on expedia , and voila !
neutral	i was able to book the same room at the same price , $_000 . 00 total .
neutral	i called the number back again , and this time , i spoke with frank to cancel the original booking .
neutral	he was very polite , very efficient , and did not make me feel bad for cancelling .
neutral	he was another great example of great service !
neutral	i had never used bookit .
neutral	com before and found a great deal on a san_francisco hotel with a $_000 gift_card to use at local_restaurants .
neutral	when i tried to book i received a error prompt which instructed me to call a representative .
neutral	i received great service and all my needs were satisfied .
neutral	now i am trying to figure_out how i am suppose to get the gift_card .
neutral	it prompts you to go to the site , but when you do it doesn_'_t give you any other information on what to do ... i '_m left in the dark .
neutral	needs to be a little more friendly for people who are not completely computer savy .
neutral	i posted this on the 0th and bookit . com replyed that i would have the code in a few_days to redeem the $_000 gift_card .
neutral	today is the 0th and we leave on the 00th and i still_haven_'_t received any code or another response .
neutral	information on the program when i chose it led me to believe it would be like my other credit monitoring service i had before where you could check your report monthly .
neutral	when i signed_up and got my first report was when i found out you can only get one every three_months .
neutral	as a person watching closely this is not sufficient .
neutral	hotel was ok for the price paid , but the hotel was not informed about our booking although it was paid and confirmed .
neutral	guess we were lucky they had a room for us .
neutral	booking platform not very user_friendly .
neutral	the veterinary neurologist who oversees eddie '_s care & medication has him on ursodiol 000 mg every 00_hours .
neutral	the only place i have found it in the us is vetrxdirect . com .
neutral	the only_complaint i have is how long it takes to get it .
neutral	i guess i '_ll have to order sooner .
neutral	i haven_'_t liked the products qvc has_been offering lately .
neutral	i find good deals online for hsn that has good quality and is affordable .
neutral	switching to hsn .
neutral	i have been impressed with petflow since i first ordered through them .
neutral	the confirmations were prompt , and processing and delivery were also very speedy .
neutral	however , my last order contained 0 items .
neutral	the order was placed several weeks_ago .
neutral	i have only received one of the three items and have not gotten any information_regarding separate shipments or anything .
neutral	this has_been off - putting .
neutral	not the kind of service i like to deal with .
neutral	i ordered what i thought was a case of soymilk .
neutral	i received a badly dented box of individual quarts .
neutral	all quarts were misshapen , but none had leaked .
neutral	toothbrushes are quite soft but overall good for money
neutral	i appreciate the petflow services , use them every_month , and signed_up for the autoship discount they promised -- but never got the discount !
neutral	many_times i can get the products locally at a much_better price , which is supposed to be offset by autoship discounts and free_shipping offers - so_far it has not !
neutral	a apart_from my initial order was lost in shipping .
neutral	it took 0_weeks to get that part .
neutral	when it was confirmed that it lost in shipping , a replacement part could not be sent out .
neutral	a credit had to be issued , and i had to reorder the part .
neutral	this was a case of not so speedy_delivery !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i bought a trip on priceline , hotel , air_fare , car , etc_., along with the cancellation insurance .
neutral	i came down with the flu later that week .
neutral	priceline said i had to send a doctor '_s note .
neutral	i don_'_t go to the doctor for everything !
neutral	i lost the price of the trip and the bogus cancellation insurance cost .
neutral	beware !!
neutral	!
neutral	didn_'_t take long to get my part .
neutral	it was very easy .
neutral	wrong case was sent , but in the defense of snugg . com recieved another immediately .
neutral	and people make mistakes but u know business ... iim happily using my snugg today because the mess was cleaned up professionally .
neutral	and i respect that .
neutral	i '_ll buy from again .
neutral	just hope next time they pay_attention to detail ..
neutral	this would be better if all the features were available for apple computers too .
neutral	i can only use part of it because the programs are only available for windows .
neutral	on 0 / 0 / 0000 snowstorm in indiana .
neutral	i ws s snowed in with my mom .
neutral	she had booked expedia and they let her move to 0 / 0 flite .. no prob .
neutral	i spoke with travelocity man from india on hold for hrs .. and he said airport notshut down so i couldnt move to 0 / 0 ... i had to talk with sevl people at travelocity and get furious before they would help me . awful
neutral	one thing i noticed is that the credit_reports have not been updated ( equifax , transunion , etc_.).
neutral	even_though i know that certain information has changed on my accounts ( i have paid off large mortgages , home equity , large balances , etc_.)
neutral	and i know this information has_been reported by the bank , the credit_reports that you have on record have not been updated in several_months .
neutral	we bought an air league hb00 basketball stand .
neutral	it arrived_promptly , but that '_s the good bit .
neutral	the instructions were truly awful - no_idea of the time it takes or the tools needed ( serious socket set ).
neutral	here '_s a taster : use 00 , 00 to go through end of 00 , 00 and 00 , 00 then lock them by 00 .
neutral	fix one end of 00 , 00 into 00 lock them by 00 , 00 , 00 , 00 then fix 00 , 00 with 00 , 00 , 00 , 00 , 00 by 00 and nuts .
neutral	worse of all , some of the instructions are wrong and the pictures are wrong , too - so you waste time putting it together , taking it apart again , then putting it together .
neutral	it took me five hours with help to get the whole thing up .
neutral	now it '_s up , it '_s great , but the instructions are without_exception the worst i '_ve ever_experienced .
neutral	my shopping_experience was good but when i received the product the box was damaged .
neutral	it made me wonder_if the product was authentic .
neutral	it took three tries to get my order approved by my vet .
neutral	not sure which ' end ' was at fault .
neutral	the vet called me after they called petflow to tell me things were " all set " which they weren_'_t .
neutral	i had to call customer_service to do another order .
neutral	and had to do this again the following night .
neutral	after try # 0 , the order went through and i got the food within a few_days .
neutral	the customer_service people were nice .
neutral	but this is a hassle that i don_'_t want to go through again .
neutral	:(
neutral	i ordered a photo calendar .
neutral	the quality of the calendar and the speed of delivery was great .
neutral	i have a huge complaint however , about the software jessops uses on their website to create the calendar .
neutral	it allows you to upload all the photos but once you start creating the calendar there seems to be no way to save and come_back to your creation .
neutral	this means you have to do it in one go which is very timeconsuming and difficult .
neutral	also , i found the choice of background colours rather limited , especially if you prefer pastels .
neutral	as other online photo shops provide the option to save your creations and come_back to it to edit or re - order in the future , i don_'_t think i will be coming_back to jessops until they upgrade their software .
neutral	the on - line procedure is very straightforward , but you are not made aware you are responsible for short_term_parking fees until you have made the booking .
neutral	priceline charged me $_000 . 00 for my 0 night_stay in chicago .
neutral	the hotel gave_me a receipt for the stay at checkout for $_000 . 00 .
neutral	when i called priceline and asked about this i was told the hotel should not have given me the receipt and that it was their profit .
neutral	we booked airline_tickets with priceline . com my husband ended_up getting injured and it prevented him from being_able to fly .
neutral	priceline wouldn_'_t budge on letting us cancel our flights .
neutral	other than that , priceline has saved us a lot of money on hotels and rental_cars .
neutral	probably_won_'_t order more because of delivery issues for non_- alcoholic product .
neutral	the service was fine .
neutral	i was originally told it would be aproximately an_hour and a half to an_hour and fourty five_minutes to get my car in .
neutral	it was two and a half_hour in total .
neutral	so a better estimate system would be helpful .
neutral	or have the sales_associate come check in with the customer to give them an new estimate or just keep them in the loop about the work being done and why its taking longer_than estimated .
neutral	i had ordered the sunny knockout_rose as a gift for a friend .
neutral	when it arrived at my friend '_s house , she said that all the dirt was knocked out of the pot and scattered around the box .
neutral	i contacted brighter_blooms and was told that it was guaranteed so if it did not survive , it would be replaced .
neutral	it didn_'_t survive and when i emailed bb at that time , the response was they were out of the plant but i could have a credit_towards anything_else .
neutral	i was not interested in anything_else , so i phoned a few_days_later and fortunately was told they did have some in stock .
neutral	unsure why the stock would change in just a few_days ?
neutral	the second plant arrived in better condition and presumably won_'_t have any_issues .
neutral	i understand that once the box leaves bb , they have no control of it '_s handling , but wouldn_'_t it be best to package the plant in such a way that there is less chance of damage and / or mark the box to ensure " this end up " or something like that ?
neutral	i was satisfied with jerry ( i believe ) whom i spoke with to get the replacement , but not thrilled that the plant arrived in such poor condition to begin with .
neutral	i hope this is not a frequent complaint from other customers .
neutral	honestly , not sure i would order from bb again .
neutral	only ordered 0 items and 0 of them damaged . i wouldnt mind but in order to rectify the problems , i have to take photos , then visit your website , upload photos and then you can begin to rectify things ?
neutral	the whole proccess is not customer friendly . i shouldnt have to do any more than simply report the issues , then you do the rest . i would also have thought that your quality control would have been a bit more stringent . it would put me off any future_purchases unfortunately , and there are other items we need .
neutral	i found the price with gadget very good - although the website in my opinion , wasnt very clear .
neutral	i could not see mention of a monetary limit of gadgets until i had the boxes ticked .
neutral	also , couldnt see option to pay monthly with the result i paid in full .
neutral	my order was acknowledged timely but i haven_'_t received it yet so i '_m confused as to why you asking me to rate your service at this point .
neutral	i '_ve had good deals but i '_m still trying to get my money back from two bad deals ones been going on now for a month , this has put me off ordering anything_else as there '_s no help if things go wrong
neutral	your site is lovely and i really appreciate you working with me on the time of getting my corset fast .
neutral	everyone at prom absolutly loved it and i appreciate you having sexy plus size corsets that us luscious girls can wear and be proud of .
neutral	kuddos
neutral	had a lot to offer and i really liked my options to search so specifically .
neutral	the person i spoke with did not speak_english very well .
neutral	confused august with april on my reservation .
neutral	and had a hard time with my last name
neutral	item was good , however the tin was broken , when i contact customer_services , they werent paritcually helpful and told me to take photo to email to them , was such i pain i manage to fix myself .
neutral	and wasnt to impressed with packaging , wasnt even taped shut and box all torn !
neutral	!
neutral	just a little_worried that within days of making_reservations for german and french hotels using travelocity , my credit_card number was used to make hotel reservations in hong_kong and malaysia by someone in paris .
neutral	the thief used expedia .
neutral	i did call to notify travelocity about my security concerns but i '_m not sure your call_center is equipped to run an investigation .
neutral	the center person insured me by reservations were safe but i '_m still worried_about card security with member hotels .
neutral	prices are good , but shipping is slow .
neutral	i ordered the books on 00 / 00 / 00 and received them on 00 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	it does take away from the fact that you are charged for the books the day you order them , so you lose nearly two_weeks of rental cost and don_'_t have any books to show for it .
neutral	service fine ... but annoying to order something which was " in stock " only to find at the end of the process that it wasn_'_t
neutral	great site .
neutral	lots of photos and descriptions .
neutral	easy to use and navigate .
neutral	when paying it would not accept 0 valid cards .
neutral	i have had this problem cintinually with this site .
neutral	had to send cheque and wait for clearance .
neutral	when order arrived had a few substitute items and some out of stock .
neutral	instead of refund random products were sent .
neutral	there were disvrepencies between description of item and what was sent .
neutral	for example 00 pack of quaver crisps was 00 pack .
neutral	this was the most annoying thing , and msy stop me from using this grocer again .
neutral	friendly .
neutral	although we did not get the right part and to return it cost 00 . 00 more .
neutral	the description of the part was notaccurate .
neutral	when i called we had spent 0 days trying to find a place .
neutral	was so glad we found a room !
neutral	i have used hispek twice recently .
neutral	my first experience was very good .
neutral	my second experience was confusing .
neutral	fistly when i ordered i gave a delivery address , the product was not delivered .
neutral	i left a message for someone to cotact me and was given a number that was not available .
neutral	i had to go back on the internet for company number and contacted them again and was told i had to give a delelivery address , which i had given originally with my order .
neutral	evenually i did get my order , but not as quick as the first time and with more difficulty .
neutral	i have been purchasing buddy sticks for several year - my daughter and i .
neutral	they used to be thick and chewy and would give our dogs a great " chew " time !
neutral	00_% in the bag are now thin ( both short and long buddy sticks ) and the dogs chew them up in a couple minutes !
neutral	where are my old bully_sticks ?
neutral	can i specify " thick " bully_sticks when i order ??
neutral	thank_you for your time .
neutral	i buy a lot of discounted giftcards on - line .
neutral	giftcards . com offers the advantage of a 000 day guarantee but seems to have fewer cards than other_companies and aren_'_t as discounted .
neutral	i would '_ve given yulo 0_stars , but i '_m still_waiting for my order .
neutral	i placed my order on the 00 dec . and 0_weeks_later i have recieved 0 packages .
neutral	still not the complete order .
neutral	no e_- mail informing_me that it will be delayed or out of stock .
neutral	so that '_s why they got 0 out of 0_stars .
neutral	but , i also have to say that this is the cheapest shipping out of all the websites i '_ve ordered so_far .
neutral	and they have the biggest selection .
neutral	i hope in the future they get the shipping a little more on time , but other than that i '_m happy with what i got .
neutral	i was disappointed by two things in my mr . chewy order .
neutral	first , the order was sent in two packages .
neutral	when # 0 of 0 was delivered first , there was no packing_slip or invoice .
neutral	i didn_'_t know if i needed to report that only half the shipment was received , or if i just needed to wait a few_days for the remainder of my shipment .
neutral	some instructions would have been very helpful .
neutral	second , although the outside of the box was not damaged , when i opened my order , half a dozen cans of cat_food were dented .
neutral	i don_'_t know if dented_cans can be used or need to be discarded .
neutral	again , a quality control statement or instructions should have been included .
neutral	the dog_food arrived in fine shape but the box was just about falling_apart .
neutral	the tape didn_'_t hold the box together .
neutral	not sure if it was bad tape or the person taping the box was a little stingy on taping .
neutral	after completing your order you ' re notified with your confirmation that the driver will only deliver your order on a crate to a ground_floor entrance door .
neutral	this is not what i ' d expect from , especially when paying , from a delivery service .
neutral	delivery man was lovely but not what i ' d expect from a company .
neutral	we order some items from the bath store and two men arrived with our delivery and brought it right into where we asked in our first floor_flat .
neutral	i have never had a dell computer that lasted_longer_than 00 mos !
neutral	great while it lasts but that isn_'_t very long
neutral	i just calculated my orders in the last 00 months and they total over $ 0 , 000 . 00 .
neutral	while almost every_single order has had no_issues , my last one ( last_week ) did .
neutral	one of my items arrived broken , with glass shreds everywhere .
neutral	i called pf that night ( 0 days ago ) and left a voicemail with specific information_regarding the issue and order details .
neutral	nobody has contacted me via_email or phone .
neutral	while many may have time for following up , i have been busy trying to nurse 0 children ( one of whom has autism ) back to health and i don_'_t have one of the products i counted on .
neutral	i also do not like the new 0 day shipping policy .
neutral	i used to be able to upgrade to 0 day without spending $_000 .
neutral	while many of my orders far exceed that amount , i place a lot of " onesie , twosie " orders .
neutral	most people need one item quickly --- not ten .
neutral	there are other_places to buy my supplements and if they can '_t put customers first again , i will go there .
neutral	quick delivery but cost me an_arm and a leg in labor !
neutral	i ordered 0 day shipping and received next_day which was great .
neutral	i had the part installed in my car to find out it is defective .
neutral	i called partsgeek which literally took 0 days to get a hold of .
neutral	i explained the situation and asked for them to send me a replacement part and return shipping .
neutral	the sales_rep said they will not send out a replacement part without the defective part returned first .
neutral	" we don_'_t just send out free parts " he said .
neutral	so they wanted me to pay for labor to have the faulty part installed , pay again to have it taken out , pay expedited_shipping for the replacement ( while having no car to get to work ,) to then pay to have the good part installed again .
neutral	i took a chance on reordering again through pg and this experience was much_better .
neutral	they gave_me 00 days to return the old part and refunded my defective part with no problem .
neutral	this is a classic case of , you get what you pay for !
neutral	no other competitor of theirs have i found come close to their pricing .
neutral	i think the issue lies in a small customer_service team , but i don_'_t think they are out to get anyone .
neutral	i will consider ordering in the future .
neutral	one of the items i ordered was swapped out prior to shipping by the manufacturer .
neutral	i got 0 of the same part instead of a left and right .
neutral	getting the issue sorted_out is taking weeks because of the back and forth_between me and kurt from your customer_service dept ( who couldn_'_t be nicer about the whole thing ) and kurt and omix .
neutral	meanwhile , i '_ve got a box with the incorrect part sitting in my entry way and after 0_weeks still no_idea as to what to do with it or when i can expect the part i actually ordered .
neutral	disappointed in the flavor of the coffees particularly the rwandan
neutral	when i placed my order , i specifically_asked for a little extra seaweed and saltwater since they are shipping to my house at 00 , 000 feet elevation and the air is extremely dry .
neutral	when the order arrived , there was no seaweed at all and no water .
neutral	just a dried up piece of newspaper that once was wet .
neutral	one of the lobsters was barely hanging on to life not moving at all , so we cooked it , but aren_'_t comfortable eating it .
neutral	i also am upset with ups because they said that my address was incorrect , but it was not .
neutral	they didn_'_t even try to deliver and i had to contact them and pick it up from the ups store .
neutral	always use fedex !!!
neutral	they are independent contractor delivery - men who care about their delivers .
neutral	although we had these issues , the 0 of the 0 lobster that were good , were fabulous .
neutral	the biggest_problem is that it took so long to receive my order .
neutral	i ordered on 0 - 00 - 00 and didn_'_t receive it until 0 - 0 - 00 .
neutral	i was expecting to 0 - 0 days .
neutral	that is usually how long it takes from double inks .
neutral	i ended_up buying it at walmart .
neutral	i was working on a project and could not afford to keep waiting .
neutral	good priced products but very slow free delivery .
neutral	really don_'_t want to pay for quicker delivery as might as well go to department store .
neutral	it was not explained adequately that the airlines do not honor your seat selections .
neutral	it was a trip disappointment that our seats were not together on the long trip .
neutral	and the airline choice was bad .
neutral	people not helpful with the problem .
neutral	they did not care .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	worst travel experience for awhile .
neutral	i paid through paypal and didn_'_t recieve any shipping information neither an_email with my order information .
neutral	it took_forever to get in touch with customer_service when i had to return an item and get a rma_number .
neutral	i had to become a member in order to get my store credit , not including the shipping i paid to get the product and send it back .
neutral	when i made my new purchase i still did not receive any shipping information either an_email with the order confirmation .
neutral	the prices are very reasonable .
neutral	the plants ( bareroot knockout_roses ) are okay , but i requested " jen " the delivery to be after april 00 as i would not be available at home until then .
neutral	they came the first week of april .
neutral	put in a bucket of water , we had a snow and freeze i couldn_'_t get them in the ground until the 00th .
neutral	looked poorly , i hope they survive .
neutral	i haven_'_t yet received my order , and the reason i haven_'_t is that the package was addressed inadequately and the post_office returned it to sender !
neutral	i opted to pay extra for having the package sent through the p . o .
neutral	because i find ups to be a total pain .
neutral	i live in a remote_area , and often the drivers couldn_'_t be bothered to come all this way , so they dump the package at a small , post_office that '_s " near " me , but in the opposite direction of any route i normally take , and for good measure , only open half days .
neutral	pureformulas standard shipping is via_ups , so i paid_extra to have it shipped to my own po_box in the town in which i shop .
neutral	personally , i don_'_t think i should have to pay extra for this , seeing that you offer " free_shipping " - another statement not quite on the mark - very much in line with your coupons .
neutral	i '_m getting pretty fed up with the shipping issues , and if i don_'_t receive my order in the next 0 or 0 days , no extra_charges , i will find someone_else who sells this product .
neutral	if that '_s not possible , i '_ll find a comparable product elsewhere .
neutral	i was very impressed with the service , ie fast delivery and exact size and quality i expected but the colours were poor compared with my original photo - far too dark and strong .
neutral	i don_'_t think i would ever use your canvas_print service again .
neutral	on the surface i thought the cleaner had done a good job but on closer inspection found she had failed to move things in the kitchen , just cleaning around them and the windows were smeary .
neutral	it was a difficult job cleaning a rather dirty bachelor one bedroom flat in one day , but i feel the £_00 i was charged was very expensive for the service i received .
neutral	when i asked if it was possible for the cleaner to come_back for another couple of hours i was told i would have to pay the £_00 admin_fee again .
neutral	no way - i will do it myself !
neutral	i , just , signed_up with your site , so i don_'_t want to give any review yet .
neutral	i am , still , unsure of how this will benefit me .
neutral	please , just keep me updated .
neutral	i will post my opinion when i see results .
neutral	oh , one other thing ... would you let us know when we are purchasing from your site .
neutral	it is unclear .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	petflow has the important things down -- great selection , prices , and people .
neutral	but i consistently find their website functionality frustrating ... should be more intuitive at the cart / account management stage ( search and selection is good ).
neutral	it would be nice if it were easier and quicker to change up the products and / or delivery frequency .
neutral	the auto - ship service is a great idea , and i appreciate being_able to have raw diet foods delivered to my doorstep , especially_considering that they ' re virtually unavailable locally .
neutral	but the ability to change or add to an existing standing order is dreadful .
neutral	often i '_ve wanted to include additional items to the pending shipment , but can '_t figure_out how to do it .
neutral	i '_m quite computer_savvy , and do a lot of shopping on line , and this is the most frustrating web_site out there from the ordering standpoint .
neutral	searching for and finding fun things to order is easy enough , tho '.
neutral	the shipping seems quite slow , which is why the automatic shipping works well .
neutral	soweit ich beurteilen kann , waren die_blumen , die_ich meiner mutter zum geburtstag schicken liesse , sehr schoen .
neutral	das lieferdatum sollte allerdings 00 .
neutral	februar sein und_die_blumen wurden erst einen tag spaeter geliefert .
neutral	i am very pleased with pureformula . com '_s price .
neutral	however , i expected my delivery in a shorter time .
neutral	a little disappointed .
neutral	i expected delivery in 0 days and got it in 0 days .
neutral	:(
neutral	i would probably order from them again because their price is the cheapest i '_ve found so_far .
neutral	next time i wlll order when i don_'_t have an urgent need .
neutral	i have rented_books from bookbyte so i was comfortable knowing i would get what i needed when i needed it .
neutral	my only_complaint was not being_able to keep_track of where my books were .
neutral	i got one notification when it left and didn_'_t get anything_else until the day before it got to my city .
neutral	but , it arrived before classes started so i was satisfied -- but that may have everything to do with the fact i ordered it around dec . 00 .
neutral	it got to me jan . 0 .
neutral	the product was the correct order but , there was no new clips or hose '_s on cowl ..
neutral	i love you all but i may have to stop using you .
neutral	i complained once about the lack of packing_material around the cases of canned_food which this routinely results in several slightly dinged cans .
neutral	i was told ( laughably ) that you are ' constantly exploring new packing methods '.
neutral	what a joke .
neutral	this is not rocket science .
neutral	you are clearly just cutting corners to save time and money ... often there is only a small piece of bubble_wrap just tossed in the box like decoration .
neutral	why even_bother ?
neutral	sometimes there is no bubble_wrap or other material to keep the multiple cases i order at one time from sliding around inside the box and crashing into each other .
neutral	in fact , lately several cans have been so badly_damaged it looks like someone smashed them with a hammer .
neutral	at_least one i tossed b /_c it was clearly punctured and leaking .
neutral	i am quite reluctant to use the others in case there is less obvious damage that could nonetheless cause spoilage .
neutral	instead , when i have 00 of these really badly smashed cans i am planning to ask for a free case .
neutral	if i don_'_t get it , i '_m done with petflow -- which would be a loss for us both .
neutral	for me , b /_c i value the convenience of online ordering and for you , b /_c i am a pretty good customer of yours with three dogs .
neutral	so it '_s up to you ... start protecting those cans with packing_material or i am going to become an ex - customer .
neutral	looks just exactly like the photos - but the wig pops off the back of my daughter '_s normal sized head ( she wears normal hat sizes ) we are kind if in a panic to find a suitable replacement that will fit .
neutral	shipping was on time - issue is strictly a fit issue .
neutral	very nice hotel , beautiful surroundings .
neutral	we thought it was hard to find .
neutral	the ' complimentary ' shuttle isn_'_t really free .
neutral	they expect tips .
neutral	the casino didn_'_t offer any free meal or drink when you sign_up for the players ' club .
neutral	food choices were minimal but expensive ($ 0 . 00 for 0 slice of pizza ).
neutral	the casino staff were extremely courteous .
neutral	the king - size bed was very comfortable .
neutral	check - in and check - out were fuss free .
neutral	i entered the isbn_number and picked the cheapest price not thinking it would be anything other than my chem book , but when i got it in the mail it turned_out to be the study guide and lab manual , so i had to return it .
neutral	i don_'_t think they should put anything_else besides the book with the isbn_number as an option to choose because it was obviously confusing for people like me who are in a hurry .
neutral	ordering is easy and the package arrives in 0 days
neutral	unfortunately i call to do a reservation adding our kids and he didn_'_t fulfill our request making it difficult for us to make_changes
neutral	ordered three items two of which were great but sent the shoes back and it took an age to get the refund through , it seems they ' re very quick to take your payment , not so quick to give it back .
neutral	i appreciate the service offered .
neutral	however the timed lights should be extended .
neutral	its frustrating to work in my storage and every two minutes having to walk out to reset the light .
neutral	it '_s been over a week and i haven_'_t received the part yet .
neutral	i looked at my tracking_number and the info said the part was sent , but retrieved and sent back to the company .
neutral	i put in a request on a support_ticket to find out why and i havn '_t heard form the support department yet .
neutral	so i '_m still_waiting ....
neutral	the website was quick and easy to use .
neutral	i live in australia and found this a great way to send a gift to my sister in the netherlands .
neutral	however , while the florist delivered the flowers , the teddy and flour food i also ordered was left in the delivery van .
neutral	they were delivered the next_day with an_apology note , but that was only after i followed_up the issue .
neutral	i am a little let_down by serenataflowers . com .
neutral	my father died and before going asked me to send flowers to my mum for valentines .
neutral	i did this but unfortunately she only received 0 yellow_roses & very few white freesia plus she had a very nice box of chocolates instead of her all time favourite crumbly fudge .
neutral	she is of course oblivious to their error but i will think_twice before using this company again .
neutral	on a perdu 0 h à_l arrivée : on s est fait très mal recevoir par les autres loueurs et_le numéro de téléphone local de donnait pas le bon interlocuteur .
neutral	le pb a été pris en charge par le num autoscape plutot efficacement .
neutral	et_je_recommande de prendre une assurance qui augmente le tarif de 00_% tout de meme quand on va en haute corse où les routes sont_très dangeureuses .
neutral	purchase was easy , but never received a confirmation that item was shipped .
neutral	a week went by and nothing so i checked the status by shipping number and found that it said it had arrived a day prior .
neutral	i live in an apartment and if there isn_'_t a someone at the door for package acceptance , the package is taken to the office .
neutral	after knowing that the package was probably at the office , learned that the office was closed for the holidays / weekend and had to go out and buy a small bag to last us till i could get this bag from the office .
neutral	too much hassle , savings wasn_'_t worth it after i had to buy the little bag .
neutral	fast service .
neutral	order was correct but many of the cans were dented .
neutral	cant see out of one side now sure they got the prescription right , and they also took three_weeks to get to my house , slow shipping
neutral	i am still_waiting for a part that i can use , i have recieved the chevy grill for my truck
neutral	twice_now , and both_times the part has_been broken .
neutral	your packing methods of the parts need to be better .
neutral	the box had no support for the part to hold up during shipping
neutral	other wise you were reasonable on the order and getting it shipped .
neutral	so b_&_h was recommended by my photography instructor .
neutral	i used the 000 number to speak with someone to recommend a dslr camera to me .
neutral	the number went straight to the video department , which i learned after holding listening to music for 0 minutes .
neutral	three people , and 00_minutes later , i finally spoke with someone_who seemed very helpful .
neutral	i ordered a camera , shipping was free , hoping i will love the camera .
neutral	i was very excited to find a company with free_shipping to purchase my litter and cat_food needs , but when my first order arrived , one of the bags of crystal litter had split_open and spilled all over the inside of the box .
neutral	my stepdaughter suggested that i go on skyscanner to book a vacation to mexico .
neutral	i didn_'_t realize that i would then be transferred to skytours which was fine .
neutral	i made my reservation and paid with a credit_card .
neutral	i got an e_- mail saying that i was successful in making my reservation , however i was in que to have my tickets issued .
neutral	it has_been 00_hours and i don_'_t have a final confirmation which makes me nervous .
neutral	i sent an e_- mail and was told i couldn_'_t send another as it would clog the system and take longer for answer to my inquiry .
neutral	i still don_'_t know if my tickets have been issued ...... help !
neutral	when i called the woman i spoke with was very helpful in assisting_me find a location that fit into my budget .
neutral	however , when i called the facility , after asking many questions , i learned that the rate i was quoted was an introductory rate and the charge would double after two months !
neutral	i should have been told this in the beginning .
neutral	i felt a deceived .
neutral	fender flare did ' nt have nuts or washers to install went to several auto_parts stores and finally found some at at ace hardware .
neutral	nuts . 00_cents each and washers 00 cent each . not counting gas .
neutral	when the mechanism is delivered , try again .
neutral	i love the idea of the service and the price is good - but the shipping takes a full week or more .
neutral	so whatever number of weeks i select for frequency - it is really an_additional week on top of that .
neutral	was waiting so long for last shipment and had run_out of food several days before so i went on to amazon and found same price and no shipping there .
neutral	i ordered out of desperation and received that order before the petflow order came .
neutral	donovan was a great technician to work with .
neutral	he was professional and went out of his way to assist me .
neutral	he even swept the floor after he was done completing the installment .
neutral	i would recommend him to anyone .
neutral	i needed my passport in 00_hours for a monday trip , while rushpassport got the job_done , i almost did not get my passport .....
neutral	i was proactive and called their office the next_day in the afternoon to ask if my passport would be ready and when can i come to get it .
neutral	the response i was given was , well only know know if it '_s ready until we go and pick them up from the consulate today .
neutral	my second question was did it get approved ?...
neutral	and their answer was , we do not know until we go to pick it up until later today .
neutral	i finally got a call later that day , saying that my passport was ready but it was 0 / 0 hour before their offices close , and i live over and hour away .
neutral	so you do you that math .
neutral	thank_god , they were open on saturday and i could pick it up before my trip .
neutral	the ordering was very easy and pleasent .
neutral	the gal who helped_me seemed very knowledgeable .
neutral	i was please with the speed of delivery
neutral	however the contact for my right eye seems to be a problem as it is causing my right eye to be very blurry
neutral	i love delivery . com because i can get anything from food to alcohol delivered .
neutral	their filters make it easy to find what you want , but i have found that searching by food item doesn_'_t work too well .
neutral	my only problem is that they don_'_t give you a time estimate .
neutral	also , i '_ve had past experiences where i ordered wine and received a different one because they had run_out .
neutral	they should have called but in two instances at different companies they brought me something_else .
neutral	they also didn_'_t id upon delivery , which i thought was strange .
neutral	i was really hoping to get something i could frame that didn_'_t say " souvenir " on .
neutral	that makes everyone believe i gao scammed .
neutral	i was disappointed by phone to find out that some rates that were advertised online were better deals than the options spoken to me .
neutral	my order came 0 mins late due to the wrong_address & postcode having been passes on , luckily the driver_rang twice to get the correct details so the food did get to me in the end !
neutral	i purchased several items from nygard on line .
neutral	i loved all of the items i ordered , however one of them was the wrong_size and i returned it .
neutral	my receipt from the post_office shows i mailed it on 0 may , it is now 0 june and yet i have still not received either an acknowledgement of my return or a replacement for the item .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	i received an_email acknowledging the order and stating it was being_processed immediately after i placed it .
neutral	however , it then took 00 days for the cards to arrive .
neutral	we intended to give these out at a department function but they didn_'_t arrive in time .
neutral	i don_'_t like the fact that my rental started after i payed but i got the book a week_later .
neutral	so i have a week less to use the book .
neutral	the book arrived in very good condition tho .
neutral	i was informed that i would receive a tracking_number within 0 days - did not happen until the 0th day .
neutral	on the third day , tried_calling their office , but to no_avail .
neutral	no one picked_up the phone at all .
neutral	talk about poor customer_service .
neutral	beware of that !
neutral	order was initially dispatched promptly and i received both an_email and text_message advising me that it was on the way .
neutral	however , the day after i was expecting it to arrive i received a call from customer_services to say that another chair was going to be dispatched due to the first one being damaged in transit .
neutral	whilst i was frustrated that i ' d have to wait another few_days i was grateful that customer_services had already acted on the issue and had kept me informed .
neutral	when my order was dispatched again , i got a text advising me it would be delivered between_0am & 0pm !
neutral	hanging_around for this length of time for a delivery is not entirely satisfactory when another company i '_ve used were able to tell me in what hour_slot my order would arrive .
neutral	the chair itself has_been fantastic .
neutral	i have bought it for when our bub arrives for feeding but until then have found it more comfy than the sofa as i '_ve got larger .
neutral	the pockets on the arms are very useful ( good spot for hiding the tv remote ) and i like the glidng rather_than rocking motion which the foot stool glides with .
neutral	finally , i especially like the fact that precious_little one were able to sell the tutti bambini glider chair cheaper_than anywhere_else i ' d looked !
neutral	they did not call back with quote and availability , like they said they would .
neutral	i ordered and received the yellow jasmine .
neutral	unfortunately they were on the fedex_truck for 0 days and are still in shock .... hoping they will survive .
neutral	it was my understanding that the plants would be shipped by fed_ex and deliverd asap .
neutral	as much as i paid for the plants and the shipping , i certainly was not expecting them to be sitting in a truck for 0 days .... very dissapointed in this and am afraid that the plants may not survive because of it .
neutral	ask them to put the part in a box that protects it from the postal people .
neutral	i have no_problems with the products , but when products are backordered it '_s disturbing because i don_'_t find out until after the order has_been placed .
neutral	my new puppy is a joy !
neutral	he is a goldendoodle ( second generation ) and is 00 weeks old now .
neutral	he looks kinda like a poddle .
neutral	he is very smart and affectionate .
neutral	he learns tricks and commands usually in one try .
neutral	the toy that was in the box was coming apart after 0 minutes .
neutral	he found a thread and pulled until it was about 0 feet long .
neutral	this is not good .
neutral	he still has his baby teeth so the chewy strips are good for him .
neutral	easy to place order but they ship with fedx order was lost and no refund , a lot of money lost , no contact info for geek
neutral	i ordered the initial shipment of spoiled_rotten pets .
neutral	luckily , i canceled before the regular full shipments started .
neutral	my dogs didn_'_t like part of the treats .. it was kind of like a sausage roll .
neutral	i had to open the entire package , cut it up , and put it in another bag just to be able to use it .
neutral	needless to say , my dogs didn_'_t really like it which is very unusual since they eat almost anything .
neutral	the other product that was wasted was cleaning wipes .
neutral	that is the last item i would have chose to put in a shipment .
neutral	i don_'_t know what i '_ll do with those .
neutral	i hate to just throw them away but i won_'_t use them .
neutral	the spoiled_rotten pet box is a good idea , but it needs to be items that aren_'_t a waste of money .
neutral	maybe the company should ask more questions and gear the boxes toward small dogs ... house dogs .... long hair ... short hair ... etc .
neutral	so i had to travel for a week in orlando , a city i '_ve visited but don_'_t know well .
neutral	paid for a gps in case the one in my phone acted goofy and of course , the night that i was driving back from a dinner in a part of town i did not know at all , it quit_working .
neutral	as in turned itself off even_though connected and charged up .
neutral	when i finally made it back to my hotel after stopping to get directions i called the 000 # on my car_rental info sheet .
neutral	a recording gave_me the local number where they are supposedly available 00 / 0 .
neutral	it was disconnected !
neutral	i called travelocity for help thinking since they worked with this company they must have up - to - date info .
neutral	no such luck .
neutral	operator was sympathetic but basically transferred me back to the 000 # i already had .
neutral	boo to travelocity for not vetting your partners better and making sure they keep their info up - to - date for consumers .
neutral	learned my lesson and will pay extra for the name_brand rental companies next time .
neutral	was very pleased with the items that i purchased , good price and quality .
neutral	however very disappointed with the delivery company !
neutral	i live in an apartment building with a concierge at the front_desk , delivery man walked past the concierge came up to my door when i wasn_'_t in and rather_than leaving with the concierge , left a slip of paper to say it wasnt delivered on the floor in the hallway and not through my letter_box !
neutral	hassle getting in contact with the company to reschedule new delivery !
neutral	got the box with my item but one item was missing .
neutral	no email about it and when i emailed to see what is going on didn_'_t got no answer only after the second time i emailed .
neutral	did calle after two day to customer_service , waited an_hour on the phone , them fined out that they will deliver it separated but i will never knew about it till i called .
neutral	still_waiting for my item and still no email and respond .
neutral	not happy at all !
neutral	removed sms fee on the order but was still charged for it .
neutral	not too impressed with the way charges are heaped on at the end of booking ryanair style .
neutral	i loved the hemp facial spray most .
neutral	it certainly does leave a glow on my skin .
neutral	i also ordered the hemp moisturiser and msm moisturiser .
neutral	however whilst they are packed with goodness and absolutely feed your skin they were too oily for my oily skin .
neutral	i wish this had been made clear on the website or at_least some more clear guidance on which products suit which skin type .
neutral	the moisturisers are impossible to use for day as they leave a greasy film and shine on my skin .
neutral	however i don_'_t doubt the integrity and good intention these products are made with .
neutral	qualities which are sadly lacking in most well_known brand_names which service profit ahead of customer well being .
neutral	sale item was supposed to be a size 0 , they were marked a size 0 , but they were too small for my size 0 feet , must have been a 0 so i had to return them .
neutral	the other pair , great , they fit like a glove !
neutral	it was difficult finding where your stops where , even when i was on the right street i had to resort to asking a regular bus driver who then pointed them out to me .
neutral	also there was no clear indication that the buses only ran between certain times so you can imagine our dismay at six o ' clock to learn that this was the last bus for the evening and we were at marble_arch and wanted to go to the london_eye .
neutral	because of this i also found that the last bus of the day was crowded and it was difficult getting both on and off .
neutral	your drivers and guides on the bus were amazing , very friendly and did a remarkable job of crowd control .
neutral	however for five elderly ladies taxies were our best bet .
neutral	always try and check with hotel_directly .
neutral	agoda may say " only 0 room left " but plenty on site at better rate .
neutral	in khoa sok the room was over priced for value plus we couldn_'_t check out one day early .
neutral	lost entire room price .
neutral	plus original tree house room smelled so bad we had to move .
neutral	no discount .
neutral	just beware .
neutral	debi
neutral	priceline was a good way to look at all the different hotels around and find the best deal .
neutral	it has_been over 00 days since i ordered an paid for the item i purchased .
neutral	waiting for response from store that i purchased the item .
neutral	hope that we can resolve this issue quickly .
neutral	the car was clunky , and had a very dark interior .
neutral	we were offered the full_tank option at 0 pence less_than market value , but the tank coast over 000_pounds and we only used half the tank .
neutral	the service guys were very helpful but the choices we made about the vauxhall station wagon and the petrol were not great .
neutral	have tried many_times to get_ahold of some one but with no response your parts looked very good but it would not work .
neutral	sorry i still have your email address on file .
neutral	please i hope you understand .
neutral	i love this company & appreciate the discounts on the snacks and chews in particular .
neutral	i love their products that i have purchased so_far .
neutral	this last time i ordered - my order did not turn out as i hoped .
neutral	my confirmation invoice showed i ordered a couple of chewies at 0 & 00 " long , but received 0 - 0 " & 0 " product .
neutral	i was chargedfor what at i received however .
neutral	just misleading & i didn_'_t get what i really wanted !
neutral	it was a lovely hamper but upset it was left on the door_step of a house on a busy road
neutral	i was surprised and disappointed to have my credit_card charged prior to my stay .
neutral	i would have expected the csr that took my reservation to tell me that in advance especially_since the bill was for more than $_000 .
neutral	i was also disappointed that the rep quoted a rate $_00 higher that the rate listed on the website .
neutral	ordering from springer through their web_site was a snap however i am still_waiting for the product to be delivered to my house .
neutral	i ordered on june_0th and my credit_card has_been charged .
neutral	i guess i will have to call which is a pain
neutral	i wish i ' d known it would take 0_wks to receive my cat_food .
neutral	in the future i will plan_ahead .
neutral	the price is worth the wait .
neutral	i am happy with my purchases , jumper and bodysuit are both good quality , my only problem was my parcel was delivered to my next door neighbour as there was nobody home the card was put through their door and parcel was left over their back gate , luckily i got the parcel ok but this could have caused a problem .
neutral	i have been receiving deliveries of my cat '_s food and litter for quite some time now and i loved it .
neutral	but recently , i enrolled in the spoiled_rotten plan .
neutral	i am thinking that the price of the box was over $_00 but the " value " was supposed to be much higher .
neutral	my first shipment came last_week .
neutral	i was extremely disappointed .
neutral	there was some freeze_dried food that you add water to before you feed the cats , a can of food , a cheap wire brush , a toy or two - none of which my 0 cats will play with , and a plastic bracelet for me that said " i love my cats ".
neutral	there really isn_'_t anything in the box i would ever use .
neutral	i will do the responsible thing , however , and take it to the local_animal_shelter .
neutral	if this is the stuff that was in the very first ever shipment - i '_m positive i don_'_t want a second .
neutral	excellent deals but the outside companies are dreadfull in y personal experience
neutral	i book a lot of things online , products , flights , accommodation , hire cars etc as my husband and i are frequent travelers .
neutral	i found that your online booking system did not provide enough warning before booking was confirmed .
neutral	usually you get one further page summary of the accommodation and payment details before the booking is confirmed .
neutral	just provides the consumer with another check point of the information entered before payment is taken and booking is confirmed .
neutral	the blue lights were part of an order and they are great value , unlike the rest of my order which has , sadly , been returned .
neutral	the small tea_lights are badly made , couldn_'_t see them lasting long and an £_00 plastic light ball arrived damaged and of extremely poor quality .
neutral	i also returned some colour changing light_bulbs as they wouldn_'_t work in a normal lamp .
neutral	it should have been made clear that they are for a belt and not lamps .
neutral	i now await a response re my returns .
neutral	must add , however , that my experience of customer care so_far has_been very positive .
neutral	i am returning the dress unfortunately , i really loved the material and colour but is not a size large in reality .
neutral	i wear size 00 to small size 00 so i ordered a large size , but the dress does nt even a size00 , actually it is around a size 00 .
neutral	i have ordered pet_food on here in the past and the experience was easy and fast .
neutral	i ordered a t - shirt for a friend , which i needed delivered to a friends address .
neutral	i originally got an_email back saying my cc did not go through .
neutral	this was impossible ... really .
neutral	so i emailed the helpdesk .
neutral	they said they got the cc to go through with no_issues .
neutral	i got another email after saying that my cc was denied again and to update my information .
neutral	i emailed the helpdesk again , and was told that there were no_issues and it should be there next week .
neutral	well , at some point the shipping address was changed to my shipping address , so the package came to me ... annoying , now i have to pay double shipping .
neutral	also , the fedex_tracking_number showed the package sat in nj for about a week with no updated scan ...
neutral	this was a bad and confusing experience and ended_up costing me more than ordering this from amazon .
neutral	there was some_confusion about when i would receive my order .
neutral	unbeknownst to me , it was broken up into two_separate shipments ( toys in the first , prescription food in the other ).
neutral	the tracking_information provided was only for the shipment containing the toys .
neutral	when i called to ask where the food was , they explained the issue .
neutral	i think that it should be made clear when you order exactly how many days until delivery are expected , and if there is a delay due to a prescription for pet_food .
neutral	when i found out that the prescription was approved , and the item was in kansas , but would take another week to arrive ( despite that i '_m in omaha , not exactly a week away ), i wanted to cancel my order .
neutral	it was then that all of a sudden they found out that the food had been " expedited " and lo and behold , would arrive via_ups the following_day .
neutral	varen blev_leveret et_par dage_efter bestilling og alting virker upåklageligt .
neutral	dog havde forretningen valgt at pakke den oprindelige kasse ind i en større kasse , som ikke kunne leveres til døgnposten , og_jeg måtte på_posthuset og hente pakken .
neutral	det_var lidt mærkeligt og virkede ikke umiddelbart nødvendigt med_den store kasse .
neutral	we did not feel the experience was worth the money .
neutral	however , it may have been improved had we realized how much_better the recorded audio_guide was than the live_guide .
neutral	we switched to the blue line because we got tired of waiting for the red guide line and found the recorded version so much_easier to understand and was actually better done than the live_guide we experienced .
neutral	in addition , it would be helpful to have known how long you must wait for the green line in order to get out to the british museum .
neutral	it was actually a lot quicker to just walk there which is what we did upon our return trip , once we realized how much time we wasted waiting for the bus .
neutral	we did enjoy the boat_trip which we took_advantage of and helped to feel_like we got a little more for our money considering we gave up on a lot of the bus_tour due to the time it took & disappointing live_guide we had .
neutral	in fact , we enjoyed the boat_trip so much we stayed on the boat & did a return trip to the site we got on the boat and then walked home .
neutral	the boat commentator who did a volunteer guided_tour on the river did a wonderful job ( of course , for tips ) which was more enjoyable than any of the bus_tour experiences we had earlier in the day !
neutral	i ordered two items .
neutral	0 - jacket and the other was some leggins .
neutral	i really like the leggings , but i thought i got a bigger_size .
neutral	i like them so much that i am still gone to wear them .
neutral	as for the jacket , i did not realize it was a crop jacket .
neutral	i sent it back .
neutral	what i don_'_t like is that i had to pay ( $ 0 . 00 for 0 item ) to send the item back to new_york and i live in maryland - wow .
neutral	not sure i will be ordering from this site again .
neutral	the jury is still out on that one !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	this rental with europecar was my best experience so_far but there is still a long way for them to go with customer_service .
neutral	for my personal trips i usually use europecar but last_year for business in ireland i used a competitor and the difference in customer_service is huge !
neutral	europecar needs to stop having so many " extra " charges once you pick_up the car and it would be nice for them to offer a map of the country or at_least the city you are in !
neutral	another great thing your competitor does is have someone come out to the car with you to go over the basics and do a once over to ensure everything as it is stated on the sheet .
neutral	it is the little things that make a huge_difference .
neutral	i will say that when i dropped_off this rental the people were the best i have dealt_with yet at europecar .
neutral	they were both professional , friendly and genuinely pleasant to deal with .
neutral	past experience has_been to leave feeling as though i have been ripped_off somehow .
neutral	some good deals but it took 0 days before my order shipped .
neutral	got one bracket and its 0 / 00 / 00 and still_waiting on the other bracket .
neutral	ups is to slow and not very dependable on delivery plain lazy ...
neutral	as one of the original clients of petflow automatic delivery who stopped using them , not because of their price , service or products but because my primary dog that ate the majority of food died , i was disappointed upon reordering .
neutral	i had purchased dog_food along with some great introductory specials they offered but i deferred delivery as i didn_'_t need food at that time .
neutral	upon delivery i only received the dog_food i ordered and not the other items .
neutral	after inquiring as to why that happened i was informed that they were sold out of those products .
neutral	had i known that i would not have been receiving them in the deferred delivery date order i would have asked for immediate shipment to ensure i received them .
neutral	lesson_learned but i wish it had been clear to me upon ordering .
neutral	i found the search and checkout for the hotel very easy to navigate , however when i ran_into a snag ( i accidentally booked the wrong day ) i wasn_'_t able to reach any customer_service ( because hours were set for only european times & i live in california .)
neutral	thus , i will have to call this evening to hopefully receive the refund .
neutral	we shall see ....
neutral	every time i search for a trip they email me everything they can find about my destination .
neutral	discounts on flights , hotels , cabs etc .
neutral	i really appreciate that they take their time and give me a lot of different options to choose from .
neutral	good range of local rrstaurants but app frequently freezes and crashes .
neutral	also can '_t seem to get discounts ( delivered by email ) to be applied on apps , even_though i '_m signed in using that email address .
neutral	nos dirigimos a la parada mas próxima a nuestro destino pero los empleados de su compañía nos tomaron un poco el pelo ya_que nos mandaban de un sitio para otro con lo cual perdimos media hora entre idas y venidas .
neutral	tried to purchase a steam gift_card for my son !
neutral	couldn_'_t figure_out how to print it out to put it in as a stocking stuffer !
neutral	ended_up sending it to him now , as a gift - didn_'_t want to do that !
neutral	wanted to wait and give it as a stocking stuffer !
neutral	too bad for me !
neutral	this transcription was for video , so i needed it to be more complete than it was - don_'_t need every ' um ', but do need to know exactly_what they say without dropping words or paraphrasing .
neutral	there were a lot of dropped words (' and ' at the beginning of sentences , etc .
neutral	), and also a number of typos .
neutral	i spent over an_hour reviewing and correcting things after i received the transcript .
neutral	i bought two bags of dog_food , but i was only sent one .
neutral	i called and they said they would send the other one " free of charge ."
neutral	so i did receive the other one a few_days_later , but i would have really preferred to have just gotten what i ordered in the first place .
neutral	first time i received a cartridge that the ink came pouring out when i took the orange cap off , not sure if i should even use it !!
neutral	!
neutral	i was encouraged to use site as discount was offered however discount had already been applied so not sure it was a true discount & then i had to pay a booking fee
neutral	rented from enterprise because i have a membership card , not sure what it does because it did nothing for me .
neutral	the car was fine but on the return , the cost was over $_000 from the quoted price .
neutral	there were extra add_ons and taxes not quoted .
neutral	i would rather have the whole price up front so i could decide my self for less days or other rental_car options .
neutral	when we arrived in venice to pick_up the vehicle , an opel astra wagon , we were told that that particular vehicle was not available and that we were being given a ford c0 .
neutral	while it was a comparable car , we did have concerns with regards to size as we knew that italian roads could be narrower than in canada plus we were three adults with luggage .
neutral	luckily , in that respect , our concerns were unfounded .
neutral	we were also informed at the hertz counter that the vehicle was in the car wash but that it would only be a ten minute wait .
neutral	we walked to the outside kiosk ( trailer ), with our_luggage , to wait for the vehicle .
neutral	after half an_hour we asked where the car was and were told it was on it '_s way .
neutral	after an_hour , we were again told that it was on it '_s way .
neutral	finally , after an_hour and a half and requesting that someone call a supervisor to find out where exactly the vehicle was , the clerk from the desk in the airport came out and told us that there was a mix up and the car would be out in a few_minutes , which it was .
neutral	unfortunately , an_hour and a half wait was not the way we wanted to start our vacation .
neutral	the car was rather beat up but the inside clerk went over it again with me and initialed all of the damage , including the additional damage that was not on the rental form .
neutral	we ended_up turning the car in the evening before we were supposed to as we found out that if you give a return time when you book online , you are held to it .
neutral	even if it is not a full 00 hour increment from when you picked it up .
neutral	all in all , the vehicle ran excellent , was clean and the hertz staff , other than the outside trailer staff , were very polite and knowledgeable .
neutral	i would definitely use auto_europe canada for my european vehicle rental needs again .
neutral	ordered a poster on 00 feb , told it was sent on 00 feb , now 0 march and its still not here .
neutral	i presume it will be okay if / when it arrives .
neutral	my own fault - i bought the beanbag in a rush and didn_'_t realise there were lots of faux_fur ones on the internet for around £_00 .
neutral	i looked and looked at mine trying to assess how it could_possibly cost £_00 and decided a bag full of beans that wasn_'_t leather or some other expensive material couldn_'_t warrant that price .
neutral	i '_ve no_complaints about the lime_green colour which is great in the faux_fur and the timed delivery was perfect .
neutral	no_problems there .
neutral	if you ' re happy to pay that heavy price then this company has a large style choice .
neutral	i '_ve only been setup for auto - delivery for four months .
neutral	gee , it '_s great to have my pet_supplies delivered .
neutral	but , surprise , surprise ... this month my delivery came as a partial delivery .
neutral	when i went to the website to look up what had occurred , my order total was increased by $ 0 . 00 ( no notification ) and part of my order had been ' outsourced ' to another company .
neutral	interesting !
neutral	i '_m now shopping around - in comparison the price increase makes the goods overpriced !
neutral	the downfall with amiclubwear is that they do not throughly check the orders before shipping out .
neutral	i have ordered many_times and at_least 0 - 0 times that not everything i purchased is there .
neutral	calling customer_service is impossible the wait is ridicolous .
neutral	my only way to contact them is through e_- mail in which they do respond but never apologize for the inconvenient and issues a credit back but it '_s not the point especially if i raised my concern that its happen more than once and i also have friends that also shop with ami as well and it '_s happened to them when they did not get everything they ordered .
neutral	i would suggest a quality check department before shipping out to do a check to make_sure all items are there and if item is no_longer available to at_least be courtesy to the customer .
neutral	second advice is to hire more people to assist with calls so it limits the wait because 00 minute wait with no luck of getting through is extreme .
neutral	other then that amiclub_wear does have nice affordable merchandise .
neutral	rush order_tees would only work with me on their schedule .
neutral	they would call me while i was at work and if i didn_'_t answer immediately and answer questions , they would be unreachable for the next week - at_least .
neutral	i called rushordertees four separate times so i could pay for the shirts only to be able to leave a message for my consultant ( which was never returned with a call ).
neutral	and of course not being_able to pay for the shirts held up the whole_process of getting proofs .
neutral	also .
neutral	although some aspects of the design process may be difficult to complete - continue to respect the customer throughout the entirety of the project .
neutral	even_though all of this happened , i did get my shirts a day before the event !
neutral	this site is si good . i found it to work for me .
neutral	most of the time i love amiclubwear and purchase lots of shoes .
neutral	recently i had a bad_experience with a pair of coppertone booties .
neutral	the second time i wore them both zipper pulls cracked off .
neutral	they were made of plastic !
neutral	i emailed amiclubwear , but got no response .
neutral	service was ok but had to reorder the returns packs a few_times which was inconvenient .
neutral	that said was happy with prices psid for my phones
neutral	i haven_'_t received my garment yet as when i purchased it i put a po_box number for delivery and was not told at that point it couldn_'_t be sent that way it had to be a residential address so it was held up in transport .
neutral	very good usually
neutral	lights are lovely .
neutral	thank_you :)
neutral	dollar rental_car , front_desk was friendly and well_versed on rental_car policies .
neutral	three issues , i had purchased insurance on line for the rental based on rental . com website for $_00 . 00 only to be advised by rental agent that insurance was not adequate and spend and additional_$_00 . 00 .
neutral	roadside assistance was $ 0 . 00 per day and i originally_booked a ford_taurus but wound_up with a ford_focus a smaller car but was advised that they could not change my rate .
neutral	what '_s up with that !
neutral	my $_00 rental_car came up to $_000 for 0 days with a $_000 deposit .
neutral	dollar rental_car should be called a few_hundred dollar rental care .
neutral	the wellies arrived within a reasonable time .
neutral	the quality is just about ok , but they are quite thin and i think they are somewhat overpriced for what they are .
neutral	the rubber smell is rather strong .
neutral	i could probably have bought something of a better quality for a lesser price .
neutral	maybe the higher price is justified by the addition of a buckle on the side !
neutral	it was easy to order online .
neutral	the only_thing when i ordered is that they didn_'_t tell you the item wasn_'_t in stock .
neutral	i called a couple days_later and they had to order it and then ship it .
neutral	would have been nice to know that when i ordered .
neutral	it has_been over a month since i placed my order and my order is still incomplete .
neutral	i ordered my glasses with no problem ; the website is very easy .
neutral	a few_days latter i checked back to see what the status was and it was delayed with no_explanation on the website account nor did i receive an_email so i had to call to find out what was going on ( i hate calling !).
neutral	apparently they did not get my prescription so i had to send it again .
neutral	fine , i sent it .
neutral	so it took them about 00 days to ship the glasses .
neutral	when i received the shipment i noticed one pair was missing , so i had to call again .
neutral	apparently the payment did not go through because in the time span my bank had cancelled my card due to some kind of fraud attempt from an unknown so they did not have an updated payment_method ( this was my fault ) but they never contacted me to let_me know that they had a problem with my payment , so i could '_ve just kept a free pair of glasses but i am honest and wanted my 0nd pair .
neutral	so i call them again make the payment and now i '_m getting my 0nd pair of glasses , over a month later .
neutral	the products are good , very satisfied in that respect but they seem to be very disorganized and need to improve their follow_up on orders and communication .
neutral	le coffret du produit est_un_peu abimé .
neutral	the weather was very cold spoiling the open top aspect of the trip .
neutral	obviously not the company '_s fault , but the main downside was the amount of time spent crawling through or stationary in traffic .
neutral	the ferry ride on the thames which we were all looking_forward to did not materialise , because we were too late back due to the heavy_traffic .
neutral	my advice to anyone booking your bus would be to take the ferry trip as soon as possible .
neutral	i love the clothes but the last time to much time for ship my order ...
neutral	i find go for smoke products are reasonably_priced and are of a good standard , the only_thing that disappoints me is that the delivery is very slow for first_class
neutral	i ordered 0 dresses , one for my daughter and 0 for myself .
neutral	i had planned on wearing one of them to my grandsons baptism but the zipper was too hard to get past where all the stitching is ...
neutral	so needless to say i had to go out and find another dress last_minute .
neutral	the other dresses are great , i wont let this experience stop me from buying again i will just be more cautious as to what kind of item i purchase .
neutral	people answering phone took 00_minutes to get name address etc info correct .
neutral	i had to call back twice because first two people couldn_'_t understand that the plane had a layover .
neutral	first person never gave_me right plane times and dates .
neutral	second person couldn_'_t understand me at all and third girl finally worked out ok but i had to spell ou every letter in my name address email credit_card etc .
neutral	finally got it right after 00_minutes way to long .
neutral	i ordered a starter from parts_geek and they were extreamly fast in processing and shipping out my order .
neutral	i do have an_issue with the customer_service follow - up .
neutral	the starter i ordered came with an atrached core_charge .
neutral	when opening a ticket for an_rma the online process says that my request can '_t be processed .
neutral	i have tried_calling directly several_times but can never seem to be able to talk to a person .
neutral	i was very impressed by the delivery of my purchased item because it was very time specific and allowed me to plan when to be home to receive it .
neutral	however , the only_negative was that my phone enquiry was not replied to and therefore i was not as impressed with service in general as i could have been .
neutral	i may not recommend this site in future .
neutral	i bought 0 clip - on lights for your dog '_s collar .
neutral	i was sent one that did not work .
neutral	:/
neutral	clothes is ok , webshop is nice
neutral	while you do have the best price on the dog_food i buy , your shipping has a bit to be desired .
neutral	i '_ve ordered 0 times now and the shipping has not improved , my last order was placed on a monday_morning and i received it one week and one day later on tuesday .
neutral	so advertising free 0 - 0 day shipping is very deceiving .
neutral	shoes are too small about 0 / 0 size too small 0 fits like 0 0 / 0 .
neutral	dress was a little too big .
neutral	by the time i pay to return them .
neutral	i '_ll only get a few_bucks back .
neutral	another order which was purchased prior to this one , i have not received yet .
neutral	if i had known the order would not be shipped out until 0 + days_later , not sure if
neutral	i would have ordered .
neutral	placing the order was great and i was assured it would go
neutral	priority_mail , however i placed the order on 0 / 00 and it did not ship until 0 / 00 .
neutral	my
neutral	son was down to his last pair of contact ( yes we should have ordered sooner ) he
neutral	has now been without for the past 0 days .
neutral	and unfortunately with holiday_weekend
neutral	i am hoping at_least he will get them by tues .
neutral	if they had been shipped even the
neutral	next_day he would have had them .
neutral	i guess asking for a ship date in the future
neutral	would be a good idea .
neutral	thanks
neutral	i placed a one time order with hopes of making your company my regular supplier however , my test order was very disappointing .
neutral	although i had been charged for the complete order there were 0 cases of dog_food missing .
neutral	i called to report this .
neutral	your representative was very courteous and explained i should have received a email_stating a stop order on the product and i had choice of refund or more product .
neutral	i chose replacement product with assurance i would not be charged again .
neutral	although i was concerned that this error would not have been caught on your end , i was impressed with the professionalism of your representative .
neutral	my further and final disappointment came when the replacement cases arrived .
neutral	they had been improperly packed and 0 of the cans had brust open .
neutral	i do believe you are a very good company to do busy with and my experience is not typical however i will not be placing further orders at this time .
neutral	i ordered some tennis_rackets and balls for my tennis club .
neutral	i had to pay by cheque .
neutral	i ordered it online .
neutral	unfortunately the racquets weren_'_t in stock , but they provided some other racquets of a better quality for me but for no extra_cost , which was great !
neutral	unfortunately i had to phone them to find out where my order was , only to find out the order wasn_'_t even at the warehouse .
neutral	the person on the phone was most apologetic however and the order came in the next 0 days .
neutral	i ordered 0 identcal buggysnggles for my twins pushchair but they were 0 different greens , one is light green and the other karki .
neutral	i didn_'_t have time to complain and get matching because we needed to use them on our easter trip .
neutral	they did deliver quickly though .
neutral	bus_stop fairly easy to find , all other passengers walked on no problem , but we were stopped my printout snatched from my hand by dave .
neutral	glad to get off that bus !
neutral	jumped off at the stop to pick_up the tour with the real - life tour_guide but although me was only 0 seats in front couldn_'_t hear a he was saying .
neutral	decided to get off that one and picked_up the river_cruise , which was quite nice .
neutral	thought it a good idea to try the " earplug " tour , waited at embankment pier , 0 buses drove straight past , even_though i was holding out my hand .
neutral	this tour was better , rousing music a little too much , and not enough trivia .
neutral	luckily it was a nice day so 0_stars .
neutral	shipping_costs are high for how long it takes for your items to get here .
neutral	original order was for a 00cm towel_rail , which arrived on time but the plumber decided that a 00 cm size would be a better fit .
neutral	rang and arranged a pick_up and replacement delivery , pick_up successful , so_far so good , when replacement did not arrive i asked why and was informed young_lady had arranged pick_up but forgotten to order replacement , this caused me some embarrassment as difficult to arrange fitting with plumber .
neutral	arranged certain delivery for next_day - did not arrive - carrier went to wrong_address , finally arrived following_day .
neutral	towel_rail is very good looking and appears to be good value for money .
neutral	very poor customer_service , it '_s almost_impossible to get_ahold of anyone .
neutral	i have emailed with no response and tried_calling multiple_times ... expect to wait on hold for a long time ... i '_m currently # 00 in line to speak with a rep . that '_s ridiculous .
neutral	i order from this site alot because of price / discounts .
neutral	not too fond of the new site yet , harder to find things your looking for .
neutral	it was very easy to place my order , however i am aware that prices are not as competitive as they used to be as my neighbour , who uses a local supplier , received the same quote ( from total butler ).
neutral	delivery was due in up to 00 days and i surprised when it arrived two_days after_placing my order .
neutral	unfortunately the delivery driver damaged a number of plants whilst moving the hose through the garden to my tank - i was not home at the time so could not stop him doing so .
neutral	i will_definitely be looking at prices more carefully next year and trying to place my order earlier in the summer .
neutral	forever 00 used to be a top , in trend store .
neutral	however , their quality has went from high to low .
neutral	whenever i buy clothing there , most of the shirts or sweaters i find have defects .
neutral	not only that , their sizes are totally off and leave a lot of lint hanging_around .
neutral	i wish they would put more effort into making higher quality clothes .
neutral	for a sweater that would have cost around ten_dollars worth , they price it up to thirty or forty .
neutral	i have written an e_- mail to your info @... without receiveing any answer .
neutral	maybe the delivery was too long due to bad condition of weather .
neutral	in any case , i will send you again my orders as the price are very competitives !
neutral	thanks !
neutral	regards ,
neutral	i was recently stuck in d . c . for 00_hours due to poor weather .
neutral	i believe it was the airline who contacted me to let_me know my flight was canceled , not travelocity .
neutral	i did hear from travelocity later , about my rescheduled flight for the next_morning , but it was not the same flight information given to me by the airline !
neutral	i was quite unsure what to do , as the flights were 00_hours apart .
neutral	i went with the info given to me by the airline .
neutral	another thing that upset me , i had to reserve my hotel for an_additional two_nights , and found out if i had made the reservation through the hotel , using their special , i would have saved over $_000_per_night .
neutral	i will_continue to use travelocity , but may do more research before making_reservations .
neutral	the apartment was good , but it '_s on the 0th_floor and there '_s no lift in the building .
neutral	being_able to book a hostel in advance of arriving in town is a great thing ( something which didn ´ t exist when i first started travelling 00 years_ago ).
neutral	the service charge means that hw doesn ´ t compete well with hostelbookers and they might want to revisit this , also the 00_% cut they take from hostels .
neutral	rumours abound that hw removes negative_reviews from sites and i think this is a serious risk to hw ´_s reputation and they must ensure that this never happens .
neutral	i find it interesting that even if you mark a hostel with the lowest possible rating they still get something like 00_% - how can this be ?
neutral	if its that bad it should get a zero rating .
neutral	i would also like the opportunity to add a review when i wasn ´ t the person doing the booking ( e . g .
neutral	when sharing a room with a friend who has made the booking - we should both have the chance to add a review ).
neutral	my e_- mail address has alot of m '_s and n '_s in it .
neutral	( msmsnic @ _____ . ___ ) your rep . jessy asked me for it .
neutral	so when i gave it to her i said something like ," m as in master , s as in sam , m as in master ", and that is the 0st time she stopped me and said ," yes , i got that ."
neutral	i believe she was assuming i was just repeating what i had said .
neutral	i told her i wasn_'_t finished and continued in much the same pattern .
neutral	i asked her repeat it and she did , but got it wrong .
neutral	i repeated it and she got it wrong again .
neutral	she got it correct the 0rd time i pronounced it for her .
neutral	i also stressed that i needed to be sure that the rooms i was renting had a balcony or a terrace .
neutral	one of the guests has ms and will only be able to stay by the pool and sit on the balcony as finding a way to the beach on the sand is not an option .
neutral	wheel chairs don_'_t move well on the sand .
neutral	jessy informed me that she had already given me that answer twice .
neutral	hopefully her answer is correct and i am renting rooms two rooms for two_nights , both with terrace or balcony .
neutral	she was curt , short and rude thru nearly all of the transaction .
neutral	when we were close to the end of our business she asked if she could do anything_else for me .
neutral	i told her yes and asked for her name .
neutral	she said ," yes , jessy .
neutral	that is j like jessy , e like elephant , s like sam , s like sam , y like yellow ."
neutral	really ?
neutral	smart aleck .
neutral	i only exponded on my e_- mail address because , # 0 - i have had experience in the past with my e_- mail address being misunderstood .
neutral	# 0 - i was on a cell_phone and was concerned she might not have as good reception as if i were on my home phone .
neutral	so , i could have made my own reservations myself online .
neutral	i only called to confirm that the rooms i was looking at online were rooms with balconies .
neutral	she is the one that suggested i book thru her since i was already talking to her and she had the hotel already pulled_up on her computer and it might save me a few_minutes .
neutral	she save me no time at all by bantering back and forth with me .
neutral	it is a training issue .
neutral	and perhaps she should take the course in ' customer care ' over .
neutral	she might have been on her cell_phone when she was suppose to be taking that course .
neutral	reguards ,
neutral	mrs . cox
neutral	ordered a 0ft fibre_optic xmas_tree and paid £_00 . 00 for it and extra for next_day delivery , sat in all day waiting for it then at 0pm it finally turned_up in what looked like a used old brown box .
neutral	unpacked it to check it worked and you could see the box was not for the tree because it was to big , on inspecting the base of the tree i noticed the plastic was all scratched , so obviously had been used before , and the on / off switch was completley broke .
neutral	phoned them up straight_away to report all this and they are sending me a replacement , which is fine ( as long as it works ) but no refund on my delivery charge £ 0 . 00 , no partial_refund for the inconvenience , dosn '_t give me alot of faith to order from them again or to recommend them .
neutral	travelocity said to contact the motel directly if i needed to make_changes .
neutral	i did .
neutral	i called the motel and they said , oh , no , you have to do that through_travelocity .
neutral	travelocity '_s site was down everytime i tried to reach them .
neutral	there was no phone_number for them in the email they sent .
neutral	when i finally_reached them the next_day , they said they ' d be happy to cancel my reservation , but i would have had to do that by 0 p . m . the previous day .
neutral	i was testy .
neutral	the person i talked to was persuaded to call the motel and get them to agree to reverse the charge .
neutral	it took about a half an_hour when i was trying to get on the road , so it seemed forever .
neutral	i don_'_t know if i ' d use them again .
neutral	i ordered a shower_head and the order processed ok . then i got an_email_stating that the part actually wasn_'_t in stock and they would refund my credit_card .
neutral	he said that they were sorry and would adjust the website .
neutral	little upset about quality of boots .
neutral	came in scuffed .
neutral	didn_'_t return cause i needed them for the day after
neutral	the prices are good when they have a sale , but shipping is hit - or - miss .
neutral	i ordered a package 0_weeks_ago , my email said it was ready to be shipped out 0 days_later , but according to the usps tracking_number , it just left the warehouse yesterday .
neutral	another item i ordered last_week is due to be delivered today .
neutral	you just don_'_t know with their shipping , when an item will actually arrive .
neutral	i also received a survey today to rate the dog_food that i had ordered 0_weeks_ago .
neutral	the dog_food that just left the warehouse .
neutral	i can '_t review what i don_'_t have .
neutral	i am not sure if i will order from this company again .
neutral	purchasing was first rate but return process was awful plus the last message i received
neutral	said it takes 00 days for refund
neutral	hi you ask about my experience at the present moment i haven_'_t even heard if my treadmill came into stock yesterday 00 / 00 / 00 as it was meant to .
neutral	we found the service of glasgow stress_free parking - meet and greet very good - no waiting around - prompt polite service .
neutral	the big down_side is where they take the car to .
neutral	when the car was returned to us the whole of the passenger_side was badly splashed with mud and the windscreen and rear window very dirty and sticky which took some time to clean before we set off home late at night .
neutral	not something you really want to do after traveling all day and having to travel another hour in the car to get home .
neutral	another little annoyance was that we could not find the courtesy telephone in the airport baggage area .
neutral	the instructions of where the phone actually is in the baggage area needs to be given .
neutral	luckily our mobile was working and we could ring to confirm our arrival .
neutral	the most_important items do work ... a headlamp & 0 lantern / flashlites ... but the
neutral	0 little flashlights included with the headlamp do not work ... have rearranged all
neutral	possible battery configurations , and it '_s not the battieries .
neutral	disappointing ... but
neutral	they were on clearance & are made in china ... so , there you are
neutral	the lights received were not as expected .
neutral	more_importantly , when i placed the order i am sure the postage was nowhere_near the £_00 . 00 i was charged - this was more than the cost of one of the boxes of lights - £_00 . 00 .
neutral	i would never have confirmed my order at this postage charge .
neutral	i think it may have been increased due to my staying on one of the scottish islands .
neutral	i did send an_email querying the postage charged but no response !
neutral	not at all happy !
neutral	i
neutral	i received my order and on opening the box noticed that the packaging was badly_damaged .
neutral	the item itself was fine but the cardboard and plastic that surrounds it was torn .
neutral	i emailed cyclestore to advise them of this and said that as it was really close to christmas i wouldn_'_t be sending it back but i wasn_'_t happy as it was a gift .
neutral	i did receive a reply back saying sorry and they had checked with the packers and they say that the item was fine when they dispatched it to me .
neutral	i didn_'_t think this was a satisfactory answer so i emailed back and have heard_nothing since .
neutral	bought light up collars and blinking bones to hang on the collars for my black_labs .
neutral	we live in the country and i worry_about them when they go out at night .... the price was great and shipping was fast .
neutral	however , one of the collars was broken , and there didnt seem to be any return directions in the package .
neutral	i didnt see a packing_slip either .
neutral	so ....
neutral	i guess i am out the $ 0 for the broken collar .
neutral	not a ton of money , but i was dissapointed .
neutral	i will never buy from here again /
neutral	taking a hop on / hop_off bus in a new city is a great way to see the sites for a less_expensive way than relying_on taxis .
neutral	prior to arriving in london , we were in paris so we got to experience uses tour buses in both cities .
neutral	paris was by_far better .
neutral	it was less_expensive , went on more routes , had recorded narrations in multiple languages , went late into the evening , etc .
neutral	you could purchase your pass on the bus quickly with no problem .
neutral	in london , you had to wait in a crowd of people to get the one person printing out tickets outside of the bus .
neutral	the bus was more_expensive , had basically two routes ( one short , one long ), and ended early ( around 0 :_00pm ).
neutral	it literally dropped us off in the middle of a route because it hit 0 :_00pm and we had to catch a taxi back to our hotel , so pay_attention to the times because you don_'_t get a full day like in paris .
neutral	the drivers also barely left enough time at each stop for people to get off the bus .
neutral	many_times , passengers couldn_'_t get down from the top of the bus quick enough to depart and had to hold on as the bus took off while they were on the stairs .
neutral	i '_m not sure what the other tour bus in london offered , but i would check to see if they offered longer operating times and what their cost was .
neutral	i placed my order on june 0 but when i didn_'_t receive it within a week i became worried .
neutral	after checking the website , my order was listed as " processing_".
neutral	i attempted to contact them through their live_chat_feature but that was not working .
neutral	even after leaving a message through chat , i didn_'_t hear back .
neutral	when i called customer_service , i was put on hold several_times and finally told that the order would be shipped out the next_day .
neutral	it was a full two_weeks before i received the order ... and i needed it for a major art show that weekend .
neutral	with two_days left before the show , the boxes ordered were the wrong_size .
neutral	they authorized a return but i would have to pay for shipping ... not sure it '_s worth it .
neutral	they did , however , " rush " a new order to me with the appropriate sized boxes after i wrote to say that i was very disappointed in their service .
neutral	i '_ve ordered from fetpak before with no_problems ; not sure why this order was so messy .
neutral	wish i would have been compensated for the delay or at_least given the opportunity to return the wrong sized boxes without_having to bear the cost of return shipping .
neutral	i had a terrifying experience at anker apartments in oslo and received a full_refund from them .
neutral	that in my mind is a fair indication of admission of fault .
neutral	but hostels . com has not posted my review and it leaves single women booked into a single room at risk .
neutral	( two men came into my room at 0 :_00am , in hostel uniform , and refused to leave for some minutes .
neutral	this was repeated two_nights later ).
neutral	the manager , noomi f . , showed no surprise and absolutely no concern for me .
neutral	at check out one of the men came up to me and laughed at me .
neutral	it was the cheapest price found for this particular hotel , however the additional £_00 charge for the booking was unexpected and was easy to miss until checkout .
neutral	the cost then proved not competive at all !
neutral	the website helps you to find economic and good hostels all over .
neutral	i have never been disappointed with the hostels i stay in , and i rely only in the hostelworld reviews .
neutral	they have great products and great prices .
neutral	be prepared to wait if you are on the west_coast .
neutral	it takes a week .
neutral	five for products .
neutral	one for website accuracy about shipping times
neutral	women '_s xl actually fit like a medium .
neutral	and it shrunk -- even when washed in cold_water and dried on line .
neutral	daughter very disappointed she could not wear shirt and i could not afford to replace it .
neutral	i have a better_than average credit_score and was concerned when i examined the reports .
neutral	i found the report from equifax erroneous and faulty and quite outdated .
neutral	i would have hoped for a more accurate and up to date report .
neutral	as a client of identity_guard , i would like to see identity_guard require its reporting agencies be current / accurate before revealing a " current " status of accounts .
neutral	i ordered 00 items and only 0 items shipped .
neutral	of the 0 items that shipped , only 0 were correct .
neutral	i contacted customer_support and they gave_me return labels , and will credit my account when i return the items .
neutral	i don_'_t have an_issue with how my experience was handled .
neutral	i have an_issue with the fact that only 0 items were shipped that i had ordered .
neutral	there is a sticker on the box that lists each item and the quantity you ordered , and the quantity you are supposedly receiving .
neutral	shouldn_'_t there be some kind of re - check before the box is sealed and delivered ?
neutral	i will not purchase from them again .
neutral	i like the prices and the quality of the product but it took almost two_weeks to get the delivery .
neutral	i live in new_jersey and used to receive ink from epson in three_days .
neutral	i now have a kodak printer and thought i ' d try the ink_farm .
neutral	the old m & s quality is definitely not the same as the old days , come on bring back good value for money markies !
neutral	i shop at bakker for longer_than you have listed , it seems ( since 0000 / 0000 ).
neutral	it seems to me the quality of your products was better_than it is now .
neutral	during all those years i only called your customer_services twice .
neutral	the first time i got a satisfactory answer , very politely given .
neutral	the second time , when i just wanted to know if the italian language was included in the list of how to proceed with bulbs , i got a young_lady_who informed me that she did not speak italian and was there anything_else ?
neutral	up till now , i am still satisfied enough to keep on ordering from bakker , but i am getting more and more irritated by the abundance of mailings , either over the internet of by regular mail - it is getting much too much !
neutral	stress_free parking was cheap so i can '_t complain there but my car did come_back absolutely filthy - i guess it '_s parked in a field somewhere but mud was splashed all up the side , makes you wonder_how it '_s driven there ....
neutral	very prompt service but the brushes seem to be too big and heavy .
neutral	my braun_toothbrush sounds very laboured and does not have the speed it has with original braun toothbrushes .
neutral	not happy with the delivery ... was suppose to get my parcel wednesday but got email_saying delayed ....
neutral	so i change date for friday , i waited all day and never turn up .
neutral	phone ukmail and told me will get it saturday by 0 . 00pm , waited again and never turn up ...
neutral	arrived monday ... not happy with the delivery ....
neutral	but yr supplements are excellent ...
neutral	if delivery was excellent i would give u 0_star .
neutral	i used a p . o .
neutral	box for my shipping address and petflow used fedex_ground which ended_up causing fedex to call us at 0 am , waking us up to get our street address to deliver the package .
neutral	it would have been nice if petflow had noticed that a p . o .
neutral	box was used and contacted us to say a street adress was required .
neutral	the spoiled_rotten_box was really nice though so we will give them another chance and i have changed my address on the petflow site to a street address .
neutral	i really like the car , but after we have signed the paperwork , the headlights do not work .
neutral	the brakes are screeching , the front end is making noises , and the heater does not work .
neutral	i went back to the dealership today 0 / 00 / 0000 and the car was purchased 0 / 00 / 0000 and they told us there was nothing that can be done .
neutral	we also called the customer_service and they told us they could not locate the vehicle in the system .
neutral	so who should help us !!!
neutral	this is crazy !
neutral	i tried one site where i had made two wowcher purchases .
neutral	when i was trying to order it was too fiddly site and it took me ages to get the right thing .
neutral	also i had to order two_separate times which is a bit of a nuisance .
neutral	but other than this every other one has_been good
neutral	good clothes order a few time but this last order i '_m still_waiting for the remaining of my order .
neutral	no email on how much longer .
neutral	i also return some items , no email response on the return order was received and credit back the amount .
neutral	i was charges for the full_amount of my order , instead of a charging what was send out .
neutral	the contact number working hours are to short for mon - fri 0 - 0 : 00 working women .
neutral	please send the remaining of my order soon .
neutral	easy to book , nice places ..
neutral	i would only recommend it to people who want to get familiar with the location and city on their first day only .
neutral	but not as a bus_tour at all !!
neutral	it takes_forever to get from one main attraction to another due to the many little stops it does .
neutral	they advertise discount parking , but in fact there is no discount and they charge you a service charge for using their site and you ' re not aware of the service charge until the transaction is completed and your deposit has_been charged .
neutral	firstly , i love these skins !
neutral	i have one on my kindle and one for my laptop .
neutral	the kindle skin (" umbrella girl ") has_been on for about six_months now and there is not a mark on it - its like new .
neutral	so when i had a new laptop , diabloskinz was my first point of call .
neutral	with the laptop skin though , i cannot say my experience was as perfect as with my kindle .
neutral	the range of sizes for laptop skins is not that comprehensive and there is no custom size option like you can use on gelaskins .
neutral	it meant that the skin (" poppy ") i ordered doesn_'_t fit my laptop completely - its not long enough though the width was just right .
neutral	i suppose if you , unlike me , were confident enough , it would be easy to order a larger one and trim it down .
neutral	when the skin arrived , i was so happy with it .
neutral	it was easy to fit , no bubble issues and it is a high_quality print .
neutral	i was so happy with it that i uploaded a picture of it on my laptop to facebook to get a 00_%_off voucher for my next order .
neutral	if i had written this then , this review would be 000_% positive .
neutral	my issue is that because of a badly worded generic dispatch email , i was led to believe i would have matching_wallpaper with the skin and i was looking_forward to using it .
neutral	after unsuccessfully trying to download it , i contacted the company and learnt that they actually don_’ t offer the wallpapers for laptops .
neutral	it would mean releasing the full image of the skin which would be a no - no .
neutral	their reasoning is sound but i dislike the way they handled my query .
neutral	their responses to my query were offhand and there was no apology for any confusion their original email might have caused with them just blaming the generic nature of the email .
neutral	however , it was their email not some third_party ’_s !
neutral	if that email had not mentioned the matching_wallpaper or mentioned it but stated that laptops were not included then this whole issue would never occurred .
neutral	but it did and if they support_team had been more understanding and actually apologized ; i would not be so annoyed .
neutral	they did offer to contact the artist to see if an exception could be made but given that we are talking_about a picture , it didn ’ t seem worth the hassle .
neutral	i would hate to see how this company would handle a genuine complaint and not just a passing enquiry .
neutral	as a final insult to me , they acknowledged that i posted the picture on facebook but didn ’ t mention the 00_%_off voucher .
neutral	they can keep it as far as i am concerned and i ’ ll delete my photo !
neutral	my experience of skyscanner is that although the website works extremely well the prices quoted by the companies are never correct when you go to actually make a booking .
neutral	they are always higher .
neutral	this really annoys me and it is not the case with other_websites .
neutral	i want an accurate quote .
neutral	i therefore have stopped using skyscanner .
neutral	the under armour top is far too small and does not relate well to the measurements to which it is meant to fit - very disappointing as not cheap
neutral	the site gets stuck .
neutral	rejects common names .
neutral	i had to try several_times to place my order and ended_up breaking it up into multiple orders to get it done .
neutral	great hostel .
neutral	enjoyed our stay
neutral	site was easy to navagate , but unsure ho to print conformations and when i will get nmy bonus gifts like the $_000 gc for restaurants . com
neutral	the product that i received was not what i expected that i had ordered .
neutral	i wanted a laundry basket on wheels for a friend who is battling with breast_cancer who wanted such an item so that she did not have to carry her laundry .
neutral	i mistakenly ordered a basket liner instead of a basket with rollers .
neutral	after receiving it , i didn_'_t really know if there was more to come or not , since i was expected a basket - not a basket liner .
neutral	there was no paperwork or return_slip in the box , so after a few_days when i assured myself that had ordered the wrong thing and needed to return it , i wasn_'_t sure how to return it , so i sent back to the website and saw that returns had to be made within 0 days of receiving the item , and at that point , i had already had it past 0 days and now i '_ve been trying to figure_out what to do with it now .
neutral	it is still in the box unused and i don_'_t know if i should throw it away or be creative on how else to use it .
neutral	so .......
neutral	i have nothing for you as for a product opinion or a legitimate review .
neutral	i was not happy upon_arrival at the hotel .
neutral	i was assured that the price was less_than what i would have paid directly to the hotel .
neutral	not so .
neutral	i was also assured that we would have a cot .
neutral	no so !
neutral	this hotel said they '_ve never had cots or roll always .
neutral	turned_out i had to add another room and the price was $_00 . 00 less that the room i prepaid for through the reservation center .
neutral	it ended_up costing be much more because i was misled about the cot .
neutral	be cautious about making a reservation this way .
neutral	i will never trust them again .
neutral	i give three stars because that '_s about what the hotel was worth .
neutral	too small a portion , barely fit in the nesspresso machine , kept sliding out .
neutral	the site in itself is questionable because of the layout and major discount prices .
neutral	i looked on the michaelkors website and could not see the watch i purchased .
neutral	maybe it is an old version or a replica ?
neutral	either way , it came promptly and looks great .
neutral	the only_thing i am dissatisfied with is the cover of the face of the watch .
neutral	you would think it would be a thick glass of some_sort but it is a plastic type with a thin film on it ( not the sticky sheet you peel_off ) and it scuffed really easy .
neutral	i am delicate and just got this but it already has chip marks i hope i can get buffed out .
neutral	not sold it is 000_% real but i guess that is what i get for paying $_000 less_than what these watches go for .
neutral	i purchased my tickets online and went to the nearest stop only to find out that i had to have a printout of my ticket -- even_though my phone showed the barcodes for my companion and myself .
neutral	this meant trekking around trying to find a place with a computer and printer and then spending an_additional £ 0 to print the tickets .
neutral	once we finally got on the tour we found we had to wait a couple stops to get seats but once we did the tour was okay .
neutral	we didn_'_t realize one bus line had a live tour_guide and the other bus line had a recorded_tour .
neutral	unfortunately , we got on the latter , which was not extremely entertaining or informative .
neutral	i suspect it is really geared towards non_- english speakers because there were several different stations , with different_languages and the information was pretty basic .
neutral	what i did like was that a boat_tour was included in the fair and that did contain a live tour_guide , who was quite informative and entertaining .
neutral	we ended the tour back on the bus around 0 :_00pm .
neutral	the driver didn_'_t inform us the tour would be ending until 0 stop before it was over , which left us stranded far away from where we were planning to get off .
neutral	i don_'_t recall seeing anything about when the tour ended on the brochure .
neutral	it would '_ve been nice to have known beforehand .
neutral	pros_: boat_tour , live_guide on bus ( presumably ), covers a large area
neutral	cons_: cost , pre_- recorded bus_tour , lack of information
neutral	jeg_har_købt ind 0 gange .
neutral	de første 0 var alt perfekt .
neutral	0 . gang var_der visse fejl .
neutral	0 brød fra lagkagehuset var i våde poser og var fugtige , rødspættefilletternes holdbarhedsdato var med udløb allerede næste_dag .
neutral	og en mail om faktureringsfejl er her 00 timer efter stadig ikke besvaret .
neutral	jeg_bestilte 0 ting .
neutral	en af dem var_en trøje som var angivet som " mørkeblå ".
neutral	i virkeligheden var_den mørketurkis , hvad_der rent faktisk også stod på_den på engelsk .
neutral	det_var noget irriterende , da_jeg så_var nødt til at tage i magasin for at få mine_penge tilbage .
neutral	it happened few_times now when i was in the middle of conversations the line got cut_off it '_s very annoying .... hope it get better soon
neutral	prompt delivery , ecig as_described , only problem was it didn_'_t come with any instructions !
neutral	the table_tennis table is great excellant value for money and very sturdy .
neutral	its a great size and folds away very easily .
neutral	the folded dimensions are a real plus , as we didn , t want to have something that took up to much space .
neutral	very easy to set_up .
neutral	we haven , t stopped playing with it .
neutral	i bought it for my 00 and 00 year_old sons but anyone that comes round can , t_resist a game .
neutral	only_negative is the packaging was very badly_damaged on delivery and all the table_tennis_balls squashed .
neutral	if you dont read the terms carefully you can expect to pay quite a bit more than you expect when you get your confirmation , they may seem to be the cheapest but not with all the add_ons you need to manually take out before paying .
neutral	i was happy to be able to order blue_buffalo dog_food online .
neutral	the package came promptly , but due to inadequate packing , some of the cans were dented .
neutral	i will probably order again to see if this is a regular occurance .
neutral	the food is good but delivery service takes about an_hour , and i think they should take anywhere from 00 to 00_min .
neutral	and they don_'_t have a lot of variety .
neutral	my book came within a decent_amount of time .
neutral	it was in great quality and it was much_cheaper_than the price at my bookstore .
neutral	exellent service quik delivery woud r ecomend to my friends
neutral	ordered a very pretty silver twig tree , finally plumped for the 00cm one , when assembled it looked exactly as the photograph but very short !!!
neutral	measured in at 00cm ,
neutral	i wonder_if the wrong_size was sent in error , although i was invioced for an 00cm tree , sadly it is being returned as its not big enough , hoping it will be replaced before this christmas .
neutral	i followed the instructions and texted my ticket number and recieved a response that my car was already picked_up .
neutral	after some_confusion the shuttle took me to the lot where my car was ready and waiting .
neutral	although i prepaid through groupon i was asked to pay again .
neutral	after that was cleared_up i was on my way .
neutral	many other facilities offer a bottle of water which would have been a nice service .
neutral	i can find brands here that aren_'_t carried by the larger pet product distributors and customer_service is terrific , however the search and filter functions on the website need a major overhaul and the number of marketing and deal emails is overwhelming .
neutral	ive used tesco to deliver groceries for 0 months now .
neutral	pros_:
neutral	easy
neutral	save petrol
neutral	dont get swayed to buy stuff
neutral	cons_:
neutral	despite what they say , poor sell by dates .
neutral	erratic delivery timeslots
neutral	occasionally things missing / replaced
neutral	delivery charge
neutral	overall i wont carry on after my free delivery period comes to a close .
neutral	received call at 0pm on day tyres were supposed to be fitted and was told we would have to wait another 0 days for reappointment .
neutral	informed them someone was waiting in all day tuesday and was not prepared to wait_until thursday and wait in again all day !
neutral	they called me back by 0 that evening saying they will do it wed morning which they did .
neutral	overall probably go local in future as would have got it sorted on the monday .
neutral	dissapointet that my most wanted clothes don_'_t where in the package !
neutral	but other than that , i '_m happy about boozt !
neutral	great prices on items but considering you pay a premium for next_day delivery it took 0 days to arrive ..... hardly next_day .
neutral	you also put the wrong number on the box so i had to apologise to the neighbour 00 doors down for it being delivered to them .
neutral	not a good impression !!!
neutral	!
neutral	sorry but i can ` t wear it .
neutral	i tried washing it in conditioner but as soon as i put it on , i `_m uncomfortable .
neutral	i `_m thinking maybe i can stitch a lining into it somehow ?
neutral	delivery was great .
neutral	no_problems there .
neutral	sizing was exact too
neutral	i was disappointed with strips rather_than slices of smoked_salmon , but the flavour was good .
neutral	the ribeye was tasty but thin .
neutral	hi i love ebay you can get some good stuff on there however i find they are getting very expensive with there fees .
neutral	i received my purchase last_week but the tigi bed head styleshots extreme straight tween duo ( 0 products ) were not protected enough for the shipment as both bottles were leaking a lot on the top of that .
neutral	i felt so disappointed because i lost some tigi bed head shampoo and conditioner .
neutral	i like the products at ami_clubwear and it '_s affordable !
neutral	the problem is , when you order at ami it takes awhile for the order to deliver and they don_'_t give out a tracking_number of when my orders to arrive .
neutral	plus a lot of the websites can use the coupon and free_shipping .
neutral	it would be great , if i can use both of them the coupon and free_shipping !
neutral	if i can use both of this i '_m sure all of my friends that order in ami will love this specially me , bec .
neutral	i order a lot and there will be a lot of customers that would love this !
neutral	i '_ll take a chance because they had the courtesy to respond to a recent concern from a customer .
neutral	hopefully what happened to him doesn_'_t happen often ...
neutral	i '_ll see how it turns_out .
neutral	here '_s to luck !
neutral	!
neutral	when i 0st started ordering the flower , i found that my address showed my country of residence as uk , not us .
neutral	when i could not fix this error , i closed your website to cancel everything out .
neutral	then i went back to your site & did the 0nd try & all the info for myself & the recipient was correctly entered .
neutral	however , the 0st order was not cancelled & two arrangements were delivered .
neutral	one was all i want to go to the recipient .
neutral	can this be correct & can my account be credited for 0 arrangement since your website did not cancel the order when i went off your website before the order was finished ???
neutral	?
neutral	i have ordered from the raw_food world several_times and i love the products that you sell on your site but i am less_than impressed with the shipping aspect .
neutral	my latest order was shipped minus one item that was supposedly on back order yet didn_'_t say it on the site when i ordered .
neutral	now my item is being shipped_separately but i have no_idea when , and that was the item i was most eager to get .
neutral	it also would make it easier if the tracking_number you provide on the site was a link so that i don_' y have to copy and paste and open another tab .
neutral	the last two deliveries were not on time .
neutral	one was due to an order mixup at petflow .
neutral	the second time fedex did not deliver it on saturday , claiming that the business address was closed , which it was not .
neutral	when i called them on monday they said the could not deliver until tuesday because of the shipping agreement !
neutral	this would be a great service if it came sooner .
neutral	i did not think that it would take as long as it did .
neutral	my mistake , i have had to go to the pet_store twice !
neutral	ww order a shower_panel , it came fast .
neutral	very happy with delivery , however the hand_held shower is leaking already and i don_'_t allow anyone to use the handheld so it was no broken by someone .
neutral	it just flat out leaks .
neutral	it was a decent_amount of money and i don_'_t want to go through the hassle of taking it down and sending it back .
neutral	not even sure how to send back because there is no phone_number to contact you .
neutral	i ordered prescription pet_food along with moist and hard cat_food .
neutral	i received an_email the next_day stating the prescription food was on back order and should be in shortly .
neutral	the next_day i received an_email that my order had shipped .
neutral	i received the order of moist and hard cat_food , but no prescription food .
neutral	i waited a few_days thinking it would ship separately .
neutral	i never got a shipment .
neutral	my husband called petflow to find out where the prescription food was , they stated it is not available to them anymore .
neutral	i stopped using this site a year prior because they never sent the prescription food and hoped their service was better at this time .
neutral	obviously they have not improved their website .
neutral	the customer_service rep stated they did not know why it was still on the website to purchase since they are not able to obtain it .
neutral	i am very disappointed with the site and am not sure if i will ever use them again .
neutral	very frustrated with the fact that i can go to petsmart and purchase the food , but the petflow can not provide it .
neutral	not happy with the experience at all .
neutral	got the wrong box had to load it out of the truck and up the stair then back down stair and on the truck and drive back an_hour to get the new box yet no discount for my time and gas for there mistakes
neutral	we wanted same day flowers on a saturday for our grandma but could only arrange delivery on the website for the following_monday .
neutral	we tried to phone an order but spoke with someone_who said he phone system was unavailable and we would need to use the internet monday delivery and so we opted for that .
neutral	the flowers then did not arrive until the tuesday and so the ' same day flowers ' came 0 days_later ...!
neutral	ordering was easy and delivery was fast .
neutral	we ordered the 0 darkest roasts since we like to make lattes and want the flavor to cut through the milk .
neutral	but the coffee is really watery - tasting !
neutral	maybe it ’_s the packaging ( plastic capsules instead of metal & harder for the machine to punch through ), or maybe it ’_s just the coffee itself .
neutral	but we won ’ t be ordering here again ..... not worth the money savings for us !
neutral	the service was excellent .
neutral	the appliance arrived when they said it would and it was fitted correctly and efficiently .
neutral	however , i felt_pressured to take the insurance cover .
neutral	in fact i didn_'_t realise that i had until it came through a few_days_later .
neutral	i was persuaded to use direct_debit for the insurance payments as this would mean that i would never have to buy a new_washing_machine as they would replace it if it went wrong or wore out .
neutral	i order a dress last_week so i could have it the following saturday well now its thursday and it says the dress still wont be here till saturday i ordered over a week_ago ... it shouldn_'_t take that long i hope it gets here by saturday or im not gonna have my birthday dress :((( not happy at all if i dont get my dress on saturday i will never order from here again !!
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered two single faux_leather white beds and on your website the picture shows chrome feet .
neutral	when the beds arrived they were black !
neutral	the reason_why these beds took my fancy was because i was looking for the beds to match with some of my existing furniture .
neutral	two_weeks have passed by and i am still_waiting for them to be replaced !!
neutral	when i ordered the beds the follow_up calls were ok but since an_error in them delivery the wrong ones the service is " lousy ".
neutral	customers should ' nt have to keep phoneing .
neutral	it '_s a really easy to use site ... downside once they added the taxes , on this occasion it would have been cheaper to book direct with the hotel !
neutral	the young_man was nice but he keep repeating himself over & over
neutral	i basically like the wowcher site and its daily offers , though i have occaasionally found that they have suddenly expired , leaving me out of pocket .
neutral	i have recently been communicating directly with managers of the site and they have mainly been helpful .
neutral	i guess my problems have been mostly down to me being really busy and finding it difficult to hold in mind the end of deal dates , though i don_'_t think that has_been exclusively true .
neutral	i do consider unsubscribing from time to time , because they consume a lot of my inbox space and are easy to while away long_periods without meaning to .
neutral	at the end of the day though , i haven_'_t unsubscribed , so i guess that '_s the important part ......
neutral	the website promised delivery in 0 - 0 days which was good as i had arranged for onward transport to portugal .
neutral	even_though the website stated the item eas in stock when ordered i then got an_email_saying it was not in stock and waiting delivery .
neutral	on telephoning customer_services they were not very interested and curt referrring me to their warehouse for further information .
neutral	i was told that stock was expected that day and an_email was sent offering delivery in a further 0 days time .
neutral	this was past the date for the transport which was leaving for portugal again telephone_calls were made to customer_services and i was again asked to ring the warehouse and give them their due they did manage to slot my delivery in a day earlier to meet my deadline although it only arrived at 0 . 00pm cutting it fine !
neutral	i did get the item i wanted and in good condition but customer_service could be , the customer should not have to ring the warehouse on their behalf or chase the order it should all be handled by them direct and refer back to the customer with a smile not try and get_rid of them as soon as possible which is how it seemed ..
neutral	i ordered my glasses so long ago i don_'_t even remember when .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t received them ( maybe they '_ll be in the mail today ).
neutral	the first time i sent my prescription , they apparently didn_'_t receive it .
neutral	so after waiting a week , they finally sent me an_email requesting the prescription a second time .
neutral	after sending that again , it took at_least another 0 - 0_weeks for tem to prepare the glasses for shipment .
neutral	i '_m in day 0 of the 0 - 00 day shipping .
neutral	here '_s hoping next time around things will go more smoothly .
neutral	i was using one of the boots right now , and they broke while i was walking ... and im still_waiting fot the traking number of a order a i idid a week_ago !!
neutral	!
neutral	it was nice to have a hop on and off pass for 00_hours to help get us around the city in the bitter cold but that was about it .
neutral	however we wanted to take the red human guided tours and there seemed to be few and far between .
neutral	we would pass up on a blue after a blue followed by yet another blue before giving up .
neutral	the street signs say 0 - 00_min every bus ... this is not true !
neutral	we waited 00 - 00_min just to see a bus most times .
neutral	we ended_up just walking to the next stop on more than one occasion because we never saw a bus come through .
neutral	oxy absorbent pads .
neutral	had to use two to absorb the urine from my dog .
neutral	probably could have used a third .
neutral	the product makes cleaning up urine easier & faster_than what i was doing which was pouring a lot of borax on the spot , letting it absorb the urine and then getting it off the carpet .
neutral	however , will be traveling and using these pads will be easier than using the borax
neutral	i '_ve used rentalcars . com several_times in the pasted and had great experiences with enterprise rental .
neutral	recently , i used the same rental company but didn_'_t have the best experience as before .
neutral	the car in which i received didn_'_t have interior lights and after leaving the rental_car location , i found out that the back break light was also out .
neutral	due to it being a holiday , all cars were sold out so i had to deal with these two issues .
neutral	i felt_like money was wasted in a way since i wasn_'_t able to return the vehicle .
neutral	the shuttle met us at the paris airport as arranged , and we paid the agreed amount , which was good value .
neutral	they delivered us to our hotel as_promised so overall it was not a bad_experience .
neutral	however there were a few bad points :
neutral	- the driver drove quite fast and dangerously at some points and scared some of our passengers
neutral	- they did not provide a child_seat even_though they promised one when i booked
neutral	- they did not seem to know where our hotel was even_though the driver had a gps - he got to the right road but then drove right past it , and would have kept on going if we hadn_'_t been looking out for it and yelled for him to stop .
neutral	im afraid the cream tree is going back as it was partly white and partly greyish .
neutral	the delivery etc was quick but shame about the product .
neutral	would definitely stay at hotel again , great location and great suite .
neutral	i would not stay on floor 0 again though bc this is where the public restrooms for the rooftop bar are located and it was quite busy and loud on a sat night .
neutral	nice staff .
neutral	liked this company with past orders , but i ordered several supplements last_week in one order and never received a confirmation_email .
neutral	i thought i might have not hit the final " pay now " button , so i looked on my history page and there was no order .
neutral	i put in another order ..... again , no confirmation_email at all .
neutral	i called customer_service and they showed the second one went through .
neutral	i asked them to send me an_email anyway so i would have a paper trail .
neutral	they sent me two identical emails the next_day for my first order .
neutral	low and behold .... four days_later i receive two packages with my orders .
neutral	i will eventually use them , so i did not send back , but it was a chunk of change that i was not planning on spending at this time .
neutral	they just need to work out some bugs with their website .
neutral	very nice trousers but belt loop tore when i put them on .
neutral	quite small sizing ( like for my cion jacket ). overall really nice quality leather .
neutral	i have used auto_europe for all my last rentals and had great cars and excellent service - the staff helped load the car and were very pleasant and helpful .
neutral	prices were always good but i guess i found the reason_why when i tried to return the car which i had booked for 0_weeks after 0_weeks due to unforeseen_circumstances - there was no refund on the voucher even_though they would have the car available for re - renting .
neutral	therefore as these sort of things can always happen i will pay a little_bit more and have flexibility with another rental company
neutral	we are still_waiting for our delivery - nearly two_weeks after the order was placed .
neutral	i wasn_'_t impressed with the quality of the calendars i ordered .
neutral	though i usually love ordering clothes from this website i was not satisfied with my last order .
neutral	half of the items i bought in adult clothing were way to big even_though the sizes said small or extra small .
neutral	very easy site to use but don_'_t make a typo error .
neutral	applied from nz , changed date from 0rd to 0nd but didn_'_t notice ,( my mistake ) that it read 00rd . saw mistake as soon as i ' d finished , rung office to get business hours , closed of course as it was midday sat here in nz , sent email explanation .
neutral	rung first thing uk monday_morning but no way .... had to pay 00_pound to have mistake altered .
neutral	bad pr .
neutral	honest mistake , didn_'_t want to change my plans !!
neutral	disappointing as trying to find the best & cheapest sailing turned_out to be the dearest .
neutral	pro :
neutral	fun site to shop for random items .
neutral	lots of good deals !
neutral	lots of items i have never seen .
neutral	free_shipping !
neutral	cons_:
neutral	out of stock often
neutral	back ordered often
neutral	slow shipping ( but its free )
neutral	test review .
neutral	the stops are very close to the attrations and therefore is a good thing and we never waited more than 00mins for a bus to come .
neutral	on the other hand , i booked through the big_bus website since it says that it is cheaper , only to find out that the big_bus officials were selling the tickets at a cheaper rate .
neutral	moreover , obtaining the free vouchers promised by big_bus were a hassle .
neutral	and finally , from the three buses we boarded , no one had any rain_ponchos and therefore everyone had to cram downstairs
neutral	good value rabbit food .
neutral	quick delivery but something like 0 pounds delivery charge !
neutral	that '_s so expensive .
neutral	take to long to deliver , and no way of contacting them , when they finally showed_up , the color of the frames were darker than i saw on webite , also the tint is to dark , so glasses have been thrown out .
neutral	in future will pay extra and get them done locally , that way i can see before i pay !!!
neutral	!
neutral	this was the easiest booking i have made in a long time .
neutral	well i feel_like the price is ok the shipping is not doing well because wen you waiting on one order of parts for one specific car is not ok to send some parts one day after 0 days the rest of the parts i think if the company could fixed that he could be a better service thanks
neutral	however ..... having got all the info off from the stressfreeparking website , the parking dropoff was incorrect , and i spent 00_minutes ( at 0000 ) trying to find out where it was ..... big minus for any recommendations .
neutral	i finally found mr parminder at purple parking who could not have been more helpful .
neutral	he advised me what i should do on my return , and there he was at 0000pm being courteous , smiling and very helpful .
neutral	but for him i would have given stressfreeparking / purple parking a large thumbs down .
neutral	you need to remove the sfp website , or at the very least update it , as i understand it has gone into liquidation
neutral	we had a good time on the tour .
neutral	def a good way see london .
neutral	but ... there were road_closures when we went and the communication was poor to non_existent .
neutral	which_meant when we got off the boat_trip we didn_'_t know where to pick_up the bus .
neutral	when we were on it the commentary was good .
neutral	worth doing but check for road_closures !
neutral	i cancelled an order and received an_email_stating it was cancelled and it still arrived at my house .
neutral	in opposition , i like the coupons that come with purchases in the mail .
neutral	i was really pleased with one of my purchases and thought the value was fantastic .
neutral	i '_m unfortunately returning the other item and the zip is very very stiff .
neutral	other than that i was happy with the service .
neutral	i have bad expericience buying here .
neutral	i would give this site 0_stars if you could return bathing_suits .
neutral	i cannot_believe that an airfare can go down $_00 per_ticket and nothing can be done about it because it it 0 days_later !
neutral	i was amazed_at the prices and selection from festive_lights and ordered 00 baubles from them .
neutral	when the delivery was with me two_days_later i was delighted , that was until i undid the box .
neutral	the protective_packaging was a small piece of corrugated cardboard laying on top of the items .
neutral	after taking all the baubles out i found 00 were smashed beyond_repair , as the prices were very good and i liked the ones that werent damaged i did not complain but had there been anymore damaged i probably would have returned the lot .
neutral	overall , good prices , good delivery but be prepared for broken baubles !
neutral	products havn '_t even arrived yet .
neutral	raw_food world is always very slow with their shipping .
neutral	nice quality product but a little over priced , though the cats love their new toys .
neutral	most of the pet_food i can get locally for less .
neutral	i don_'_t see myself shopping their for myself because the sizes run way too small .
neutral	i might shop their for my grandkids .
neutral	not a scam site ( unlike jerrycards . com which is a scam ).
neutral	goods are genuine , unused and delivered quickly .
neutral	however ...
neutral	daily limits should be able to be raised immediately if the credit_card buyer can provide evidence of id and a picture of the card , both_sides , for the merchant .
neutral	i really like the design of the coat but i had to give the first one away because the size i ordered came up small i ordered a size 00 uk n it was more like a 00 - 00 uk size so i had to order a mans one and it made me feel really fat but i know that it can sometimes happen .
neutral	i liked my experience ordering from giftcards . com overall .
neutral	my one decently inconvenient issue was they didn_'_t ask what theme / occasion my gift_card was for and when it came it said , " merry_christmas ."
neutral	my card was for a baby_shower so i had to take it to the retailer and use it for a different card .
neutral	not the best since ordering it online was supposed to save a trip to the store .... hmmm ...
neutral	two orders came with the wrong product each time .
neutral	then you couldn_'_t track my order .
neutral	the braided bully_sticks i ordered came twice with all broken peices that would make a dog choke .
neutral	each time you took_care of problem , but these problems shouldn_'_t happoen in the first place .
neutral	i will no_longer buy the 0 - 0 inch braided bully_sticks from you .
neutral	it is worth the extra money to buy good quality bully_sticks at pet shop .
neutral	bed it nice just a few points where it '_s splintered and needs sanding to be safe
neutral	dont make it hard for your customers to contact you via phone if problems occurs with the parts that the customer order .
neutral	dont make it hard for them to return the parts .
neutral	you would want your customers to keep_coming_back to you regardless of the mishaps that happens .
neutral	bouquet was larger than_expected which was nice but didn_'_t contain as many blue flowers as was depicted in picture , and flowers were different too but presume this was seasonal .
neutral	great instant processing .
neutral	great customer_service when i '_ve had to get them on the phone .
neutral	very reasonably password / account recovery system .
neutral	super easy to use website and payment procedures .
neutral	but : the paypal prepaid mastercard debit car they offer is for the birds !
neutral	yes , i love the instant transfer .
neutral	what '_s unconscionable is that 0 in the last 0 months i '_ve been unable to transfer funds from my paypal to debit_card -- one it lasted an entire 0 day holiday_weekend !
neutral	and when i contacted paypal they would only say they had nothing to do with it .
neutral	sorry , but you offer and promote the product .
neutral	it '_s on you to take_responsibility for it .
neutral	when starbucks does it right , they ' re great -- a classy environment offering their regular drinkers a range of options .
neutral	when they just make their store a way station for the " to go " crowd , it '_s just a joint where their poor staff have to wear uniforms .
neutral	love their espresso beans -- sweet and smoky flavored .
neutral	their regular coffee is , for the most part , meh .
neutral	but when have a store they put down easy chairs -- they it helps create a great atmosphere .
neutral	also , i really like their individual clover brews .
neutral	especially when the beans are from africa or indonesia .
neutral	i ordered an expansion tank lid .
neutral	it broke upon installation but was still usable .
neutral	since i had waited days for it to arrive with no way of transportation , i did not want to wait on sending it back and then wait again on a new shipment that may do the same thing .
neutral	i booked travel in january through_travelocity . com and received incomplete confirmation .
neutral	when spending over 0000 $, one would expect confirmation without_having to call an 000 # that routinely disconnects customers .
neutral	i would probably try another site for booking travel the next time i do so .
neutral	these heads do the job but as the middle section of filaments is missing the clean cannot possibly be as thorough .
neutral	probably_won_'_t recorder .
neutral	the flight was delayed for 0 hours the plane was sitting there but there was no crue to fly it .
neutral	i don_'_t think there '_s any excuse to schedule a flight plane if it is there and not be late but no crew scheduled to send it off .
neutral	the crew should be the first thing you have i can understand actual plane delayed
neutral	luckily i left a date earlier_than i was supposed to
neutral	more hours to access the units .
neutral	what if i want my stuff at night ?
neutral	hi ,
neutral	i don_'_t know if i will use giftcards . com again .
neutral	i ordered several on december 0 and they will not arrive until december 00 .
neutral	i thought i ordered early enough .
neutral	if i new they would have been so late , i would have purchased at the store and foregone the personalization .
neutral	now , if they do not show up on 00 / 00 , i will not have gifts for 0 people .
neutral	these people are low_income who need this gift_card for food .
neutral	i placed an order for 0 parts - 0 were shipped - there was no mention in the box as to where the 0th part was ..... i called the packing_slip number as it states to do if parts are missing and they told me they were the warehouse and that i had to call partsgeek directly .... went to the site .... no phone_number - had to send 0 different emails before i finally got a response telling_me they were sold out ..... if i hadn_'_t done all the leg work i would have never known where the 0th part was .... also haven_'_t gotten the part refund yet either ..... the 0 parts that i did receive were exactly_what i wanted .... as a customer i shouldn_'_t have had to chase down my answers ..... the customer_service with this company is my big complaint here and not being_able to reach them when i needed to ....
neutral	i love all the shoes i '_ve purchased from this sight .
neutral	the cons of my purchases are shoe_size issues i encounted .
neutral	the shoe_sizes are not the same for some of the brand_names .
neutral	i always have to order a size up for those noted brands e . g . red circle brands .
neutral	your call waiting time also sucks , you need to improve on your customer_service experience .
neutral	acceptable experience
neutral	we were unable to get the full benefit from our 0 passes because of route changes due to protests in london .
neutral	with only 00_hours on the pass , we were unable to see any of the oxford_street section .
neutral	i understand that this is out of the control of the big_bus company , but the staff were not clear on what the " detour " would entail .
neutral	the bus reversed course entirely , and was taking us back in the opposite direction .
neutral	i believe that is more than a detour , but the guide really glossed over it .
neutral	we were trying to get somewhere at the time , and would have gotten off had we understood the situation .
neutral	an_hour later , in a totally different part of town , we were informed that if we wanted to get where we were going ( st . pauls ) we would need to get off an walk around the corner and across the river to get there .
neutral	during the time we were in london , we also noticed many more stops on the original line , and will probably recommend that company over big_bus_tours to friends planning a visit .
neutral	requested an alert when item was back in stock , did not happen , whentback on line to find there was now stock in .
neutral	i think that the contact_lenses were a bit big and made my eye like it was staring_at you .
neutral	these were colour contact_lense ( brown ) the diameter and the base curve was too big and i couldnt change these size either on the site .
neutral	their prices are great and can '_t be beat but shipping is not very fast so if you need something fast don_'_t bother .
neutral	i am very pleased with the wig i ordered .
neutral	my only_gripe is i wish they ' d have had a size_chart when i placed my original order for my costume .
neutral	i wear an xs / s in most every store ( express , bebe , new_york & company , victoria secret , etc ), so i ordered an xs / s costume .
neutral	it didn_'_t fit at all , so i had to order a new one .
neutral	based on the size_chart that was on the package of the item i returned , i re - ordered the costume in a m / l .
neutral	when this one arrived , it was tight in the hip and thigh area and loose in the chest area .
neutral	because the costume still looks ok for the most part , i didn_'_t return it for a larger_size because i didn_'_t want to have to worry_about getting it altered .
neutral	hopefully i won_'_t look too crazy on halloween :-)
neutral	we had a great room , clean , no smell of smoke and pet friendly .
neutral	but it said breakfast was included , i asked what was for breakfast , and the office said coffee .
neutral	i said that is breakfast .
neutral	yes replied .
neutral	so we went and got some pastry at the store for breakfast to have with our coffee , while we were sitting there having our coffee and pastry , out of the corner of my daughters eye came this little mouse across the dresser .
neutral	everyone scrambled and then sat back down to waited for him to come_back out from wherever he was .
neutral	finally he came out and another one ran_across the floor .
neutral	we all jumped on the bed .
neutral	sure glad we put the pastry in the microwave during the night we would not of had anything but coffee that morning .
neutral	very entertaining place to stay .
neutral	the software to put the photo book together was okay but not as intuitive as i would have liked .
neutral	i had to faff around quite a bit with moving pages and deleting pages .
neutral	was great i could save what i ' d done part way through , and pick_up where i ' d left of on return .
neutral	great to receive the photo book it looked amazing , my friends were in tears when they received it as a wedding present .
neutral	worth the expense & effort .
neutral	loved the site , really happy with product choice and prices . awful delivery though !
neutral	they use myhermes courier service .
neutral	meant to be next_day delivery , took 0 days to arrive !
neutral	cheaper pet_food
neutral	a little expensive
neutral	fair quality
neutral	worth the call
neutral	excellent gear , easy to order and well_packed but i ordered on thur , i paid £ 0 for next working day delivery but it was delivered on the monday , not fri . my money wasted , wanted it for the weekend .
neutral	didn_'_t get what i ordered .
neutral	no follow_up from petflow .
neutral	usually when i go to mavis for tires , oil changes , inspection or breaks i leave telling myself i will always use these_guys .
neutral	this time not so sure .
neutral	while the manager and staff are very polite and friendly the service took twice as long as quoted without an explanation until i spoke with the manager at what i was observing .
neutral	i was told 0 0 / 0 to 0 hours when the work was already started i ended_up being there 0 hours .
neutral	i was have struts done first the wrong ones were sent ( no_explanation that now they had to wait for the correct ones to arrive ) then the mechanic kept leaving my vehicle to help others that had come in after me ( only to be told when i asked - they only had one mechanic on and he had to help the other guys .
neutral	then i was told almost done next up for alignment only to see my car sit up on the lift for 00 to 00_minutes .
neutral	explanation only offered when i asked how to to be told machine keep going down .
neutral	the manager was nice and offered some discounts but i feel he should have done more .
neutral	not sure if i would return
neutral	this process was amazing and it even took my american credit_card .
neutral	fast and reliable .
neutral	i loved it !
neutral	i was so happy on how my order went they took_care of everthing really good the manager let_me use an old precription which i love , the only 0 things that dissapointed me was that they told me they will email me when the glasses were gonna be ship out and they didnt even send me a tracking_number , also when i received the glasses both of the ( legs ) are so loose i have to go fix it =( because even one came apart .
neutral	other then that i love how the frame looks
neutral	i got to the howard johnson and was given a dirty room , however after i talked to the staff_member he quickly assigned me a new room .
neutral	overall the quality of service was good because they were willing to help me feel_comfortable .
neutral	the room was nothing like it was pictured online , which was disappointing .
neutral	overall it was an okay experience .
neutral	good way to get oriented with the city and learn some facts but not quickest way to get around .
neutral	while the busses run frequently ( we never waited more than 0 mins ) the tube is much more efficient to get from place to place .
neutral	i enjoy the dragon toy i bought , my dogs love it !
neutral	the other led_collars are enjoyable , but within no later than a day , they both frayed and are falling_apart .
neutral	i '_m quite disappointed ..
neutral	usually my go to site for travel is travelocity - when i ordered my plane_tickets i did not check the waiver at the top for additional insurance - when i looked for my confirmation i did not have my flight to florida .
neutral	i did have the return flight as i saw the wavier at the top .
neutral	i had to reordered the airline_ticket through the airline and paid an_additional_$_00 .
neutral	ordered a treadmill rang before placing the order to ensure it was on stock for next_day delivery was told order and it would be there next_day did this it did not arrive rang up and was told there was a cut_off time for orders told them was not told this .
neutral	they went away and listened to the recording and confirmed that their staff had not told me there was a cut_off time i asked for a refund of my delivery and was refused i then asked for the head_office address and was told they would refund the £_00 . 00 delivery charge as far as i am aware ithas still not been done
neutral	please stop requesting feedback every time i interact with stamps . com .
neutral	i pay for the service and don_'_t like all the spam that follows when i call your customer_service for something ( software issues , printer incompatibles , scale / weight inconsistencies , postage reimbursements ) .
neutral	also , the tier one , tier two technical_support stinks .
neutral	not fun to have to troubleshoot problems and repeat them over and over from getting passed around because the first person cannot resolve .
neutral	( and the hold music during that process is ear piercing !)
neutral	i would venture to say you really don_'_t need that first line of support and that most of us have already thought of the suggestions they come up with .
neutral	all it does is escalate the problem and bad moods of customers .
neutral	otherwise , i love not standing in line at the post_office ( and would enjoy reviewing their sorry bunch ).
neutral	thanks much .
neutral	petflow has done a fantastic job of keeping me posted when my recurring order is to arrive and providing the tracking_information .
neutral	also , packing of order is great .
neutral	that said , i am really disappointed at what appears to be decreasing quality and size of the bocce bakery products i am receiving .
neutral	this last order of dog_biscuits in two different_flavors didn_'_t look anything at all like the previous order of exactly the same thing .
neutral	the one pack had barely any whole biscuits and were a lighter color and the other looks like there is a whole new recipe and smaller biscuit shape these days .
neutral	i may cancel my subscription because of that
neutral	you might be fast but using fed - x is very slow i '_m still_waiting ..
neutral	reasonable cost .
neutral	although did mess about with the day of getting tyre_fitted .
neutral	the day i booked through the website wasn_'_t actually available garage so booked for the day earlier .
neutral	then the tyre wasn_'_t at the garage on the correct day .
neutral	ended_up getting it fitted the following week .
neutral	they could '_ve have kept in better contact with me while i was waiting to hear if the tyre would be delivered .
neutral	but the garage checked my tracking for free .
neutral	difficult to install with no directions or tutorial so i went to you tube however i still ended_up ripping the speakers out because i was unaware of the components beneath .
neutral	i placed an order on the 0nd day of december expecting more than enough time for delivery .
neutral	it is now 0 : 00 am christmas morning and no controller to give my son .
neutral	i emailed the company and was told my order was going out the next_day and would receive a conformation email .
neutral	never did .
neutral	after about 0 days , i call them and are told the shell had a crack , was redone and they bumped up my order to priority so i would get it in time for christmas !
neutral	hopefully when i finally do get the controller it works properly .
neutral	i used another site to compare prices and got better deals on it , so used both musicmagpie and webuydvds in order to get best possible price .
neutral	pretty good service though .
neutral	thanks !
neutral	hi your information is excelent all the advice is thair for to make everything so easy for your travelers , one thing that went wrong wasnt sent the sim message . hope to be able to use you the next time as your pricing is reasonable
neutral	love the bulbs , but if you get one that doesn_'_t work , you will never get the credit .
neutral	" well , it worked in our lab " is what i was told .
neutral	well , it didn_'_t work in my showroom and that '_s where it needs to work !!!!
neutral	all the others were fine , but at over $_00 a crack , i expect either a new bulb or my money back .
neutral	it has_been months and neither has happened .
neutral	i bought from pet_flow twice and both_times very satisfied with my purchases .
neutral	the only_thing i was disappointed with was the discount i was told i had $ 0 . 00 on my next purchase , then of course you had to order another $_00 to get it .
neutral	if you are going to give a returning customer a discount , good business would be not to make them have to buy a certain_amount to use it .
neutral	i will come_back more often if that would have been the case .
neutral	i had already spent $_00 for two visits , another $_00 was too much especially at christmas time .
neutral	i like bookbyte for the ease and they have a good selection , however , quite_often a book is in the " processing " stage for awhile before it ships .
neutral	it would be helpful if it could ship more quickly after the order is placed .
neutral	i was referred to the site , to earn credits for another .
neutral	i did notice some really great deals .
neutral	i was so excited about the prices , that i added a few items to my checkout cart , but at check out , the shipping fee was $ 0 . 00 , so i then got rid of a couple ( thinking the fee would be less ) and it stayed the same .
neutral	i ended_up only buying a $ 0 . 00 nail_polish , which looks really awesome , but ended_up paying $ 0 . 00 total .. which that part , was not cool ..
neutral	i think the fee should be cheaper , since it would weigh less to ship ..
neutral	i finally received my glasses and was so pleased with them and i was worried that i wouldn_'_t like them .
neutral	there so pretty and i feel great with them on .
neutral	only one problem both of the lenses had a scratch on them .
neutral	which made me pretty sad bc i waited so long to get them and knew there was nothing i could do about .
neutral	i would love to give 0_stars but i wanted to honest .
neutral	hopefully i '_m the only one who had this problem .
neutral	my order appeared not to be processed .
neutral	i checked the ship date schedule and it said rx confirmation pending .
neutral	i never received an_email inquiring_about the rx , so if i hadn_'_t called i never would have received the order , which arrived close to 0_weeks past ship date .
neutral	i was frustrated .
neutral	the problem has since been solved and now i have their food .
neutral	taste of the wild_salmon is great nutrition and eliminates all skin conditions related to food_allergies .
neutral	i did the bus in dubai .
neutral	i found the staff were very friendly but the bus was too slow .
neutral	there were lots of breaks and down time .
neutral	when our driver got off at deria city for a 00min break he left the door open so we were all left to bake in the sun without_any air_conditioning .
neutral	so i got off and took a taxi .
neutral	i found the dubai creek boat_ride wasnt really worth the time as the bus mimic the same route and spoke about the same things .
neutral	however , i did really appreciate the free water on board the buses .
neutral	that was really appreciated in the extreme heat .
neutral	this website does have competitive_prices as i received a discounted_rate so i am happy i got the best price available .
neutral	i do think the website should be more ' up front ' about additional_charges like booking fees , sms text confirmations and cancellation charges .
neutral	these are not shown on the initial page and should be .
neutral	i will use again .
neutral	excellent service with the curtains arriving within the stated time .
neutral	they were an excellent fit so were precisely measured and look great on the windows .
neutral	will_definitely use woodyatt again .
neutral	i purchased multiple gift_cards for christmas and birthdays some with the same name .
neutral	i had to re - input 0 and 0 times because the cards kept reverting or changing to a different person .
neutral	grouped cards shoudl be given a discount and no shipping_costs .
neutral	if you can get that bug fixed you get 0_stars
neutral	the item i ordered was packaged very well and arrived within a week .
neutral	i was very satisfied until my credit_card bill came and i was charged twice for my order .
neutral	after_speaking to the credit_card company i found out that parts_geek had charged me twice for my order .
neutral	at this time i am waiting to get it resolved .
neutral	i find it a huge problem that this company does not take phone_calls .
neutral	everything has to be done online .
neutral	i won_'_t use this company again unless i am refunded my money for the overcharge .
neutral	i bought 0 pair of versace sunglasses .
neutral	upon initial inspection they looked amazing .
neutral	as soon as i got the opportunity to wear them i noticed the lens was popping out at the top .
neutral	i didn_'_t really want to wait to send them back and then get a new pair .
neutral	so i fix them myself .
neutral	i was very disappointed that i paid the money that i did and that the product was not inspected more carefully prior to shipping .
neutral	however i '_m sure given the opportunity the sunglasses would have been replaced with a new pair .
neutral	since i fixed them they look great and i am very satisfied .
neutral	i would still buy from this company again .
neutral	am happy with the quality of the finished article , but the release mechanism to drop the blind works intermittently .
neutral	it comes ready assembled so it is nothing to do with how it has_been hung , not a smooth_operation at all .
neutral	the recipient posted a photo of the flowers i sent her on facebook .
neutral	it did not look like what i ordered but when i went back to the serenata website , it did not show the arrangement i ordered - christmas celebration .
neutral	also , there was no search_bar for me to look for it that way .
neutral	i was happy once i spoke to a person of english_speaking from the usa since that is where i was booking my hotel .
neutral	i had problems with book from another company and they booked the wrong date and charged me and held my money for three_days .
neutral	it would be more helpful to have someone_who is from this country to book out rooms .
neutral	not some one in another country !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	we '_ve used_skypark meet & greet a number of times and found them extremely efficient and good value for money .
neutral	however , the last time didn_'_t come up to the excellent standard that we ' d come to expect .
neutral	we drove to the car_park and handed_over the car at level 0 near the lift and were told to collect it from the same place - on our return , we phoned and spoke to a foreign gentleman_who told to go down to one .
neutral	when the car couldn_'_t be found we rang again and asked what floor he was on and he said it was on the 0th_floor .
neutral	it must have been a language problem .
neutral	also , the car mat was covered in mud as if the driver had just left a building site .
neutral	consequently , we have given a 0_star_rating , as prior to this one incident the service was 0st_class .
neutral	i intended to write and complain , but , i returned from holiday unwell and didn_'_t get around to it .
neutral	in view of our past satisfaction , and the fact that the meet & greet are taking place on the terminal forecourt , we are sure that our unfortunate experience was just a one - off .
neutral	found some unique items but pricing is a bit high .
neutral	i had to tell petflow ( via their facebook_page ) that they had mispriced two items .
neutral	could be better , could be worse .
neutral	i have booked with this firm before , so persisted despite problems with booking form and pop_ups .
neutral	there was no way to confirm all information re dates before paying , hence , when confirmation came via_email , wrong dates !
neutral	however , i emailed and someone rang from the office and we sorted_out dates and , even discussed departing heathrow 0 and arriving heathrow 0 .
neutral	when new confirmation came through , it stated gatwick term 0 and gatwick term 0 , so once again , office sorted it out .
neutral	i would award 0_stars for office staff , but only 0 for website ( how could i have requested gatwick terminals 0 & 0 as they dont appear on drop down list ) only persisted because i had used company before and had no_problems .
neutral	when items were packed , it looked like a child had done it , and package arrived in bad shape , but part was ok .
neutral	shipping was initiated fairly quickly , but took a long time for parts to arrive .
neutral	dit is een prima site , maar_ik adviseer je om gewoon lekker zelf een film te gaan bekijken ;-)
neutral	it was a little crazy making .
neutral	there was no option for a message from us ( e . g .
neutral	we love you ).
neutral	everything was generic or singular .
neutral	and then , to go to all the trouble of having it sent to me so i could write a note on the card only to find that
neutral	the envelope it came in was addressed to me -- like i was the recipient .
neutral	why in the world wouldn_'_t you have an option for having the card and envelope be inside a mailing envelope ?
neutral	makes no sense .
neutral	how do you make this work if you want to write a personal_note and include something with the gift_card ?!
neutral	i had to cut the gift_card down so it would fit inside an envelope i had on hand and then could put it in the package mailed to my beautiful niece .
neutral	i needed my glasses right_away but they took almost a month to get to me and that was too long
neutral	i ordered an item and added code for student discount however i was then unable to enter a code , repeatedly advertised on the website , offering free_postage .
neutral	when i emailed to try and sort this i was informed that the company was unable to refund the cost .
neutral	i emailed again to ask why and suggested they could simply refund me the sum of £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i was then informed that only one code could be used and therefore i could use one code or the other , not both .
neutral	automated emails in the first instance resulted in me spending more time trying to get a suitable outcome which was in fact futile !
neutral	delivery was also quite slow , however it was just inside the given number of days .
neutral	it seems as if every time i go to purchase from your website , it will show cards as available and then after i get through log - in , purchase , etc_., and place my order , it says the cards are no_longer available .
neutral	so i go back to the home page , and lo and behold , they still show as available .
neutral	so i try different cards , and the same thing happens .
neutral	the next_day i return to your website and the same cards are still showing as available .
neutral	i do not have this problem on other gift_card websites .
neutral	what they have is available , and i am able to readily purchase .
neutral	it is very discouraging that time and again i am not able to do_business with you .
neutral	it was my first time ordering and i was happy with everything but 0 treats ( cowboy cookout gourmet sausage treats ) they both expired 0 / 00 / 00 that is over a year past the date and i would let my dogs eat something that old .
neutral	i am very leary about ordering again because it don_'_t want this to happen again
neutral	goldstar is terrific for landing tickets at less_expensive prices .
neutral	the seats ( and views ) won_'_t be as good of course .
neutral	i have actually decided to buy tickets at full face value once seeing the seat area for goldstar members .
neutral	and you '_ll get several emails each week .
neutral	the main one comes out tuesday night .
neutral	if a hotel has any surcharges , such as resort_fee , wireless internet charges , parking fees , etc then after priceline says your price has_been accepted they need to say something like : the hotel that accepted your price has a $_00 . 00 / day resort_fee , or a $ 0 . 00 / day wireless fee , or ... do you still wish to purchase this hotel at x - dollars / night ?
neutral	i know there is the fine_print , but nobody expects more than a few_dollars for any fees .
neutral	i wasn_'_t very happy when we were charged an extra $_000_+ for the 0 days we stayed at our hotel .
neutral	we have used priceline several_times but only for 0 - 0 nights , and had never had this issue before .
neutral	the room was great once we got to the hotel , but booking through_travelocity was not a good experience .
neutral	the person on the other end of the phone had difficulty understanding what i was saying and had to repeat myself several_times .
neutral	english didn_'_t seem to be their primary language , i know sometimes it is difficult to understand people on the phone but it was still very frustrating and took a long time .... almost decided to not continue with the booking and call the hotel direct .
neutral	so much for fast delivery on the item i ordered .
neutral	and that status of my delivery was not updated so i had no_idea where it was .
neutral	it said it was dispatched so i thought great it will arrive by the weekend .
neutral	when my partners glasses finally arrived it was great .
neutral	but i ordered the glasses on a wednesday_night and i did not receive them until the following_tuesday .
neutral	the clothes were great although i got two different pieces of clothing .
neutral	both size 00s one was the correct size and the other was massive .
neutral	and both size guide models were the same size to refer to ...
neutral	product not as heavy as expected , lightweight and kinda dissapointed
neutral	i have dealt_with travelocity on several_occasions and have been satisfied .
neutral	the last time , however , i has a question about my travel_plans so i called your rep and he answered my question .
neutral	i also heard on a recording that i would be charged a fee if i decided to schedule my flights with the rep so i explained that i was going to go back online to set my travel_plans and he assured_me he could do it and would not charge me the $_00 . 00 fee .
neutral	we then_proceeded to schedule my flights .
neutral	unfortunately , when i received my credit_card statement , i found he charged me the fee after all .
neutral	when i contacted travelocity about this , i was told they would remove the fee .
neutral	to date this has not been done and i '_m quite sure will never be done .
neutral	so , that is why i will probably not use travelocity the next time i book a trip .
neutral	nicely_packaged with cotton bag and ribbons although this made it difficult to inspect the playing cards within the wooden box .
neutral	the box was scratched and was poorly made with obvious joins in the lid where it should have been one whole piece of wood .
neutral	shame as it is a gift for my father in law .
neutral	however , it was a quick delivery and as already mentioned nice packaging .
neutral	i received my order quickly .
neutral	replacing ink was a messy process as ink leaked as inserting into printer .
neutral	i have never had that problem with hp_ink_cartridges .
neutral	black_ink does not work properly .... streaky prints .
neutral	products have always been good quality , but prices are double that of most competitors with similar product quality .
neutral	overall i think your site is great , great deals and top quality stuff .
neutral	however , i think your website needs tweaking when it comes to ordering stethoscopes .
neutral	there should be a more intuitive way to know if your order is placed .
neutral	you should be able to place the order then engrave it .
neutral	not the other way around .
neutral	loved the product
neutral	ive perchanced alot from this site until one order of shoes i got were to big so i returned them and never got a refund just store credit of only half of what i bought the shoes for .
neutral	shoes were around $_00 and only got $_00 in store credit and it didnt even include what i had to pay to ship them back .
neutral	still a month later i have yet to get a refund .
neutral	i loved the site until now .
neutral	feb 0 , 0000 p . s .
neutral	shoes are not true to size !
neutral	!
neutral	it didn_'_t begin well with a rather unhelpful telephone_conversation with an operator who refused to tell me all the technical questions she was going to ask me about my windscreen even_though i explained that i would have to go out and walk down the road in the rain to check each time i didn_'_t know the answer .
neutral	i was also surprised that a new windscreen could not be fitted for a week , which left me with no car if it was raining as the windscreen wipers could not be used over the cracks .
neutral	however the fitter was punctual , charming and did a great job in the time he said it would take and of course that was the main thing .
neutral	not that straight_forward
neutral	order was placed on 0 / 00 , payment was posted 0 / 00 but delivery did not happen until 0 / 00 .
neutral	disappointed about cs being indifferent to this issue , a 00_%_discount on my next order is not really an incentive for me to shop there again .
neutral	all items are extremely good quality and extremely unusual .
neutral	just the colour combination i was looking for .
neutral	only_thing that spoilt the shopping_experience was the trauma of getting it delivered .
neutral	use of city_link with limited home delivery hours was extremely frustrating .
neutral	sizing is way too variable .
neutral	normally a size 0 but garments nearly all too small .
neutral	if i can '_t rely_on sizing then it is too difficult to order .
neutral	products returned but not yet credited to my account .
neutral	not sure if i will shop again .
neutral	sorry .
neutral	when ordering granite plaques , one was misprinted .
neutral	when told of the problem , they replaced it at no charge but it was not the same size of the original which is not good for our applications .
neutral	my order was sent on the 00th , but didn_'_t arrive until the 00rd .
neutral	i ran_out of food for my dogs in the mean - time and had to make a very costly , expensive and time_consuming trip to the pet_store to grab a small bag to tie us over twice .
neutral	i '_m not sure this ' convenient ' service of ordering from petflow is what i thought it would be .
neutral	ordered on 00 - 0 today is 00 - 00 still_waiting for part very slow . ordered parts from other_suppliers had part in 0 to 0 days .
neutral	the shoes i bought were the normal size i wear however the shoes they sent were smaller i asked to exchange them for a size_bigger i was told that no exchanges or returns just store credit meaning ima have to pay to send the shoes back then pay again to have the right size shipped back to me i ended_up just keeping the too small shoes and just gave them away because i couldn_'_t fit them
neutral	i tested a week before my peroid about 0 days before these tests faintly picked_up on the hcg , a week_later i read negative which for someone_who has had miscarraiges is heart breaking so i ended_up buying other tests which in fact turned_out to be positive .
neutral	everyone is different .
neutral	i rang and asked for a quote for a couple spending 0 days in italy .
neutral	a cursory phone_call with a lady_who couldn_'_t really be bothered produced a quote of £_00 .
neutral	i went on line , did it myself and paid £_00 !
neutral	!
neutral	result !
neutral	another plus is that my husband suffers from colitis and this is covered as standard .
neutral	i booked with bookit . com before and was very pleased .
neutral	however , this time , i was surprised to see a higher price than_expected .
neutral	i booked a hotel for $_000 a night with a 00_% extra discount .
neutral	however , i ended_up paying over $_000 which i don_'_t understand .
neutral	it says plus tax .
neutral	they should include the tax in the price advertised .
neutral	it now shows that the original room - rate was $_000 which makes no sense because the reason i even looked at it was the advertised price at $_00 !
neutral	looks like not for the date i wanted , but still it should have been no more than the $_000 minus 00_% as_advertised .
neutral	when trying to book a trip , if the selected air flight is not available , the system will bump you automatically to another flight , without an explanation , and then have you going around in circles and won_'_t allow you to finish the reservation .
neutral	suggest if a flight is not available that the system either lets you know or does not include an unavailable flight so you can select an available flight and be able to move forward through the reservation .
neutral	we finally called book it and was told that if a flight is full it bumps you to another flight .
neutral	very frustrating !
neutral	i bought a pair of boots and i love the fit and color .
neutral	i bought some shoes that were so lovely and i wanted them to fit but one shoe is bigger_than the other or one of my feet is larger than the other .
neutral	i do not know how to return it or exchange it .
neutral	i have nothing else to say at this time .
neutral	i have not received my order yet .
neutral	ordered blooming plants and flowers for funeral ( family ) in square basket .
neutral	was assured would look just like picture .
neutral	did not resemble picture at all .
neutral	substituted which was never mentioned when i ordered .
neutral	what they sent was in a dime - store basket .
neutral	called to complain and they offered in - store credit .
neutral	i told them i didn_'_t want in - store credit and would never use them again .
neutral	they gave $_00 credit to my card and were supposed to send confirmation e_- mail , which i never got .
neutral	called credit_card company to verify credit was issued .
neutral	these people in my estimation are not reliable .....
neutral	ordering on - line was easy and straightforward .
neutral	i ordered 0 items and as_promised the delivery was the next_day .
neutral	unfortunately , one of the items was delivered twice and the second item ordered did not materialise .
neutral	i asked the delivery driver to take the additional item but was told they couldn_'_t take the duplicate , they would have to return the whole order .
neutral	after waiting for another 0 days for the remainder of my order to be delivered i sent an e_- mail to the company giving a date when the duplicate item could be collected and was informed that if collection could not be made on the arranged date i would be charged for the cost incurred of trying to make a collection , despite giving the details of a neighbour who agreed to assist in the return in case of emergencies .
neutral	i was rather concerned that a charge could be made , as we all know emergencies can arise , and when i rang to make my position clear that i had not order the duplicate item but would be charged if the collection failed , i waited 00_minutes before my call was put through to a member of customer_services who confirmed the charge of approximately £ 0 could be made .
neutral	i had read negative_reviews of this place but still decided to go because it was the closest tft location to my home .
neutral	when the guy_who was in charge of my order went over finances with me , he told me that my tires were ~$ 00 more than they had been listed for online .
neutral	i called him out on it and of course he had a response (" computer glitch " or some bs ).
neutral	i wasn_'_t overcharged but i had a sour taste in my mouth after that .
neutral	nice try , guy .
neutral	i was not able to apply this card to my game !
neutral	so when i tried to use it , my purchase was charged to my sons account which caused a lot of hard feelings .
neutral	i would like to give this card back to you for a full_refund !
neutral	most_recent_purchase was fine and arrived within 0 days .
neutral	however last fall i purchased water blocks and all 0 covers were broken when opening the box , my email requesting information whether extra covers can be purchased , never was answered .
neutral	i now have 00 boxes without lids because the year before they were cracked in transit also .
neutral	i highly_recommend improved packaging or make lids available for purchase .
neutral	we have been paying our monthly dues to the company and so_far , nothing has_been settled .
neutral	i know this takes time , but i '_m a tad worried_about not seeing any movement yet .
neutral	i continue to get harassing phone_calls from my creditors even_though i have switched my address and phone_number to all my creditors towards ndr .
neutral	today , i received one at my place of work !
neutral	i hate this and i understand that this part if not ndr '_s fault but it does make me feel " under the gun ".
neutral	i just want to see some movement to tell me we made the right decision in trusting our money and accounts over to them .
neutral	very hopeful , but very nervous .
neutral	when i booked our room on travelocity , i specifically stated that there would be two adults and four children .
neutral	i expected that there would be beds ready for everyone .
neutral	i even called ahead and requested a crib and was told there would be one .
neutral	when we arrived at 00 :_00pm , exhausted and ready to just crawl into our beds , the guest services coordinator asked us if we needed the pull - out couch .
neutral	i expected the blankets and sheets would have already been on the bed , but she had to go find some .
neutral	so we made our child '_s bed for them while we waited for her to get the crib .
neutral	to summarize , this hotel stay wasn_'_t the simple , restful stay i had expected .
neutral	we won_'_t stay there again .
neutral	drinkstuff were great , very helpful , polite & friendly but their delivery company - dpd were awful .
neutral	said they couldn_'_t find our address ( it was delivery to a company with a big office , no one else has had trouble !)
neutral	so delayed delivery but fancy - they found our address first time when they tried to re deliver them .
neutral	then nearly 00_% of the ( plastic ) glasses were broken - i expect by the delivery company - drinkstuff were very good about replacing them but yet again , the delivery company said they couldn_'_t find our address !!
neutral	still_waiting for delivery for the replacements ...
neutral	i had to amend my rental bookings a few_times , but in the end i got there .
neutral	the online experience was pretty good , but rental lady kept trying to push insurance on me .
neutral	i was pretty annoying .
neutral	i wished the offline experience was a good as the online experience .
neutral	the experience was easy and quick .
neutral	although i understand that a non_- refundable rate will not allow me to receive my funds in the event i am unable to check in on my scheduled day .
neutral	i find it hard to understand_why my credit_card had to be charged prior to my check - in date .
neutral	i would have been more comfortable to be charged on check - in date regardless if i showed_up or not .
neutral	i would like to see that aspect changed .
neutral	the hunter_boots are beautiful , but the box they arrived in appears to have been kicked around a stable yard !
neutral	a big dissappointment considering this is a present .... not the best looking gift !
neutral	i was really excited about the dog_food that i found on chewy .
neutral	it was the same product i used to buy from the feed_store in another_state .
neutral	it was on sale for a great price !
neutral	i was told it would be here by weds .
neutral	and it '_s sat .
neutral	morning already and it '_s still not here .
neutral	i just checked online and found out that it was delivered to the office on the opposite_side of my huge apt .
neutral	complex and has_been sitting there since thurs !
neutral	i specifically_asked how it would be shipped and ordered it because it came fedex and not usps , because i did not want it to be sent to the office because it didn_'_t fit into the tiny usps boxes in the apt .
neutral	complex .
neutral	i was home all day thurs .
neutral	so i have no_idea why it got sent to the office instead of where i was waiting for it at .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	i clicked the wrong room type when booking online and did not get a chance to review it until all was completed and it gave_me the final outline .
neutral	i immediately called the toll_free number to inquire if they could switch the room type and was told i would have to pay a cancelation_fee and then rebook .
neutral	that is totally crazy !
neutral	i could see if it was days or weeks_later , but this was within an_hour and they could not fix it .
neutral	at minimum the website should allow a full review before hitting final to ensure everything is correct .
neutral	i bought a futon online ... the product looks like it is high_quality and i '_m excited to get it .
neutral	however , my card was charged a week_ago and i haven_'_t received any communication about the shipping status .
neutral	i always shop online and always get charged after the item ships .
neutral	i will try to contact then today .
neutral	once you are set_up , it '_s very easy to use , however , i find it expensive but , calling to cuba is expensive everywhere .
neutral	i had a few droped calls and got charged about it , not really happy about that , but other than that it is okay
neutral	i called frames_direct to see if i could order some glasses first to see if they would fit my son '_s skinny face .
neutral	they said yes , no problem , so i ordered 0 pairs of glasses ( same pair , different_colors ).
neutral	they fit my son '_s face , and he liked the blue pair .
neutral	i called to see what i should do to get lenses put into the blue pair , the representative told me exactly_what to to .
neutral	i sent both pairs of glasses back and put 0 note in with a prescription attached as well as put post it notes on both pairs of glasses explaining what to do ( return the brown ones , put frames into the blue ones ).
neutral	i then received an_email_telling_me that both were returned .
neutral	so , i called 0 days_later to see what was happening , and the representative told me that they were working it out .
neutral	i then received an invoice for the 0 pair of glasses with lenses .
neutral	then i waited and waited for them to be processed .
neutral	on the website , it claims that glasses are received 0 - 0 business days after_placing order .
neutral	my glasses didn_'_t arrive until 00 days after i talked to the last representative and received my invoice .
neutral	it took so long !
neutral	now , a little over a month after receiving the glasses , the bow broke right off .
neutral	for now , we have epoxyed them , i '_m afraid my son will be without glasses for another 0_weeks , so i haven_'_t even contacted customer_service about the issue .
neutral	rotors look good but sent us rear brake_pads not front .
neutral	unhappy husband putting my tire back on with no new parts :(
neutral	i was supposed to receive $_00 for the book i sent in , but when bookbyte processed my book they said it had a different isbn_number than i had reported and they would only issue me $_00 .
neutral	when i contacted customer_service to see if they could double_check the isbn_number , they told me that the book was inaccessible and there could be no checking .
neutral	i bought that textbook from my school_bookstore , which would not have stocked a book with an incorrect isbn_number without telling students about the error .
neutral	therefore , i '_m confident that the book i sent in had the correct isbn_number and that i was stiffed out of $_00 .
neutral	i was disappointed with the taste of the coffees i ordered as they had no robustness .
neutral	nespresso coffees cost more but delivery is faster and quality much_better .
neutral	i will be going back to nespresso .
neutral	i placed my order over the phone for 0 bosal mufflers for my mint condition0000 mazda rx0 .
neutral	i added the hangers & gaskets to my order and received everything quite quickly .
neutral	unfortunately , the mufflers were very poorly packaged and quite beat up by the time they arrived in washington_state .
neutral	when i took my car to a fully qualified mechanic / muffler specialist for installation we discovered that the hangers didn_'_t fit at all and only after modifications & welding would these mufflers fit my car !?!
neutral	i will be contacting bosal about their products but partsgeek also needs to improve their packaging practices and also consult with bosal on their products to avoid my hassles happening to other customers .
neutral	i have had identity_guard since 0000 .
neutral	i have always relied on it to give me all 0 scores .
neutral	i thought the scores were pulled directly from the 0 credit_bureaus .
neutral	this month there was a notice that they changed to new software that is more like creditors for scores .
neutral	as a result , my scores went down 00 - 00 points depending_on company .
neutral	how could it have been that far off before ?
neutral	i am going to go directly to each of the 0 credit companies and check my score to see how it compares .
neutral	if it is off , i am going to cancel my identity_guard service .
neutral	a
neutral	took 0 and 0 / 0_weeks to arrive and don_'_t entirely trust that it arrived the fact that it came a few_days after i had queried what was happening .
neutral	i don_'_t mind a delay but only if i receive updates - had nothing after a few_days after ordering and as i said nothing until i asked where my order was .
neutral	not had chance to try the product as yet so will wait and see .
neutral	last point - got the chance to review well before the product arrived .
neutral	you '_ve changed shippers and i haven_'_t received my items yet .
neutral	ups takes_forever to deliver to where i live .
neutral	flowers were quite dry and lifeless , but on time .
neutral	i would avoid if possible , but in a pinch , easy to use .
neutral	it was so hard to link a paypal_account that i didn_'_t even_bother to make a purchase and instead contacted the seller direct and gave him a credit_card .
neutral	well i ordered two different perscriptions because my eyes are different and one perscription did not work and since i opened just one contact they would not take the rest back .
neutral	so im out $_00 .
neutral	booked with travelocity on delta_airlines february 00 , 0000 .
neutral	when i attempted to select seats , there were none available .
neutral	it was left to me to find a seat at check in .
neutral	when i arrived to check in at the rochester , mn airport , there was no plane .
neutral	therefore , all passengers were placed on a bus to be driven to minneapolis airport .
neutral	when i checked in at minneapolis airport , i did have a seat_assignment - middle !
neutral	delta agents worked to assign me an aisle seat due to my height / legs .
neutral	return trip from ft myers airport to rochester was on time and uneventful .
neutral	whew !
neutral	this review is hard for me to write .
neutral	i did not have any_problems with this service - my car wasn_'_t stolen , i was picked_up on time , i didn_'_t miss my flight , everything was ok . my biggest thing was , i was worried_about all of those things .
neutral	the van that took me to the airport and picked me up was an old dirty dodge minivan .
neutral	the van was marked with a white printed off sheet of paper taped on the window .
neutral	there was too much potential for a young_woman alone to be in danger .
neutral	i pulled out of the parking_lot and thought my tires were flat .
neutral	i went to pull over , but didn_'_t because my options were a strip club and an adult store .
neutral	i don_'_t think this service was " bad ", but my husband will never let_me do it again .
neutral	since our contract with you started in the winter_months ( nov . or dec .) you insisted on doing the yearly inspection in the winter .
neutral	i have never seen a termite in these months .
neutral	if we see any termites in the spring or summer , we need to call you then of course there will be a treatment charge .
neutral	so the contract charge is for your man to come out and do this inspection , then if any thing is found , we pay above and beyond .
neutral	i would prefer to have the inspection done in the season the termites are more active ., then maybe i would feel more confident with the inspection .
neutral	as it is now , we feel the inspection is just for show .
neutral	i have known that i needed new_tires for a little while now .
neutral	when i tried to order new_tires a couple of months_ago with another company ( firestone ) i was contacted soon after my order and was told that they were out of stock and i would have to purchase a more_expensive tire .
neutral	i was very frustrated by this bait and switch tactic that i decided to look elsewhere .
neutral	i asked around town and a few people said townfair , so i decided to try my luck ordering tires via their internet site .
neutral	i visited the site and within a few_minutes i had found the tires i needed and at the price i wanted to pay .
neutral	i submitted my order and was surprised when they confirmed my order and appointment .
neutral	when i arrived for my appointment i was a little_concerned because the price was suddenly more than the price i was given over the internet .
neutral	i was getting ready to walk out when they said they would give me last_week '_s price , which happened to be the price i was quoted over the internet .
neutral	i was a little frustrated because i felt_like they were trying to get me to pay more but when i put up a fuss they gave_me the price i was originally_quoted .
neutral	once the games were over they were very nice and courteous .
neutral	overall , it was a good experience but not great .
neutral	the overhead door was bad when i moved in .
neutral	the clerk had a hard time opening it .
neutral	by the time i went to move the last few items out , i couldn_'_t even get it opened and it was raining .
neutral	i waited_until ii saw a man_who could help me .
neutral	two guys finally managed to get it opened .
neutral	one good thing , is with all the rains we had , the unit did stay fairly dry and nothing got ruined .
neutral	easy to order , prices are great .
neutral	i ended_up with a teacher edition instead .
neutral	not so great !
neutral	in response to an over subscribed deal wowcher emailed to state that instead of purchasing the item you could have a refund .
neutral	i opted for a refund and contacted wowcher ass requested on the email address provided to have no response a week_later .
neutral	i then rang wowcher only to be told that i have to email another email address to get my money back – again i did , to which i have had no response .
neutral	i ordered 0 items all size lrg .
neutral	i normally get med , but decided to go large .
neutral	glade i did no most of it .
neutral	one fit good , the second looked a little big but i think a med would of been to small .
neutral	the third one was a to tight , it would not even zip up all the way , gave that one to a friend that i know has a smaller waist than i do and it fit great and she normally wears smalls .
neutral	so i liked everything but sad that it did not all fit .
neutral	i am keeping the two shirts and the dress went to the friend
neutral	the only_negative_thing about appliances_online and its potentially a big negative was the aggressive tactics of the sales guy trying to sell us the insurance on the fridge we were buying .
neutral	he nearly caught us out and my husband and i consider ourselves pretty savvy about these things .
neutral	the insurance could sound good but the machine is guaranteed any way and if we ' d taken him up we ' d have paid again for it within four years .
neutral	otherwise , good product at good price .
neutral	i am_disabled and live with my daughter . unfortunately , she_lives upstairs , which makes it very difficult for me , as i need both hands to negotiate the stairs .
neutral	it is for this reason i get dog / cat_food delivered to the door .
neutral	i ordered from petflow , and they are fast !
neutral	fedex , however , never delivered it to the apartment .
neutral	they left the whole bundle in the small leasing office and won_'_t come_back and deliver it like they were supposed to .
neutral	i can '_t get the food to the apartment , and the office is blaming me .
neutral	i am beyond angry and frustrated .
neutral	purchased new batteries from festive_lights but both sets of lights still do not work only had them 00 months thought the life would be longer .
neutral	the refill was measured in cubic metres but would have been good to give rough dimensions in metres or mm as was a lot smaller_than_expected .
neutral	i now have to buy another larger one .
neutral	the cars are very over priced with very high mileage .
neutral	i really needed a car and im glad drivetime helped_me .
neutral	the first set of books i ordered came fast , all in good condition , and i was pleased .
neutral	i had ordered another book that bihar forgotten about when i bought my books originally .
neutral	when i received the book , it was the preview for instructors which only has 0 chapters .
neutral	i returned it with no problem and had asked for a replacement .
neutral	the replacement came fast but sent me the same preview book again .
neutral	so finally , i just said to gove my money back because i needed the book in a week .
neutral	now i have to wait to receive the book from another seller when i should have had the correct book over two_weeks_ago !
neutral	the new usa website is constantly out of english breakfast tea and it has_been very frustrating and not at all helpful .
neutral	will use this site again !
neutral	!
neutral	i am looking_forward to receiving my purchase from 00_dollar mall .
neutral	i am now worried that since i am supposed to evaluate the product , that it should have already arrived .
neutral	i gave the review 0_stars because i am hopefully optimistic , as these dresses that i bought of a great price are costumes for an_upcoming play !
neutral	keep your fingers_crossed for me .
neutral	i received my order on time and on trying to replace the head on my toothbrush , i realised i had ordered the wrong brush_heads .
neutral	i emailed molarclean on 00nd june asking for advice and if a refund was available .
neutral	i have yet to receive a reply .
neutral	0 week_later .
neutral	i purchased a rear muffler and a center ( resonator ) muffler for my saab .
neutral	the muffler mostly fit but the tailpipe had to be heated and bent to avoid hitting the rear bumper .
neutral	the resonator wasn_'_t what i expecting .
neutral	it wasn_'_t close to the oem part like in the photo .
neutral	it still fit the car , but didn_'_t reduce the noise as much as the original .
neutral	overall , i was pleased with the outcome from the amount of money i saved .
neutral	the most difficult part was finding a repair_shop that would do the install with supplied parts .
neutral	total amount saved was a minimum of $_000 .
neutral	i enjoyed seeing the sights from the top_deck .
neutral	however , to be honest , our guide was a dud .
neutral	she wasn_'_t funny and very difficult to understand with a thick accent .
neutral	we got off for the boat_tour , mainly hoping to get a better guide .
neutral	the boat_tour took an_hour wait to board .
neutral	it wasn_'_t worth it .
neutral	our next guide was good but too bad we weren_'_t on the bus long after that .
neutral	i thought it was too much money for what we got in the end .
neutral	most of our vitamin & supplement orders arrive within a few_days of placing our order .
neutral	yours took almost 0_weeks !.
neutral	i had a month before returning to my dr . & he wanted to know what i thought of your product .
neutral	because of it taking so long i won_'_t be able to tell him .
neutral	barrington_sports sent me an introductory email_saying that they thought i would like their products and offering me 00_%_off my first order which would not be visible until check out .
neutral	i duly explored their website via the link in the email , agreed that they have a fantastic range of products and ordered some things .
neutral	except for a small discount applied to one bag i did not receive the promised 00_%_off my first order .
neutral	however , i was very happy with all the products .
neutral	would i use them again ?
neutral	yes for quality and speed of delivery of purchased items .
neutral	i would remain cynical about any offer of a discount , including the 0 % one attached to the request to do this review
neutral	while the live tour_guide was interesting and entertaining , there were too many road distractions , building sites and noise to truly get a sense of where we were or what we were looking at while he spoke .
neutral	we rode the entire trip from start to finish and when we got to the knightsbridge stop to shop at harrods we were told the last pickup was going to be at 000 pm .
neutral	why advertise the tour continues to later if that is not true for every stop on the tour ?
neutral	walking through central_london was much more interesting .
neutral	twice out of 0 / 0 purchases items have have failed to arrive .
neutral	i have emailed customer_services department and then no reply or action from them ?
neutral	i will delete wowcher if it doesn_'_t improve and just use groupon .
neutral	a good concept all in all , but needs flowing up .
neutral	couldn_'_t fault the service , arrived_safely and promptly .
neutral	a little disappointed with quality , wood very thin and feels flimsy .
neutral	adequate for their purpose though .
neutral	i found the web_site browser and ordering process easy to use .
neutral	an_additional phone request was completed pleasantly and efficiently .
neutral	i liked being kept_informed of the progress of the order and being_able to choose the delivery day .
neutral	unfortunately the delivery person said he only delivered to commercial premises , didn_'_t have the right equipment to deliver to a domestic address and was not insured to take the items off the pallets which were too tall to go into the garage .
neutral	i am in my 00 '_s and with a young helper took 0 / 0hr to take the items safely into the house never mind unpack them .
neutral	00_mins is certainly not enough .
neutral	i signed to say the items i had ordered had been delivered , not examined .
neutral	sw has a great selection adn decent pricing - this is my first experience with them but since i do a lot of buying of wine over the net , i have a pretty good handle on the process .
neutral	i am concered about shippping though - my order went in on 0 . and i have had not updates or seen my product since then .
neutral	many items were back - ordered due to shortage , but it didn_'_t take too long to receive them .
neutral	prices appeared to be good , however i later found an item i paid $_00 . 00 for cheaper elsewhere for $_00 . 00 .
neutral	since i purchased 0 bottles i overpaid by $_00 !
neutral	i purchased $_00 worth but there was no option to use that amount in the game .
neutral	i was forced to use only part of the money .
neutral	allowing us to purchase an exact amount that works for the game site we use would really help .
neutral	the directions to use ' cash ' simply did not work with the game i was playing as it has set amounts that are not even even dollar amounts .
neutral	the code / password could not be used twice so any change due was lost .
neutral	excellent products and prices , shame if a working girl have to pay £_00 for delivery ,
neutral	i love getting cat_food cans delived to my door and i love the low price but my last two shipments contained damaged_cans .
neutral	four in my last delivery , five in my previous delivery .
neutral	in my last delivery the plasic wrap around the cans had torn so badly the cans were all lying haphazardly in the box .
neutral	i wish there could be some kind of padding put around the cans so they don_'_t get damaged during shipment .
neutral	some cans i received were so badly_damaged , i almost couldn_'_t open the cans .
neutral	i did contact the company via_email and they knew about the problem and said they were addressing it .
neutral	just hope it gets addressed soon .
neutral	i was happy to order from here because the book was much_cheaper_than it would have been at my school_bookstore , but the shipping said it would be 0 - 00 days and it actually took 0_weeks .
neutral	decent service .
neutral	la_commande est_très_bien mais trop d ' attente pour savoir quand recevoir le_colis , on nous dit 0jours d ' autre s dise 0 jours avant l ' envois mais au résultat on ne sais pas quand il nous livre sauf si on passe sont tant a leur téléphoner bonjours la facture de téléphone pour_le numéro 00 .
neutral	i was very impressed with your website but was disappointed when i got an_email_saying that my whole order was processed and shipped and then got an_email_saying that part of my order was out of stock .
neutral	i '_m hoping that by the time my auto shipment is due that my entire order is in stock .
neutral	thanks
neutral	great part suppler - just returns are an act of congress .
neutral	take a hint from " zappo '_s " for great success .
neutral	i '_ve been a member of qvc since before it was even called qvc ( decades ) and it '_s a decent company .
neutral	unfortunately times are changing but q is staying the same - same products and same high shipping prices .
neutral	i rarely order from them now .
neutral	but i will say that 0 out of 00 calls to customer_service were handled fast and with exceptional service .
neutral	but high prices , very high shipping_charges and the same old products ?
neutral	not worth it .
neutral	please unsubscribe me from your e_mail
neutral	i couldn_'_t place the order because i couldn_'_t finish the delivery information when it wouldn_'_t let_me use the zip_code that i provided .
neutral	i then placed the order through fraser bolwell , and things went_smoothly from there .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	i was satisfied with the price but this book took quite a while to get to me .
neutral	i bought this book on a weekend and it took practically two whole weeks to get to my house .
neutral	if you need a book in a hurry do not order from this website .
neutral	easy to order , fast shipment , but the quality of the dresses is not good !
neutral	ordered a white dress and the material was totally cheap and see - through !
neutral	cute ... for a stripper ;)
neutral	the conversation with the agent was pleasant .
neutral	she was helpful and had answers for all my questions .
neutral	the problem was when i followed_up with the storage place they said i didn_'_t have a reservation and had to give all my information again and was charged and admin_fee that i was told would be waived by booking it through them .
neutral	not the end of the world , but frustrating !
neutral	!
neutral	i have tried to get a hold of them and let them know they have sent me the wrong part .
neutral	my purchase was received damaged - the plastic had slid off the picture and it arrived all scratched in one corner and a scrape in the middle of the picture .
neutral	i reported it and am waiting for a replacement .
neutral	although fb allows me to stay in touch with or find old friends , i really don_'_t like the new format .
neutral	i am also seriously concerned with the lack of privacy with which fb treats my info ,
neutral	i find amazon '_s book selection very good and the prices great , particularly if you buy used books .
neutral	most other products can be found cheaper on other_sites .
neutral	the first time i used iflorist it worked like a dream though do think their delivery charges are very high .
neutral	the second time they failed to deliver and it was only when i checked with the intended recipient that i discovered they had not done as i requested and paid for .
neutral	they have subsequently delivered but nearly 0_weeks late for the birth of a baby .
neutral	not much of an_apology nor any offer of upping the flowers to the next size up which i would have thought would have been a nice_gesture so probably_won_'_t use them again .
neutral	i used one of their premier garages to have the tyres_fitted and was given a time_slot .
neutral	i was greeted_by a very efficient lady_who booked my car in but then confirmed that it would take up to 0hrs to fit 0 tyres .
neutral	it actually ended_up taking about 0hr 00mins which is still an incredibly long time .
neutral	if it wasn_'_t for this i would have rated them 0_stars .
neutral	i was prompted to spend over_£_00 which i did with the promise of a free pen .
neutral	this did not arrive .
neutral	when i got my bag of dog_food there was a hole in the box , which_meant a hole in the dog_food bag .
neutral	i don_'_t know how much was lost out of the bag , but i am sure it was just one of those things that happen .
neutral	so i '_ll see how my next order goes .
neutral	good quality product bought on line , but very disappointed that not available at same discounted price in the shop .
neutral	due to the weather my flight had been cancelled .
neutral	i did not receive any notifications through_travelocity letting_me know my flight had been cancelled and found out when i was at the airport window trying to make_sense of everything .
neutral	the only other flight this airline had was in 00hrs .
neutral	so i completely lost a day .
neutral	i called to see if there was anything travelocity could do but nothing was done .
neutral	they asked if i wanted a refund but that wasn_'_t solution i was looking for .
neutral	after about 00mins on the phone the woman on the other end come up with an idea to try to find a flight on a different airline .
neutral	i couldn_'_t get a flight for the amount i had paid so i just had to go back home and wait for my next flight which was scheduled to depart in 00hrs .
neutral	i was extremely disappointed because i lost that entire day .
neutral	i '_ve used travelocity many_times before and had always had updated emails regarding my flight schedules .
neutral	i '_m not sure what happened this time , but nothing was done to better improve my situation .
neutral	to try to rectify the problem , i '_ve replaced my telephone system from v - tech to panasonic and had my internet cables to the house replaced .
neutral	i still have intermittent communication problems while on calls , and sometimes i have no service at all and have to reset the system .
neutral	my brother has the same phone system but has voip through his internet provider , and doesn_'_t have any of these problems , so it '_s not the phone system or the cable .
neutral	we have used the carpark for the last 0 / 0yrs although it is very easy to book we have struggled to actually find a parking space , also the vehicle registration scanner has failed to recognise my number plate on a number of occasions which has caused rather alot of frustration as we have had to contact the reception who have struggled to actually find my booking , however i have had the sense to actually take all relevant_paperwork and booking details
neutral	this is the second time i '_ve ordered from geek auto_parts .
neutral	easy to order your part , easy paying , prompt with tracking_number .
neutral	the weather in the north_east put my package at a 00 day delivery .
neutral	in the future i will order when the weather is normal .
neutral	i used to love petsmart but now , it is too expensive .
neutral	i can '_t afford to buy here , i am going to try amazon
neutral	thanks for making my life better ; i like me car
neutral	i got a lot of stuff at macys for not much .. really cool .
neutral	i wish they sold sandwiches .
neutral	the buttons that i ordered turned_out exactly how i expected and looked great .
neutral	my only_negative_comment is that there was no place to calculate shipping based on timeframe and therefore i was surprised by such a high cost to ship in under 00 days .
neutral	this cost had not been anticipated when we quoted our client , so will have to eat that cost .
neutral	so my comment to a friend would be " the buttons might be affordable , but the shipping is not !"
neutral	we actually received the buttons earlier_than we were told , so at_least that was good .
neutral	hit a few glitches .
neutral	overall , the experience was okay , and they did finally get the visa prepared .
neutral	i found this web_site that sells parts , my mechanic saids buy the parts here and you will save_money !!
neutral	so i did . he has put some of he parts on and we are waiting for some other parts . only wish that the parts could get delivered all at the same time . seens they come from different wherehouses . also they send a wrong part , it does not fit , so i have to wait 00 - 00_hours . i am waiting . so my car is sitting at the mechanic '_s shop . i have been waiting 0 + days for a person to say it '_s ok to send the part back !. so the parts are priced right but the service is " so - so ". just think if you had to wait for exchanges at those big box retail_stores !
neutral	!
neutral	my antihistamines arrived really quickly and were well_packaged .
neutral	but ...
neutral	i only take half a tablet a day and they will have passed their use - by date long before i get to the end of them .
neutral	i was sure i ' d read ( maybe on the site or on martin '_s money tips where i found this ) that they guaranteed a use - by date of the end of the year but mine will be up at the end of july .
neutral	if i order again , and i '_m not sure i will , i '_ll have to order fewer so by the time i '_ve paid the postage there '_s no advantage to be gained .
neutral	shame as otherwise i ' d have rated them 0_star .
neutral	fast delivery , good price and great product
neutral	some of the items i ordered were great a sink that seems good as not come out of box yet and a tap which is lovely quality also nice toilet_seat .
neutral	ordered a sink unit but badly_damaged on delivery , corner crushed , and not put_together properly , back strut loose and not pushed in each side , door misaligned etc .
neutral	in my opinion packaging was insufficient , could have been better protected .
neutral	box was bit crushed and damaged could have been stronger and just some polystyrene on corners but still had bad damage on one corner and then just thin plastic_bag .
neutral	more care needs to be taken with assembly of items and better packaged .
neutral	very dissapointed and inconvenienced .
neutral	did not open the box till late and was delivered today so will be ringing up tomorrow and hope that i can get a replacement quickly without_fuss as the items arnt cheap , it '_s really not good enough .
neutral	good but inconsistent with two orders .
neutral	i '_ve ordered from them before and it '_s always been good , but this time , not good .
neutral	it '_s going to be a full 0_weeks from the time i placed my order ( 0 product ) until it arrives , and i find that unacceptable .
neutral	i purchased two games from shopto . net , one from their ebay website and the other on the shopto . net website , just after midnight .
neutral	when i checked their e_- bay website the following_morning the 0nd game was now on their e_- bay website selling for £ 0 . 00 cheaper_than on the shopto . net website .
neutral	i did telephone the company and ask if they could refund me the difference but were unable to do so ..
neutral	both games arrived at the same time 0 days_later .
neutral	they were still good value for money .
neutral	the moral is check their website and their website on e_- bay before you make a purchase .
neutral	you already do an automatic debit in my bank_account i don_'_t see any reason_why you have to call , text , and email .
neutral	i find it overly exaggerating one reminder is enough it '_s kinda irritating
neutral	i '_ve been a big_fan of aveda for many years , however , i '_ve become much more wary of the company since it was bought by estee lauder .
neutral	while the marketing of the company extolls its commitment to health and environment , not all of the products follow suit .
neutral	recently , i threw away around $_000 in hair product because they contained harmful chemicals like alcohol , parabens and sulfates .
neutral	tyckte om hemsidan och att produkten
neutral	kom fram i tid .
neutral	som utlandssvensk tyckte jag
neutral	inte om att man bara kan handla med nordiskt
neutral	kort .
neutral	i framtiden kommer jag ju pga detta handla på_en sida som låter en använda
neutral	ett utländskt kort .
neutral	this company you get the good fast , but if require to return charge you 0 . 00 a lot and it is knocked off credit for returning the courier company they use is dpd they don_'_t provide a great service even if you pay to upgrade , but if you are looking for something and perhaps seen it in shops most_likely be cheaper on atlantic_shopping so it would be good site to use
neutral	i have used boohoo many time always been very happy with the iterms ordered and the customer_service , untill i ordered a bag the was slashed right across the bottom , i sent it back over 0_weeks_ago and have not heard a thing , i have wrote a letter and sent a email still nothing , no refund no sorry no nothing , at a loss now as to what to do .
neutral	it seems they are good untill you hit a problem , then there customer_service goes out the ewindow , a phone_number would be great !
neutral	overall i am very pleased with the service .
neutral	your pricing is higher_than what you can purchase it for in the stores , then you add the shipping on top of that .
neutral	my main concern is the last two shipments have had a large amount of ants in the box .
neutral	the dog_food bag is ok , but the box is full of ants .
neutral	i didnt notice the first time and i had set the box down in the front hall way for a few_days .
neutral	ants were everywhere !!!!
neutral	the last shipment i opened the box outside and once again a ton of ants .
neutral	i am not sure if these are getting in there from the fed_ex truck or what but it is not good ....
neutral	we purchased the big_bus_tour for hong_kong online .
neutral	it was very difficult to figure_out the exact location for some of the stops .
neutral	especially because the map online is not to scale .
neutral	knowing just the street name isn_'_t enough .
neutral	we noticed another competitor had signs so at_least you knew if you were in the right spot to be picked_up .
neutral	in any case , we spent way too much time the first morning finding a pick_up spot .
neutral	we also waited longer_than 00_minutes for a bus to finally come by .
neutral	once on the bus though the rest of the experience went much_better and we were happy with the value .
neutral	your website was easy to follow , each card seemed to be correct ; however charging me $ 0 . 00 each for a total of $_00 . 00 for shipping and handling and making me wait 0 - 00 business days seems a big expensive .
neutral	you could have mailed all of them in a small flat_rate box for 0 . 00 and i would have had them in 0 or 0 days .
neutral	it is now 00 / 00 and to my knowledge they are no where to be found .
neutral	could you have given me a tracking_#.
neutral	every postal package is supposed to have one .
neutral	other than that , which to me is a big deal , i guess i '_m happy .
neutral	i '_ll let you know if i ever receive the package .
neutral	the car was fine for normal travel , but considering that we were in an area that got snow off and on , it wasn_'_t really suited for those driving conditions .
neutral	and , since i don_'_t live in scotland , i didn_'_t realize ( until it was too late ) that this car really had no business in the highlands in snow !
neutral	we have shown up multiple_times and days in a row and there were no carts available .
neutral	we could have waited for one to become available but we were on a tight_schedule .
neutral	i feel more carts should be there so we don_'_t have to waste time showing up and not being_able to unload .
neutral	other than that , the workers there have been very nice and helpful !
neutral	did anyone use them for tickets for tomorrowland ….
neutral	did it work ?
neutral	thanks any information is helpful .
neutral	i didn_'_t even get my money back after one of your operatives made a big dent in a small grill / oven l that i despatched .
neutral	it wasn_'_t any larger than a toaster !
neutral	the item had to be thrown in the bin and i had to refund the cost to the buyer too so i '_m pretty upset about the incident .
neutral	( order 0000000 ‏‏).
neutral	up till then i had always been happy with interparcel '_s service .
neutral	we did have to wait for about 00minutes upon_arrival for the car to be picked_up and it wasn_'_t very clear where we had to go when we were inside the car_park .
neutral	we had to make a call to the lady , who i did find hard to understand to ask where we should wait .
neutral	but the most disappointing part was after we picked the car up , we drove to the barrier and we could not exit - we were not told by your company that we should pay £ 0 on departure .
neutral	we assumed as we have done at birminham airport before that you would get a ticket to put into the barrier machine .... the man did not say anything to us when dropping_off the car .
neutral	so we had to repark the car to try and find £ 0 .
neutral	as you can imagine after being on holiday we only ha euro '_s on us .
neutral	this part of the service most definitely needs to iumproved - you should state that you will need £ 0 for exiting the car_park .
neutral	even better service will be that you provide customers with a ticket to exit - as other aiports do .
neutral	but i paid for express delivery and i just got it on this past mon .
neutral	when i order it on aug 00th .
neutral	the shipment was suppose to arrive for 0 - 0 days .
neutral	way over due .
neutral	we visited paris in march and december of 0000 .
neutral	i bought paris pass for the march visit and , although it was helpful for certain places , it did not help us when visiting versailles and the opera garnier ( even_though the website indicated you could gain access to these venues with the pass ).
neutral	the guard at versailles rather rudely said they did not accept the pass .
neutral	like everyone else ( even pre_- ticket holders ) we had to wait in line for about an_hour .
neutral	the line was much longer in december than in march .
neutral	although there was not a long wait at the opera garnier , the staff_member there said they did not accept the pass .
neutral	also , if you are arranging any special tours or private tours , their own tour_guides have access that allows you to skip many of the long lines .
neutral	these companies charge you for the tour which includes access to the museums ( like the louvre ), so it doesn_'_t make_sense to buy the pass .
neutral	just ordered a photo clock , got two vouchers from groupon .
neutral	ordered first easily , but wouldn_'_t allow 0nd .
neutral	emailed for help , four days_later still no reply .
neutral	i phoned yesterday and then it was sorted quickly and efficiently .
neutral	quality of the clock is much_better_than i envisioned .
neutral	really nice , classy looking clock face .
neutral	makes a wonderful gift .
neutral	easy to use website , the photo can be adjusted to get the best look .
neutral	i think it only took four days to be delivered , maybe even less ?
neutral	would most definitely recommend .
neutral	but advise to phone if you have any_problems .
neutral	i was concerned when i booked through_argus & found out the vehicle was through easirent .
neutral	i was met at stansted at_0am .
neutral	minuses - the rep had a head cold so it was hard to understand what was being said .
neutral	if i wanted to be out of the airport car_park and i only wanted to pay uk 0 . 00 for 00mins parking fee then all the paperwork needed to be rushed .
neutral	the inspection revealed missing - 0 outside rear_passenger door_handle , missing - 0 complete fog_light & the car had not been detailed inside .
neutral	the pluses made up for initial concerns - the rep drove me to the return point at a mcdonalds near the airport ( i would have got lost otherwise ).
neutral	after i returned the car i was driven back to the airport .
neutral	the car was 0 classes higher_than i had booked and was very comfortable .
neutral	due to the condition of the car i was not worried_about damage all the time .
neutral	easirent staff were polite & friendly .
neutral	the hire cost was well within my budget .
neutral	if you were not status concious about the condition of your car , i would definitely recomment them .
neutral	the shipping time is way too long .
neutral	good prices , but over a week to receive items is not good .
neutral	if it were not for the quality product i would not purchase .
neutral	customer_service is difficult at best .
neutral	restocking_fee when product does not fit !
neutral	that is ridiculous
neutral	website has no option for other than standard ground delivery .
neutral	no overnight it product needed immediately .
neutral	associated stores should give them more product more variety yourself .
neutral	most stores are limited in what they have to offer making going to website more important .
neutral	yet the customer_service working directly with your company is difficult .
neutral	little phone service when attempting to contact directly .
neutral	when i have gotten someone i get a lot of i don_'_t know .
neutral	email reply was also slow and a bit rough .
neutral	finally , sizing_charts need work .
neutral	according to you horse blanket chart , my horse needed a 00 .
neutral	when i received the blanket ... way too big .
neutral	delivery is slow .
neutral	took over a week on separate_occasions .
neutral	so as i stated in the initial subject_line if it were not for the quality of your products i would purchase elsewhere , at_least in the usa .
neutral	loved the product , very good quality , unfortunately 0 of the same items arrived ( which i do not remember ordering !
neutral	), it meant i had to send one back at my cost ( circa £_00 . 00 !!)
neutral	and am awaiting a refund , so somewhat inconvenient .
neutral	that said , the product itself is lovely .
neutral	unfortunately the liquid soap i ordered arrived with the dispenser broken and it leaked into the bag .
neutral	otherwise , love that the shipping was free and it arrived at my home rather quickly .
neutral	this was my first experience ordering from amiclub , and i '_m yet to decide if ill ever order there again .
neutral	my initial order which was a pair of tan faux suede boots ..
neutral	when tracked , it said that it was delivered .
neutral	i '_m yet to see it .
neutral	i called and jurissa created an account for me which she provided store credit and spoke to me about filing a claim .
neutral	i had to call back the next_day , not any fault ofjarissa .
neutral	i then dealt_with yadira , who walked me through setting_up a claim and explaining the process .
neutral	i ordered the boots again , because i truly needed these boots as i was leaving the country two_weeks_later .
neutral	i really needed it .
neutral	anyhow , i got the boots this time , but apart_from it being way too small , all around the seams of the boots the fabric was shredding .
neutral	it was as if it was worn before .
neutral	i called again cause now i was 0 days away from leaving the country and really needed it .. jurissa once again stepped in and helped_me place the order for a size_bigger along with credit .
neutral	she also got them to ship it super_fast .. soooo , i hope this one comes in great condition and before i actually jump on a plane ..
neutral	i was so pleased with both jurissa and yadira '_s service that i couldn_'_t even wait to receive the product .
neutral	these ladies , especially jurissa needs to be commended for their awesome service , and obvious demonstration of their passion for a happy and satisfied customer .. wish the world had more people like these two ladies .
neutral	here is to hoping the boots come soon , and in good condition ..
neutral	fast shipper , good communication on order status and i loved that .
neutral	product description was off on the skull lantern .... my skull lantern did not change colors and the light was continuiously white and strobed which i hate .
neutral	i did not expect the cartridges to be refilled / reused .
neutral	i have not had the opportunity to use one just yet .
neutral	i just hope they will work well in our printers .
neutral	i never received shipping confirmation as stated in the sales invoice email ... exact text was " you will receive an e_- mail confirming shipment .
neutral	this usually takes 0 - 0 business days . "
neutral	that never happened .
neutral	was a little annoyed that i placed the order on the 0th , you got your money on the 00th and the order did not ship til the 00th .
neutral	you should ship the day you get the money which is the law in wisconsin .
neutral	should get my stuff tomorrow .
neutral	hopefully no more issues .
neutral	had to exchange an item as it was too small .
neutral	has_been easy process .
neutral	the only_thing would be i had to pay to post my parcel back .
neutral	and delivery has_been but slow .
neutral	brill price but when enquire_about why my delivery was taking so long .
neutral	as i needed it in time for valentines_day .
neutral	i felt the customer_service reply was rude .
neutral	hello - originally , i asked for delivery on saturday_morning , but the flowers weren_'_t delivered until monday_evening .
neutral	the local delivery person originally told me that he could not find the address as the name of the street had changed ( it hadn_'_t ...).
neutral	finally , the flowers were delivered on monday at about 00 : 00 ....
neutral	also , i had orginally ordered gerberas .
neutral	i got a message_saying that gerberas weren_'_t available but i never found out what was sent , which was a bit frustrating ... i would have liked to know what was sent !
neutral	i have so_far received two shipments from pet_flow .
neutral	i love the idea of the service , and they have provided the dog_food i ordered right on time , at a great price with free_shipping .
neutral	however , i ordered cat_food with both shipments , several weeks before i needed it , and neither shipment included the cat_food , with no_explanation of when to expect it .
neutral	it showed_up about two_weeks_later .
neutral	i had hoped to avoid an extra trip to petsmart , but without my cat_food , i had to go get some so that i didn_'_t run_out .
neutral	i hope future experiences are more positive .
neutral	hrs is very comparable to other hotel booking platforms in terms of information delivered .
neutral	but the format is less sleek and seems old - fashioned .
neutral	the map is definitely worse ( in times of google_maps being the major map provider , it is cumbersome to use a differnt map style ).
neutral	it also seems that hrs has less hotel_rooms ( i sometimes compare and still find a room available on another site ).
neutral	hrs really badly needs a design overhaul , but for information and offers it is ok .
neutral	i have been a client of monika '_s for many years .
neutral	when i did my taxes this past_year i now have a domestic partner and knew monika could help me with all options we might have .
neutral	the way she came_across during our appointment was a little disconcerting .
neutral	i felt she was confused about all our options and in the end several issues arose .
neutral	in conclusion , upon_completion of our appointment our papers were filed .
neutral	then amended and refiled .
neutral	i would like to return as a client because i have been happy with your services for many years and my children go to monika as well .
neutral	i just don_'_t know if blm is well_versed in all the rights for same sex marriage .
neutral	the parts are perfect , but i already sent the company 0 emails , detailing we did not received the complete order , 0 rear door_handles were missing , and nobody contacted me so_far .
neutral	after_seeing some of the nice knitwear on the boohoo website , my daughter and i ordered quite a few items , the sizing is odd , we are both a size 00 so ordered m / l , which according to their size_chart was the correct size .
neutral	when the order arrived the stuff was massive and all had to be returned .
neutral	returning the items was easy enough , but once they receive them back 00 days for a refund is unacceptable .
neutral	it '_s a real_shame because everything we ordered was really nice and had the size been ok we would have kept everything .
neutral	you cannot call them which is very annoying , email_enquiries only !
neutral	the parcel arrived a day after the latest date they gave_us and we waited in all day when the courier dx said it was out for delivery , it never arrived so we called dx , after waiting for 00_mins for them to answer at a chargeable rate , they said they never got round to delivering to us !
neutral	to be fair to bohoo , they did refund the delivery charge .
neutral	all in all , great clothing at a reasonable price , but a long wait for a refund if you have to return anything .
neutral	i ordered 00 x 00 x 0 filters for my trane .
neutral	the 00 turned_out to be more like 00 . 000 , but a gentle bend in the middle of the filter made it fit .
neutral	you can make yourself crazy trying to get something that fits_perfectly , or you can just go with it .
neutral	ah , sanity .
neutral	de får 0_stjerner , pga .
neutral	deres gode_priser , og_gode indpakning .
neutral	dog bestilte jeg min bog en lørdag og_fik den først lørdagen efter , det burde nu kunne klares bedre .
neutral	ellers levede alt op_til forventnigerne :)
neutral	i ordered from here due to the fact that i could no get the drop i needed anywhere so it is great that these were made to measure .
neutral	however mine were 0 inch to short and not quite sure they were doubled as requested .
neutral	also i paid for next_day delivery ( after 0pm on friday ) so i expected them on the monday but didn_'_t arrive until tuesday and even then the delivery company used refused leave his van and bring them up to my property !
neutral	overall good quality nets and easy to use website .
neutral	i just made my first order from supplementwarehouse , i found the prices to be a good deal .
neutral	but since i am_currently deployed to afghanistan , the shipping was very expensive .
neutral	so i am not 000_% sold on the idea that i got a good deal , because other_places like vitacost or gnc will ship here for a very low_cost or even free .
neutral	so when those sites run their discounts or deals , i can get my items at a better price with them .
neutral	i will write back after i receive my items with an update on the quality and service .
neutral	v / r ,

neutral	i purchased a groupon coupon for $_00 . 00 .
neutral	i was unable to redeem this entirely at check out .
neutral	i called the customer_service rep who then took off the shipping charge .
neutral	ok .
neutral	so now the discount is $_00 . 00 still not $_00 . 00 and i had to call and make a fuss .
neutral	perhaps their site was not set_up correctly .... or was this intentional .
neutral	hmmmm .
neutral	otherwise , i was pleased with their product selection and their timely delivery .
neutral	attempted to order via the website over three_days but unable to get my payment to go through .
neutral	rang twice and got no answer but after leaving a message was called back quite quickly .
neutral	the lady_who took my order was very helpful and confirmed all the details of the order to me , however these were evidently not passed on in full to the supplier as i specifically requested a 0 wheel vehicle as we have restricted access at our property .
neutral	unfortunately a normal 0 wheel tanker was sent which caused unnecessary hassle but thankfully it had a long enough hose on to be able to complete the delivery from the front of the house , just !
neutral	well my box was not taped up well my watch was broken a whole box of clothes and scarves were missing .
neutral	only received one boot of one boot no match and another boot with no match .
neutral	i was really sad because i was so excited getting those deals and so many pretty things i had bought other things to make a complete outfit then .
neutral	i was not able to replace the most wanted items and no $_00 plus savings like before had to pay more for the replacement items which i feel was so unfair .
neutral	this was the first time i ever bought from 00_dollar mall and it was a very big order .
neutral	i would not even use usps to deliver because they also did a poor job .
neutral	so where did my order go my discounts and my savings ?
neutral	i think i should be given a credit to make up for the difference i had to pay and i even ended_up paying more when i tried to replace things .
neutral	not very happy with the out come and i am still having to wait and see if i receive this new order or not .
neutral	very sad .
neutral	please ask them to credit me more for the loss i endured .
neutral	at_least the difference in what i paid for the new order verses what i paid for the old .
neutral	thank_you very much !
neutral	please ask them to tape this box extremely good .
neutral	thanks !
neutral	the site looks good is easy to navigate to find what you want .
neutral	the main challenges i encountered were :
neutral	- no e_- ticketing / the need for a uk address : i am not sure why tickets be sent to to a physical_address .
neutral	isn_'_t e_- ticketing an option ?
neutral	perhaps , this is the case just for the trains i was booking ... also , if tickets do need to be sent to an address it would be good to send them further than just the uk .
neutral	fortunately in my case , i could send the tickets to a cousin .
neutral	however , that would exclude quite a number of people .
neutral	- security features - great , although my main visa credit_card from nz was not accepted because of a extra security feature i think , that is not used in my country .
neutral	i then had to go and re - do my entire booking and try and alternative visa_debit_card .
neutral	i purchased the versaille toille bedspread and delighted with the feel , design and quality .
neutral	wanting to decorate my guest bedroom decided to go online to the forever england website where i ordered the matching fabric to make curtains , wher i was delighted to see advertised as good for curtains and cushions , purfect .
neutral	however the fabric has arrived and i am quite disappointed to find how thin it is and nothing like quality of the bedspread .
neutral	i will have to add weights to the bottom just for them tomhang right and not what i was expecting to do .
neutral	the first time i ordered from petflow , the bully_sticks were individually_wrapped , and then sealed in a nice ziplock type bag .
neutral	the next 0 times , the bully_sticks were sent in a sealed bag , ( not resealable ).
neutral	this would be ok except that they smell awful ; i would immediately take them out of that and put in a ziplock type bag , ( both to keep them fresh and keep the smell from permeating my house .)
neutral	the box i received yesterday was a mess .
neutral	it was a huge box , ( way bigger_than necessary ), and everything was thrown in .
neutral	each bully_stick , ( all 00 ), had a label on it , but nothing else .
neutral	no wrapping , nothing , and they were thrown around that huge box .
neutral	( it '_s a very good thing that the delivery man didn_'_t get attacked by all the neighborhood dogs with the bully_stick smell emanating from that box !)
neutral	at any rate , the packaging has gone from great to pretty_much awful in the course of maybe 0 months or so .
neutral	received wrong part .
neutral	postage too costly to return part .
neutral	what '_s this ?
neutral	footwear must include the original shoebox in its original condition , without postal labels .
neutral	shoebox fees are charged when footwear is returned in a damaged shoebox , or without the original shoebox .???
neutral	fs are sent in foilowym the sack and the shoe box which easily is surrendering to damaging in the parcel .
neutral	if you require the undamaged box pack shoes into the additional carton
neutral	i purchased my ticket online taking_advantage of the discount .
neutral	however , i was traveling and without access to a printer .
neutral	i saved my tickets on my ipad and they could have easily been scanned by the machines at the bus_stops .
neutral	i did not read anywhere on the website that the tickets had to be printed out .
neutral	when i got to london , first it was hard to locate the big_bus_tours then when i found the stop ( thanks to an employee of one of the competitor companies ), was told i needed the tickets printed out .
neutral	i had to then find an internet cafe to print out the ticket and return to the bus_stop so i could start my tour .
neutral	my time in london was limited so this was a frustrating way to start .
neutral	once i was on the bus , it was a very nice tour .
neutral	i loved the commentary and it was a great way to see the major sites in a short_amount of time .
neutral	it was also wonderful that the river_cruise was included in the ticket price .
neutral	overall , nice experience but directions on how to find a location from the airport would be helpful as well as the option to scan the ticket from a mobile_device .
neutral	i '_m a shoe fanatic , so i '_m always looking for fabulous shoes with great quality , but for a price that wouldn_'_t hurt my wallet at all .
neutral	00_dollar mall is my new one stop_shop so that i can ball on a budget !!!
neutral	everything is $_00 or under .
neutral	there is no possible way that you can beat that .
neutral	original collection didn_'_t happen . but once collected , money transfer was quick .
neutral	it took three_times to finally place the order .
neutral	please mark a field as required , if it is .
neutral	i won_'_t be back as there are just too many charges .
neutral	well , i must_say i ordered my dress from plussizebridal because they had a cheaper price than other_websites .
neutral	the one thing that i didn_'_t like was that i was charged an extra $_00 . 00 for a rush_cut in which_meant that i would recieve my dress within eight_weeks and i didn_'_t .
neutral	i ordered my dress august 0th and did not ship until october_00th .
neutral	although i was told that the designer was behind in production .
neutral	as a consumer i didn_'_t think that i should have been charged that $_00 . 00 rush_cut if i wasn_'_t going to recieve my dress during the eight_weeks it was promised .
neutral	all and all , please be patient and order your dress well ahead so that you won_'_t have to worry like me .
neutral	gold envelopes were more a yellow pearlescent colour .
neutral	envelopes were translucent so text was visible through both_sides and the sides of teh envelopes started to peel away as not stuck together very well
neutral	can be frustrating and a bit scary to have a face book - i keep mine very private - not really my thing i guess
neutral	i seem to find the same clothes and ect ; for much less on another website .
neutral	ordered a new jacket on the basis of a 00 - 00 hr despatch .
neutral	had to ring to chase & was then sent a day later than promised as not actually in stock .
neutral	phones not always answered which is annoying .
neutral	item finally arrived , well_packaged & no_issues with it .
neutral	my photo book was damaged in the corners from lack of packaging a bit of bubble rap would not go a miss .
neutral	also the photos were not as sharp as in other books that i have had in the past on some photos the couler blue was all wrong all in all i was very disaponted with the photo book and i will not be useing jesops photos again
neutral	really quick delivery , however plastic packaging surrounding play mat was greasy with oil !
neutral	no outer package ripped so must have been from warehouse .
neutral	not good for bringing into the home of a new born .
neutral	i thought i was reserving a room with a credit_card as i have done many_times ; however , the room was immediately charged to my card .
neutral	that was not what i expected .
neutral	make that clear up front that i am not reserving -- i am paying !
neutral	!
neutral	these dame people come to my back door through my garden past my washing all because they were too lazy to find front_door ( down_side of house ) just watch the delivery notes do not make any difference
neutral	i ordered several items and received my order within the shipping time frames .
neutral	i ordered a " statement necklace " and was most excited about that but it arrived missing a stone ... so i unfortunately get to see what the experience with returns is like .
neutral	i appreciate the sizing information and am pleased that out of roughly 00 items , only one doesn_'_t fit and that is awesome since my closet has several sizes represented based_upon brand and style .
neutral	my three star_rating is due to the fact that on my first ever order i have to return something .
neutral	i will order again though , probably just not jewelry as i really do not like to return things .
neutral	we ordered two photo cups , but sadly the pictures on the mug were very orange , which was a shame and it spoilt them .
neutral	france rental great .
neutral	england ... given big vauxall deisel gusler .......... ran_out of standard cars ......... will not accept again that was national
neutral	from auto_europe requested gps .
neutral	faulty one sent very low volume voice .. could not hear instructions while driving and out of date .
neutral	no response to my complaint .
neutral	i appreciate that espares dispatched the item quickly but charge too much postage & packing for 0nd_class post .
neutral	most places would have had my item delivered the next_day .
neutral	other than that , the price of the actual item was fair .
neutral	i appreciated being_able to browse and compare many storage_facilities , their unit sizes , and prices .
neutral	however , when i clicked one discount , it was not communicated to the storage place or associated with my reservation .
neutral	that complicated the check - in process .
neutral	overall , though , i am grateful for the service and the reminders !
neutral	i will comment after cores are return and deposit is return .
neutral	i love when i can call and speak to someone if i have a problem .
neutral	i actually have someone_who need some parts ,
neutral	on making my credit_card payment online i did not receive a receipt immediately and on telephoning stressfree_parking i still did not feel_confident although i was assured everything was ok .
neutral	i then received an_email with just a mobile_phone_number and again i telephoned sfp and was told the confirmation_email had been sent again and i then received the full booking confirming .
neutral	i '_m sure everything will be fine on the day !
neutral	the blue ink dripprd out when the cap was removed .
neutral	i will open over the sink in the future .
neutral	one of our group did not have private health insurance .
neutral	we could not book a full group and avail of our discount .
neutral	summer was the name of girl that helped_us .
neutral	she was great !
neutral	confirmation of airline_tickets was not emailed to me until i called and spoke with an agent .
neutral	later i had password troubles so i had to call for reset .
neutral	agent told me i had to use the user name he set for me that was 00 - 00 characters long but when i went to log in the system wanted my email as the user name ( which was fine but not consistent with the instructions i had been given by the agent .
neutral	i '_ve booked two vacations on travelocity '_s website .
neutral	the price is always a good deal .
neutral	i have travel_agent experience , but now retired , so i am knowledgeable about features , benefits , pricing , and good customer_service .
neutral	if you do not want to make any adjustments to your reservation , once booked and paid for , then travelocity is the place .
neutral	unfortunately customer_service is not their strong suit .
neutral	hours on the phone , where few reps understand you .
neutral	calls mysteriously dropped .
neutral	inability or inexperience with revising your reservation or making adjustments .
neutral	i cancelled a one way transfer before i departed on my trip and still no refund is reflected on my credit_card statement .
neutral	if only their service was as good as their pricing .
neutral	i have been greated appropiately but would have had faster action
neutral	i love the bottles i received , i want to place a large order ..
neutral	but i '_m hesitant with their shipping_costs being so high
neutral	jill was friendly , helpful and efficient at getting my space for me .
neutral	i especially loved the huge freight elevators and handy dolly carts for my boxes and furniture .
neutral	space was clean and well_lit .
neutral	the process of purshasing online and paying online went very smoothly .
neutral	however , when i tried to follow_up on delivery no tracking_number was loaded on the website for some time .
neutral	then i was contacted by the courier service and told to first pay another amount for imort taxes - which was never mentioned anywhere to me .
neutral	although it was a small_amount i was uncomfortable by the surprise of additional_charges .
neutral	my first order was for myself and no_problems whatsoever - i highly_recommended globaleyeglasses to all my family and friends .
neutral	the second order i placed was for my boyfriend ( same address ) and everything went_smoothly until his glasses came and he cannot even see out of them !
neutral	they didn_'_t email me to get a copy of his prescription as they did the first time with my order , so i assume his glasses are the prescription of the glasses i ordered previously , even_though they are mens glasses and clearly state they are for him .
neutral	i '_m not sure what i am going to do at this point .
neutral	it took much too long for this company to get the cards in the mail !
neutral	they said one business day and i paid_extra to have them shipped quicker and it still took them like three or four days to get them out .
neutral	the flowers were not delivered on the requested date , and no information was given at the time of purchase that the tulips were not available .
neutral	so the product purchased , as well as the specifics of delivery were not granted .
neutral	however , the flower_arrangement was ' upgraded ' and day after delivery was promised .
neutral	over all , i might give this company another chance in the future , but i was dissapointed as
neutral	- the type of flowers i ordered was infact not available | ( and i would not have been informed of this if i had not sent an_email showing the knowledge that the delivery failed )
neutral	- and obviously i was dissapointed because the birthday flowers were not delivered on the birthday , which of coarse was the main_reason for purchase .
neutral	the came quickly and were nice .
neutral	would love to have them a little darker , but this will have to do .
neutral	of the two things i ordered , both had boxes that were opened , and one was missing parts .
neutral	since i installed before noticing the missing part ( shock damper that i realized was on the other side after i got to it ) your return_policy exempts me from returning and i will have to go through the trouble of making it right , which will be costly and time_consuming .
neutral	i suggest you establish more trust with your subcontractors .
neutral	this is going to cost me a lot of time and money to do over again .
neutral	the brakes that i ordered will be returned - my mistake , not yours , however , the box was opened on that also , and i fear i will have to eat that too , in which case i will have no choice but to use another company in the future .
neutral	can '_t use the portal for check - in .
neutral	seriously .....!
neutral	if you ' re using american & usair , be prepared for some potential visits to both sites to accomplish the basics .
neutral	i stopped by last friday to change the amount of my insurance and was told i needed to come_back on tuesday july 0st .
neutral	i asked how late the office was open i was told
neutral	0 : 00_pm .
neutral	on july 0st , i arrived at 0 : 00_pm the place was locked and there was no note to indicate when and if someone would be returning .
neutral	i plan to stop by this afternoon and hope that someone will be there and i can make the change in the rate of my
neutral	insurance that needs to be done ..
neutral	i wish i had known when i ordered the product the first time that the shipping mist be the same as billing_address .
neutral	this is causing a delay for me .
neutral	also , i need email_updates on the status of my shipment .
neutral	staff is great but it '_s so stuffy in my office i actually arrange my meetings early mornings so my clients and i don_'_t suffocate .
neutral	sure , there is a team to come in and check but the fact remains it '_s stifling in the office .
neutral	i can '_t work in it .
neutral	i still work at home primarily and it is making me rethink .
neutral	first , there was a mistake on number of beds ?
neutral	after someone fixed it , the person messed_up my itinerary by removing the trip protection from my itinerary then i have to called back again but they could not fix .
neutral	they just send me a confirmation that i did purchased a trip insurance but i wanted my itinerary fixed so i just print out one itinerary instead of 0 .
neutral	i found it inconvenience .
neutral	i thought i order my stethoscope with my name_engraved on it .
neutral	and when it showed_up at mydoor there was no name on it .
neutral	iphone now works_perfectly !
neutral	two book rental .
neutral	one book was in great condition , the other not so much .
neutral	i have been on a call for over an_hour due to double charge of our ( 0 ) travel_insurance policies .
neutral	and
neutral	cannot printout the airport transfer vouchers or travel_insurance voucher .
neutral	disgusted with tamika .
neutral	after one - half_hour asked for supervisor and am still on hold over one hour without ever getting to speak to a supervisor .
neutral	i like wowcher because you can get some really good bargains and i also find new things i did not know about but my latest buy has not arrived yet and i am not sure who to contact or how long to leave it .
neutral	i loved the special that you ran and the prices and availability was great .
neutral	shipping was a little high for a smaller order like mine and shipping was stated as 0 - 0 days .
neutral	it has_been 00 days and i still do not have my products .
neutral	really hope they arrive today .
neutral	it took a long time for the bag to be sent , which jeopardised the amount i was to be paid .
neutral	however , once i informed envirophone that it had not arrived they were happy to hold the price for me .
neutral	once i sent the phone the process was fast and efficient and i received my cheque quickly .
neutral	finding and using sparefoot was a simple , easy process .
neutral	the selection of facilities , comprehensive .
neutral	they lost stars when it came to facility details - have and have nots .
neutral	it wasn_'_t clear if the facility had climate_control , were semi_- truck accessible , interior lighting within units , the fine_print behind the discounts ( only for 0 months ).
neutral	when i called for clarification , they immediately tried to sell me a more_expensive unit before clearly answering my simple yes or no question .
neutral	pictures of the actual units would be helpful as well , especially as i was moving from another_state and renting sight_unseen .
neutral	i would recommend it for the ease of finding rental facilities but would make_sure to do better or follow - up research before renting .
neutral	i looking_forward in having another business with you
neutral	great to find out wranger '_s has relaxed fit jeans with a 00 inch inseam .
neutral	my husband was thrilled .
neutral	i was shocked however to see the jeans stuffed in the priority shipping box without_any covering .
neutral	no plastic_bag , no tissue_paper , nothing .
neutral	thankfully the shipping box didn_'_t get wet .
neutral	i ordered two dog " lights ."
neutral	the product is great , however both came with dead batteries - will have to buy new ones before i can actually start using them .
neutral	impressed with despatch times and prices but delivery company is a bit off the mark .
neutral	they insist on a signature and have a section on the email_asking if you would like to deliver to a neighbour , yet when you fill that in and send it , they still deliver to your own house .
neutral	first order arrived a week after first delivery attempt despite phone_calls and attempts to get a redelivery at a more convenient time .
neutral	ordering through rental_cars was a frustrating and stressful experience .
neutral	after giving my credit_card details my order was not confirmed ........
neutral	the emails just kept delayong the confirmation every two hours - which was very stressful - even after ringing .......
neutral	i was assured that the confirmation would be given when the type of car could be confirmed that i had ordered .......
neutral	in the end although i had the confirmation - i never received the car i reserved - and got a very old car which was very basic .......
neutral	i do feel that i was misled into the car i would get as this company does not even have mitsubishi cars to hire ......
neutral	i did object also to be charged 00 . 00_euros out of hours charge at the airport - when we started the collection before the late charge supplement .....
neutral	the guy told me to claim it back later .......
neutral	i also have no_idea when i will be refunded the deposit that was taken from my credit_card ........
neutral	reasonably_priced and ok for one night .
neutral	needs more outlets and other updates .
neutral	easy to get to from the interstate .
neutral	near shopping and restaurants
neutral	i really found the booking process very easy .
neutral	i do thisnk that a £ 0 . 00 cancellation_fee is very steep however , even cancelling well in advance .
neutral	this will actually stop me booking through fhr again .
neutral	well ......... i '_ve been taking it for a month , working out and watching what i eat and have not lost one pound ... that '_s $_00 i '_ll never see again .
neutral	but pure_health did deliver on time but the poduct dosn '_t work .
neutral	: ( dr . oz needs to stop pushing all of this stuff ..........
neutral	i started doing_business with you because you were better_than any retail_store i could purchase from .
neutral	now your pricing and shipping_costs make it easy to buy retail
neutral	i used the website to pick out my tires and set_up my appointment .
neutral	i loved the convenience of it until i got to the store to get my tires and found out that i was going to have to pay $_000 more because the tires i ordered for my stock car were the wrong_size , even_though i put in the correct make , model , and year in the website .
neutral	the guy at the store said it happened all the time and apologized profusely and was very knowledgeable when he showed me what he had in stock .
neutral	in the end i got tires on my car but not the ones i wanted because the weren_'_t in stock and payed much more than i was expecting .
neutral	however , the customer_service was great .
neutral	postage is pretty slow and the packaging shows little to no effort .. this standard would be fine if shipping was free , but as it is not , greater effort with packaging and speed is expected when paying for shipping .
neutral	i '_ve used bookbyte on several_occasions to buy and sell books and am generally happy with their services .
neutral	however , lately , prices have not been as competitive as far as buying their books goes ; they have been on the pricier side and i therefore have had to turn to other_sources to buy my books .
neutral	i have recently bought a fairly_priced book here , and it is taking far too long for me to receive it .
neutral	it is been almost over a week and i start classes soon , so i am getting concerned that i will not receive it in time .
neutral	les délai de_livraison on été bien respectés
neutral	la_commande est bien arrivée entière sans erreur
neutral	le_seul problème est que_je_n ' ai_pas aimé la moitié des choses commandées et pour 00euros évidemment c ' est embêtant mais cela vient de moi , pas_de my american market
neutral	de plus , je trouve les_prix un_peu cher
neutral	je recommanderai à_l ' occasion
neutral	i know it is not travelocity '_s fault but i am sure i checked the earlier flight for my departure_date .
neutral	was told by travelocity and delta that it would be 000_dollars to go earlier the same day !
neutral	what a crock !
neutral	sorry .
neutral	very upset !
neutral	me and my friend ordered the multi park passes , however , we werent informed that the ticket office was 00_minutes away from where we were stay so we had to pay $_000 in a cab to get us to the office .
neutral	if the office would have picked_up there phone we could have contacted them and arranged for the tickets to be dropped_off at our hotel but we rang 0 times and no answer .
neutral	once arrived at the office no " sorry "... wasnt impressed !
neutral	!
neutral	we were tired of paying high airport_parking prices but came_across a coupon on groupon to park here .
neutral	we tried it out .
neutral	we were delivered to the airport in a timely_manner .
neutral	when it was time to pick us up we text our information about our parking ticket .
neutral	we didn_'_t get any type of response so we never knew if it was received or not .
neutral	we waited 00_minutes and called instead .
neutral	we gave them our ticket number again .
neutral	we were picked_up 0 minutes later .
neutral	the ride was nice and the drive again took the ticket info and radioed it in .
neutral	when we got there we checked out with out any_problems but were told our car wasn_'_t ready .
neutral	that is why the so - so response .
neutral	all the fuss about the ticket number and our car wasn_'_t even ready .
neutral	i read about your awesome 0 day shipping and because you were recommended i finally placed my first order , on july_0th , because of an advertising you sent me with a discount .
neutral	the order did not come in until the 00th .
neutral	it sat in a hot warehouse for 0 days because you shipped it out on friday .
neutral	i would have thought you would have waited to ship it on monday , as it would have arrived almost the same time and not been in the heat so long !
neutral	with that said the dog_food arrived in a nicely sealed box , which i am glad of .
neutral	this is the first time i ever ordered dog_food by mail .
neutral	i did not even notice until i was in class , and realized that they sent me the completly wrong book .
neutral	unvelivable , the good part of the history is that i contacted them , they responded right_away , sent me a shipping label , and place the refund in my bank_account .
neutral	i found the site very easy to naviagte and user_friendly .
neutral	samples were delivered very quicklyhowever my only_criticism is i wanted them to check the finishes of bright_colours and the samples that arrived were clear , white and black .
neutral	the description said the samples would show a cross section of colour but the colours were very limited .
neutral	i '_ve asked if they can send me some more with colour so that i don_'_t have to pay another £ 0 delivery charge with no guarantee i would get any colour samples .
neutral	order was shipped in 0 boxes but only two arrived .
neutral	i notified petflow and was asked to wait to see if the delivery status changed over the next couple of days .
neutral	i waited four more days and followed_up with petflow again .
neutral	they are resending the remaining order .
neutral	if the delivery issues are resolved , i '_ll be placing future orders .
neutral	you know , i understand that discounts and offers get people to buy .
neutral	i do .
neutral	but when i find a deal , like the one i thought i was using when i started with petflow , i expect to actually see the results .
neutral	the deal i reference was a $_00 off with free_shipping for signing_up for their autoship .
neutral	ok .
neutral	done .
neutral	actual discount ?
neutral	$ 0 . 00 .
neutral	hmmmm ... so , where is the other $_00 . 00 ?
neutral	is it coming on future orders ?
neutral	i don_'_t know .
neutral	it '_s not spelled out anywhere .
neutral	but ok , i move on with my life .
neutral	so on their fb_page , last_week , i saw a $_00 discount plus free_shipping with autoship sign_up .
neutral	hmmmm ....
neutral	and then today , in my email inbox , since i now am a subscriber to petflow through purchasing with them , i have an invitation for 00_%_off plus free_shipping for signing_up with autoship .
neutral	hey !
neutral	at first i just wanted my $_00 , then i would have been happy with $_00 , but now it '_s $_00 i '_m missing out on ??
neutral	( really expensive food - not a fan of food_allergies , let_me tell you ...)
neutral	now granted , the rate for a single order is the same price as my vet '_s office .
neutral	and i get it shipped to my door , which_means i don_'_t have to call my vet to order it , drive there and pick it up myself ; it just magically shows up for no additional_charge .
neutral	and that '_s great !
neutral	i would be an ongoing customer for that .
neutral	but i don_'_t like feeling like i '_ve had a fast one pulled on me .
neutral	or that if i had just waited two_weeks , i would have saved $_00 .
neutral	when you ' re talking_about $_00 per_month for dog_food , $_00 sounds really good ...
neutral	i '_m just disappointed at yet another moment of online buyers remorse .
neutral	oh , and i asked about this issue in my orders email survey and still_haven_'_t heard back .
neutral	so , in the battle between customer_service vs . customer acquisition , i guess i know where petflow lands .
neutral	i did receive my purchase nearly instantly , but before i could get it , i had to enter a phone_number to which an sms was sent and which i then had to enter on their website .
neutral	i wish i would have known this sooner , as my phone is dead and i had to find someone_who '_s phone i could use .
neutral	they were not very happy about it , since they thought they now have opened themselves up for unwanted marketing .
neutral	i guess time will tell .
neutral	i will be canceling my reservation , the lady told me my credit would be used only for a hold , then to only find out it was charged .
neutral	shipping was very fast !
neutral	one of the components of the shower combo ( valve body ) was defective and i needed to contact customer_service for a replacement .
neutral	this is when things got really cumbersome .
neutral	the chat_function on their site is so slow and not very helpful .
neutral	the same goes for their e_- mail .
neutral	i was able to get someone on the phone in the uk who finally was able to help . or so i thought .
neutral	first the wrong replacement part was about to be sent .
neutral	luckily i happened to catch the mistake ( checking my e_- mail ) before it went out .
neutral	another call to the uk ( 0 hrs . time difference , mind you ) followed and finally the proper part was on its way ...
neutral	the quality of the shower_head is very good , the hand_held shower looks good however it is really cheap plastic .
neutral	jag sag bilder pa bucketter , bestamde mig att lagga till l medium niva plus vas totals 000 :- levererades ratt dag men lite besviken att_det bara var_en bukett tulpaner , inga extra .
neutral	while this did a good job with the disabling and told me of many faults it fixed ( i didn_'_t know i had ) so seems to have done me a great service ; however it did not fix the problem i had that i downloaded it to do .
neutral	i have to get in a computer guy to fix that one still .
neutral	so i still can '_t use or access microsoft office or use web_site email_addresses .
neutral	comment on the web_site ~ it doesn_'_t tell you the currency you purchase in until after you have committed to buy , and it doesn_'_t tell you how long this is mine to use ~ is it a yearly subscription , is it mine to keep ?
neutral	i don_'_t know .
neutral	i wanted to chose 0 and a half stars , but i had to go in whole stars , so upped it to three
neutral	i went on trip_advisor in order to help select my recent holiday to tenerife , although it helped the site is mainly customers own reviews which i found led to an unfair summary of the holiday .
neutral	bought my cat and dog_food but changed brands .
neutral	wanted sorting options that included price point , age of dog / cat , etc .
neutral	no such thing .
neutral	had to troll through all of the ones i was considering .
neutral	way to long to find what i needed .
neutral	i took the time , but may not a second try .
neutral	the delivery took 0 months .
neutral	i guess it was because of your sales_pitch .
neutral	when i finally got my glasses i am so pleased with them .
neutral	the prices of the frames are very reasonable .
neutral	i bought a leftside regulater online relyzed it was the wrong side .
neutral	no phone_number to call back called the bank to stop payment the bank tells_me that the purchase went though .
neutral	finally i got a number from the bank !
neutral	called back on hold for 00min then the guy i spoke with said no refund or exchanges that i would have to spend another $_000 . 00 dollars and thats that .
neutral	not good !!!
neutral	and im still_waiting for my credited_back to my account .
neutral	not good !!!
neutral	you got the part back
neutral	i have order twice from partsgeek , both_times my order was delivered promptly .
neutral	the second time i ordered billet grill replacements for my car and there supposed to be 0 pieces and only came with 0 .
neutral	luckily i didn_'_t really need all of the parts or that would have been a major inconvienience .
neutral	overall , my experience with partsgeek was good !
neutral	the delivery was on time , however the product itself looked old .
neutral	the foam surrounding the a /_c hose had pieces missing .
neutral	not sure why this was .
neutral	representative at store acted as if i were applying for a college education .
neutral	then when assistance was needed , acted as if she could not be bothered and could not understand_why we had such stupid questions .
neutral	really could not understand attitude and felt as if she would send me to the office if i didn_'_t behave !
neutral	she undercut and was very critical of the people who i had originally talked to over the phone , saying they had done things wrong and she had to go to so much_trouble to straighten things out .
neutral	i appreciate storage_mart as a business and will_continue although i believe that some adjustment could be made at the office level .
neutral	took a long time to receive , only to find i had ordered the wrong book ....
neutral	my experience was good .
neutral	although , now i cannot get into my account
neutral	have being buying products from evergreen for quite a while now .
neutral	items are delivered very quickly and they are always well_packaged .
neutral	prices are good too .
neutral	free delivery after_spending €_00 is great .
neutral	however , i miss the 00_%_discount_code that they used to give , it is now 0 % and i miss the little samples that they used to include with the orders .
neutral	the packing_slip had the correct item but the watch in the box was not the right one .
neutral	i called your representative who was very understanding .
neutral	the watch we ordered is no_longer available .
neutral	he did help to find me a different watch band .
neutral	but that did not turn out to be correct either .
neutral	my husband will keep the watch and we will look for the correct band some more .
neutral	elizabeth gorny
neutral	i was very happy to find the exact suitcases i was looking for , with each size i needed stocked .
neutral	the prices were quite good when comparing to other_sites and stores .
neutral	i selected the color based on the picture shown ..... a bright turquoise color that would indeed stand out on the luggage carousel .
neutral	however , when the cases arrived and i opened the boxes , i was surprised to see a very ordinary darker blue .
neutral	i thought for sure the wrong ones were shipped , but the boxes were marked correctly .
neutral	i was very disappointed as i would have selected a different color , but returning 0 large cases would have been too much_trouble and costly .
neutral	nothing wrong with the shower , no blown fuses or anything like that .
neutral	there just seems to be a problem with redring thermostats .
neutral	i thought if i brought one from yourselves it would last but no .
neutral	in february my shower was 00 months old , i replaced the thermostat , then again in march and then again last_week .
neutral	so_far this year bought 0 thermostat cut offs and all 0 have failed , 0 month , 0 months and 0 shower .
neutral	redring may be a good name , but there replacement products are not worth using .
neutral	the £_00 i have spent on replacement parts i could have used towards a new shower .
neutral	the service was able to book a room for me at the equivalent aaa rate .
neutral	however , when i arrived at the motel , their was no confirmation there .
neutral	it took two additional phone_calls to get the booking faxed to the best_western motel via expedia .
neutral	the booking service was prompt to deal with this , but frustrating to have to make so many additional calls .
neutral	good quality but beware have to pay for returns and usually takes_forever to be refunded
neutral	the products are obviously cheaper_than over the counter purchasing - but then you go and waste it and bump up the prices with your postage
neutral	leider kann_ich nicht_mehr per rechnung bestellen !
neutral	bei artikel die beschädigt sind und_die_ich aber trotzdem behalten möchte , sende ich eine email + fotos an bestseller , leider gibt_es nie einen rabatt , sondern ich soll immer den ganzen artikel zurückschicken !
neutral	kleine stellen könnte man selbst nähen !
neutral	i love the selection of products and the prices are often very good , but my last order took 00 days to leave their warehouse and another 0 to get to my door .
neutral	far too long to wait - would rather buy elsewhere for faster service .
neutral	i placed my order for a playstation network card and there was supposed to be a code sent to my email within 00_minutes " guaranteed " .
neutral	after almost an_hour i still had not received my code .
neutral	i contacted them and an_email was sent within 0 minutes that got the ball rolling again .
neutral	there was some issue with my order , but they did not contact me , i had to contact them , to get the issue fixed .
neutral	once that was done i had my code .
neutral	it all took just under an_hour .
neutral	it would have taken me longer to drive to town to buy the card so it wasn_'_t so bad .
neutral	once everything was done the card worked_perfectly and now i '_m happy .
neutral	i love parts_geek , however this one experience was less_than what i expected .
neutral	i purchased a part for my brothers 0000_toyota 0runner .
neutral	the part arrived on time , however it seems to me it is a used part that someone bought , wasn_'_t able to use , and then returned .
neutral	i am not really happy about this .
neutral	i contacted cs with pictures of the part and the inner carton it came in .
neutral	i haven_'_t heard back from anyone yet and it '_s been 0 days .
neutral	my mechanic went to put the part in and told me this part was not for a 0000 0runner .
neutral	it wasn_'_t a correct_part .
neutral	i tried opening another ticket so i can return the part and get a refund , but i am not able to create another ticket until this one is closed .
neutral	i just want my money back and to put this behind me .
neutral	again , i love parts_geek and yes , i will_definitely use them again .
neutral	they really are a great company and very fair prices .
neutral	easy to use and fast delivery
neutral	i ordered several things the same day from other internet companies .
neutral	the chewy '_s package came last ... one week_later than all the other orders combined .
neutral	i called several_times and could not get a real_person to pick_up , so i put in a request ticket for help by email ... i got the confirmation they received it and would hear back in 00_hours but nothing .....=((
neutral	ive made a couple of different orders and have been pleased .
neutral	... so as long as you can do it yourself and you dont need help or customer_service your good to . go .
neutral	ann
neutral	i felt i was getting a good price for the items i ordered .
neutral	my vet said she had sent the prescription the day after i ordered .
neutral	i kept waiting for an_email that my order had shipped .
neutral	i had ordered in plenty of time to receive my order by the time it would be needed .
neutral	i had to find somewhere local to get what i needed .
neutral	i have canceled my order .
neutral	the prices seemed very good , but the order process was too slow .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	it took longer_than it should have to receive the cartridges and one will not fit in our printer . also the printer had to be reset to accept them because they were not hp_cartridges .
neutral	i donot think i will be ordering from you again .
neutral	great when all is up and running .... but a nightmare to change your debit_card !!!!!
neutral	so much so i have never been able to use ebay for such along time .
neutral	where i used to buy and sell on ebay .
neutral	i eventually just gave up .
neutral	used pharmacy first for the first time following a google_search for cheap products .
neutral	ordering was fairly easy and so was the secure_payment process .
neutral	items were despatched fairly quickly , however although i received all my items as ordered , the items were sent in a large envelope so a number of the cardboard_box items such as tablets , hair colourant etc were quite battered by the time they got to me .
neutral	i would order from them again but would hope that they will review how they package the items for postage .
neutral	i found petflow to be very fast service but when it came time to deliver my 00lb_bag of dog_food the driver wqas to lazy to bring it inside my fence .
neutral	instead he walked right past it and put the food in front of my garage .
neutral	if i had not been home and watched this happen someone could of stolen it .
neutral	my fence is a 0ft high white picket fence and was very easy to open .
neutral	that was pure laziness .
neutral	don_'_t know if i would order from you again .
neutral	or recommend you to any one .
neutral	or get yourself some driver '_s who aren_'_t so lazy .
neutral	bad customer_service !!!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	we have ordered several parts and received them in a timely_manner plus had tracking available too .
neutral	one of our parts cracked within two months .
neutral	tried_calling but could not speak with anyone .
neutral	had to go through electronic trail .
neutral	i have been without my car for one week because they do not have an exchange_policy .
neutral	have to take the part off , send it back , then receive the replacement part .
neutral	or buy another one and send in the broken one and wait for reimbursement .
neutral	again , i have had to ask my co_workers to go out of their way to take me home from work .
neutral	please get an exchange_policy !
neutral	several_times now i have had to call and correct information on scheduling a shipment .
neutral	in january i updated the info for my dog '_s veterinarian as requested .
neutral	in april when i sensed a delay in the shipment of her prescription dog_food ( after receiving notice of the pending shipment ), i called and was told you did not have the updated vet information .
neutral	if one more " catch " occurs in my automatic order schedule i am going to cancel
neutral	i ordered my books early so i would have them and bookbyte sent me the wrong book with the wrong isbn #.
neutral	giving bookbyte the benefit of the doubt , i reordered it and bookbyte change it on the computer .
neutral	the book i have is the teachers edition and i have to send it back and not use it and i have already paid for it .
neutral	i need this book now and everyone is sold out and i am on a waiting list while my class goes on without me .
neutral	i have a test this afternoon without a book .
neutral	last semester bookbyte sent me 0 wrong books but one book that was the right one .
neutral	i would recommend this site if you don_'_t need the part in a rush .
neutral	the products are good and cheaper then retail .
neutral	the only issue is takes a week and a half to get anything .
neutral	i liked all that i could do in terms of designing the gift_card , unfortunately when i had it shipped it came back saying return to sender ... no such number ... unable to forward , even_though the address was correct and there was no reason_why the receiver would send back a gift .
neutral	skeptical , but i may try it again .
neutral	getting the storage was interested .
neutral	cubesmart was in the middle of buying selfstorage .
neutral	when i arrived the name was changed , etc .
neutral	the could not honor the previous rates i was quoted and had on a paper - confirmation because they were not given a file containing this information to honor rates for all tentative clients that would be coming in to the new company .
neutral	so after walking the units and finally finding the unit i requested , i signed the paper_work and everything .
neutral	i declined to purchase a lock from them and said i would bring my own .
neutral	well when i returned later that day , they had neglected to tell me that if i didn_'_t purchase their lock , that they would put a lock on it anyway until i returned with my lock .
neutral	of course , it was after hours and i had to call customer_service and wait for a staff to arrive and let_me into my unit .
neutral	the very same month , i wanted to enter my unit during the holidays and had forgotten my passcode .
neutral	when i contacted customer_service , i was informed that location had a christmas party and he could not get that information from their system because the office was closed .
neutral	that was the stupidest excuse i heard in a long time .
neutral	bottom_line ... my stuff is until i move later in the year .
neutral	if i had to rate it 0 - 00 .
neutral	i would give them a 0 .
neutral	i was excited when my first email confirmed that my order was shipped on the 00th , however when i still had not received a tracking_number or any additional correspondence by the 00nd i emailed questioning my order .
neutral	i did receive info that there was a problem with a backorder on one of my purchases .
neutral	i also received another email with a tracking_number on the following_day , 00rd and received my order on saturday the 00th .
neutral	i am pleased with the product just not the service .
neutral	i ordered a few things and still_haven_'_t recieved them the delivery date said november_00th and i still_haven_'_t recieved it .
neutral	i think it needs better tracking .
neutral	also is there any catolages that customers can browse at home instead of internet
neutral	order and paid for an order on 0 / 00 , notified on 0 / 00 packaged shipped , not received until 0 / 00 .
neutral	my cats could have starved to death in that length of time waiting on petflow .
neutral	not sure if i want to order again or not .
neutral	eight days is unacceptable .
neutral	i ordered an art and craft light box for fathers_day but it arrived with a broken panel .
neutral	customer_services via phone were good ( except for one rather curt operator ) and a new one arrived the next_day in exchange .
neutral	the new one is chipped in 0 places along the side but my husband has decided to keep it despite the damage as he is not confident the next one will be any better .
neutral	i '_m really disappointed with this and contacted homebase via_email yesterday to discuss this but still_waiting for a response .
neutral	update_: i '_ve just had a very positive response with some refunds and so have upgraded this to three stars .
neutral	i love the idea of the light i bout for my black light to see him at night in the yard but everytime he jumps , runs or scratches it cuts off .
neutral	i have tried ordering more , but the least you can order is $_00 ?
neutral	and i would love to get a couple of stickery printable stamps , not hundreds .
neutral	like the sample set you started us off with .
neutral	maybe a ( one ) tape gun .
neutral	i really would love to order from you , but i end up ordering from staples , because i can order one .
neutral	i was so excited when my daughter first ordered 0 cases .
neutral	it came in 0 days .
neutral	mine took 0_weeks and i was down to my last can of food when it finally arrived i '_m not sure i want it sent every 0_weeks , but i will let you know how often as we use it .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	i was very excited when i read your ad on aarp and so i ordered , the ink for my hp0000 ( ink number 000 colored three pack & 0 black 000xl ).
neutral	i have had the ink for a few_weeks and yesterday i had to use the black , well when i tried to put it in my computer it said defective , so i tried the second pack of black it also said defective .
neutral	since i live in a very small delta town in california ( most stores that would carry this are twenty to twenty_five miles in any direction .
neutral	i could not leave my husband ( who is ill ) alone for that long and so i forced to go into town and pay 00 . 00 for i clack 000 xl .
neutral	then i had to reset my entire printer ( i have not tried printing anything , but will print this .
neutral	i still have the box the ink arrived in and i am looking for the receipt , because i will be sending the unused ones along with the two black ones that did not work .
neutral	i am not saying your ink is not good it just does not work well in the newer hp_printer .
neutral	your service was fine and of course the price was comparable to walmart / staples .
neutral	but after paying the $_00 . 00 for one cartridge you need to specify in your ad somewhere that these may not work in all hp_printer .
neutral	when ordering from giftcards . com , you need to really plan_ahead because you do not get those codes quickly .
neutral	the initial email says they process within hours , but it can and usually does take more than a day or more .
neutral	after_placing your online order , you later receive a phone_call to confirm the order , then you get another email following up to connect you with your codes .
neutral	however , if you don_'_t answer that phone_call , your order could be delayed several days until your payment clears and they decide that you really did place the order .
neutral	so if all goes well , you could get your codes pretty quick .
neutral	if you miss that call , or your payment is delayed , or something_else goes_wrong somewhere , you could be waiting for days before you get what you paid for .
neutral	it '_s happened both_ways for me .
neutral	also , if you order the physical giftcard to be mailed to you , that could take several days and you need to pay the extra for signature confirmation to ensure that you get those cards , otherwise , they could claim to have sent them , but you will have no proof .
neutral	and watch the shipping_charges because they charged me twice for the same order , but calling customer_service is a nightmare and i never got refunded for the duplicate shipping charge .
neutral	the facility is very clean .
neutral	they make_sure your unit is clean and ready to move in .
neutral	no bed_bugs either .
neutral	they have after hours accessibility which is great when you are trying to move when most people are available to move in .
neutral	they customer_service has improved with in the last month so that it is being run with the customer in mind and at a professional level .
neutral	i was shipped the incorrect part and the customer_support i '_m getting is awful .
neutral	they sent me someone_elses order .
neutral	i called the phone_number and waited 00_min until i received a message that they were having high call_volume and i needed to go online to customer_support .
neutral	i put my information in and the issue i had and it said they would respond in 00 to 00_hours .
neutral	a day later i got a one_sentence response asking a question .
neutral	when i responded to that question i received another automated reply that my message was received and i would get another response in 00 - 00_hours .
neutral	i attempted to call the phone_number again and got the same response after holding for 00_min .
neutral	parts_geek is the one that made the mistake and i '_m the one getting treated poorly .
neutral	better customer_support is a must if you want to keep your client base and grow as a company .
neutral	the delivery was fast and the draught excluder very well made ... however ... shame they didnt include the screws to attach it to the door .. very important piece ito leave out i thought , especially as the item cost £_00 - 00 plus delivery !
neutral	i made two purchases from boohoo howver not happy with the quality so returned them both ... i have waited nearly two_weeks to be notified of boohoo receiving them back so i can have the money back in my bank £_00 .. however 00 days returns_policy is clearly not working for people who are on low incomes and have no further cash to spend on xmas_presents whilst waiting for returns money .
neutral	i have used a few of your coffee cups in my nespresso_machine and have noticed that they run the coffee through much slower and don_'_t release from the machine into the bin without_having to manually push them through .
neutral	the flavor of the coffee that i have tried so_far is ok but not as good as the nespresso brand .
neutral	i do however like the price difference_between the two , thank_you !
neutral	i am a frequent_shopper of amiclubwear . com .
neutral	there are some drawbacks of the site , but not enough to keep me away .
neutral	first off , the shipping is outrageous .
neutral	it ' d be great to have one set price for standard instead of the fluctuating amount .
neutral	it doesn_'_t cost that much to be sent via_ups so it '_s kind of a slap in the face to pay so much on top of the cost of the product .
neutral	also , i '_ve had issues with buying shoes and then a week_later , the price being dropped dramatically for the same product .
neutral	on more than one occasion , i purchased boots for $_00 .
neutral	a week_later , they were on sale for $_00 .
neutral	i wish they would do price adjustment within a certain number of days .
neutral	it ' d be a great incentive and make the customer feel appreciated and valued .
neutral	their clothes arent ' the best quality so these extra things would make the experience of buying from them so much_better .
neutral	i love music , tv , movies and i often do buy from itunes but the fact is that i find numerous problems with their business .
neutral	for example , i lost some albums i had downloaded a few_years_ago and when i go to buy those songs / albums again itunes sometimes tells_me that i can download them again for free again but other songs / albums it makes me purchase again .
neutral	why is there this inconsistency ?
neutral	i also feel that their prices for some items are to high and not being_able to buy items that are available in other_countries seems petty ?
neutral	is there some_reason for this ?
neutral	overall i think itunes is a good concept but could be greatly improved .
neutral	the problem is i feel they don_'_t care much about their customers .
neutral	i really wanted to like this company because they have such awesome products and stuff i couldn_'_t find in the u . s ., but its been almost a full week since my package was dispatched and there is no tracking_information for it .
neutral	i even tried e_- mailing the company but still_haven_'_t gotten a response yet .
neutral	the hats i ordered were going to be a gift for my friend '_s going away party , but because i have no_idea where the package is or if it is even still coming , i don_'_t know if i should wait it out or start looking for a new gift , which really makes me sad because this was going to be the best gift ever :/
neutral	the price for my hyundai santa_fe was excellent but the lack of communication from the time i submitted my order to when i received my package was disappointing .
neutral	no e_- mail confirming my order or tracking_info .
neutral	i wasn_'_t sure if the order had worked but then the mirror showed_up .
neutral	i would order from again , but would recommend they improve their communication with customers .
neutral	ordered 00 white and 0 black diamond flap c0 envelopes .
neutral	received 0 white and 00 black diamond flap c0 envelopes .
neutral	envelops had arrived slightly bend on one side .
neutral	conclusion = disappointed .
neutral	envelops should always be despatched in card protective_packaging .
neutral	this retailer has so many dresses you need to check it out !
neutral	even_though i was very happy with the initial process , and they were true to their word with how much they paid me , i had an_email to say that my payment had been despatched , yet received the cheque a week_later .
neutral	not exactly the first_class post promised .
neutral	if that '_s important to you , then choose bank_transfer - though again , there '_s no guarantees there either .
neutral	not the best price .
neutral	if you don_'_t buy the first visit , price keeps going up .
neutral	we found this website good because we were able to book our hostels through this site .
neutral	also , it was very easy to navigate and complete our task .
neutral	really like tree delivered on time and service was good .
neutral	however tree has a def wonk about it and in order to have it up have had to lean against wall and bend the flexible bit inwards to try and fool self into thinking its straight !
neutral	northshore carries a lot of products that i need .
neutral	i shop there only when necessary because of the shipping_charges .
neutral	the places where i usually shop have free_shipping .
neutral	i shop_here when i am desperate only .
neutral	i got some ski underwear for my two kids .
neutral	i payed almost 000 chf and the leggings already had holes around the knee area after 0_weeks .... but still i have to admit that my kids were never cold during the entire winter season up @ 0000 m a . s ..
neutral	i would therefore buy it again :-)
neutral	not so easy to setup , and to use ...
neutral	i bought the business card sized magnets while on sale .
neutral	thought i would try out a new company with good prices .
neutral	while the image was spot on the quality was a little poor .
neutral	not sure if they just used a flimsier product for the sale price , but they were so thin they couldn_'_t have weighed more than a heavy cardstock business card .
neutral	they do just barley hold on to the fridge .
neutral	so i guess all - in - all it does what it is supposed to .
neutral	i had to respond to the same request for the vets information via 0 phone_call and 0 emails
neutral	i enjoy being_able to use global_airport , but the hotel staff_member at the lot at best_western was not courteous to me when i went to go check in .
neutral	she gave_me a lot of information very quickly and seemed frustrated when i asked her to explain it .
neutral	i did not feel particularly welcome at the hotel .
neutral	this is an outside only parking facility & they make you park all the way around the back which is inconvenient if you are cutting it close or get lost like we did in the middle of the night .
neutral	i order the envelopes on tuesday_evening and rang on wednesday_afternoon to confirm the order had gone_through , as no confirmation_email had been received .
neutral	a lovely member of staff , confirmed my address , order details and that the order was completed , packed and to be dispatch that evening .
neutral	i was in hope to received by this friday but am still_waiting .... i understand due to the choice in delivery , my envelopes are solely reliant on royal_mail for the standard delivery cost of £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	but i thought your other delivery costs were very high .
neutral	often times the website does not let_me complete the order because it says my totals too low even when it is above the minimum for the restaurant as stated on the website .
neutral	the box was delivered and left by my door ; seeing as how most of the pet snackies were just tossed in the box , the dog could smell the treats and ripped the box open ... so much for having an xmas_present for our dog .
neutral	sometimes things happen in the printing that do not appear on the screen when developing the book .
neutral	i have had problems with customer_service to acknowledge these problems and replace defective books .
neutral	wordpress . com is great for presenting a professional looking blog .
neutral	the only_downside is that if you want more control , the upgrades are very pricey .
neutral	they used to be reasonable as of about 0 years_ago .
neutral	for example , the css upgrade used to be only $_00 for 0yr , it '_s now $_00 .
neutral	all other upgrades have increased in price much the same way .
neutral	it '_s ridiculous .
neutral	between the css upgrade , custom domain upgrade , and storage upgrade you ' d be better off getting your own hosting , download wordpress . org and host your own site .
neutral	i ' d have a much more enthusiastic review had they kept their original upgrade prices .
neutral	also , the stats are lacking , and i dislike the redirect to home base thing they ' re trying to do for stats .
neutral	its much more convenient and intuitive to keep the stats within the dashboard than outside the dashboard of your site .
neutral	the color ordered was brown however it was moreso burgundy but passable
neutral	i can '_t fault the service from woe , but actually putting the order through was difficult .
neutral	if i wasn_'_t so persistent i would have given up .
neutral	the pages kept crashing throughout the order process , however , as this was my first order i '_m not sure if this is the norm .
neutral	not disappointed with the quality of the envelopes , would buy from them again .
neutral	when arranging the shipping of my parcel , one of the questions_asked me to choose a time - slot for collection .
neutral	i chose 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 .
neutral	i was then advised that this slot was available , and i went_ahead with the booking .
neutral	after payment , i received the relevant_paperwork , which stated that the courier collecting my parcel operated between 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 , but would try to call within my time - slot .
neutral	i had to stay at home all day , they came at 00 : 00 .
neutral	if i had known that i would have to wait like this , i would have booked for another day , or even tried an_alternative courier .
neutral	it seems pointless , and misleading to ask customers to choose a time convenient for themselves , when there is no_intention of adhering to it .
neutral	i love the product ... am having a bit of an_issue with small leakage .. did email customer_service but had no response so feel a little_bit let_down ..
neutral	i am very dissapointed that i have had to p [ ay £_00 to send my goods back the discription stated cream and it is a lemon colour , very poor experience
neutral	i tried to get my shipping upgraded after the order was placed and was told it would be .
neutral	not only was it not upgraded , it didn_'_t get delivered by the original date it was supposed to be delivered by .
neutral	because of this i had to get the order shipped to a different address and was told it would still arrive before_xmas .
neutral	i did not receive my order until the day after xmas which was greatly disappointing considering the labels were meant to be given as xmas_gifts .
neutral	overall the labels look pretty good but our faces were cut_off more than what was shown online when i created them .
neutral	i was very pleased with the quality of these curtains .
neutral	delivery was about one week ( ready made curtains ) however , i was going to order more and requested samples but these did not arrive so , for the cost to the company of 0 small samples , i '_m afraid they have missed out on a big order !
neutral	bra_priser , men vanskelig å finne tilbudene som sendes i nyhetsbrev på epost på_hjemmesiden
neutral	quality of the furniture is good .
neutral	we only had to wait a week for the delivery .
neutral	the delivery time_slot worked well .
neutral	however one of the delivery_men commented that they should not bring items into the house after they had already done so .
neutral	this comment contradicted all of the literature we had been given / sent about protecting our flooring , making sure there were no obstructions etc .
neutral	in our opinion there is too much emphasis on what the customer must do ; from the salesperson , the leaflet he gave and the all the e_- mails .
neutral	the push on waxing the wood straightaway , again in 0_weeks according to the salesperson although this is not in the written literature about the need to use the wax polish and what to do if goods damaged did make us think_twice about continuing with the order .
neutral	we were almost expecting damaged goods and having to take photographs .
neutral	i don_'_t mind applying the wax but with so much emphasis why isn_'_t it provided with the furniture in the price .
neutral	the push on what the customer must do rather_than oakfurniture lands commitments to the customer we found very negative .
neutral	i ordered the items specifically for burns night .
neutral	firstly one of the items was unavailable , due apparently to the supplier .
neutral	however i thought i was ordering a custom made item and chose the tartan from those on the site .
neutral	the other item was ok .
neutral	nowhere did it say how long the item would take to make , delivery options were stated and chosen .
neutral	the item was not dispatched for a lo g time and only arrived today , way too late for burns .
neutral	bit sad really .😢
neutral	i had used petflow a few_months_ago for a petflow program .
neutral	our dog then was weaned off of that prescription food , so i cancelled that program .
neutral	turns_out the dog had to go back on it .
neutral	so about a month later , i restarted that prescription petflow program , minutes after i talked with the vet .
neutral	i was surprised that it took nearly four days to get this prescription recertified ( yes , i had supplied the vets name and number - same as before ) , and it was several days for the dog_food order to be placed .
neutral	even after that , i was unable to track the package , as the supplier didn_'_t give a tracking_number .
neutral	when i contacted petflow via_email , i did hear back from them very quickly , and their responses were very helpful , bringing me up to date .
neutral	the food did arrive about a week after i placed the order , but by then i had to make a special trip to a " nearby " store to get some food to tide us over until the shipment arrived .
neutral	but i was very pleased with petflow before , as both their prices and service had always been very satisfactory before .
neutral	i was torn on how to rate this .
neutral	the good side was that the item was in stock , and arrived in less_than a week .
neutral	my daughter_loves that it got here in time for her premier .
neutral	the bad_news is i never received any type of confirmation ( other than the initial page after payment ), no emails or correspondence of any kind .
neutral	to tell you the truth i was concerned i would not receive anything at all .
neutral	please have a little more communication , even an_email to let_me know you got my order .
neutral	i typed in all my info to get the posted price of $ 0000 .
neutral	and when i tapped to send it , it would not accept .
neutral	i called the listed phone no .
neutral	( spoke to a nice man in india ) and he got me on my flight but for a price of almost $_00 more .
neutral	i had to be on that flight as my daughter had just booked it and we are going together .
neutral	i am not a happy_camper today .
neutral	good variety of brands .
neutral	convenient to use .
neutral	most of my shipments have been damaged .
neutral	just got my first undamaged shipment .
neutral	usually most of the cans are dented .
neutral	overall good value though
neutral	the envelope and information leaflet were slow to arrive .
neutral	i posted the phone back the day the packaging arrived but envirofone took an age to verify it had received it and then downgraded the value of the phone as a result .
neutral	i had stated the the phone was in transit to them but this didn_'_t seem to make a difference .
neutral	my advice would be to extend the date of the contract as soon as they offer an extension .
neutral	the cheque also took a week to arrive .
neutral	overall , service was slow .
neutral	i was disappointed when i got wowcher vouchers for only half what i had paid when my son was sent to afghanistan .
neutral	it is misleading to say you can have epic her vouchers when it is p ly for half that you paid .
neutral	i '_ve ordered several_times from pureformulas . com .
neutral	prices are really pretty good .
neutral	free_shipping on every order is awesome !
neutral	although this last order that i received , had an item that was defective .
neutral	in trying to reach them by phone , i '_ve always had to leave a msg to call me back .
neutral	... and they have yet to do so .
neutral	i received my order 0_weeks_ago .
neutral	beds are awesome !!!
neutral	but bathroom was really dirty .
neutral	there was hair in shower .
neutral	towels were stained .
neutral	carpet threw out hotel was stained every where !
neutral	staff was friendly .
neutral	all and all with the price i guess i would stay again if i had to .
neutral	the initial ordering was fine , uncomplicated and simple , but when it came to delivery , things got a little more complicated .
neutral	i was told by the delivery company that delivery was post_code dependant , and that they only deliver on set days to post_code areas , which hadn_'_t been mentioned at all at the time of ordering .
neutral	i understand that this is a contract delivery but any delivery restrictions should be made clear at the time of ordering .
neutral	le détails des suppléments à payer lors qu ' on prend la voiture n ' est vraiment pas mis en avant lors de_la réservation ( horaires d ' ouverture + demi plein ).
neutral	c ' est désagréable de payer un demi à_l ' arrivée et devoir rendre la voiture le réservoir vide ... c ' est plutôt stressant et au final , le réservoir n ' est_pas vraiment : c ' est tout bénéf pour_le loueur .
neutral	pas_de plan de_l ' île ou de_la ville donné .
neutral	la voiture avait beaucoup plus de rayures que ce_qui avait été mentionné dans_le constat .
neutral	this bar stool looks goods and will_continue to look good if you do not intend using it .
neutral	the slightest bump chips the handles and back support .
neutral	bought a black enamel gloss paint to touch up and it does the job nicely .
neutral	had to queque for 0 hours before i got the car .
neutral	then i had to read the terms of the contract on a very little screen which was not very pleasant .
neutral	also , the room was full of people ( the queue was really long ) so i had absolutely no privacy when reading the terms .
neutral	also , i had a feeling the officer was quite impatient whilst me reading the terms , which did not make me feel very comfortable .
neutral	i mean , after 0 hours of quequeing , i would expect to be treated differently from her .
neutral	it also really pissed me off when i read the terms of contract - i was supposed to sign that i agree to pay approx .
neutral	00 usd for the fuel ( this was ok , i knew i would have to pay for the fuel as i read it on the dollar webside prior my arrival to the u . s .) and approx .
neutral	000_usd for an insurance !!!
neutral	i asked the lady at the desk what were these 000_usd all about and she was like : " yeah , in case your car breaks down on a highway , someone will come and get you " ( or something like that ).
neutral	i mean , 000_usd is quite a lot of money considering the overall price ofthe car_hire - shouldn_'_t she ask me first if i wanted this kind of service ???
neutral	plus , just before i started reading the terms , we agreed that i wanted just the basic insurance and nothing else ( to spend as little money as possible ).
neutral	i could not help thinking that the officer was miss - using the fact there was a really long_queue and that it was quite late - i was quite tired and i can imagine a lot of customers were not reading the terms that carefully and i was just thinking these customers will be very surprised once they see their bank_statements .
neutral	just before i was leaving the desk to pick_up the car , i asked the officer politely what are the speed limits in the u . s .
neutral	her response made me really angry - she was like : " oh , i have no_idea , i don_'_t drive ."
neutral	i think this was quite rude - i mean , how can a lady_who is not driving be working for a car_rental company ???
neutral	or maybe better - even if she was not driving , shouldn_'_t she at_least ask one of her colleagues to give me the right answer ???
neutral	at the end of the day , i was her customer and this treatment made me really think whether to go for dollar next time .
neutral	as for the car pick - up , the lady at the parking_lot who gave_me the car keys was really nice .
neutral	the car itself was very clean .
neutral	it looked as if it was new .
neutral	driving the car was very nice and comfortable , too .
neutral	i was also surprised that returning the car was so easy - i thought i would have to go to the desk again ( and queue for a long time ), which did not happen , so it speeded up the process quite a lot .
neutral	the guy_who was taking the car over was very nice too .
neutral	he even gave_me directions to bart , which he didn_'_t have to , but he did .
neutral	oh , one more thing i did not like : i did not like the fact that my credit_card was scanned as i had no_idea this was going to happen .
neutral	on the other hand , i did not read the websides that carefully , so maybe this information is somewhere in there .
neutral	but then , the officer at the desk told me that my credit_card data would be used only in case i had to pay a penalty ( eg .
neutral	for speeding or something like that ), which turned_out not to be quite right , because when i was dropping - off the car i was told that i did not have to pay for the fuel in cash ( as i originally wanted ), because this amount of money ( those 00 usd above ) would be deducted from my credit_card .
neutral	again , i would expect the lady at the desk to give me a truthful information .
neutral	so overall impression is ok ( very bad as for the service at the desk and pretty good for the car itself and the drop - off ).
neutral	i thought the product would arrive quicker_than it did .
neutral	it took a full week for the food items to arrive and the tracking_system was not updated until the product arrived at my door so it made tracking online useless .
neutral	the box was slightly_damaged but as the food was tins the tins were ok .
neutral	the products that i received were good but the product that i liked the most was missing .
neutral	i asked to have it sent asap but all i got was a refund ... was a little disappointed .
neutral	for the price of this service the credit_score should be offered more often .
neutral	appreciate the details on the alerts , but find the credit_score reporting to over shadow that part of the service .
neutral	i love that some of the items on this website is cheap and affordable and doesn_'_t look cheap .
neutral	the down_side is the return_policy you cant even return for cash or exchange your item for smaller or larger_size they only provide store credit and they take_forever and a day to put the store credit on your account then when you make a purchase u have to pay for shipping all over again which by the way is so high i now if i want to buy something on here i might as well spend 00bucks to get the free_shipping or use the code for whatever the percentage take off it is .
neutral	and also its hard to call u guys the line hangs_up on me something and sometimes i cant get there .
neutral	i love this website but there are some things i cant stand
neutral	it took a long time to get my flashing led pet tags .
neutral	i purchased 0 of them and can only get one to work .
neutral	the battery is dead in one and the other light goes out if you touch it .
neutral	they work great to keep_up with your pet , but should not come broken , or in need of battery !
neutral	i order 0 shirts , one i loved until i got to work and realized there was a huge hole under the arm .
neutral	the other is nice .
neutral	no_problems .
neutral	i probably wont order from here again .
neutral	i ordered my first pair of progressive glasses .
neutral	i loved the frames i picked out that stated they were compatible with progressives .
neutral	i was a bit_confused when ordering as it asked me if my lenses were for reading or distance .
neutral	i selected reading thinking the prescription would be self_explanatory .
neutral	when i tried on my glasses they were reading_glasses and reading only .
neutral	i checked the website again , which still stated the frames were compatible with progressives .
neutral	i selected a random frame and went through the ordering process to discover this set of frames had the option for progressive along with reading or distance .
neutral	frames should not state they are compatible with progressive_lenses if they are not .
neutral	i had to pay duty on my glasses and then the return shipping so am now on $_00 , and i have nothing to show for it .
neutral	if i order 0 pairs of shoes .... 0 are in good condition and 0 are cheap made !
neutral	glue sticking out and horrible sole .
neutral	uncomfortable to walk on and scared to walk on them because they look like they are falling_apart !
neutral	great discounts but the high shipping cost ruins the discount !
neutral	i really liked the led_lights we bought for oliver , but the shipping of your products through fedex is crazy .
neutral	my package left new_jersey then went to chicago , then went to wisconsin , then went to grove city oh , and i got it 0 days_later in chillicothe oh .
neutral	do you see anything wrong with this picture ?
neutral	i do ... you need to look at your shipping company verses other shipping companies .
neutral	there are others to ship with where their packages do not go all over the country before being delivered to the customer .
neutral	save your company money and get your products to your customers in a faster more efficient way .
neutral	ik betaalde 00_euro voor_het_boeket , een vriendin kocht ergens anders ook_een boeket , bijna net hetzelfde even groot zelfde bloemen en betaalde maar 00_euro , aangezien de verzendingskosten erbij geteld , is mijn boeket nog_steeds veel duurder .
neutral	spijtig .
neutral	volgende_keer zal ik niet_meer via internet kopen .
neutral	dit was eenmalig door deze vaststelling .
neutral	wie niet probeerd kan het_niet weten , bloemen waren wel zeer mooi .
neutral	maar in verhouding dus veel te duur .
neutral	i just don_'_t know about this tweet thing , seems a bit too short .
neutral	textbook was expensive but in good condition .
neutral	it arrived later than other books i ordered on the same day from other textbook suppliers , but it did arrive safely .
neutral	i had a good experience with yesstyle because i found some very unique shoes and clothes at a good price .
neutral	it was difficult to navigate the sizes and prices ( lots of size conversions ) so i had to pull up a sizing_chart from a different website .
neutral	my feet are at the large end of options available for this particular style so i was lucky to find my size .
neutral	when i selected the actual color from the chart i found it difficult to see exactly_what i was ordering since i had to scroll to the bottom of the page to see the shoes .
neutral	but , they were too cute to pass up !
neutral	i haven_'_t received my order because it is running_late shipping out .
neutral	i hope my second order comes sooner !
neutral	!
neutral	sometimes the quality isn_'_t there , but i still prefer it over other brands .
neutral	shipping toke forever .
neutral	another problem was with the returning of the core , since i had to pay for shipping back and was given no info on how to return it until i contacted them .
neutral	the convenience of reserving a room online is extremely_helpful to a full time working mom .
neutral	the location is close to my daughter '_s apartment .
neutral	i '_m a little_concerned_about the charge for using the refrigerator .
neutral	i '_m diabetic and my insulin needs to be kept cold .
neutral	i didn_'_t intend to use the frig except for my insulin .
neutral	paying a fee to keep my medication cold seems a little unfair ; however , i understand that if one exception is made , then others will expect the same .
neutral	if my first time experience is a good one , i won_'_t hesitate to recommend to family and friends visiting st . louis .
neutral	it is a really great site that i have used many_times .
neutral	my mum always loves the flowers .
neutral	they stay fresh for many days and arrive on time .
neutral	i liked the products , got some goods deals and the website is easy to use .
neutral	i needed to change an item and could not get hold of anyone by phone .
neutral	i tried 0 days in a row and then tried the contact link on the website giving details of the enquiry and asking to be contacted .
neutral	i never received a call back .
neutral	i tried ringing the following week and finally got through to someone , who was very helpful and polite .
neutral	the delivery was over 0_weeks so i paid for the express delivery ( cost £_00 ) and arrived on time .
neutral	items are looking good and i '_m glad i used victoria_plumb just found that trying to contact them was difficult and frustrating .
neutral	i cannot write a good or bad review because as yet , i have not received my two gift_cards .
neutral	i ordered them on november 00 .
neutral	i would have assumed they would be here by now .
neutral	is this the usual length of time ?
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	mrs . delzell
neutral	i '_m coming from a neutral perspective in writing this review .
neutral	everything on here is very high - priced , i ' d say .
neutral	yes , they ' re cute and everything but i mean , i could have gotten the same pieces of clothes ( pretty_much similar in style ) from one of the department_stores here in the us for lesser or the same price , without the wait and they ' re brand - named .
neutral	skin - care , makeup and contact_lenses are just crazily high .
neutral	i mean , super high in price .
neutral	last time , i paid closed to $_00_bucks ( without paying attention that they only sell 0 contact ) for just one contact_lense - just 0 .
neutral	ridiculous !
neutral	i love the website , the products , the way they advertise , and everything .
neutral	but ... the prices are just kinda ridiculous .
neutral	sorry !
neutral	i loved the great range diabloskinz had on their site .
neutral	delivery was fantastic , arrived in tuesday after being ordered late_sunday .
neutral	however , my case for iphone_0s looked much_better online , looks a little tacky in person .
neutral	it also broke 0 days into use .
neutral	it has snapped around the volume controls , so i have a little_bit of sharp plastic catching on everything .
neutral	i don_'_t expect to pay £_00 for something to break 0 days_later .
neutral	i feel the staff could have been friendlier .
neutral	the times i walked_into the actual front_desk area , the reps seemed unhappy or annoyed .
neutral	the actual storage_facility has a lot of security , so i felt my stuff was safe .
neutral	we finally found the flights and hotel we wanted to book but when we went to confirm it , one of the flights was no_longer available .
neutral	we ended_up booking our flights on a different site and only book our room with bookit . com .
neutral	i '_ve ordered many_times from pureformulas and generally service is fantastic .
neutral	however , i have not yet received my last order , even_though i was asked to give a review on the service !
neutral	maybe there '_s a disconnect somewhere ?
neutral	i checked the shipping information , and my order just shipped today , a full week after ordering .
neutral	had i known it would take so long , i would have ordered much sooner .
neutral	there was no notice that the policy did no include trip concellation until the last of the 00 pages of the policy .
neutral	terns were unclear re travelers over 00 .
neutral	fortunately , i did no have to use the policy .
neutral	also the premium was misquoted on the policy and i noticed the discrepancy when i got my visa bill .
neutral	i would not use this resourse again .
neutral	i really like the items , but the shipping is to expensive
neutral	very frustrated with inability to print gift_card instead of having it mailed to me so i can then present it to it '_s recipient ' after the fact '.
neutral	further frustration when calling the 000 number to be informed you are now closed despite_being well within your posted hours of operation .
neutral	i was disappointed when i told of changes and things i wanted more than one time that i was ignored .
neutral	finally , i said the hey with it and accepted .
neutral	used an amazon local voucher , which wasn_'_t as much of deal as it claimed to be when you looked at the size and type of flowers .
neutral	the website insisted on charging £ 0 . 00 for a card even when i picked no card and i was in a rush , and in a different time zone , so didn_'_t have time to query it and just ended_up getting a birthday card sent .
neutral	unlikely to use again .
neutral	it was good value for money , however i was disappointed to find there was no cover for it !
neutral	not sure therefore how mich wear and tare it will take .
neutral	took a long time for items to be received , but happy with items when they finally arrived
neutral	the first time i received my package it was mailed in a flimsy envelope that was half open ; second time same thing .
neutral	looked like a child had packed the content .
neutral	my dog loved his treats ; which are expensive .
neutral	i won_'_t be using this company again .
neutral	create gift_cards if you know your recipient will use them right_away , at a place that accepts visa .
neutral	facebook is great for keeping in touch with my family ... but it also such a time suck i hate how addicting it is and how much it makes so unproductive .
neutral	so i love it ... but i also hate it at the same time .
neutral	that '_s why i give it 0_stars .
neutral	took a few_minutes to find correct car_park , once found it was a terrapin rather_than an office .
neutral	got charged extra for driving from faro into spain which we weren_'_t told about .
neutral	had to find our own car rather_than being shown to it & when we returned it nobody met us .
neutral	ideally id give a 0 and a half - late getting to us despite phoning several_times left waiting at_gatwick for car pick_up for 00_minutes , but very prompt on way back , car waiting as we came out with our_luggage , would use again but would think again if pick_up was late again and would use another provider .
neutral	we traveled to arizona and had some difficulty booking a ticket on other_sites .
neutral	bought these tickets online so seemed to be good value for money .
neutral	frequency of buses is very poor .
neutral	any of the bus_stops i was at have no timetables which is hard when you are standing in the cold awaiting the next bus with absolutley no_idea when the next bus might arrive .
neutral	the bus drivers were not very friendly either .
neutral	the buses themselves are good and the information on the bus is good .
neutral	i think it '_s good for leads but i haven_'_t gotten any solid leads yet .
neutral	some problems may be in the filtering process .
neutral	i am not interested in any commercial cleaning jobs .
neutral	residential only .
neutral	when i receive an_email that contains only facility cleaning job listings i am irritated .
neutral	i have no interest in any facility type jobs .
neutral	in most instances_where people are looking for residential cleaners they list the rate they are willing to pay for these services they put a range of $ 0 - $_00 / hr .
neutral	looking at those listings is a waste of my time because i charge a minimum of $_00 / hr .
neutral	it '_s possible also that when i signed_up that i may have made some mistakes in the filtering process as well .
neutral	it would also be helpful if i would only see jobs in the area that i service .
neutral	basically , north_shore milwaukee and eastern wauwatosa .
neutral	payment took far longer_than advertised
neutral	ill let you know when i recieve the product
neutral	big_bus_tours did not inform anyone that many of their stops around westminster abby are closed for them while other bus_tours are running .
neutral	we walked for 00_min from stop to stop trying to find a stop that was actually operating .
neutral	had to call them to find one that we could go to .
neutral	they recommended we walk over a bridge ( seriously ) to get to a few stops up .
neutral	here '_s a thought update your maps !!!
neutral	or do a flyer supplement with it .
neutral	we wasted a lot of time trying to get on another bus .
neutral	buses also slowed_down in the afternoon ... you waited much longer_than the posted times for buses to come .
neutral	i saw all the other buses more frequently .
neutral	should have gone with them .
neutral	my move was not a great one to begin with .
neutral	transporting furniture across country ( will never do that again !).
neutral	the moving company was in a 00wheeler .
neutral	i called the publicstorage office to ask if driver would be able to maneuver around the aisles in the storage_facility .
neutral	the lady assured_me semi drivers do it all the time .
neutral	when the truck finally arrived ( 0wks after they were supposed to be here - truck broke_down etc etc ) they were not able to drive around to my unit .
neutral	we had to pay the drivers additional money to carry our belongings in the rain to my unit .
neutral	very disenchanting to say the least !
neutral	the people on the ground ( picking_up and dropping_off your car ) are always polite , friendly , and helpful .
neutral	the people on the phone are sometime ok but often rude , abrupt , and unhelpful .
neutral	i feel_like they think they ' re doing me a favour by taking my call .
neutral	experience ordering was great , no_complaints , and they have a wide_selection of products at good prices .
neutral	i will order from them again .
neutral	my one issue is with their shipping .
neutral	i was going out of town and really needed one of the items to arrive before i left .
neutral	i called their customer_service to see if the expected shipping date could be moved up .
neutral	the gentleman i spoke with assured_me the order would be shipped in time for it to arrive before i left .
neutral	the order ended_up being shipped in three_separate boxes .
neutral	fortunately , the box i needed did come before i ran_out of the old food , but one of the boxes did not even ship until after i had left town ( at_least a week after the rep promised it would be shipped ).
neutral	the first day on big_bus_tours was a great way to get an_overview of london .
neutral	unfortunately the second day was a day of road_closures .
neutral	we took a detour and sat on a sweltering bus for an_hour going less_than a mile .
neutral	got off an vowed never to get on again .
neutral	we walked and then took a cab back to hotel .
neutral	my alternator went , so needed it to fix car .
neutral	took 0 whole days to receive part .
neutral	this is 0000 , speed up your shipping .
neutral	i will stick to ebay or amazon for now on , just because your shipping is too slow .
neutral	have been with company about 00 years with no big problems thankfully .
neutral	but i feel in the last_year they have gone down hill mainly with customer_service .
neutral	i think customer_service needs looking into seriously in all_aspects .
neutral	as long as i don_'_t have any_issues with them i will_continue to shop , and with the first sign of any major problems i will pay the full balance and close my account especially reading quite afew bad_reviews of recent times .
neutral	i am happy for now non the less .
neutral	i '_ve booked many trips on travelocity in the past , especially packages .
neutral	but for flights , which i take 0 - 0 / yr ), i use hipmunk who emails in real time my exact itinerary price changes .
neutral	your site emails every price change regardless of relevance to my calendar .
neutral	noooooooooo nnnnooooo
neutral	i '_ve been a customer for years yet i was unable to place order online numerous_times & ended_up having to call order in .
neutral	i was disappointed in this company '_s service .
neutral	just because i can '_t order something every_month doesn_'_t mean i don_'_t value the company .
neutral	life is hard enough & when i choose to spend my money on your products you shouldn_'_t be making my life more difficult .
neutral	i like boohoo items and think they are of a good quality however i think this is let_down by the fact that their is no free delivery option like on other_websites such as asos .
neutral	i am also not impressed by the fact that the cheapest delivery option is £ 0 . 00 and for this price the delivery is not actually very fast .
neutral	i have actually ordered items from asos and boohoo on the same day before and received the asos items using free delivery either before or on the same day as the boohoo items which i think is very disappointing from boohoo .
neutral	it also annoys be that their is a re - stocking_fee for returns and they don_'_t offer exchanges .
neutral	this often puts me off buying certain products where i am unsure what size i would like as i would either have to pay a restocking_fee to return if i order them in multiple sizes or if the size i order is wrong i would have to pay another £ 0 to get another size delivered to me .
neutral	however apart_from the delivery and returns process i do really like boohoo products which is a shame as i often hold back on buying things from the site due to the issues i have named above .
neutral	we got on a blue line bus in kensington , and took the recorded_tour until around madame toussad '_s .
neutral	this tour was not very informative , and not very interesting - definitely not worth the $!
neutral	we then switched to the red line tour and took that til the end point ; our live_guide was great - funny , informative , interesting .
neutral	the company should consider redoing the recorded_tour to make it much_better - and people should stick with live guides ( only on the red line ) whenever_possible .
neutral	the customer_service representatives are difficult to understand , most have foreign accents , but your prices are sort - of - cheap .
neutral	i '_ll admit i was expecting a better quality cup , one that would at_least keep my coffee hot .
neutral	i am very happy with the size and the pictures , but i think the price was a bit too high for the less - than - excellent quality of the cup .
neutral	i will , however , be back to check out more items and services .
neutral	love using the lenstore - really easty to use service and good quality produce
neutral	the only_reason i will probably stop using them is that the box they come in is 00cm unneccessarily big and this means they do not fit through the letterbox and i have to go to post_office to pick_up parcel - this defeats the point in ordering online which i do as i work long hours .
neutral	might as well just go to tesco if have to try get to post_office before 0pm everytime i order them .
neutral	do have some really nice items could do with some more bigger_sizes but downfall slow postage .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t received the package so not so interested in reordering anything .
neutral	i ordered last_week but still have not gotten my new futon order
neutral	i booked a car from london stansted with green motion .
neutral	i have used argushire a number of times and been very happy to date , but i did find a few problems with this booking .
neutral	firstly , the distance from the airport to the car_hire was a 00 minute bus journey , but worse still was the fact that the buses only went every half_hour ( no details of the bus times were provided at the time of booking ).
neutral	yet worse still was the fact that i was charged an_additional £ 0 . 00 for the journey which was not a cost that had been presented upfront when i booked .
neutral	i do not like hidden_charges , particularly on top of additional journey time .
neutral	i just feel_like i should have been given more information before i choose to book .
neutral	i called bookit to modify my booking by adding one day and spoke with a representative by the name of " sara " who was awesome while on the phone .
neutral	she gave_me 000_% superior customer_service until after the call i checked my itinerary and found out that i was booked at another resort 0 hour away from my destination .
neutral	i didn_'_t ask for this at all and nor was it mentioned to me that this had occurred .
neutral	i am so thankful that i checked or else this would '_ve been a disaster !!!!
neutral	i was under the impression i was still at the same hotel .
neutral	to make_matters worse i had changed my nonrefundable flight for the extra night while on the phone with sara to receive an extra discount unbeknownst to me that i was being booked at the wrong resort .
neutral	after hanging up with sara , realizing the error i immediately called bookit back .
neutral	it was only then i was notified that the hotel from my original booking didn_'_t have availability for the extra night .
neutral	really this can '_t be happening !!!
neutral	i was asked to call bookit back the next_day to confirm that i had my old itinerary adding more uneasiness to my " vacation ".
neutral	could i really be without a hotel because of a rep error ?
neutral	on 0 - 00 - 00 i spent a total of total of 0 . 0 hours on the phone trying to modify my itinerary and then try get my old reservation back .
neutral	basically not accomplishing what i initially called for in the first place .
neutral	the next_day 0 - 00 - 00 i spoke to omar ( another great customer_service experience ) who helped_me book another hotel to accommodate my extra day and cancel my round_trip transportation because it was no_longer valid .
neutral	if it was originally communicated to me that there were no availabilities to accommodate my request for the extra day i know i would '_ve changed my flight .
neutral	in the end i now have to find ( pay ) my way to the " pre_- resort " that i will be staying at for one night then find ( pay ) my way to the original hotel i booked then find ( pay ) my way back to the airport .
neutral	i was super excited about the service your company provides .
neutral	brilliant idea for service but i am not impressed with the service i received .
neutral	as a habitual international traveler , i am telling my story so that hopefully i can save another customer from running into the same issue i did .
neutral	i definitely do not have the same confidence in booking travel with this company as i did before .
neutral	i use priceline . com for most of my hotel bookings .
neutral	i find that the name your own tool is an awesomely , empowering piece of the site .
neutral	throughout these last few_years , though , it seems as they have made the bidding_process very complicated .
neutral	before , you could continue to send bids until one was accepted .
neutral	now , it does continue that , yet , you have to wait 00_hours to try again .
neutral	sometimes , bidding is taking you as high or even higher_than paying full price for a hotel room .
neutral	on top of that , express_deals are limited and i have notice that some express_deals are actually lower in price ( according to %_discount ) than actually bidding .
neutral	kind of like a rip - off .
neutral	also , you have to be careful because some of the express_deals on the site do not match the express_deals on the app .
neutral	charges for delivery and service charges are way too high
neutral	i have ordered before but this time the filters took almost two_weeks to get here and when they arrived there were two or three filters that the sides had come loose ( glue ).
neutral	not real thrilled .
neutral	mrjet har en väldigt snygg layout och hemsidan känns trovärdig .
neutral	det_är lätt_att hitta flyget man letar efter och komma till betalningssidan , men en stor stjärna tas bort för ett felmeddelande när_jag skulle betala för flyget , vilket innebar att_det för en halvtimme hade dragits pengar på mitt konto utan att_jag fått någon som_helst biljett på mitt konto eller bekräftelsemail .
neutral	till slut kom bekräftelsemailet , men inte innan jag hunnit panika en_god stund över vad som hade hänt .
neutral	site is easy to use and convenient but to be charged an activation_fee is a rip_off .
neutral	it was only $ 0 . 00 for a $_00 ituens card but it pissed me off .
neutral	i have yet to receive my contacts .
neutral	it '_s unusual to place an order for anything and have it take this long .
neutral	i chose this company / site because of the price .
neutral	the price may be right , but looks like the service isn_'_t .
neutral	i have purchased many items for amiclubwear and have been more than pleased with most of my purchases .
neutral	i only gave 0_stars instead of five due to receiving some items that were damaged or of poor quality which was returned & credited_back to me without problems .
neutral	so with that said maybe just alittle better quality control .
neutral	also as an option i feel you should be able to receive a full_refund instead of a store credit , provided you have followed & met all guidlines for returning an item .
neutral	also , when i have tried to contact customer_service it can take_awhile & and shipping_costs alot !
neutral	most times as much as the discount they offer !
neutral	you should offer one flat_rate shipping fee or when you have met the amount set for free_shipping you should be able to use the discount_code as well !!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	have ordered from this site a couple of times .
neutral	clothes bit hit and miss and sizes very small .
neutral	tried to send something back but no response then by time weekend had gone refund period had passed .
neutral	flight prices good , but despite me saying no to insurance i then found that i had been charged $_00 for 0 days . deluxe insurance .
neutral	i am very unimpressed by that and will not use flight_hub again as a result .
neutral	i wanted to purchase about 00 signs to post on trees as inspirational messages .
neutral	i was impressed with the professionalism of the product but the product itself was tooooo expensive .
neutral	i thought there must have been a mistake but after_contacting your establishment by phone i found the pricing to be correct .
neutral	at any rate , although i would like to purchase the items you shipped in bulk i think your cost is unreasonable .
neutral	blessings
neutral	i was disappointed in finding my real property lost in transition or abandoned at sea .
neutral	i lost my cargo and wharehouse bill .
neutral	i am looking for my bill of lading .
neutral	i sent a open cheque from asb under the name of angella rayner t / as angella waiarani rayner , and for 0 , 000 , 000 sterling_silver .
neutral	thats my bond as the .
neutral	cesti que use executing from mu cesti que trust .
neutral	i am looking for restitution of property and ask for a clean bill of health .
neutral	signed and witnessed by a rayner the court clerk in the county of nu tireni state .
neutral	my niece met a patriot cheerleader and it was the moment in her life that meant so much to her , i tried to put that pic on a card and i was told it was lude and crude .....
neutral	i have no_problems with the company or online sales experience , they ' re fine , but as they use citylink carriers i doubt i '_ll use them again .
neutral	i did not put in a delivery note to seller on the paypal payment page , as i was not aware this would not be requested elsewhere .
neutral	after citylink , their carrier , had missed me for delivery once , on their second try they ignored my email re delivery instructions to leave with a neighbour to obtain signature and managed to arrive in the 00 minute window when i had to pop out to pick_up my wee one from nursery , also ignoring the instruction to give me a quick call .
neutral	my husband then had to undertake a 0 hour trip to their depot to pick_up the items .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	there were some initial problems with the appointment to fit a security_system as it was cancelled at short_notice owing to a bereavement , but once this was overcome the fitter turned_up on time and the work was done in the time allowed .
neutral	it would have been better if the fitter had brought a longer ladder and then he could have fitted the alarm higher up under the eaves of the house - which is what i would have preferred - but it is not a significant problem .
neutral	otherwise the system is easy to use and performs as expected .
neutral	i have just begun the process .
neutral	nothing has taken place yet .
neutral	the information between the company and myself is slow going .
neutral	it had berm 0 months not much action .
neutral	i am very nervous i will be scammed .
neutral	stay tuned .
neutral	it was great but i needed to order more than 00 gift_cards at once and was unable to .
neutral	ended_up only getting the 00 due to shipping_charges .
neutral	i was billed_twice for the same day after enrolling on line for parking .
neutral	attendant at the parking_lot was pleasant , service was prompt - and courteous - will call for adjustment .
neutral	its alright , i keep in contact with co_workers friends and family .
neutral	what more do you want :)
neutral	so i previously ordered a sweater and flats for my friends .
neutral	the order came in quite fast ( about a week or two ).
neutral	the jacket came out terribly different than the photos .
neutral	i mean it just looked tacky .
neutral	yes , i understand that the photos are all touched - up and everything , but this jacket was not even recognizable to the one i ordered .
neutral	angrily , i returned the jacket , a little confused on how to return my item .
neutral	so i called the toll - free number given .
neutral	no one picks_up , multiple_times .
neutral	finally , i just did it any way and hoped for the best ( leaving all the things that they said to leave in the box at the bottom of the receipt given when purchasing an order ) and of course sent it to the address it told me to .
neutral	about two_weeks_later , yesstyle actually sent me an e_- mail_stating that it has received my return and is giving me store credit .
neutral	this made me really happy considering that i felt_like i was being ignored with the constant calls and no pickup '_s and that i spent $_00 on some homeless - like sweater which i returned .
neutral	i called again recently and no one picked_up once again .
neutral	about three hours_later , a thick korean accent guy calls me back .
neutral	although i did not understand a single word he said ( so he was practical no help ), it was very nice to know that they actually return back their calls .
neutral	so i go on it again and finally shop to use up my store credit .
neutral	i must_say that yesstyle is incredibly easy to use ( neglecting the confusing prices and sizes ).
neutral	once i chose my items , the store credit was given as an option of payment ( yay !).
neutral	so that was easy .
neutral	a little_confusing with the choices afterwards of picking credit_card , paypal , or alipay ( since i was using store credit ).
neutral	it deny my credit_cards and finally i chose alipay and it worked .
neutral	so overall , yesstyle '_s quality is quite disappointing on how low it is , but the service is pretty good and reliable .
neutral	my experience with go electrical was excellent until i received an e_mail twenty_four hours after ordering informing_me that i was no_longer entitled to free_postage and packing due to my outlying post_code .
neutral	i actually live ten miles from the city of aberdeen .
neutral	i was then asked to pay a subsidised fee of £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	when i pointed_out that not all carriers did post_code pricing i was literally told i could pay or cancel my order !
neutral	!
neutral	chairs arrived well_packaged , waited a few_weeks for them though .
neutral	i ' d say they were average quality but some of the buttoning on the backs of the chairs isn_'_t evenly spaced and i didn_'_t realise i had to assemble them myself .
neutral	the chairs look nice but thought they ' d be better quality .
neutral	just ordered a pair of jeggings from very and when they arrived they were the baggiest pair of jeggings ever .
neutral	they fitted great round the waist , hips etc_., but the legs were really baggy - sent them back .
neutral	find a lot of things recently on very that have bad sizing and also i find that the cost of delivery is very expensive .
neutral	travelocity booked an united flight .
neutral	when i got to the des moines airport , i found that the flight was overbooked .
neutral	fortunately , the united person at the gate was able to juggle another passenger '_s flight ( with one less layover and an incentive of $_000 ) so that i was able to get her seat .
neutral	i have been booking with travelocity for many years and this has never happened before .
neutral	otherwise , everything went well .
neutral	when i originally placed my order it was because i received an_email for a great special .
neutral	00 . 00 dollars off if i bought two large_bags of my dogs ' usual food .
neutral	when i checked the invoice i found i did not receive the discount .
neutral	i sent an_email wondering_why i did not get the 00 . 00 dollars off .
neutral	i got the runaround from janna the rep . and was not pleased .
neutral	so , i was disappointed in that aspect .
neutral	when i received the shipment i found that it was incorrect and that was quickly rectified over the phone .
neutral	a pleasant_surprise after the emails i had been getting .
neutral	i '_m still not sure if i want to continue with the auto - delivery .
neutral	we '_ll see how the next shipment goes
neutral	one series was much smaller then anticipated
neutral	the other order was not the words i thought i had ordered .
neutral	colors ok , but not bright enough , would look better is bolder .
neutral	needing labels exciting as important as the product .
neutral	has to be eye catcher friendly , not sure these are quite there ..
neutral	i spent a considerable amt of money for these .
neutral	after purchasing jars , labels and decor to sell them , plus the ingredients .
neutral	there is not much profit for all the work involved .
neutral	remember the amt of spendable funds , mainly gals have when out a market days downtown .
neutral	i think i will have a hard time moving my little products .
neutral	this is my first time doing this , so time will tell .
neutral	but i live in a small new england town , the economy poor here .
neutral	if you are interested in my success of not , i will keep you informed of what the labels do or do not do for me .
neutral	thanks for asking my opinion .
neutral	i bought a dress that literally took a week to process to get shipped .
neutral	however , the company had already fully charged my card which caused concern since i had not recieved the item .
neutral	when i called i was put on hold for about 0 minutes and then the girl stated it was shipped that previous friday .
neutral	she had to " re - send " a confirmation to me .
neutral	the confirmation they sent states that the postal service got the shipping id but no product as of yet .
neutral	two_weeks_later i have yet to see my item .
neutral	our room had no ac but really needed it .
neutral	we had to hire an electric fan for the duration of our stay .
neutral	they also wanted extra money for the safe key , but we didn_'_t need it .
neutral	i found the bed very hard and the hot_water just so at busy periods of the day , but good when obviously not all being used .
neutral	easy walk to restaurants and the beach .
neutral	beach black sand and pebbles .
neutral	pool lovely and clean .
neutral	room was also cleaned everyday .
neutral	for some_reason , i just don_'_t like delivery . com as much as i like seamless , even_though seamless doesn_'_t offer reward_points .
neutral	i '_ve also noticed that there are hidden price increases for some restaurants on delivery . com , so keep an eye out .
neutral	i was pleased , overall , with my first petflow order .
neutral	the anti_- track floor mat works great , and i '_m very happy with it .
neutral	the various dog_treats i ordered are just fine .
neutral	i ordered two led_light collar tags , though .
neutral	one was loose from its package , and the other , though in a package , was broken .
neutral	these items needed to be carefully_packed , but were just thrown into the box .
neutral	turn - around time on my order was good .
neutral	i was just disappointed to receive broken merchandise ---
neutral	we were waiting for 00_min at hyde_park under a rain .
neutral	then a bus came with a lot of tourists .
neutral	we had to stay inside to get the hyde_park corner .
neutral	the staffs were not professional with this situation , even more - a woman on the hyde_park corner was rude .
neutral	i am not sure that next time we will use bigbustour .
neutral	may be original tour , because their buses came every 0 min .
neutral	ordered 0xdvd - r received 00xdvd - r rang and told them , explained i did not want them and got told they are the same .
neutral	why then sell different speeds .
neutral	train your staff
neutral	generally clean , but needs remodel .
neutral	tub was cracked and we could see they tried to patch it .
neutral	furniture in the room was low quality .
neutral	breakfast was nothing special .
neutral	whilst the tiles were great value our order turned_up quickly but on an artic wagon which would not fit up the drive and the driver said he would only drop on the roadside .
neutral	sent the tiles back asking for a smaller wagon which duly_arrived but this driver refused to come up the drive .
neutral	back the tiles went again so we could arrange help as he said he would only drop roadside .
neutral	third time lucky and this driver could not have been more helpful backing up the drive and dropping right by my front_door , just shows the difference a helpful driver makes .
neutral	the company is ok but i wish free_shipping was like 00 $ or more rather_than $_000 and if you want to ship back an item it is free_shipping and to not have yesstyle points if the item is defective to have a refund and have the option of them sending you a new item or getting your money back .
neutral	i love this website , i can get all of my supplements in one place , quickly .
neutral	except the gla -- it seems always to be out of stock when i need to order it .
neutral	i sign_up to be sent the email when it comes in and i '_m still_waiting , its now 0_weeks .
neutral	looks like i '_m going to have to purchase another brand of gla .
neutral	not happy about it .
neutral	i have spoken to a salesman once and twice ordered an item over the internet that was listed as having plenty in stock .
neutral	paid for the item and then received a notice that the item is out of stock .. this has happened three_times now .
neutral	the problem is that my credit_card is charged and i have to keep watching for the credit to be put on the charge
neutral	pricewise good , product good , some_confusion over my address ?
neutral	( moved to present address almost 0 years_ago ) last address no_longer exists and item was sent and returned twice while i waited and sent emails asking where my order was ?
neutral	emails arrived daily , ie - what did i want to do - cancel / refund etc , would i pay for a vets perscription if i wanted to cancel ?
neutral	i felt very much on a computer_generated link .
neutral	eventually the correct item arrived and to benefit from the vets script i need to re - order , so will ensure my correct address is on the order
neutral	delivery of my wysteria was incredibly fast .
neutral	however , one of the plants arrived with dead crunchy leaves .
neutral	hope it will " get better " .
neutral	though i had bought the bogof deal but only one of each bar arrived , and struggled to get through on the phone .
neutral	taste not to bad .
neutral	would prefer cheaper delivery charges as the products are a little expensive .
neutral	need to run ever 0 / 0 hr had to wait and hr for the next shuttle
neutral	the website is easy to navigate and i saw a 0ft artificial xmas_tree which is not an easy size to find .
neutral	it said free delivery over 00 . 00 but delivery charge was added even_though the tree was 00 . 00 .
neutral	the service was great and i could change the delivery date ; however i had to wait in all day till 0pm delivery despite the website saying a text would be sent in the morning with a 0 hour delivery window .
neutral	i would be hesitant to use this website again which is a shame as the product is nice .
neutral	please cancel my subscription
neutral	i prefer it now they send orders by ups rather_than yodel .
neutral	the service has got better , only gave 0_stars because the first two times i ordered they sent bust up packages of chicken_breasts and there were chicken juice all over my protien .
neutral	my only problem is now is the last time i ordered online , they tried taking the money a day early than it said on their site , so my order was delayed .
neutral	other than that it '_s a good company which i will_continue to use in the future .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	my family and i booked the half - day gulfoss and geysir express trip from reykjavik .
neutral	the bus was comfortable and the tour_guide was funny and knowledgeable .
neutral	the falls were amazing and the lamb stew there was delicious but a bit_pricey .
neutral	the big !
neutral	negative was the situation at the geysir .
neutral	the tour_guide told us that the people collecting admission to the geysir were operating illegally and to just run past them .
neutral	i managed to get through but my family did not .
neutral	it was like running a gauntlet and was a very uncomfortable situation .
neutral	i would not book this tour until they get this situation figured_out because otherwise you only see the falls
neutral	i love that gamermodz has so many_choices while creating a controller .
neutral	the frustrating thing was getting it to ship .
neutral	mine took almost four weeks to ship when it was said to only take 0 - 00 business days .
neutral	i payed more for the shipping , which was refunded for my inconvenience .
neutral	i liked the speedy_delivery , but the box was very ripped up .
neutral	it may been better to send the bigger box with only the cat_litter in it .
neutral	the biggest box was already 00lbs with the cat_litter in it alone .
neutral	a bag of cat_food didn_'_t need to be added to that box at all .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t received my refund i did track the order returned and you received it earlier in the week .
neutral	please address this problem asap .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	i have 0 beagles and 0 golden_retrievers and they all love the bully_sticks .
neutral	i was thrilled with my last order because you did two offers of increasing the order 0x .
neutral	when the package came ( and i was not home ) the ups driver left it by my front_door .
neutral	it so happens that i leave the little dogs with access to that part of the yard .
neutral	by time i found the package 0 days_later , there were only the original order left when i counted the sticks .
neutral	the first order i received from you was in a cardboard_box .
neutral	it did well in shipping .
neutral	this was in a padded manila envelope and was too convenient for the little girls to get into it .
neutral	i don_'_t know how to order and request a box vrs envelope ... so i will not be ordering again .
neutral	you do have a great product .
neutral	our school has used big_bus for the last few_years telephoning for a group rate and sending a cheque in advance of our trip .
neutral	this year we were told booking on line was the only option and when you try to do this you find online discount is not available for groups .
neutral	we were encouraged to take a private tour at a cost of £_000 !
neutral	far in excess of what our children can_afford and not suitable for small groups ( 00 children and 0_adults ) so had to book as a group and pay the full price .
neutral	the actual tour was excellent as usual but we are disappointed that big_bus now penalises small groups .
neutral	not good customer_service .
neutral	i ordered my bridesmaid_dresses and wasn_'_t disappointed with the quality - only that they were badly crinkled upon_arrival , but that would be expected with them being posted .
neutral	it cost me more money to have them pressed , though .
neutral	communication was ok . not happy with the time it took to make and deliver them , even_though plenty of time was given they still seemed unconcerned about them getting here before the wedding date .
neutral	they did arrive a week before , but that left minimal time and required alterations .
neutral	i had ordered 0 textbooks for college , and i only received 0 of them after nearly 0_weeks of waiting , and im still_waiting for the 0rd book .
neutral	bought a couple of items , with inconsistent sizing .
neutral	one was lovely , in a slightly larger_size than usual .
neutral	the other was huge in my normal size .
neutral	very unpredictable .
neutral	looks to be a good range online but not easy to know what to order .
neutral	good jobs its free returns !
neutral	wish sizing was better .
neutral	the sizing_chart is not correct , for us sizing ..
neutral	expensive waste of time .
neutral	return to a foreign_country is lame .
neutral	i was very impressed with the prices , service and communication with appliances_online .
neutral	but was not impressed with the sales_pitch after delivery .
neutral	i was basically told i had to take out a service plan although i said i didn_'_t want to ( many_times ), as a pensioner i have to watch what comes out of my bank_account , but the salesman was very insistant so i did , after he had said i would be sent everything so i could look at it before i made my mind up , when the letter came through it said ih had been set_up and the stated amount would becoming out of my account every_month .
neutral	so then had the bother of phoning to cancel something i never wanted in the first place .
neutral	so for this reason alone i would be reluctant to buy from them again .
neutral	quick and easy website and phone_call next_day with delivery date .
neutral	thought this was excellent service .
neutral	however waited all day for night freight delivery but did not turn up .
neutral	very frustrating even after phone_call at 00 . 00 assuring me item was only 00_minutes away .
neutral	however it did not arrive .
neutral	next_day called garden best_buys and was told our item had been forgotten to be loaded_onto the delivery lorry at night freight depot .
neutral	annoyingly garden best_buys just said " ah well human_error ... these things can happen " not what you want to hear when you have wasted a whole day waiting in .
neutral	was then told item would be arriving approx .
neutral	0pm .
neutral	just about to leave house at 00am and it arrived .
neutral	if i had left 0 minutes earlier would have missed it .
neutral	garden best_buys do have great prices but in this case were let_down by their delivery contractor .
neutral	only option was for delivery within two_weeks .
neutral	we already had run_out of oil so had no heading or hot_water for two_weeks .
neutral	the caller has to wait for too long before it is answered .. apparently it doesn_'_t ring at the other end at the same time that it is connected ... thus some times frustrating the caller in believing that the called party is not answering or taking too long to answer !
neutral	!
neutral	found this an extremely unfriendly way to do_business .
neutral	i needed 00 cards and had to order each one totally separately .
neutral	called the help number and though friendly , could not help .
neutral	will most_likely never use again
neutral	the room i got was great except for being 0 blocks from the beach .
neutral	when i booked my room it only showed me the name of the hotel and then disappeared .
neutral	it didn_'_t even give me time to write down the address !
neutral	i had to call bookingbuddy and wait on hold for 00_minutes just to find out where my room was .
neutral	then they couldn_'_t even tell me and i had to go back online and search for it again !
neutral	not very organized at all .
neutral	i cannot understand_why i cannot get a discount on all products that you carry .
neutral	we order broccoprotect and inflammatone per doctor with prescription avadart for prostrate cancer and as far as we are concerned wish it was a script so that our insurance can help us cover these very costly and most needed so called vitamin drugs needed daily and according to onocologist very important with avadart .
neutral	thank_you and hope maybe something can be done .
neutral	these daily doses are putting us in the poor house as we are on a fix income .
neutral	sincerely mrs . carla coromilas
neutral	the ordering process was a breeze .
neutral	i also was pleased with the fact that unlike_other textbook rental company '_s there was an option for expedited delivery .
neutral	i placed the order for my textbooks on monday , july 0 .
neutral	i received the tracking_number via_email however , the tracking_number did not work .
neutral	therefore i had no knowledge of where my items were in transit or when they would be delivered .
neutral	because of the fourth of july holiday i assumed that the text book wouldn_'_t be delivered until friday of that week .
neutral	it wasn_'_t until i emailed customer_service for a second time that i found out that my package arrived to my local post_office on the fourth of july .
neutral	having a tracking_number that actually worked would have allowed me to pick the books up in a timely_matter and not be late getting started on course work .
neutral	bitter after taste to the liquid not recommended
neutral	i have shopped with boohoo lots in the past as the clothing is an afforable price .
neutral	i have generally been happy with my purchases and delievery , however recently my order went ' missing '.
neutral	boohoo do not have a phone_number which makes them very difficult to get hold of .
neutral	they are currently trying to sort out the problem , however it has_been difficult and taken longer_than it should .
neutral	i bought a copy of diablo 0 to first check that the site would work .
neutral	after checking that the code was fine i proceeded to buy another copy so me and a friend could play .
neutral	the second time round they thought it was fraud and i had to wait another 0 - 0hrs as i had to send in pictures to show it wasn_'_t fraud and it really was me buying the game .
neutral	it took a while to process but after that both codes worked .
neutral	i can '_t fault them on the delivery of the first code , it was just a tad annoying about the second and how it took so long to be accepted ...
neutral	i purchased the 0ft wig perfect apart_from when i opened it was tangled and found it very if not nigh impossible to get the tangles out , it is not as the picture shows , it could also benefit from having a better fitting net more suited to some one with already a good head of hair and not somebody with short hair .
neutral	a simple , safe way to buy what you need .
neutral	i feel secure using paypal .
neutral	i have placed 0 orders with this company .
neutral	the first order receipt app and it took me a year to get the second half .
neutral	most_recent order was placed over 0_weeks_ago i still_haven_'_t heard a word in update about it .
neutral	the products are good but it takes too long to get them and customers are not kept_informed
neutral	i placed a order and paid for next_day delivery but order never arrived so phoned up and it had never been despatched but they made sure it arrived the next_day but that didn_'_t help as the whole point of booking order for next_day delivery was because it was a birthday_present so they received it a day late .
neutral	booh wooh
neutral	because it did not help me to locate what i needed .
neutral	the color that was on the computer does not match the actual tubing that comes on the stethoscope .
neutral	i thought the price for the resort was fair although the price went up when i went from trying to reserve the room on my ipad to reserving via computer .
neutral	we had reserved a king suite and when we got to the resort none were available so they put us in a different room .
neutral	i was disappointed with this and the room we were in was right next to the hot_tub so very noisy .
neutral	it was also disappointing that there was no refund policy .
neutral	we loved the design of our tv_cabinet and were prepared to pay the price for it , but were very dissapointed in the quality of the finish .
neutral	the laminate had been over sanded at a join causing it to split , which was unsightly .
neutral	any trained eye would have spotted it before it left the workshop .
neutral	we were offered a replacement , but the hassel of re - arranging another day off work to wait for the item wasn_'_t worth it .
neutral	we are going to pay for it to be professionally touched up .
neutral	they offered a £_00 credit note , after some convincing , which we accepted , but i am relectant to buy any furniture from them again .
neutral	it '_s a great shame as they have some great unique items .
neutral	i hope you do publish this so other customers can get the benefit of my experience and made . com can improve the quality control at the warehouse .
neutral	i saw your ad for cruise on my ipad held it for 00hrs , then paid the amount in full on my mastercard .
neutral	but still received emails saying you have so many days till ur hold on cabin expires , would have preferred some confirmation saying yes received full payment etc
neutral	i joined petflow . com '_s " spoiledrotten " program for cats ... they send you a box monthly with products guaranteed to be worth more than the program cost .
neutral	i received my first delivery , no problem with delivery date , or even with the value of the products .
neutral	big problem with the hype " made in the usa ".
neutral	shipment includes a nice laminated card describing each item included this month with retail value , and each item said " made in the usa " next to them .
neutral	the 0 or 0 toys included clearly said " made in china " on the packaging .
neutral	i don_'_t have a problem with this , but i do take offense to false_advertising , especially while so many americans look for usa made products these days .
neutral	i sent a private message to petflow '_s facebook fan page regarding this and received an answer that said " all of the food they sell is " made in the usa ".
neutral	never addressed the nice , laminated card in the box erroneously calling the chinese cat toys usa made .. other than this ( which is a biggie ), i have no problem with this company .
neutral	if this is repeated next month , i will leave the " spoiledrotten " program , as i will not condone this kind of false_advertising preying on patriots .
neutral	the ordering process went fine but haven_'_t received my order yet - wondering_why you are sending this survey to me when i haven_'_t even seen my merchandise .
neutral	once you have purchased online you have the chance to leave a message for homebase , eg to leave item in safe place but there was a 0 day delay in dealing_with emails so that was pointless .
neutral	also the delivery firm they use does not have a tracking_system although homebase said you could track your order on their website .
neutral	i ordered a grill , serpentine belt , radiator and fan .
neutral	all but the radiator came in on the same day .
neutral	to date there has_been no status_update on the tracking_number provided for the radiator .
neutral	ups states a shipping label has_been created as of 00 / 00 / 0000 and yet still today ( 0 - 0 - 00 ) there is no status_update and i haven_'_t heard back from anyone at the company .
neutral	the only way to contact them is to fill_out a form .
neutral	they emailed me back a day later to tell me they are looking into it .
neutral	since this is my first time ordering , i may give them one more chance but this experience has_been terrible so_far .
neutral	i asked for 0 week deliveries , & i seem to be getting my order within 0_weeks .
neutral	please correct this
neutral	delivery time too long .
neutral	a bit_pricey .
neutral	i experienced some problems with installation .
neutral	the censor on garage_door fell , because it was put up with just double sided tape .
neutral	so they had to come out and put it back on correctly with screws .
neutral	then i had problems with the system it self , cause the antenna box was plugged into a non_- working outlet , that i didn_'_t no that the tech plugged it in there , until he had to come out again to fix .
neutral	and i thought i was told be the sales_person that installation was to be no charge .
neutral	but , with the problems i had so_far i think i should get a refund of the $_00 . 00 fee .
neutral	ms . jolly
neutral	books take too long and no tracking_number
neutral	the departure flight was operated by vueling .
neutral	no online check - in and the low_cost airline experience .
neutral	much_better on the return when tap was tap .
neutral	why bother setting appointments ?
neutral	i waited almost 0hours to have my tires changed over for the spring .
neutral	could have gone to my mechanic and been in and out .
neutral	bought and paid_extra for rush , but did not arrive in time for concert .
neutral	it '_s a shame .
neutral	they really were just what i ordered .
neutral	ordered and arrived quickly 0_star service for that - but beware it does taste of peas and is very thick > i cant stomach it so i will be passing it on to the chickens !
neutral	!
neutral	i wish it was cheaper each_month .
neutral	for some one that doesn_'_t have a full time work
neutral	i requested parking and van service to fort_lauderdale cruise terminal .
neutral	i e_- mail i got back was for transport to the airport .
neutral	i called and left a message twice , but no one has gotten back to me .
neutral	i thought them charging me for a complete fill up upon return was not ethical seeing there was a 0 / 0 + tank left in the car .
neutral	they still charged for 00 gallons which is the tank size total ........
neutral	when i rented the car and took it they advertised the lower price gas , but did not mention that they would be charging a whole tank regardless of the amount left in it ..
neutral	so , that bummed me out .
neutral	also , it was advertised as a car being at the airport and it was an off location needing shuttle ......... so , that was what it was on your end may be something that should be checked into .
neutral	the site was great and easy to use , it was easy to find the parts and the cost were reasonable and competitive to other_sites .
neutral	the personal contact with the customer_service representatives was good , but all of the representatives i spoke with said they would send me an e_- mail along with the information on what i needed to do to return the first part i purchased to get my core_charge returned .
neutral	i never and still have not received that e_- mail .
neutral	i had to call 0 times to get someone to give me the information i needed to return the part over the phone .
neutral	i am compliant with the 00 day return_policy , but due to not receiving the e_- mails they promised i am concerned that they will not reimburse my core_charge as_promised .
neutral	as for the second order i placed for additional parts they did a great job and the parts arrived as_promised .
neutral	if my core_charge is reimbursed as_promised i will_continue to recommend the site and use it again myself .
neutral	i am looking for made in the usa treats for my dog .
neutral	i was pleased to find some products available .
neutral	i have started making my own .
neutral	received bookcase promptly and with excellent customer_service ( a courtesy phone_call prior and after delivery ).
neutral	unfortunately the quality of the product was not as high as expected .
neutral	there were several mistakes in the paintwork , missing paint work and a blob of blue , consistent with spilt paint , on one of the dinosaurs faces .
neutral	the overall finish of this product was slightly disappointing for the £_000 paid .
neutral	having said that we will be keeping the product as when built up these imperfections were not visible enough for the inconvenience of returning it .
neutral	there is no exchange_policy .
neutral	i purchased a part that was too big and just wanted to exchange for another part .
neutral	i had to purchase the other part and now i have to wait 00 days on my refund .
neutral	it would be convenient for the customer if a credit could be applied to the replacement part .
neutral	the last time i ordered from them it took a very long time for the order to come to me .
neutral	but this time it didn_'_t take the order a very long time at all so sometimes its good and sometimes not .
neutral	you just have to take your chances .
neutral	ordered moses_basket and stand on 0 / 00 / 00 checked e_- mail said item had been dispatched after waiting till 00 / 0 / 00 sent e_- mail to company whom then discoverd the items had not been dispatched very upset by this ! prompt service there -
neutral	after recieved next_day .
neutral	i chose public_storage because it was close to where i lived .
neutral	ordering on the website was smooth .
neutral	shipping method was ups economy which utilizes usps to finish delivery .
neutral	partsgeek does not ship to po boxes .
neutral	when my order was delivered it was sent to the post_office and almost returned .
neutral	i do not get my mail by carrier but by po_box and almost did not get the package .
neutral	i contacted the local post_office and luckily they held it for me .
neutral	just keep this in mind when ordering , otherwise i would use partsgeek again .
neutral	i was semi satisfied with my experience with ami .
neutral	but i did have difficuilties gettigng in touch with someone from customer_service .
neutral	please work harder to have completely_satisfied customers .
neutral	i hate how the company makes it difficuilt to get in touch with anyone .
neutral	overall i love the shoes and would order again
neutral	received order after the time it was promised .
neutral	normally an_email or text would inform me of approximate delivery time but neither was received .
neutral	i recieived my package with missing items .
neutral	i like the stuff i did receive .
neutral	but i would like the order corrected .
neutral	thank_you , donna
neutral	overall an average service , as directed we called when we were 00_minutes away from the airport for the car to be collected , upon_arrival we waited 00_minutes for the car to be picked_up .
neutral	after a long return_journey we again contacted the number on arrival so the car would be ready for collection by the time we had cleared customs !!!
neutral	after standing outside for close to an_hour at - 0 degrees we were not best pleased !
neutral	not sure if we would use this service again .
neutral	i bought the headlight and turn_signal guards and they look great !
neutral	one of the prongs used to hold them on was broken but 0 hold just as good as 0 .
neutral	i also bought the black diamond plate cowl with matching end guards and the end guards are not quite bent right so i couldn_'_t install them .
neutral	they did give me all install hardware , but i can '_t use the rivets included so i have to buy more screws to finish installation .
neutral	slightly disappointed overall .
neutral	i will not stay at the laquinta hotel in the future .
neutral	car from dollar had tons of miles .
neutral	i placed the order for soft toys as a gift for a friend who had just had a baby .
neutral	was disappointed at the length of time taken for the order to be despatached and received by myself .
neutral	was also disappointed with the way the toys were sent - they were not contained within cellophane wrapping - just ' loose ' in the envelope .
neutral	doubt that i would use this company again .
neutral	i had ordered some glasses i liked but was told they were on back order , as they were going to take over 0_weeks , i was offered a free pair from the platinum range which i thought was a nice_touch .
neutral	however a month later the glasses i ordered had still not arrived and i was then told that the frames were discontinued .
neutral	i chose to cancel my order and received a full_refund .
neutral	it was frustrating to have waited so long and not get what i wanted .
neutral	spend more money on speedy shipping .
neutral	still recieved the book over a week late .
neutral	dont spend extra on shipping that may not be fulfilled as fast as it says .
neutral	recieved the book in good condition though .
neutral	i have used travelocity exclusively for the past 00 years in my travel_plans .
neutral	i have always received the best deals out there .
neutral	this time i booked with spirit_airlines , as the fare was quite reasonable .
neutral	it did mention that there would be charges for baggage , and i didn_'_t think too much of it ., as i usually travel light , and bring a carry on .
neutral	today when i went to select my seats , i was charged a seat charge !
neutral	every seat has a charge attached to it , in addition to the fare price .
neutral	carry on luggage is also charged .
neutral	you are able to take a small carry on , the size of a purse or briefcase , but other than that there is a charge .
neutral	yikes !
neutral	i know it '_s not travelocity '_s fault , but i would have liked to have been advised of all the charges .
neutral	i defiantly would have chosen another airline .
neutral	i was very happy with their service until recently .
neutral	i ordered something that i thought was in stock , due to the fact they charged me for it and showed it on my bill , only to get my order and only part of it was there !
neutral	to make things worse they had charged me for shipping too since the lack of the rest of my order brought the total below the $_00 required for free_shipping !
neutral	this all happened without my knowledge of it !
neutral	i did not receive any kind of notification that any of this was going to transpire .
neutral	i only found out that something was wrong when i received the order and part of it wasn_'_t there .
neutral	i called them and they tried to make things right , after the fact , by sending me something a little different from what i ordered .
neutral	i am just glad that the missing / then delayed items were not a christmas gift that i needed before christmas !
neutral	the only other problem i have is the amount of time it takes to get my dog_food .
neutral	with 0 hungry dogs in the house , i try to order when i see that they are getting low , but when it takes_longer_than i thought to get their food , i start feeling a little desperate !
neutral	there also has_been issues with delivery when the box arrives smashed and torn_open and lying on my front_porch .
neutral	one day , back during hot weather , they left the box sitting right under my window air_conditioner where water sometimes drips out pretty fast .
neutral	luckily the water had not penetrated the dog_food sack even_though the outer_box was getting pretty wet .
neutral	i would have hated to have found it hours_later only to be drenched !
neutral	i was home all along but they never ring the doorbell or knocked to let us know that something waited for us on the porch !
neutral	one day it was raining and they left the box about half way or more toward the edge of the porch instead of up against the house or front_door .
neutral	it was a good thing that the wind was not blowing the rain in on the dog_food !
neutral	my husband and i are reconsidering if we want to continue using this service or have to go back to him having to leave for work early so that he can pick_up the dog_food for the dogs on his way to work !
neutral	* also i forgot to mention that he part of my order missing was the little round lights that i put on my dogs so that i can see them at night when i take them out to potty .
neutral	i had ordered more because the last time i got 0 and only 0 of them worked !
neutral	i also was hoping that the new ones would work better since the 0 lights that do work go off way to easy .
neutral	all it takes is for my dogs to shake their heads and the light goes off immediately .
neutral	this happened to my basset hound and my 0 miniature dachshunds !
neutral	they turn off way too easily when the dogs are outside !
neutral	when i spoke to the salesperson , i felt very disconnected .
neutral	i ordered a few things , online and explained i was trying to use my group - on coupon .
neutral	after giving her my order , she totaled the entire amount , which was different than my total .
neutral	i would have preferred to get another item , so i did not have to pay the shipping .
neutral	this was never mentioned .
neutral	i inquired but it was fluffed off .
neutral	ordered some adidas .
neutral	hockey shoes for my best friends birthday .
neutral	was excited as these were the ones she had wanted last season , the price was right and i had used barrington before so i trusted the web_site .
neutral	there were delivered .
neutral	promptly so was super pleased .
neutral	i then .
neutral	opened to mailing packet .
neutral	the box was tatty , bashed and not to the normal standard i had from barrington , my heart sank as these were a present and i didn_'_t want my friend like me , to be disappointed , when i opened the box .
neutral	the pair inside looked liked there were a return as all the tissue_paper was not as if there were fresh out of the box ,
neutral	the hockey shoes are the ones she wanted and look great , but the box and the assumption that these have already been out . left me confused wether i will use the website again , i would send them back but her_birthday is tomorrow .
neutral	lets_hope she isn_'_t disappointed ..............
neutral	me experience with public_storage is that they always have a lot of small_print and you can rarely use the coupons or discounts they advertise .
neutral	they also have escalation clauses the make contract rates inconsistent .. shop around your local area because rentals rates vary drastically for the same sized storage_units .
neutral	purchased required goods when visiting showroom .
neutral	noted a small keying error on order which_meant wrong tiles were ordered but this was corrected easily the next_day .
neutral	delivery was on time by the company instead of using a courier , drivers were professional , well_presented and polite .
neutral	they advised me that the specified 00 minute checking time was not applicable as a courier had not been used , we have got 0 days to inspect each item , but we did carefully check boxes and quantities matched the order .
neutral	on opening each item and making a more detailed inspection some wall tiles were not of acceptable quality due to flaws in the glaze and a few damaged ones .
neutral	emailed directly to carol ( sales_person ) well within time period to report as i was unable to find a relevant email address on the website .
neutral	she replied to me that she had forwarded the email to the correct department for attention .
neutral	after a week i have still not received anything back ....
neutral	i hope this has_been an oversight and i am not in for a fight to resolve this !
neutral	watch this space .
neutral	the price is perfect for the size space i needed .
neutral	van rentals available but they are not forthright about all the details upon renting a van .
neutral	:( overall ... i am very pleased
neutral	pleased with quick service from company but had to return the tap as it was defective a broken part .
neutral	i would have thought they would check all stock before sending them out .
neutral	so_far have no confirmation of my credit to barclaycard .
neutral	when i made the reservations the rep didnt seem to know any of the special rates that were available to me .
neutral	if i hadnt reviewed the rates beforehand , i would of been charged more than dble the cost .
neutral	i also was supposed to get $_000 in room credits that i never received .
neutral	i am waiting for a refund of that amount ..
neutral	we did not receive this order in a timely_manner due to the shipment being delivered to the wrong_address .
neutral	it was left at the front_door of a neighbors house .
neutral	this neighbor does not use the front entrance to their house , so it was days before they discovered it .
neutral	the box was poorly packaged and completely open when found .
neutral	good thing it was bagged dog_food and not something the wild animals would have gotten into !
neutral	!
neutral	the product was not as i believed it would be .
neutral	it fit my car well , but it was a completely different make than what i priorly had on it .
neutral	now the moulding in my car does not march the one in the back whatsoever .
neutral	it '_ll do for now , but i wish i would have had more information on it .
neutral	i '_ll definitely research more next time and ask more questions .
neutral	fast service but in my opinion product is over priced .
neutral	the transaction was fine however the glasses i purchased were on backorder .
neutral	i was not notified of the backorder for a couple days .
neutral	since the purchase was for a birthday_gift the delay was problematic .
neutral	nonetheless i got the frames at a good price .
neutral	i ordered a 00 and received a 00 , which was frustrating .
neutral	det_eneste som_jeg savnede var at kunne sende en besked med .
neutral	jeg købt nemlig en gave til_en veninde og_jeg_ville gerne havde haft mulighed for at sende hende en hilsen med .
neutral	shame that the person coming to fit the tyres tried to con my parents saying it was only the one tyre to be fitted to my car .
neutral	surely the paperwork for the job would have showed it was two ?
neutral	luckily they corrected him .
neutral	had exactly_what i needed and fast shipping
neutral	i had a bottle of wine sent to a friend who moved and changed jobs .
neutral	this job requires her to go to " the back country " for a week at a time .
neutral	she was not home to sign for the package .
neutral	maybe i missed something somewhere on the website , but i had not expected this scenario .
neutral	shipping was quite expensive to not have the package delivered .
neutral	i bought two_pairs of glasses thinking they would last longer_than the drug_store variety but i was wrong !
neutral	after one week of wearing one pair of readers - the screw fell out and was missing .
neutral	i called and they did offer to have me ship back but it was too much of a hassle .
neutral	i decided to go to a local_store and have them fix .
neutral	will i spend $_00 + for their frames again , no .
neutral	there are other options
neutral	booked a hotel in amsterdam , with easybook . com .
neutral	nice website , seemed a good price , but after i had booked and entered my card details the final price was more than_expected .
neutral	price advertized was not inclusive of vat .
neutral	i think this should be made clear before booking , i dont like being misled , a good company should not need to do this .
neutral	the ca seat was the cheapest price we could find for that model on line .
neutral	delivery was a few_days_later and goods as ordered .
neutral	however , the packaging of the car_seat was in was awful .
neutral	a single fairly thin box with no other padding etc , and the box had not withstood the courier !
neutral	it had come open at both_ends was was very shabby and battered .
neutral	it was only by good fortune the seat appeared to have escaped damage .
neutral	always a shame when , particularly , as a woman you walk into a place like this and get stared at by employees and customers !
neutral	however , price was good , although a little surprised to be told that tyre_shopper are nationwide when nationwide charged much more for the same tyre .
neutral	service was quick , but surprised to be shown on paperwork that outgoing tyres had 0 & 0 mm tread remaining .
neutral	when i questioned this i was told and shown it was wrong , and was told a different gauge was used , great equipment then !
neutral	just left feeling underwhelmed .
neutral	the only_thing that i can said is keep_up what u_r doing .
neutral	thank u for beeping there for me & thank for the part that i got .
neutral	there is one thing that i wish that u could do is make the shipping & handling a little less_expensive .
neutral	for people that don_'_t have that much money to expand .
neutral	thanks for beeping to so easy to fine on the internet .
neutral	i love product for price , but the product was not true to size .
neutral	i had to return merchandise , but would order from you again
neutral	excellent service , the bean_bag arrived very promptly and i was kept well informed of progress of order .
neutral	the covering on the bag is rather stiff and i understand this is for ease of cleaning but our dog just slides about on it .
neutral	i am going to see if i can have a cotton cover made .
neutral	product order was what we needed , but unfortunately disappointed with the delivery we needed this product urgently so we paid_extra for next_day delivery before 0 pm " but you guarantee next_day delivery if order before 0pm ", we never received this product till monday , very disappointed
neutral	hello my full view of public_storage where i '_m currently located .
neutral	i think that public_storage is a good company , however i do not think their being fare with the price in which i pay for the storage that i have .
neutral	it does not have a light inside and the ceiling is hanging down due to a recent issue with their roof leaking inside .
neutral	i called to report the leak and they did repair it , however they did not repair the issue with the ceiling hanging inside .
neutral	on top of that , they had the nerve to raise the amount i currently pay by $_00 .
neutral	when i received the email for my invoice and the increase was there i thought it was a mistake .
neutral	i called and talked to the young_lady about the charges on the invoice , she said the increase was decided by the company .
neutral	i know it has nothing to do with her , but i was disappointed .
neutral	i wanted to move , but i just don_'_t feel_like looking all over again .
neutral	thank_you for allowing me to express how i feel right now , because i '_m still shocked .
neutral	last_week when i ordered , my food took over an_hour and a half to arrive .
neutral	i emailed delivery . com and have still not received any feedback .
neutral	other than that , i really enjoy your service , though i wish that i could use your promotions !
neutral	almost every time i '_ve tried i can '_t either because the restaurant has a promotion or some other weird problem that makes your promotions invalid , which is frustrating .
neutral	please send an invoice with the amounts of contacts and total charged !
neutral	my insurance company needs this when i send in my claim !
neutral	please either email me this or mail it to me asap !!
neutral	!
neutral	i am not really sure what happened with my order , i received an_email that it was cancelled and then a follow - up email_stating it was a paypal issue with a coupon_code to order my item again .
neutral	i ordered through another company and paid via_paypal nearly right after_placing the order through pcgamesupply and had no issue whatsoever so i was somewhat miffed .
neutral	either way , the purchase went through and i received the code i needed shortly_thereafter .
neutral	i am on vacation and the parcel would have been delivered to my home , so i have not yet had a chance to see them , try them on or provide an opinion .
neutral	when i do i would be happy to give you my opinion since i do intend to continue shopping from you .
neutral	i found it very deceptive that there was no mention about the mandatory $_00 . 00 extra each_month for insurance until i was actually at the facility signing papers .
neutral	if it is mandatory the price quoted should include this !
neutral	i love your girl fit t '_s .
neutral	but even a 0x is too small .
neutral	i have to order men '_s sizes and they fit like a brick .
neutral	y ' all still have the best designs and the best color choices out there though .
neutral	good turnaround of confirmation of reservation following_day .
neutral	i was very pleased with the responsiveness of the agency , the efficiency of the process , and the quick_turnaround .
neutral	unfortunately , there were a few typos , formatting problems , and translation errors in the translations i received for approval , so clients need to be sure to proofread .
neutral	the agency is now in the process of revising based on my corrections .
neutral	the products are nice but the shipping is so slow that you begin to wonder_if your item may have been lost in the mail .
neutral	however , the company was quick to respond to my shipping inquires .
neutral	the only problem being they didn_'_t have any way to track the items so even_though they were quick to respond they weren_'_t of much assistance .
neutral	petflow still has not delivered a product that i ordered .
neutral	it has_been over a week .
neutral	the dog_food samples and dog_bone were delivered quickly .
neutral	the stuffed dog toy still is mia .
neutral	comfortable buses , informative guides but too rushed .
neutral	the crowds for the ticket line and the security at windsor castle meant we didn_'_t have the time to see the things that were described on the goldentours website as being included .
neutral	same problem in bath .
neutral	too much packed into 0 day .
neutral	they shouldn_'_t offer a tour that is unrealistic to complete in 0 day .
neutral	i received the exact part i saw online and paid for .
neutral	i was pleased and anxious to put my new mirror on but then i noticed a small disappointment , the corner of the base was chipped off ( and a good amount ).
neutral	i was flustered and upset they would send a broken part .
neutral	when i went back to check the box , the piece broken off was laying there .
neutral	it must have chipped while being shipped .
neutral	i ' d recommend to start using bubble_wrap , etc .
neutral	to keep the parts in good condition while being shipped .
neutral	fortunately i have super glue so i made a quick fix but i was still disappointed .
neutral	i wish it were easier to cancel when i am ready .
neutral	the time spent on the bus was great - the narrative was very informative and we enjoyed the on - off ability , and buses showed_up very regularly .
neutral	however , we had two frustrations : 0 . we thought we booked the online buy 00 hour / get additional 00_hours free , but when we got to the print page it was only a one day pass - i emailed for assistance and got no response ; on the bus no one would help either .
neutral	0 .
neutral	no where does it list the time the buses stop running .
neutral	we got off at harrods at 0 : 00 and were surprised to find when we wanted to get back on at 0 : 00 that all buses were done for the night !
neutral	there is so much to see london by night , we were shocked to find the buses stop running so early .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t call it " friction " rather , disappointment .
neutral	because i '_m disabled ordering over the internet is easiest for me , and i have to do it as my cash flow is in good shape .
neutral	before i ordered i called and asked what the shelf_life of the product was so that if i get two bags right_away , there ' d be plenty of time to use it .
neutral	( sometimes i '_ve got to put my cat on a diet , so usage can vary .)
neutral	when i got the product a few_days ago i checked the expiration_dates .
neutral	one bag the dry chicken / turkey expires april of 0000 , and the other may of 0000 .
neutral	when i called back to check this out i was told that 00 - 00 months was the high end .
neutral	based on current usage i should be ok , but ... anyway i was disappointed .
neutral	am glad i didn_'_t order more .
neutral	will have to wait and see how it all works out usage wise .
neutral	when i called back the customer_service rep , javier , was very nice about the whole thing .
neutral	generally i '_m very happy with the service provided .
neutral	that said , i paid_extra for the time annotations and found that the time annotations made were not done in a consistent fashion and therefore were not useful .
neutral	also , the time annotations were done using the wrong timescale .
neutral	finally , there were some mistakes in the expertise due to lack of domain expertise .
neutral	i suppose it '_s too much to expect that the person doing the transcription be an expert in big data technologies but due to these mistakes i had to review the transcription very carefully and fix it .
neutral	i have been buying from ecigwizard for around 0 months now .
neutral	i can not complain regarding their delivery service but and this is a big but ......
neutral	i have bought 0 x ecig ( same ones ) over 0 months because they only seem to last a short time .
neutral	i know that these e cigs are not meant to last forever but i expect them to last a bit longer_than a few_weeks .
neutral	i have written to them twice_now but am yet to get a reply .
neutral	i will now be taking my business elsewhere .
neutral	i would advise people to go elsewhere to .
neutral	their website isn_'_t too bad .
neutral	it '_s nicely_laid_out , has a large amount of merchandise , and is easy enough to use .
neutral	however , it could use some updates to make it easier to navigate .
neutral	checkout is relatively fast compared to some other_websites .
neutral	the translation of my marriage certificate from spanish to english seems to be accurate , as i have given it to multiple references in attempt to change my last name and it was submitted successfully .
neutral	however , i met great resistance not only with the texas dps , but also with the social_security administration office for it '_s acceptance .
neutral	the dps insisted that we use a " reputable " company that was not " online ."
neutral	the social_security office said they wouldn_'_t accept it either , and luckily had a spanish speaking staff_member to translate when we arrived .
neutral	not sure if i should recommend this company to anyone i know , especially in texas , since i had such a difficult time getting what i needed .
neutral	shipping takes too long to ship and to gwt to destination
neutral	plant material always arrives well_packed and shipped promptly .
neutral	i have been ordering from brighterblooms for several_years .
neutral	the quality has diminished and good deals are rare .
neutral	the charge for inferior plants becomes most evident because the plant material has_been less_than robust lately .
neutral	my last order included many root bound plants .
neutral	i am going to back off from placing more orders until i feel that local vendors cannot compete with this nursery for price and quality .
neutral	the flowers arrived on time for valentine '_s day .
neutral	however they were not what i expected .
neutral	the picture online showed white calla lilies in the arrangement but there were none in the bouquet .
neutral	i was disappointed because those are my favorite flowers and i wanted to share my favorite with my love .
neutral	the order and product arrived_promptly .
neutral	the ink i ordered was for an epson .
neutral	0 of the inks worked and 0 could not be seen by the printer .
neutral	this has created a major problem because my printer will not work without all of it '_s ink .
neutral	i have used other_companies and have not had this problem .
neutral	i probably will not order from them again .
neutral	i am still_waiting for the tv even_though the website said it was instock at the time to be called to say it was not , hopefully i will recieve it soon .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t have tried this service had it not been for the groupon offer .
neutral	i like the autoship discount option .
neutral	but the person_who " packs with care " in shipping obviously didn_'_t pay_attention to the fact that they were shipping grain - free food or they wouldn_'_t have put in a free bag of whole grain treats .
neutral	otherwise it seems like a good option if i couldn_'_t make it to the store on my own .
neutral	i came in on 0 / 00 with a tire that had a slow_leak .
neutral	i had to stop several_times during the day to inflate tire .
neutral	went into town_fair in leominster and they " repaired " the tire .
neutral	i didn_'_t even make it home and had to refill the tire .
neutral	went back to store on 0 / 00 to purchase a new tire .
neutral	purchased one for approximately_$_000 . 00 they didn_'_t even reimburse the $ 0 . 00 they charged me to fix the tire the day before .
neutral	oh well , have a new tire all is well .
neutral	i do have to say they were very quick with the repair and the new tire installment , so that was nice .
neutral	oh , also all the gentleman working there were very , very nice .
neutral	these fins are fab the only problem is my 00 year_old is struggling to use them because they are so heavy .
neutral	therefore she is putting them away until she is older and poor old mum and dad have got to get some different ones .
neutral	overall though they are a lovely product .
neutral	my son was so excited to receive his controller which i really didn_'_t want to spend so much on but did anyway and when he received it we called to find that it wasn_'_t working_properly i paid_extra to have it shipped faster to now have to send it back and pay for shipping again to have him wait disappointingly .
neutral	hopefully they will get it right this time around it was nice of them to offer two more mods but i hope the express ship it as well as far as coming in exactly the way we ordered it that part was perfect we were happy with the colors he picked but it was kind of expensive
neutral	my order arrived right_away , the products were reasonably_priced .
neutral	however , they spelled my name wrong and sent a thank_you card to the shipping address rather_than myself , the person_who ordered , which isn_'_t too smart .
neutral	dispatch and delivery were very efficient .
neutral	however the xl sizes were on the small size so had to be returned to get the xxl .
neutral	not great for my husband '_s self esteem on father '_s day .
neutral	i love beach house beach wear and have several different_styles of suits .
neutral	i wear a solid 00 in the tops and the 00 in the swim dresses are a perfect fit for me .
neutral	i ordered the shirren top in orange , size 00 .
neutral	no way !!
neutral	it was more like a size 0 - 0 and i nearly strangled myself trying to get it on .
neutral	finally , i stepped into it , barely got it over my hips , and i looked like i had been stuffed into a sausage casing .
neutral	this was not a good look for me .
neutral	i ended_up giving that particular suit to my teenage_daughter ( it looks great on her ) and i ordered the geo - print racer back instead .
neutral	i do not know if it was in the details that that particular type top runs_small but since all of my others fit so well ( yes , i ordered them online , too ) that this would be no different .
neutral	it all worked out but beware the shirren tops !!!
neutral	beach house is still my favorite swim brand of all time , regardless !
neutral	fab products but just too pricey - apple need to include those of us who invested originally by offering incentives to stay with them - the iphones are getting ridiculous in price !
neutral	felt the costume was of a superior standard to those i had tried endlessly on the high_street , delivery quick , just in time for my holiday .
neutral	some of the verses are worded too differently from the original verse .
neutral	last shipment most of the cans of cat_food were dented .
neutral	i didnt like that .
neutral	hope it won_'_t happen again .
neutral	i never got either of my free gifts or one elemis set ... disappointed ... hopefully it all arrives monday or i won_'_t order again ..
neutral	i choose the hotel for the area and price and that it had parking .
neutral	was disappointed to find that the parking_lot underground was full .
neutral	had to find parking around the block on the street because parking is so tight in the city areas .
neutral	in addition i didn_'_t want to drag our_luggage so_far to the hotel so my only option was to illegally park in front of the hotel long enough to get our suitcase out of the car which made me uncomfortable because this made me block other vehicles .
neutral	room small , especially bathroom .
neutral	i had a lot of trouble with their site , it was constantly making me reload the page on my browser and on my mobile .
neutral	so i finally got an order placed and waited 00 days , it didnt arrive .
neutral	i tried_calling them and no answer .
neutral	there was no email address to contact them , i had to use a form on their crappy site , which gave_me more errors , so i could_barely fill_out their form .
neutral	finally the bags ( bogo ) got here today took about 00 days , thats with the free_shipping .
neutral	so if you want it in a reasonable amount of time and want tracking_info , dont get the free_shipping .
neutral	the bags smell pretty strong of petrol and dye .
neutral	hoping it will fade .
neutral	the quality looks exactly as_pictured .
neutral	but it is fake leather and you can tell it '_s similar quality to what you ' d buy at target .
neutral	hope they hold up to average use .
neutral	will update again in a few_months if they bags break or whatever .
neutral	it should be made clear during booking if breakfast is included or not .
neutral	i think ancestry is amazing overall .
neutral	however , i have been less_than thrilled with the way the dna matching results have been sliding downhill .
neutral	at first i was deluged with possible matches but nothing for a very long time now .
neutral	also , about 00_% of possible matches are soooo distant that finding a common ancestor is impossible .
neutral	on top of that about 00_% have no tree online .
neutral	who has time to contact hundreds of no tree people asking them to please give you access to their tree !
neutral	so , i got dead space .. which is kinda upsetting since i already have it on origin ..
neutral	i ordered a product with a free_shipping option .
neutral	the product came as shown / described and met my standards .
neutral	however i ordered the product on 0 / 00 , it was coming from california and shipping usually only takes a few_days .
neutral	it showed_up a full 0 days_later , after the first leg of shipping was done via_fedex or ups ( can '_t remember now ) - then it was handed off to usps to complete - delaying the shipping a full day and a half .
neutral	i spoke with the folks at usps and they explained that some sellers hand off shipments to them to save a few_dollars .
neutral	it was a frustrating experience as we needed the shipment before we could leave for a weekend adventure on the 00th .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t received it as it is still on back order .
neutral	i really like all their items , only_disappointment is that the shoes are not true to size ,
neutral	it is very difficult to find a hotel with beds that are not hard as a rock .
neutral	the beds and pillows were wonderful .
neutral	i did not wake_up with a backache .
neutral	the room was very clean but we did see a roach , being in florida i understand this is not unusual .
neutral	the waffle maker broke_down and so we could not make a waffle .
neutral	over all i give this hotel a 0 out of 0 rating .
neutral	friendly staff ....
neutral	booked for 0 . 00 collection , at 0 . 00 on the m00 with no traffic ( for once !)
neutral	knew we were going to be there early .
neutral	rang the office and told them we would be there at 0 . 00 and told someone would try to meet us early .
neutral	sat for half an_hour then rang again as it was our fault we were early but it was now out booked time .
neutral	was told someone would be there in 0 / 00_minutes .
neutral	00_minutes later rang again and was told another 0 mins .
neutral	this carried on until 0 . 00 when i insisted someone was there immediately as we needed to check in .
neutral	someone finally turned_up at 00 . 00 , did the usual checks and we were on our way !
neutral	collection on the way back was fortunately very different !
neutral	we rang them while collection our_luggage and only waited for a couple of minutes for our car to be returned .
neutral	yes it was our fault for being early but we still had to wait another 00_minutes after our booked collection time which was not the start we needed for our holiday !!
neutral	!
neutral	specs were even better on than i could of imagined .
neutral	it makes it all the worthwhile when the products are far less ordering on line than buying from the highstreet .
neutral	very disappointed with the rejection of calls to customer_services .
neutral	and not even back on as they had indicated in the automated_message left for callers .
neutral	i love the great deals that pet_flow has but i have a hard time with their log in and sign out being computer friendly .
neutral	i will always call to confirm and lately i have been getting a grouchy person trying to figure_out what i did wrong and what steps i took .
neutral	so i am a little reluctant to order anymore but have no choice because you have such great deals on your bully_sticks and etta mae sticks .
neutral	having bought a very nice coat for £_000 i didn_'_t expect it to arrive in a very tatty box covered in parcel tape and someone_else '_s address scribbled out .
neutral	clearly this was a returns box .
neutral	then when i got the the coat out of its polythene bag the base / hem was dirty and scuffed , perhaps worn or ex - shop display .
neutral	not the end of the world but really not the standard of item or service you ' d expect for that money .
neutral	i was a little disappointed in the quality
neutral	haven_'_t gotten sticker yet , but would appreciate a us postal shipping option !
neutral	good service , nice variety of clothing available but the quality of clothing is poor to good with the description online not being a true representation of the product
neutral	i emailed to ask where my order was , i did get a speedy response to say my parcel had been lost .
neutral	super dry asked if i wanted to cancel my order and have a refund .
neutral	i chose to have my order re - dispatched .
neutral	i then received an_email offering next_day delivery .
neutral	i thought i would receive this service as i had explained that the t shirts i ordered where for a birthday_present .
neutral	i finally received my items 0 days_later .
neutral	i did email to ask why it then took 0 days not the next_day as_advertised , but have had no response as yet .
neutral	the t - shirts are great though !!!
neutral	just delivery a problem .
neutral	glad you reminded me of my order , as its been such a long time since i placed the order and have not yet received it .
neutral	would gladly rate it if i had it .
neutral	sorry i can '_t help you at this time .
neutral	hi , i have been ordering nearly every six_weeks for relatives for a couple years
neutral	i now know that kansas steaks will do all shipping for $ 0 . 00
neutral	chicago steaks prices at sales are good but then shipping hits it all back up
neutral	consider your competition to keep the business
neutral	i love the monitoring i get from identity_guard , but there are a few problems i have run_into on the app and on the website .
neutral	which is annoying since i pay monthly to be able to look at my credit_report .
neutral	hopefully it will be fixed soon or i will cancel the whole thing .
neutral	we rented two cars , the first one in nice ( from hertz ), the second one in pavia ( from europcar ).
neutral	in nice , the service was very professional and the car excellent .
neutral	in pavia , the car that we rented was parked on a side street outside the city .
neutral	the europcar employee drove us there without much explanation , dropped us in front of the car and just left .
neutral	the car was dirty and possibly the tiniest compact model that exists .
neutral	we called europcar and offered to pay extra for a bigger car , but they were not willing to accomodate us .
neutral	overall , an unpleasant experience .
neutral	the dress is great no_complaints at all , however the company they used to ship it to us in small town saskatchewan was just_plain awful !
neutral	i live in a town where dhl does not deliver to so it sat in saskatoon for 0_weeks , ii called daily they kept promising it would be sent out , i finally drove the 0 . 0 hours to the city to get it .
neutral	i emailed new_york dress , but of course they couldn_'_t do anything about it .
neutral	i would not order again if they used the same shipping company .
neutral	i ordered several items this time .
neutral	i have only had part of the order as the other item is not in stock .
neutral	i have been kept_informed by hq_hair as to the progress of the outstanding items but so_far they have not appeared .
neutral	i am disappointed at this as i am a regular customer and this site is cheaper on average than buying direct from my salon .
neutral	over all i am pleased with your service .
neutral	i do not however understand_why sometimes i am charged more for parking then other times .
neutral	i truely love the prescription sun_glasses i received but was very disappointed in the fact that my prescription was made wrong .
neutral	customer_service was very nice and understanding and got back to me the next_day .
neutral	when i called in to ask why my pupillary_distance was off by 00 mm they said that the style i chose did not allow my pupillary_distance to be made correctly .
neutral	why was this not part of the information prior to ordering ?
neutral	why didn_'_t someone call or email to inform me ?
neutral	what a waste of someone '_s time and resources if they knew it couldn_'_t be made correctly the first time !
neutral	my first time experience was that you do not get an instant decision , once approved you then have to either pay a further £_00 to get the cash the same day or wait another 0 days , all in all 0 days from applying i got the money but the amount of interest first quoted was not reduced to reflect the adjustment in the amount of days i actually had the money .
neutral	when you call you give your account number and date of birth to the automated_system , which you then have to repeat when you speak to an advisor - increased time on phone .
neutral	customer_service advisors are not quick to pick_up on your query or understand your request .
neutral	i explained i had paid for early_morning delivery , only 0 of my 0 items was available for delivery today , i wouldn_'_t have bothered if i ' d have known that .
neutral	but the 0 item had not arrived by 00 . 00 , the advisor was telling_me my item had arrived when i obviously knew it had not , when she finally understood she did give me a refund .
neutral	i do find it frustrating to keep explaining simple things , i would hate to have a complex query !
neutral	this is a fantastic product and print is great but the offers online are annoying .
neutral	if you buy anything with an offer on you can '_t use the free delivery for orders over_£_00 even_though your order came over this amount and you can '_t order more than one product at a time if they have offers on so you have to order them separately and pay delivery on each item it '_s stupid and really annoying and that puts me off buying again 😞
neutral	i ordered this card for a xmas_present .
neutral	on the 00th , i just received it today .
neutral	a little late for a present .
neutral	not real impressed since they charged my account 00 days ago .
neutral	plus they charged my to send it .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	probably_won_'_t recommend it to my other lyoness customers , sorry
neutral	we visited one hot sunday in june , and thought that the buses would be the ideal way to get around .
neutral	unfortunately , everyone else had the same idea - and even worse , the drivers kept allowing people onto the bus .
neutral	we were stood at the front of the bus when even more people were getting on , and ended_up with no room at all .
neutral	the guide at the stop in kensington said it would be best to get on , as the start of the route was only 0 stops away - which was not correct .
neutral	i '_ve entered my order as customized sunglasses and afterworths it seemd that i '_ve ordered a standard package .
neutral	so i was a little disappointed to see that colours and lenses weren_'_t as selected during the ordering process .
neutral	i am a frequent cruiser residing in bradenton but accessing many ports .... the website i made my reservation on was boldly advertised with the name global_parking .... upon_arriving in miami to park , the signage was all advertised as premier parking .... i wasted time and driving around trying to find global ... upon pulling into premier to ask the attendant where global was , i was informed that it was indeed the correct place and if i had read all the verbage detail on my receipt i would have known that ... hmmmm .... true , but i think that it could be more easily identified as i am confident that i am not the only one to be lost due to this confusion .... the shuttle driver that took us to the cruise port on 0 / 0 was very nice and helpful ... however on the return trip on 0 / 0 this one was not friendly and spent the entire trip messing with his cell_phone and taking a call ... not the safest driving efforts .... he then stopped the van at the bottom of a hill in the parking_garage to put us all out for our cars .... we all said we were parked higher up and requested that he go further so we would not all have to pull all of our_luggage so_far uphill ... definitely didn_'_t have his mind on the job at hand accomodating the customers ... this was my first experience with your company ... a little_apprehensive_about a repeat ....
neutral	was disappointed that the product was no_longer available
neutral	i heard and saw good reviews about banggood , so i thought i give it a try .
neutral	my first orders were a few make - up products , a scarf and a purse .
neutral	my scarf came in within a week , but i had such a bad_experience with my other orders .
neutral	my make - ups weren_'_t shipped until a month after my order was placed !
neutral	then after waiting a whole month , i asked them where my item was and they told me they had shipped it back to hong_kong !
neutral	i was upset that they didn_'_t give me a notice .
neutral	so i waited a total of 0 months to receive my make - ups , but in addition they gave_me more points .
neutral	then with the purse , after two months , they had sent me another purse .
neutral	their customer_service was going well until when i got done being patient they avoided me on chat .
neutral	like when we were live chatting , when i asked them about my items , they would leave the chat room right_away .
neutral	i was confused !
neutral	then i tried e_- mail .
neutral	of course when i got mad , it took them almost 0_weeks to reply back !
neutral	overall , i was satisfied with the qualities and the price , so i '_m going to give them another chance , this time with clothing and see how that goes .
neutral	if it goes bad again , i don_'_t think i '_m going to order there again .
neutral	reliable but most of the time , overpriced and if you look for a bit longer , you will find it cheaper elsewhere , please_note that i have only purchased one football ticket on this site and found out it was 00_% cheaper else where .
neutral	le modèles des 0 paires acheté me plaisent juste les chaussures rouge que_je_suis un_peu déçu parce qu ' on voit la colle qui déborde les coutures .
neutral	par compte le délai est rapide , j ' ai apprécié , puis livré à domicile gratuitement c ' est_très_bien .
neutral	i really appreciated it when you could search for a trip including dates around the ones you entered .
neutral	i liked the calendar that would appear showing the different prices on all of the dates surrounding your search .
neutral	it was a pain to have to keep switching the search dates over and over to try to find the best price for a flight .
neutral	i found the changes to the website got rid of a lot of the user - friendly options that depended on when using travelocity in the past .
neutral	these changes also took away the option to send my itinerary to multiple email_addresses , which was annoying .
neutral	when i finished my transaction , i wasn_'_t quite sure everything was done until a confirmation_email popped into my inbox some minutes later .
neutral	all - told , it was a fairly frustrating experience .
neutral	it has_been a week since the thundershirt shipped and am still_waiting on it .
neutral	can '_t comment on anything_else because i don_'_t have the item yet .
neutral	if you need your item fast i ' d suggest finding some one else .
neutral	the shoes were nice but didn_'_t get what i ordered
neutral	please do not use dpd they are incompetant and useless .
neutral	three_times they have tried to despatch my item from jules_b and three_times they say they cannot locate the address , despite me emailing them with my mobile number after the first time , ( which they already have ) and ringing them up ( which is extremely ardious as there is no number readily_available and the number you get through to is automated mostly .)
neutral	arghhhhh !!
neutral	!
neutral	any company that uses such poor couriers should rethink who they use as it has put me off using joulsb again .
neutral	i have used ebay , as a dollhouse collector , for 00 years - and for many of those years it was awesome .
neutral	now , sadly , like so many businesses , they have gotten greedy .
neutral	they not only cater more and more to buyers who have ' remorse ' and want a refund - but ebay is now charging 00 - 00_% to seller '_s of the total price of the item including the shipping .
neutral	that is outrageous .
neutral	i just finished a round of selling and after selling 00 items ( including hummels , etc_.)
neutral	and paying postage , netted about $_00 . 00 total .
neutral	next time , think i '_ll just donate them and let the hospice thrift_store get the money .
neutral	greed spoils everything .
neutral	i recieved the part quickly which was great but the pipes were uneven on the muffler and one was longer and the tip was dented also ....
neutral	we recently went to zen chinese restaurant on the embankment which was a beautiful venue and the restaurant was clean .
neutral	it was disappointing to get a 00_% service charge on the whole bill - we had paid £_00 . 00 for a £_00 meal and we had one extra drink ( coke ) and starters which brought the bill around an extra £_00 .
neutral	we was charged 00_% on the whole meal - adding the whole amount , adding 00_% and then taking £_00 off which i though was really cheeky so we will not being going back .
neutral	i was aware that there would be a service charge but did not think it included the amount of the agree voucher .
neutral	i think the details on the voucher offer should be clearer so customers are aware .
neutral	the quality and price are very good , however delivery was cancelled by the warehouse without letting_me know , i had to call them to find out , and then pay extra delivery charge to get it to me on the next delivery day .
neutral	added stress to an already stressful time .
neutral	the age categories on your site - lumping everyone over 00 into the same demographic - made me laugh , then made me wonder : maybe i '_m not supposed to be here ( i '_m 00 and wandering central america with an ancient 00 year - old .)
neutral	more troubling : the ten per_cent fee you charge , a big_hit for a host in comparison to other_sites like airbnb .
neutral	my host lost $_00 .
neutral	since i don_'_t want to ripoff hosts , i '_ll book elsewhere .
neutral	the products and services are fine .
neutral	but i get flooded with emails from petflow .
neutral	after i have just purchased a huge supply of chews and food , do they think i need to place another order right_away ?
neutral	i have a small dog !
neutral	he doesn_'_t eat that much .
neutral	and then they put time limits on the next " deal " i can get on food .
neutral	like i said , we haven_'_t even opened the bag we just got .
neutral	how can i even take_advantage of any of their special_offers if they are offered for only a limited time ?
neutral	it '_s a good company i think and they are helpful on the phone .
neutral	but they need to stop with all these emails .
neutral	it '_s so annoying , i am ready to unsubscribe and then i will miss something ... but i '_m missing it now since i no_longer open or read anything they send me ,
neutral	i have introduced wowcher website and referred to other friends and family_members .
neutral	only be cautious when booking a holiday especially when there are set dates as from personal experiences that this maybe over sold , what should have been a short vacation to milan in august has now been arranged for november .
neutral	this has cost far more than what was stated as having to pay for an extra day to accommodate the company '_s availability for flights and hotel .
neutral	i have been impressed up until that point with holiday i felt that more should have been done to protect the customers needs rather_than having endless battles to try a rectify the problem myself ?
neutral	the part was fine however i emailed and called to ask question - never got a response
neutral	overall , it was a nice stay .
neutral	however , we were somewhat disappointed for a few reasons .
neutral	the pictures online are very misleading .
neutral	our room was very small and i felt that it was overpriced for the quality and size .
neutral	the view was pretty but they also make it seem like your room is right on the beach with your own personal fire_pit .
neutral	that is not the case .
neutral	you have to walk around the hotel to get to three gas fire pits located right next to each other , not on the beach , but on some sand placed on the grass far from the actual beach itself .
neutral	the staff was very nice and although there are things i '_m warming you about , it was overall not a bad hotel .
neutral	using 0 capsules per cup , so going to try stronger , capsules are bigger_than nes presso so have t o squeeze them in .
neutral	due to size have to empty used capsule holder more frequently .
neutral	is there a way to dispose used capsules that is safe to environment
neutral	just would like to say , if one hast just a booking to do , it works great , but if this booking has to be changed stress is announced .
neutral	you should make this easyer .
neutral	thanks
neutral	i bought a spot on mite treatment for rabbits , the price was reasonable and i upgraded from the free 0nd_class delivery to 0st_class as i wanted it quicker .
neutral	the product is good , although instructions with treatment guidelines would have been handy , and the delivery was slow for 0st_class - it was no faster_than 0nd_class .
neutral	taxes are not included in the list price so can come as a shock when you go to pay - it does add considerably to your bill .
neutral	i love the site !
neutral	i do .
neutral	i only have a problem with s &_h .
neutral	because there '_s not many options , i feel_like i have to wait for my favorites to go on sale so the money i " save " can be used for s &_h instead .
neutral	i would like to buy more things from yesstyle throughout the year and may only have enough for one or two items at a time .
neutral	please consider a range of s &_h options so i may pick which one is best for me and my wallet .
neutral	thanks !
neutral	my item arrived_promptly 0 days after i ordered but was left_outside my door despite the package saying do not leave without a signature !
neutral	as always , the quality of my bed_linen is great .
neutral	however , when i decide to treat our bed to a new look , even if it is in the sale , cologne and cotton are not the most competively_priced on the market .
neutral	so , when it arrives in the post , scrunched up in a tiny plastic_bag ( we ' re talking a super king duvet_cover , sheet and pillow_cases here ) its more than a little_disappointing to take it out and see it doesn_'_t even look new it '_s so wrinkled and poorly wrapped .
neutral	very poor - particularly when i compare it to purchases i '_ve made in store .
neutral	i '_m not asking for excessive , wasteful packaging , just something that '_s fit for purpose .
neutral	i know the site is changing , but navigating it takes more steps than it should .
neutral	putting big pictures up in no particular order is just one more time_consuming effort .
neutral	it '_s cluttered and even using the new icons it '_s over - done .
neutral	category searching results in more big event pictures and too many pages .
neutral	why not provide a preference to users of a list or single page view ?
neutral	this makeover is exactly_what makes people go to other_sites .
neutral	it '_s not simpler , it '_s even more complicated .
neutral	good luck on improving clarity and cleanliness .
neutral	i didn_'_t require cover for a second year but my credit_card details have been used to renew my own policy & my boyfriends policy without my permission automatically .
neutral	i buy from this site at_least once a month and 0 / 00 times it '_s great but they have sent me the wrong_size of things 0x and returning or exchanging something is such a process .
neutral	i '_ve also waited over an_hour on more than one occasion to speak to someone and they don_'_t seem all that organized .
neutral	due to a fault with my oil_tank guage i ran_out of oil last wednesday_evening .
neutral	i ordered more oil first thing thursday_morning , paying for the express service even_though it said it would be delivered on or before the following_tuesday ie , 0 working days but in reality at_least 0 days with no heating or hot_water , the temp outside around zero , and the probablility i would have to get a heating engineer in to restart the boiler .
neutral	i then rang boilerjuice at_0am to explain my problem and ask that as a regular customer if there was anyway it could be delivered sooner and was told that the matter was now with the oil company .
neutral	i rang the oil company who said they couldn_'_t change the delivery date to any sooner as the booking had come through boilerjuice and not me personally .
neutral	i rang around some local companies who could deliver on the friday but i then discovered that boilerjuice had taken the money out of my account so i would have to pay another £_000 for another company to deliver which i could not afford .
neutral	the oil was delivered on monday_afternoon , and sure enough there was an airlock and i had to get a boiler engineer to visit .
neutral	i use a local company who said they were booked solid for at_least 0 days , but when i explained that i had had no heating / hot_water for 0 days and they know me and that i am a single mum with 0 children on half term , made an extra appointment the next_morning for an engineer to visit on his way in to work .
neutral	both boilerjuice and the oil delivery company were very polite but there was no facility to be treated as a special case on this occasion .
neutral	the local boiler engineer company however bent_over backwards to look after me as one of their customers .
neutral	i think boilerjuice is a great idea and i have been happy with it until now , but i am going to use my local oil company from now on so that i can get that personal service if something goes_wrong .
neutral	the room was very clean .. the hotel a little older could use updates , free breakafst nice except you needed a breakfast coupon which i believe they should have told you when checking in .. the bar area was nice as well as swimming_pool and jacuzzi .
neutral	staff a little unfriendly but not enough to ruin the stay .
neutral	i would stay here again .
neutral	if you are looking to purchase a substantial number of egift cards , there are better vendors out there .
neutral	if you are looking to purchase under 0 - this is a great site to purchase from .
neutral	quick , fair transcription service
neutral	in this day and age one loves to be able to order things online and have them sent .
neutral	what you want is for it to be sent with ease .
neutral	i would love to be able to get and receive gift_cards electronically if so desired vs having to go through the torture of the mail and having to have someone sign for it on the other end .
neutral	ruins the whole thing of being a surprise .
neutral	from now on i think i '_ll just buy gift_cards and put them in the mail .
neutral	chair cover described as " quilted cotton " seems to be something other than cotton , very slippery , does not stay in place , un - usable .
neutral	there was too may people on the bus , so we had to stand and could not see anything or listen to the announcements as there were no spare spaces to plug the head phones .
neutral	got eventually out to change to the red_route , whilest we were waiting , 0 fairly empty blue_route busses past us .
neutral	obviously there is no communication between the busses .
neutral	half of the round_trip we had to stand and could not hear the announcements , so it was just a usual crowded bus_ride in london .
neutral	we really_enjoyed the boots tour , the guys where amazing .
neutral	thanks
neutral	unffortunately , the inkfarm brand did not fit my printer , and i had to return the ink
neutral	cartridges .
neutral	they said i would get a refund , been 0_weeks , and no refund , yet .
neutral	i called your service twice , using 0 different numbers .
neutral	the bottom_line is that you gave_me the best price available .
neutral	price matters a lot to me .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	i spoke with a man_who wanted to give me info that i didn_'_t need or want .
neutral	he spoke so fast that i actually said " stop " a couple of times .
neutral	i asked if i could contact the hotel_directly ..... and i was told " no ".
neutral	wrong .
neutral	we used_skypark last_year at the multi story in wythenshaw and it was great .
neutral	never used this one before and not sure about parting with the £ 0 . 00 for the airport ?
neutral	but will review when we get back .
neutral	i ordered a front hood embel for my bmw and ended_up only a decal .
neutral	though i would get more !
neutral	!
neutral	the usual online ticket experience until my credit_card was rejected due to billing_address not matching card .
neutral	so that caused a snag .
neutral	then i used a different card .
neutral	same problem !
neutral	no way !
neutral	i called my card , they said the fraud dept put a hold due to ' unusual foreign activity '.
neutral	meanwhile i had tried to contact customer_service , i am no xenophobe but was rattled to find the small_print in farsi !
neutral	eventually i filed a contact report and was sent a no reply til 00_hours .
neutral	then they requested , y review and still no ticket !
neutral	i was growing worried , last few seats on the plane , then i happened to visit my spam inbox and there was the long lost ticket - so thanks to fraud_alert and spam filters this gave_me a bad time .
neutral	the service is fine .
neutral	i just think that a lot of the items are one - sized and it '_s very difficult to size them properly .
neutral	a lot of the time , they seem to be medium or large , and i '_m a very petite woman and this makes it difficult to shop .
neutral	i recently field my taxes using turbotax since they claimed it would be free .
neutral	while their software was relatively easy to step through , wizard style , i was upset that they charged me a fee .
neutral	they had claimed that i would be able to file state and federal taxes if i paid for turbotax basic , so i did this , and they then wanted $_00 more to file the state taxes anyway .
neutral	as i had already paid , i continued to file my federal taxes with them , but elected to file state taxes through my state '_s website .
neutral	i don_'_t care how good your wizard is , don_'_t lie to me about the cost of something after i '_ve already made it to the end .
neutral	next time , i '_ll go elsewhere with my information .
neutral	paypal is governed purely_by its own rules !
neutral	as a buyer it is great as you are completely protected for any sales placed online .
neutral	as a seller forget it , they hold money for long_periods of time without_any reason , seller support are terrible and they are not able to deal with professional sellers with large volumes being put through daily .
neutral	booking was easy , and the car_rental we selected ( fox , miami ) was cheaper_than all the others .
neutral	the only_complaint i have is when i printed out the confirmation for my booking at the car_rental , travelocity did not include their address .
neutral	i did not realize this until we were in the cab trying to find them .
neutral	the receipt only had the miami airport , and fox is located somewhere_else .
neutral	we tried to call fox , and they do not answer the phone on a sunday , so the taxi had to drop us at the airport , which was farther away from the cruise line we just left , and we took the shuttle to the car_rental_agency .
neutral	i will remember to look for the address next time .
neutral	but , it would be nice if travelocity would include the address and maybe even a map of the location we booked .
neutral	thanks ,
neutral	when i sent my books there was no damage to the binder and also one of the books was a teachers edition that obviously the college had sold my daughter but i would have no way of knowing that .
neutral	they wanted to charge to return the books but eventually waived the fee and sent them back to me .
neutral	the agent was difficult to understand .
neutral	it sounded_like he was new to the job and reading off of a script .
neutral	he repeated himself over and over again and needed the same information repeated to him several_times .
neutral	his accent made it hard for me to understand him .
neutral	he was polite and did try , but it took to long to complete the reservation and i felt_like the agent could use more training .
neutral	just booked birmingham meet and greet , cant find any instructions on where to go when we get to airport , am making assumptions ,....... booked gatwick earlier , explicit instructions , why does birmingham always make things more difficult ????
neutral	we all like to know what we need to do well in advance .
neutral	i have used flora_queen many_times and always been happy .
neutral	however this last time i did , i sent flowers for my mums_birthday .
neutral	i ordered the ' medium ' size , i think it is called ' deluxe ' and they turned_up tiny !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i mean 0inch stems .
neutral	they looked so small , it made them look like a mini bouquet .
neutral	i was very very disappointed and upset about this , so i have email flora_queen to let them know what has happened , and included pictures .
neutral	but unfortunately have had no response .
neutral	so i am very disappointed and let_down by them at the moment , and will certainly be very hesitant to ever use them again .
neutral	which is a shame as i have been using them for years .
neutral	very let_down and unhappy - once very loyal_customer ,
neutral	lucy .
neutral	love the things that you can do on wowcher but when things go wrong , as they do in life , it '_s an_absolute nightmare dealing_with these people , it '_s like they have had your money and they couldn_'_t give a shit about you now .
neutral	they are dreadful . would sure put you off buying again , and that '_s a shame because in all other aspects i enjoyed my experiences .
neutral	hola me gustaria saber que significa el estado de tu pedido en transformation ya_que he hecho un pedido hace hoy una semana y no sè nada de su estado .
neutral	gracias
neutral	good very nice well_done excellent thank_you for free_shipping
neutral	delivery time on website was stated as 0 - 0 days but it actually took 0 days to arrive .
neutral	other than that was happy with product .
neutral	it took three_weeks for my book to arrive .
neutral	i don_'_t remember the estimated delivery date being so_far out when i ordered .
neutral	i ordered something that went out of stock and they did not communicate that .
neutral	they sent the smaller order ( with a shipping fee ) which i did not have when i spent over $_00 like i planned .
neutral	they did return my shipping fee when asked , but they should not have charged it at all .
neutral	they should have told me and given me the option to add something to my order before they shipped ... don_'_t they know what they have in stock at the time of the order ?
neutral	i love the look of these sofas but i have a problem with one piece dropping to one side when sat on .
neutral	i have emailed made . com and i hope i receive a speedy reply and a solution to the problem .
neutral	i '_m not sure that these sofas will last as long as my previous sofa as i think they are cheaply_made .
neutral	will i buy from made . com in future ....
neutral	i '_m not sure !
neutral	hi .
neutral	i have loved the 0 lots of flowers i have ordered for friends lately .
neutral	however the delivery of some of them was questionable and the ability to check the progress of the delivery is not actually possible !
neutral	one lt of flowers was placed outside a friend '_s house nearly in the gutter !
neutral	they did not notice it for almost a day and it was half buried beneath garbage bags and a bicycle !
neutral	as i have tried to check the delivery status , the email redirects me to a site where you have to put in a card reference_number , but it is not the order number or any number that is given when you make the order online wiht iflorist .
neutral	so not really sure where this is coming from and thus does not allow you to check the status of your delivery .
neutral	while i have found these things difficult , i have liked the flowers and pricing and my friends have been pleasantly_surprised , thus i would order from iflorist again , however would recommend you try and sort these type of difficulties out to improve things .
neutral	thanks !
neutral	didn_'_t realise when i booked this on the internet i used a third_party site .
neutral	subsequently there was no phone_number to ring upon_arrival at the airport resulting in complete confusion and loads of stress !!
neutral	thankfully a lovely lady at the airport car_park took pity on us and managed to get hold of the right people .
neutral	don_'_t know what would have happened if she hadn_'_t helped_us out .
neutral	so beware when booking car in that you get their official site and not a third_party .
neutral	otherwise would certainly use the meet and greet especially if flying early_morning .
neutral	dissapointed trim at bottom of curtains were of a different shade .
neutral	did not return as they had been on window for two_days before i
neutral	noticed , thought it was sun causing them to look different .
neutral	i ordered , then returned two_pairs of glasses from you .
neutral	i paid full postage for the trip back .
neutral	i then ordered the " sidewinder " by shuron and haven_'_t heard_anything since .
neutral	anna baker
neutral	rated 0_stars because i never received a shipping confirmation and everytime i had to check my account to see the status , it said processing order everday .
neutral	i had to email customer_service about why my order was not even processed for shipping yet they had took the money out of my account 0 days before .
neutral	then they sent me a late confirmation shipping notice after it was shipped out days before .
neutral	ive ordered 0 times .
neutral	every time there has_been an_issue with parcel_force .
neutral	on the first 0 occasions , they stuck a note under the door although we were home both_times ( small house , no noise etc ) so impossible if they actually knocked properly for us not to hear the door .
neutral	so i had to go get my delivery from the post_office which is a pain .
neutral	on the third occasion i walked with the note to the post_office in the rain ( which is a pain as i dont drive and have a small baby ) to collect again - and it was missing !
neutral	i was fuming .
neutral	for the extra price i pay for delivery this is no where near good enough , i had to rearrange my plans to stay home that day for them to redeliver .
neutral	0 times i have paid for a delivery service i have not received .
neutral	i found similar envelopes in town from a different supplier that i can collect for the same price per env without_having these annoying delivery problems and costs .
neutral	shame tho as you have a wider_range , and i was hoping to use world of envelopes for supply for my small business .
neutral	i am considering my options as i cant have parcelforce stuff me around like this again .
neutral	i was perfectly happy with everything i ordered from you , and had email notification of despatch on 00th_november ; however the goods did not arrive , although there was an abortive attempt at delivery on dec 0th , one week after despatch .
neutral	the parcel was not left at my home - due i can only assume to parcel_force choosing to ignore the instruction i ' d given with the order , which was clearly_displayed below the address label : " if out please leave in back porch and shut door ".
neutral	instead i got a card through the door ' we tried to deliver .
neutral	you were out ............. will try and deliver next working day .'
neutral	etc .
neutral	the goods finally were left in my back porch today ( 0th_december ) according to the original instructions ; the box was badly_damaged and no_longer completely sealed , although the contents were fine , thankfully
neutral	i suggest you might consider changing to a delivery service that allows parcel tracking and follows delivery instructions properly !
neutral	my only problem with this site was with the customizing of my card .
neutral	i tried over 00 different pictures and nothing worked .
neutral	i '_m bought the gift_card so my soon to be police officer boyfriend could buy his first gun .
neutral	i obviously knew a picture of a gun would not work but even the company logo , a picture of the word police , a picture of the phrase " officer in training " a picture of his motorcycle , etc .
neutral	i could not get anything to work .
neutral	i got numerous_emails regarding my picture selection and how it was not allowed .
neutral	other than that the site was easy to use and i received my gift_card pretty quick considering the holiday online order traffic .
neutral	the bouquet was quite nice but they were delivered to the wrong house .
neutral	fortunately the neighbor knew the intended recipient and brought the flowers to the right house .
neutral	i am not sure where the mix up occurred .
neutral	it was a bit frustrating because my order didn_'_t ship as soon as i thought it would .
neutral	and then one item didn_'_t ship with the other items and pet_flow did not notify me this was happeing .
neutral	due to the delay , i had to feed one of my dogs a food that she was not used to eating .
neutral	we all know that you are supposed to change a dog '_s diet slowly .
neutral	i was a bit upset that the site didn_'_t notify me of the shipping delay so that i could have made alternative plans to find the food elsewhere .
neutral	first , i thought i was booking through hampton_inn directly on their website , didnt realize i was booking through a 0rd_party .
neutral	then i realize i booked the wrong date when i got to the hotel and had to quick call to cancel and was put through the ringer bk close to the " 00 hour rule ."
neutral	seemed like the agent was trying to find a way to charge me .
neutral	first agent couldnt understand_english barely and i had to practically scream my email address bk she couldnt understand me .
neutral	then got hung_up on , called back , and got another agent whose english not so good .
neutral	overall , extremely frustrating and shady .
neutral	well , i expected to receive my part in a reasonable time_frame , but i '_m still_waiting for it .
neutral	it was shipped via_ups with a tracking_number and for some rediculous reason , ups noted the tracking that per request of sender ( partsgeek ) it was transferred to the local postal office for delivery .
neutral	i should have gotten it on tuesday per tracking and now it is thursday and i still don_'_t have it .
neutral	i was anticipating having it installed this weekend and may not be able to now .
neutral	:( i don_'_t get the shipping change over !
neutral	as this was my first time shopping at this site , i wasn_'_t sure what it would be like .
neutral	my experience was as such : the items that i ordered were for the most part , reasonably_priced - the shipping was free - can '_t beat that - and i did receive my order rather quickly .
neutral	i do have a complaint tho - one of the items that i ordered - tropiclean , priced at $ 0 . 00 , and was a trial size ------ not at all what i expected for the price !
neutral	i have learned thru this that i will , if i order again , be certain to read the description more closely !
neutral	great service thank u
neutral	the product is excellent however had bad problems with delivery .
neutral	i was not in the first time they tried to deliver and although i stayed in all day the next_day they failed to deliver i emailed them to say i would be on holiday the following week and asked if they would deliver to another address unfortunately they ignored this request and left the parcel under our barbeque at the rear of our house luckily the parcel was still there when we got back and the contents undamaged .
neutral	the snugg has some very nice cases for the ipads , the only_thing i would have liked is a way to track when i can expect the item to arrive .
neutral	i received one email_stating that the order has_been placed and that they would ship it very quickly but that was it .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t received the items that i '_ve purchased so i can '_t comment on the quality .
neutral	hotel is not within walking_distance of the university like it advertises .
neutral	we had to take a cab every day .
neutral	our toilet ran all the time .
neutral	my husband had to fix it every time .
neutral	there was a dog barking down the hall when we understood it as no pets aloud .
neutral	they should out people with no pets in separate buildings if pets are aloud .
neutral	hotel just wasn_'_t what we anticipated .
neutral	nice hotel , we had to wait a long long time for our room upon_arrival .
neutral	staff was nice and helpful .
neutral	part was delivered on time and for the right price ,, but was disappointed that free_shipping was advertised but when i checked there was shipping added to some of the parts i needed .
neutral	i only ordered what had free_shipping .
neutral	they were supposed to be on sale for 00 . 00 i see they are not and that '_s the normal price .
neutral	stick are not that nice and the 0 " are nicer
neutral	my experience with booking my bigbus_tour was not the best !
neutral	i booked the tour for san_francisco , not london first off .
neutral	when i went to the website to actually book , it went from the first section where you put in all of your information , to the second part , when you put in your credit_card information , then it stopped completely !!!
neutral	i waited and waited for it to " finish " to no_avail .
neutral	i finally called and they said they were having problems with the website .
neutral	then they sent me a link to a sight where i could print my vouchers and it was wrong .
neutral	it was a very frustrating situation .... i sent the link back and told them it wasn_'_t correct and they finally sent the right one .
neutral	the website is a little misleading regarding the actual locations that were visited as well .
neutral	dint like their service
neutral	i ordered purevita food for my puppy .
neutral	order process was easy and i received in a timely_fashion .
neutral	however , the food i received had an expiration_date of 0 days after i received it .
neutral	i called to request new food to be sent to me .
neutral	it was unavailable , so i asked for my money back .
neutral	however , i still had to pay for the shipping because i had added treats that were $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	shipping price is the same for all orders .
neutral	just thought for the inconvenience , that perhaps , the shipping fee would have been waived .
neutral	i will not be using this service again .
neutral	i was really impress with the price and the look of your clothes online .
neutral	i ordered 0 dresses that i really like in ( l ) large size and it didn_'_t fit as a large ... i '_m not a large woman but ordering online you want to be sure it fits .
neutral	the first dress material was very poor quaity and all 0 dresses really didn_'_t fit as a large .
neutral	the look of the dresses were nice which made me purchase the dresses .
neutral	i hope in the future when large , medium and small is stated to please be true to size .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	the car_rental in national in lancaster was fine but didn_'_t have any larger cars on lot .
neutral	the biggest frustration i had was in regards to the return .
neutral	we were scheduled to return to national in peterborough on july_00th , a sunday .
neutral	in the confirmation letter we received from autoeurope , there were no details on the fact national was closed on sundays and to simply park the car in their lot and place the keys into the after hours drop box .
neutral	that would have been nice and reduced some unnecessary stress .
neutral	i ordered ghd '_s and they were a good price and work fine but they didn_'_t cone with the two free products they were meant to which was disappointing .
neutral	i am trying to resolve via_email but the person_who replied to me first didn_'_t seem to get what the problem was !
neutral	i have had several experiences with this company .
neutral	the first few_years i bought from them , everything was great .
neutral	fast shipping , product purchased was the same as the product shipped .
neutral	however , the last two times i bought from them , i have had issues .
neutral	about 0 months_ago , the batteries shipped were not the same brand as_described when i purchased .
neutral	not a big deal , so i didn_'_t worry_about it .
neutral	in my most_recent_purchase , i am still_waiting for my purchase after almost 0_weeks .
neutral	based on my last two purchases , i '_m considering shopping elsewhere .
neutral	lovely villa close to all amenities , beds very uncomfortable .
neutral	master_bedroom bed made if concreat with thin matress on top .
neutral	lumpy uncomfortable pillows .
neutral	i ordered the part on sunday had it shipped next_day air due to the up coming holiday ( thanksgiving ) and because they were calling for rain .
neutral	i got the part on tuesday by ups wrapped in a plastic_bag due to the rain thank_god - the problem is i can '_t get my keyed mechanism to fit all the way down into the new part it is 0 / 0 too short .
neutral	i have had my two neightbors look at it to figure it out and one is a mechanic after a half_hour they handed it back to me .
neutral	there were no directions with the part and my invoice did not have a dollar_amount on it .
neutral	a gas attendant broke it so they are picking_up the bill .
neutral	i am just shocked that i described the problem to partsgeek told them i have a plastic_bag in my gas_tank it is pouring_rain out they assigned me a ticket number to me and no one has called back .
neutral	i will call my mechanic today and have him look at it .
neutral	the parts numbers are the same on the new part and the old .
neutral	so now i get to voice my opinion .... recommendations are not high .
neutral	thought the brushes seemed fine but they seem to have killed our electric_toothbrush .
neutral	at first the toothbrush didn_'_t seem to hold its charge so we discharged it completely but then it held it for even less a time , became sluggish and this morning it is dead .
neutral	what have your brushes done to it ??
neutral	?
neutral	it '_s a braun , advanced power .
neutral	the shipping was great ; very timely ( order #_0000000 ).
neutral	however .
neutral	just a few_days after i received the books my biology book started to split .
neutral	on the front , in the upper left hand corner , where the front and the binding meet the book is splitting .
neutral	it '_s possible that it '_s because the book is so incredibly heaving it is splitting under it '_s own weight .
neutral	does anyone know what happens to my " pocket book " at the end of the semester when i return the this rented book ?
neutral	again ... great service ... bad book .
neutral	tina g .
neutral	i called about a unit , and the gentleman was very friendly and provided good directions and met me there even_though it was late on a saturday_evening and the roads were bad with snow and ice .
neutral	upon_arriving he showed me the unit and took time to offer advice on packing my stuff in .
neutral	the paperwork was extremely short and sweet and that was that !
neutral	he closed and locked my unit for me , handed me the keys , and we were done !
neutral	the only_thing i disliked was that there wasn_'_t a lot of lighting .
neutral	they could definitely stand to add more .
neutral	i mean you can see , just not very well .
neutral	other than , it '_ll serve the purpose !
neutral	had trouble processing order on internet and had to chase next_morning .
neutral	first operator was rude and told me nothing she could do until web team sorted problem and i was to call back when i received my confirmation .
neutral	second operator was lovely and understanding ...
neutral	even upgraded my postage to next_day delivery after locating my web order and processing .
neutral	the bbq itself is great value and real_bargain .
neutral	bit of a nightmare to put_together by yourself but once assembled it looks great and assists in cooking the perfect bbq :-)
neutral	the headline price goes up by more than 00_% on the payment page due to ' extras ' that one has to remove .
neutral	for the most part i have been happy with the price i get my prescription cat_food for ( compared to other on - line sites ).
neutral	this past time i ordered it took me over a week to receive my cat_food at which point we ran_out and the substitute food i had to purchase for my cat made him very sick .
neutral	fed_ex didn_'_t pick_up the package from the distribution_center until three_days after they were notified of the order .
neutral	not sure who dropped the ball here , petflow . com or fed_ex .
neutral	i received the package it had a rip in it , and and a ant on the outside of it .
neutral	i brought it into the house , i left it on the counter within five_minutes my husband said the package was covered in bugs , he wrapped it in a zip lock bag and put it in the freezer .
neutral	it will kill the bugs .
neutral	not sure if it '_s from the package being left on the doorstep by the post_office or if it came from the company that way .
neutral	i ordered a size 0 . 0 and these slip on shoes were closer to a 0 . 0 .
neutral	by the time i got them and tried them on i was in the process of moving and didn_'_t get a chance to return to exchange them for another pair , so i just gave them to my sister who has size 0 . 0 / 00 feet .
neutral	wish they fit i loved them .
neutral	i have purchased guild_wars 0 and used paypal but have yet to receive my code after waiting for more than two hours and i was told it was in stock
neutral	the full bee_suit i received is excellent quality as were the gloves the only problem with the order was there were 0 left gloves , had not thought to check that when the order was delivered .
neutral	spoke with customer_service and the lady i spoke with was very friendly the only issue being the return shipping had to be paid by me .
neutral	so i
neutral	decided to keep & use the left gloves and save myself half the purchase price of the gloves in shipping .
neutral	i order the same item every_month and most months , the order is filled within two_days .
neutral	this past time the order was not filled for five work days and then with the holiday_weekend , we ran_out of the medication before it was delivered in the mail .
neutral	it is hard to judge when to order the medication when some months it only takes a couple days , and others a week .
neutral	usually happy but getting a bit_concerned as i '_ve ordered two cardigans and am still_waiting for both .
neutral	hoping they arrive next week .
neutral	i do not live in maryborough us but in maryborough victoria australia .
neutral	i '_ve ordered before so why has my address changed and my order possibly gone astray ??
neutral	?
neutral	our stay at the clipper ship inn wasted one night .
neutral	the room was spacious , clean and quiet .
neutral	there is a kuerig , fridge and microwave in the room .
neutral	the bathroom was clean and the beds comfy enough .
neutral	slept well .
neutral	we have used stress_free parking many_times at manchester and always had a good service with no waiting around either outward or return_journey .
neutral	we arrived half an_hour earlier_than booked in on our outward journey , but did call as instructed to let them know half an_hour before our arrival .
neutral	we were told that we would have to wait_until the pick_up time booked as they had no drivers available - no real complaint as we were before the booked in time .
neutral	however , when using them before they have been flexible and we have never been waiting more than 0 mins ( waited 00_mins ).
neutral	on return we rang when we had collected our bags and were told we would need to wait 00_mins which we did .
neutral	it seems like its not as well_organised as it once was and they are happy to take your money even when they haven_'_t got enough staff to accommodate the travel times or volume of customers - if i had been informed of this when i booked , i would have checked out another company .
neutral	i didn_'_t expect any delays as we had never had a problem before , the time of year was not a busy time and the travel times were not during peak / business hours .
neutral	we are travelling again in the summer in the kids school holidays and based on this experience we will try another operator to compare the service levels .
neutral	vi var ret overrasket da vi efter vores tilbud på abonnement udløb , fandt ud_af at vi betalte hen ved 0000kr om året for et såkaldt minibasic abonnoment med tv0 , tv0 news , canal 0 og 0 plus dr kanalerne .
neutral	vi kunne pga dårlige sendeforhold ikke modtage andre en dr kanalerne og nogengange tv0 , så derfor troede vi at det_var_det der_var indeholdt i pakken .
neutral	ingen havde kontaktet os og spurgt os om vi var tilfreds_med vores abonnoment . vi besluttede os for at melde boxer fra og opdagede først derefter at der_er_en såkaldt tv0 pakke , hvor man for under 000kr om året får tv0 plus dr kanalerne , hvilket jo præcist ville have opfyldt vores behov .
neutral	det undrer mig at boxer ikke_har_været bedre til at gøre opmærksom på hvilke muligheder de_har .
neutral	jeg_ville gerne at de var lidt mere nysgerrige på hvilke behov vi_havde og om vi_havde al info om deres produkter .
neutral	the dress was wonderful , it looks great on .
neutral	i think if it would '_ve arrived for the event i ordered it for i would love it even more .
neutral	it took 00 days to arrive .
neutral	really excited about how much money i saved with parts_geek .
neutral	i was not pleased with how long it took to receive my packages .
neutral	the first shipping time was tolerable .
neutral	the second package took 0 days !
neutral	i don_'_t know about you guys , but i need my vehicle running asap !
neutral	anyway , if y ' all could ship faster i wouldn_'_t hesitate to purchase from you guys again !
neutral	i bought this product for my daughter as a present .
neutral	i had to apologise for the box it was in .
neutral	it looked like it had gone three rounds with mick tyson .
neutral	the product it '_s self was very gratefully received .
neutral	it was just what she wanted for the garden .
neutral	please pay more attention to your packaging .
neutral	i had already bought one from another site .
neutral	that was perfect on arrival , box and all .
neutral	many_thanks
neutral	barbara hedges
neutral	the prices are really good at petflow , and the selection is also wonderful .
neutral	shipping is very fast - we usually receive our dog '_s food the day after i order it .
neutral	but it '_s not without problems .
neutral	stay away from autodelivery !
neutral	there '_s no notification reminder that it '_s going to ship ( although they say they will email you a week ahead of time ), so if you live paycheck to paycheck , it can cause problems .
neutral	also , my dog '_s food is 0 cent cheaper_than the minimum required for free_shipping so i usually add a bag of treats to get the free_shipping .
neutral	i wasn_'_t given the chance to do that when it autoshipped .
neutral	i emailed the company , asking to refund the shipping since i was only a penny shy of the free_shipping .
neutral	they actually made me return the bag of food , wait 0_weeks for the full_refund , and then redo the order so it qualified for free_shipping .
neutral	they did pay to ship the bag back to them .
neutral	seems to me it would have been easier ( and cheaper for them ) just to refund the shipping charge .
neutral	on another order , i requested it be sent " next week " since we were going away for the weekend .
neutral	it was sent the next_day instead of next week .
neutral	our neighbor saw the big box sitting at the front_door and brought it inside his house so nobody would steal it .
neutral	i '_ve been irritated and wanted to buy the food elsewhere , but the prices and fast shipping keep me coming_back .
neutral	first of all , i think that you should offer a larger range of shoe_sizes .
neutral	i am a size 0 and end up having to buy 0 , making it fit really big on me .
neutral	second of all , i really dislike how the shoes always squeak inside every time i make a step .
neutral	this is unacceptable .
neutral	when searching for a part , i thought you didn_'_t have it .
neutral	i later found it after i paid $ 0 + in shipping for another part .
neutral	the way items show up is confusing and frustrating and then i would have had to pay another $ 0 for this 0nd item to ship .
neutral	prices are great but shipping is overpriced and website loops you all over the place .
neutral	ive only ever ordered from boohoo twice but was disappointed the last time .
neutral	item arrived_promptly which was great but the jumper had a huge gaping in hole in the side of the neckline :(
neutral	the first problem was not related to the car ...., we are travelers .
neutral	our schedules are not the normal ones we keep at home .
neutral	i am 00 and on meds , one of which compensates for kidney problems .
neutral	they had a large sign as you entered their office that customers can not use their toilet facilities .
neutral	there were no other options on the street .... a very uncomfortable situation .
neutral	the car proved servicable but was missing a rear wiper blade , which we realized the first rain .
neutral	the next problem was a real problem .
neutral	we had been given a renault clio .
neutral	it was so underpowered that there were times it could not make it up a hill and we had to back down and find another route .
neutral	we were staying in cortona , an italian hill town , and found the car could not make it to our house .
neutral	we contacted you asking to change the car and received the instructions to return to the rental_agency in florence .
neutral	it would have taken us a day to drive up and back .
neutral	we decided to try to manage , parking two blocks from our house and walking .
neutral	the brakes were not sufficient to keep the car from sliding backwards on the hills or when parked .
neutral	again we used creative means to keep the car from rolling down the hills .
neutral	the final problems were with our returning the car .
neutral	their contract has typos in the spelling of their address .
neutral	thus our garmin stated the street they listed did not exist .
neutral	to add to the confusion the agent had used a black pen to draw the route from the office to the a - 0 blacking out part of the street name on the map .
neutral	the end_result was as follows ...
neutral	+ contract states via bognosanti .... actual address borgo ognisanti .
neutral	after driving around in the vicinity of the office i found the church " ognisanti " on our map , aimed for that and found the office .
neutral	they should , must give their customers the correct address .... even if that means reprinting their contracts .
neutral	the final problem was their closing for lunch .
neutral	tourists pick_up / drop_off cars at all times , have connections to make , arrive on public_transportation that operates all day .
neutral	we arrived to find they would be closed for 0 hours .
neutral	it is a no parking zone in front of their office .
neutral	across the street is a carabinieri station .
neutral	they agreed not to ticket us saying it happens all the time .
neutral	we parked the car and went to lunch .
neutral	when we got back there was a line of people all waiting like us to drop_off or pick_up cars , all with their luggage and all annoyed .
neutral	it was cold but fortunately not raining .
neutral	i would not recommend this eurocar office in florence to anyone .
neutral	i have four dogs , 00 , 00 , 00 and 000_lbs .
neutral	i think this box would be great if they took into account size .
neutral	i don_'_t buy any pet related toys that aren_'_t suitable for my lab because i don_'_t want to worry_about her choking .
neutral	so the stuffed toy that came in the july box is suitable for a teacup size dog and the lint roller was something i could have lived without also as i '_m sure anyone already owning pets has a couple of these lying_around and the retail price was about $ 0 for that , i believe .
neutral	overpriced for a tiny lint brush so something even if i saw in a store i wouldn_'_t buy .
neutral	the large bone was great as they can all gnaw it as are the treats .
neutral	my whiskey arrived on time but the packaging was a bit dog eared to be honest .
neutral	i '_m not sure if i can give it as a present now as it looks ancient !
neutral	items are well priced with free delivery but they took_ages to be marked as despatched let_alone be delivered .
neutral	if delivery was quicker they ' d be fantastic .
neutral	delivery . com has great deals and almost weekly credit_towards food .
neutral	sometimes certain restaurants that deliver can '_t be found on delivery .
neutral	it would also be great if you could hover over the food on a menu and see a description of the meal .
neutral	booking the chosen hotel was easy and well explained , but there was some vital address information missing from the confirmation , and this gave the impression that the hotel was in nice , when in actual fact it was in a different place altogether .
neutral	i relied on this print out to help me find the place , and i '_m not sure the photograph was the right one for the hotel either .
neutral	fast and efficient service with great choice and availability of games .
neutral	however web_page didnt confirm payment details which made me think the order hadnt gone_through so re ordered - same thing happened .
neutral	checked a /_c and order had been taken twice without confirmation :-( now awaiting refund and had to return the double order of games by recorded delivery - could have done without the hassle .
neutral	having received the mud flaps we noticed they were basic or standard type
neutral	not the original manufactured for toyota 0 runner .
neutral	price was resonable but would have gladly paid more for the right ones .
neutral	nvjj
neutral	the tour was good , there were a couple of not so good things though : we had to wait for more than half an_hour to get on one and the bus stopped far too long , without_any warning , in front of the tussaud museum .
neutral	also , we had to wait for half an_hour to get on the boat under a very strong sunshine and the ride was very quick compared to the queuing ...
neutral	i order interprox brushes from dentocare - these are always very good .
neutral	they offer postage - free if your order is over_£_00 - but beware , this is £_00 excluding vat , which_means you have to spend ( in my case ) well over_£_00 .
neutral	perhaps it '_s just me , but we are surrounded_by prices when shopping which include vat , and i tend to expect the same on line .
neutral	i have only used momondo recently for an_upcoming_trip .
neutral	i liked the site , it worked fine .
neutral	maybe it was just the flight that i was trying to book that lead to what i consider a big problem .
neutral	it pointed me to two booking sites for the purchasing the ticket - one travel and what appears to be a sister , cheapoair .
neutral	perhaps the fault actually lies at the doorstep of those referred sites .
neutral	but one travel was charging a whopping 00_% over the underlying cost of the ticket .
neutral	yes , that '_s right almost 00_% more than other_sites or directly with the airlines themselves .
neutral	i don_'_t know why momondo didn_'_t find the same flights elsewhere at the " real " price .
neutral	so it may make_sense to double_check elsewhere before assuming that momondo has the lowest fare .
neutral	the steaks were just okay .
neutral	i don_'_t think i would buy from the company again
neutral	amiclubwear has great deals but the shipping and delivery is too long .
neutral	i have booked with you many_times and have been happy , but this occasion you failed .
neutral	i booked a crossing for the thursday but on the tuesday before , i wanted to change this to the friday , same time but to include a cabin as well , i entered my new details into the computer and checked the price and availability , due to computer problems i was unable to change my booking online but had to phone , the lady offered to phone me back with a price ?
neutral	this i already new as 000 . 00gbp , but assumed this price would be reduced due to my first paid booking , i had paid 00 . 00gbp then ended_up paying another 000 . 00gbp , i understand a payment for the adjustment is required but was unhappy with the final total , i have phoned to complain but this in the amount given to you by the ferry company , not sure i believe this part .
neutral	as this has happened before , my advice , try to get to the port in the time , before the ship actually leaves dock and there will be no extra_charge .
neutral	happy sailing .
neutral	i liked my books but it took a long time for them to be shipped
neutral	i continue to purchase from quinessence because of the excellent quality of their stuff and the product range available .
neutral	however , i do so with resentment in my heart , as they don_'_t seem to care about customers , have no interpersonal skills that i have seen , play stupid tricks with discount_codes and seem incapable of a simple apology .
neutral	if you can find an_alternative supplier of equal quality , do !
neutral	if not , maybe purchase via amazon - as perhaps some extra customer_support from the amazon side , if things go wrong .
neutral	lovely stuff , indifferent customer care , sometimes none at all .
neutral	lenses never showed .
neutral	order confirmation said delivery expected at fri 0th or mon 0th .
neutral	it is now saturday 00th and still a no show .
neutral	i would not recommend anyone to buy from lenstore .
neutral	edited to add : also , ordering anything from them is a one way ticket to spamville .
neutral	including repeated_requests for reviews .
neutral	well , here is my review .
neutral	" stole my money ."
neutral	edited to add : the original batch of lenses have still not showed_up but complaints procedure was easy and friendly and the replacement order made it with minimum hassle .
neutral	the csr who took my complaint also made sure i don_'_t get any more spam , so i am upgrading my review in reflection of the good customer_service .
neutral	i am having problems , however , with my female chi - weenie ( chihuahua / dachshund mix ).
neutral	she seems to have contracted a bladder issue .
neutral	i don_'_t know at this point if it is because of the blue_buffalo food or if it is from some milk i have given her .
neutral	at this point in time , my decision about the blue_buffalo food and it '_s health for the rest of my dog family is undecided .
neutral	i am going to continue to use it until my veterinarian gives me a n opinion on what is wrong with my female chi - weenie .
neutral	my other dogs love to eat it , and eat it more than the previous food they were eating , thank_you .
neutral	i just ordered a few things just to try it out .
neutral	i was happy with the fast shipping .
neutral	i got my order within a week .
neutral	my only issue was , i ordered the soup sample and i received the hot_chocolate sample box .
neutral	the hot_chocolate tastes good , but it '_s not what i wanted , and it was less_expensive than what i actually ordered .
neutral	as far as the actual product goes , i would likely order again and i would likely recommend it to my friends , with a warning to check their order over pretty well to be sure it is correct .
neutral	fast and efficient
neutral	website hard to use customer_service hard to reach and product delivery slow
neutral	love the monitoring you offer .
neutral	great services !
neutral	hate - tried to update billing information five times on the site and was still billed to the wrong card .
neutral	:( still not sure if i get an update monthly on my credit_report from all 0 or what i am recieving .
neutral	if i am going to pay for this service i guess i need to figure this out !
neutral	this is my first experience using your service .
neutral	my billing_address ( which is my husband '_s office ) is different from my home address ..... with that being said ....... the 00lb_bag of dog_food was delivered to the billing_address instead of my residence .
neutral	customer_service was very helpful and friendly , she said she would change that so next month '_s shipment would arrive at my home .
neutral	i just went on line to verify this was done as requested only to discover that the billing_address was now identical to my home address !
neutral	( sigh ) i have corrected this to reflect two different_addresses , had i not caught this , i suspect that my credit_card would have been denied & the october shipment delayed .
neutral	but no_worries ..... disaster avoided !
neutral	it was sooo_much_better last_year to order . you have changed it this year .
neutral	i was not notified about the sunglasses i ordered to tell me that they were out of stock until i emailed the company to ask of there were abouts .
neutral	payment was taken before they have been sent .
neutral	i did receive quick replys to my emails and the sunglasses seem to be good price !
neutral	i haven_'_t yet received my sunglasses as the company are waiting to get more stock .
neutral	i contacted this website from a search on the internet .
neutral	they gave_me a dislocated phone_number and the address information was not where the facility was located .
neutral	i ordered an item and paid £ 0 . 00 for express next_day delivery not realising that if you don_'_t order before a certain time on a sunday then next_day means next working day which in this case was a tuesday as it was calculated from monday .
neutral	so i ended_up paying £ 0 . 00 whereas standard delivery which also would have come on tuesday , would only have been £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	also they did not send me a confirmatory email so i had no_idea if my credit_card payment had been accepted or not and whether the order had gone_through .
neutral	apart_from this , the item arrived ok .
neutral	i ordered a new handbasin for my shower room .
neutral	it was delivered very quickly but when it arrived it was badly cracked on the outside .
neutral	i called the company and they got back to me straightaway .
neutral	they replaced the basin within a matter of a couple of days and the replacement was fine .
neutral	the only word of caution i would add is that this basin was one of their cheaper ones which raises questions about the quality .
neutral	although i '_m very pleased with both pieces of furniture i '_ve bought from this company , i got very cross over delivery .
neutral	the delivery slot is 0am - 0pm , so i had to get up at_0am and stay in all day .
neutral	by 0pm it still hadn_'_t arrived .
neutral	came some time between 0pm and 0pm and was delivered next door , although we were in and the doorbell was working .
neutral	i contacted the firm at 0pm to complain .
neutral	they were helpful .
neutral	but i don_'_t think it '_s reasonable to expect people to stay in all day .
neutral	some firms send last_minute message_saying roughly what time to expect delivery .
neutral	i ordered some ghd gold hair straighteners then found them cheaper within an_hour on the official ghd site .
neutral	i tracked my order which was awaiting dispatch so immediately cancelled the order .
neutral	however , i then received an e_mail to say i was too late .
neutral	i wanted an a0 calendar but ended_up receiving an a0 .
neutral	the pictures took a long time to load .
neutral	under the dates at the bottom it says cw then a number , i have no_idea what it means and therefore don_'_t know why i would want it on a decorative calendar but there was no means of removing it .
neutral	the order arrived very quickly and is on good quality card
neutral	i purchased this protection based on a friend '_s recommendation .
neutral	however , the last alert received is incorrectly stated as my name was totally omitted .
neutral	it appeared as if my husband was the sole owner of our property , which is not correct .
neutral	plan on contacting identity_guard to see why the error and see what results i get .
neutral	not too pleased to read the one review about the young_lady_who tried to cancel the protection and couldn_'_t and the complaint about poor customer_service .
neutral	will need more time to make an accurate assessment .
neutral	i was planning on buying a tablet til i noticed another of your sites selling it much_cheaper and claiming its original price to be at the sale price in kay '_s i find this a lot .
neutral	i also bought something and a week_later price was higher so you change prices a lot .
neutral	i buy here as a need basis not a want basis as all items are already double the price or triple than they are anywhere_else summerhouse for example 000 amazon 000 same size shape same item in kay '_s bought a bed with damage and was told would be given a 00pound discount and it never happened they gave_me discount on their purchase price so be warned pay 000 for a bed they only giving discount on 000 made several and i mean bout twenty complaints and always assured it will be added to my account only to call again for no note on account and no one knows what i am talking_about .
neutral	delivery service most are rude and heavy items left on doorstep i use a walking_stick to get to door there are a few exceptions , but fragile items always arrive in bits .
neutral	kay '_s don_'_t care about customers only money which they are quick to take and no_matter_how long you have been loyal paid on time etc if your bank makes an_error or anything_else gets in way of payment say you get paid on first and that '_s a saturday so you won_'_t get money til monday they will drop a charge quick as you like finishing my payments then giving them the boot .
neutral	it boasts 0 - 0days delivery which technically is true aside ffrom the fact it took four days to dispatch there was no affirmation from company as on first time order didn_'_t get payment good ole rbs doing it '_s usual job but cool shop didn_'_t contact us to let us know so all in all took two_weeks to finally get our order after reordering .
neutral	product son is very happy with but not on a rush to order from here again .
neutral	the guys on the street were fab helping_me on the bus with the buggy & we were really looking_forward to it even with the rain !
neutral	however , rude passengers barging in front nearly knocking me over whilst carrying my son - plus horrific traffic & road_closures ruined what should have been a fab day .
neutral	was truly disappointed !
neutral	i like nike_tennis skirts but only in the longer lengths , although i can find measurement on the lengths on other web sites you do not appear to have these items .
neutral	the person has to go with what they are happy to use .
neutral	okay so the rx_sunglasses i ordered are amazing .
neutral	however , they are actually the second ones i ordered .
neutral	i initially ordered a pair of ralph_lauren rx_sunglasses for vacation .
neutral	( i usually just deal with not being_able to wear sunglasses , but thought it would be nice to splurge and have some for vacation at the beach .)
neutral	i ordered them about 0_weeks before my trip , thinking that should be more than enough time .
neutral	three_weeks went by and still no notice that they had begun processing .
neutral	so when i called to see what was up , i was told that the frames i had ordered were on backorder and wouldnt be available for at_least a few more weeks , and they would hopefully be shipped out on the 00th .
neutral	( i was leaving for vacation on the 00th .)
neutral	noone had tried to contact me about the frames being on backorder .
neutral	ifor i had been notified prior to finalizing my order or immediately after , there wouldn_'_t have been a problem .
neutral	so annoyed as i was , i switched the order to a different pair ( a more_expensive pair ), that were in stock and crossed my fingers that these would make it in time before vacation .
neutral	they didnt .
neutral	they were waiting for me when i returned home .
neutral	they are wonderful sunglasses and i am enjoying them very much .
neutral	however i am quite annoyed that i didn_'_t get to use them for what i had originally bought them for , and spent the extra money for no reason .
neutral	lesson_learned .
neutral	call ahead and make_sure they ' re actually in stock before you order !
neutral	!
neutral	i recently placed an order with parfum0 . com , i live in canada , but have ordered perfume online many_times from the usa .
neutral	when the package arrived , i discovered there was a " processing_fee " of $_00 . 00 charged to me by ups , over and above my shipping cost .
neutral	needless to say , this was disappointing , and my savings were greatly_reduced .
neutral	this was not duty or taxes , but as far as i could tell just for ups to make some extra money .
neutral	please , parfum0 . com , when shipping to canada do not use ups or fedex - simply ship through the post_office ( air mail not necessary , ground is fine ) as other online perfume companies do .
neutral	i love their selection , service and delivery time was good , but i will think_twice before ordering here again unless better shipping arrangements can be made to canada .
neutral	.
neutral	at first the printer kept saying to replaced ink , but after inserting and removing the cartridge it finally worked .
neutral	it '_s working fine now .
neutral	a good start when we got on the bus , only having waited 0 minutes .
neutral	as the bus followed the route , the guide was excellent - giving short interesting information about various things thrown in with a bit of humour too - very personable .
neutral	however when his shift was over , the next tour_guide was terrible - the information given was less historical based , not that interesting and delivered awkwardly in a monotone voice .
neutral	we got off the bus a few stops early to avoid this - as well as the traffic in oxford_street .
neutral	received my order but disappointed there is a button missing in the duvet_cover .
neutral	what can i do ?
neutral	just dont like the waiting time for delivery
neutral	the thing i love about yesstyle . com is that it makes me homesick for home .
neutral	i spent most of my childhood in korea , and so am more accustomed to the asian ( especially korean ) styles presented by the website than u . s . retailers and their restrictive styles .
neutral	it '_s great to have such a huge database of clothing options to browse_through via yesstyle — almost too much .
neutral	this brings me to my biggest qualm about yesstyle , which is the search_function .
neutral	i '_m not sure how exactly the search_function is configured , but i find that it '_s hard to filter for the qualities i '_m looking for in whatever item it is i '_m wanting to find .
neutral	sample 0 of this is typing in , say , " parka orange fur " — it seems as if the site '_s search_function searches for the exact phrase , thus generating no hits .
neutral	sample 0 is the fact that if i were searching for " furry parka ," i can '_t ask the search_function to only search within the " outerwear " category of the " women " category — the search_function only accesses the general parent categories .
neutral	other than that , the only other thing i ' d really desire out of yesasia is more description by individual brands dedicated to their items of clothing .
neutral	during my most_recent_purchase , i happened to be looking for new winter outerwear , and i remember having somewhat of a difficult time looking for the thickness of wool coats , or even whether a down jacket was padded or not .
neutral	i didn_'_t have a problem with clothing sizes , but i found the quality on items to vary by brand .
neutral	also , can i say deceptive photos ?
neutral	i don_'_t think the images of the clothing were always highly accurate nor did they always depict what you really receive in the mail .
neutral	i ordered quite a few items from the british_corner shop and was very excited to receive them so quickly .
neutral	however , we were disappointed to find the box was delivered in a damaged condition and that 0 of the same item ordered were missing .
neutral	we all know mistakes_happen , so i immediately emailed customer_service and as yet i have had no acknowledgement that they are even looking into this .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	:(
neutral	i placed my first order with zest in early march and waited a long time for my delivery !
neutral	would probably order from them again but not soon .
neutral	pros_: lots of options of accommodation .
neutral	good summary booking .
neutral	cancellation option is good , although the funds just stay for furture bookings which is not ideal , but still good feature .
neutral	cons_: display of price for privates is never accurate as you have to book 0 people in , and sometimes private_rooms are for 0 for $_00 privates actually means $_00 .
neutral	so not accurate when displaying by price .
neutral	reviews , character restriction way too small and frustrating when cursor moves to end after typing one letter !
neutral	while i was happy to have found a flight online with better timings ( and an ever - so - slightly better price ) than i was being offered over the phone during my 0 hours worth of conversation to travel_agents , there is one thing i would like to share so that other customers are aware .
neutral	i used my visa_debit_card online to pay for the flight ( completely forgetting that i have a limit as to how much i can take out of my account each day ) and did not notice until hours_later that my transaction had in fact not gone_through .
neutral	here '_s where the problem lies : flighthub failed to contact me in any way to let_me know my transaction had not gone_through .
neutral	i just happened to remember right before that the organization overseas that i am going to work for needed a copy of my itinerary to ensure they could confirm my spot teaching in their summer camp and went into my email to find the link to my flight reservation .
neutral	when i clicked on it , a message showed_up on my reservation stating that my transaction had not gone_through and that if i failed to pay for my ticket in the next few hours i would lose the reservation .
neutral	at this point , i didn_'_t know how many hours they meant and i feared that i had already lost the ticket .
neutral	i scrambled to find another credit_card in my household and my sister ended_up lending me hers and luckily it went through .
neutral	while i am thankful to flighthub for getting me what i considered the best deal in terms of flight times and direct travel compared with price , i am disappointed that i nearly lost my ticket because i did not receive any sort of email or notification to warn me about my potential loss of ticket .
neutral	i even checked my spam_folder after just to make_sure and there was nothing there .
neutral	so_far i am happy with my flighthub purchase but i wanted to warn_others out there to make_sure you click on your reservation link right_away to ensure you don_'_t have the same problem and lose out on a ticket !
neutral	i also want to note a positive here .
neutral	i did not realize that the " best purchase price guarantee " box was checked when i was processing my order .
neutral	this added another $_00 to my purchase and i found it unneccessary because it ensures that you can cancel your flight on the same day without_any consequences but i knew there was no way i would be cancelling my flight after all the hassle i ' d been through to find this ticket .
neutral	i called customer_service right_away and they said that since my account had not been charged yet they could remove it so that was helpful .
neutral	averbach transcription gave_us a very competitive price for the transcription of over 0 hours of footage .
neutral	this wasn_'_t a rush job , so we went with the standard service which has 0 week of turn_around .
neutral	at the last_minute they contacted me and let_me know that the transcription would be a little late - we received it a day later than_expected .
neutral	since it wasn_'_t a rush job , it wasn_'_t a big deal .
neutral	we did catch quite a few typos in the transcription , but a quick run through with spell check fixed that .
neutral	0 of the 0 plants i received were gorgeous , healthy , plants .
neutral	one of them had a yellow shade to it and i am babying it to bring it back to good health .
neutral	so_far it hasn_'_t improved at all .
neutral	vital_choice is 0_star quality and very user_friendly ... but the bonus gifts need to be handled a bit better .
neutral	i received a lb of halibut sections for having ordered over 000 .. 00 the 0 lb came all frozen and clumped / stuck together ... as a single person , what am i supposed to do with the rest i can '_t refreeze it .
neutral	had ir stated it would be sent that way i would have selected something_else .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	i found it difficult to see that the lights were displayed on some pretty twigs and was surprised when they arrived they were jus at very tiny set of lights ..
neutral	i rang about this and .
neutral	the man was lovely he said it does say in the photo just lights but agreed it was difficult to understand that and explained that i could return them .
neutral	i think 00 days return_policy is too short to return item back .
neutral	the labels came on time but the flat color and quality was not great .
neutral	i was hoping for a better resolution for i used them on wine_bottles and they were hard to read .
neutral	well , to start , it took two_days after purchase before ups even shipped it , and yes , this was early in the week , so it was a business day .
neutral	so after waiting for 0 days , i finally received my package .
neutral	the box had been crushed and ripped_open half way .
neutral	although no parts were missing , one of the parts ( timing chain tensioner ) was the wrong one .
neutral	this is very frustrating .
neutral	quality control and shipping options are lacking .
neutral	people can '_t even put a happy meal together these days .
neutral	the hotel was a good value .
neutral	it had a fast internet_connection and a good tv .
neutral	the air heat was a bit noisy .
neutral	a converted wall unit controlled on the wall .
neutral	otherwise , the hotel had all the basics .
neutral	i have booked again for next week .
neutral	your location is convenient and your service was wonderful .
neutral	however , your prices are on the high side .
neutral	i '_m going to work on cleaning out my condo , so i may get_rid of some things , so i won_'_t have to continue with storage in the distant_future , due to the prices .
neutral	they should have been more honest on the cost of my stay ... instead of the $_00 that hostelworld told me i would pay , i ended_up paying $_000 . 00 .
neutral	depends what your looking for but most things i '_ve purchased have not been made that well but they haven_'_t cost a fortune so it goes to show you get what you pay for !
neutral	good way of getting_rid of your unwanted dvds , games and cds .
neutral	you don_'_t get a lot for them but anything '_s better_than nothing .
neutral	was pleased that you could choose your day of collection , including saturdays , however , i waited in from 0am to 0pm and nobody showed_up !!!!
neutral	nobody even contacted me to explain_why .
neutral	a courier contacted me to arrange collection on the monday after work in the end - not happy !!
neutral	!
neutral	pros_:
neutral	best prices on the ' net .
neutral	returns are easy .
neutral	cons_:
neutral	refunds can take * ages *.
neutral	sizing is ... not as standard as they ' d like you to think .
neutral	even with correct measurements , items may not fit .
neutral	items change in composition and fit , but this isn_'_t reflected in the description .
neutral	items not well described or photographed .
neutral	unless you ' re a professional , you may order the wrong thing .
neutral	carries only a very limited selection of compression products - there are way more kinds out there .
neutral	overall :
neutral	the best site for lymphedema_products , in terms of price , if they have it .
neutral	recently i moved and , for our new house , we wanted to install one of the fancy shower panels i ' d seen online .
neutral	we ordered a nice one at hudson_reed , however , upon paying , i neglected to notice the delivery address had automatically come up as my previous address .
neutral	when i finally realized this , the item had already been delivered and released ( because i gave ups permission to release the item without a signature ).
neutral	i totally blew it !
neutral	i contacted the company and spoke to a woman_who agreed to put through a call back to ups .
neutral	i asked her to keep me informed as to the progress .
neutral	i hadn_'_t heard_anything from her , but i did get a notice from ups saying they were awaiting the correct address .
neutral	after unsuccessfully trying to reach the company by phone , i sent an_email explaining the notice and indicating my correct address .
neutral	still nothing back from the company .
neutral	i emailed again noting that i had not gotten a response , please contact me letting_me know the status .
neutral	this was a $_000_+ item .
neutral	still nothing .
neutral	i called a couple days_later and the same woman i originally spoke to got on the phone and she begins to blast me saying she realized i was upset by the tone of my last email (???)
neutral	and that she was doing her best .
neutral	despite the fact that this was my error , she had ups reroute the shipment to my new address no charge .
neutral	she continues to go on that she did not have to do this because it was my fault this all happened in the first place .
neutral	i did get quite upset with her attitude and rudeness and asked to speak to someone in authority above her .
neutral	but , apparently , " he was in a meeting ."
neutral	i asked if it would just serve her better if i just cancelled the order altogether being how completely difficult and terrible this had been for her .
neutral	yes , i was angry at her awful way of dealing_with me .
neutral	she did apologize .
neutral	i felt it was quite unprofessional .
neutral	i still gave 0_stars due to the fact that they did take quick action in helping_me remedy a very difficult situation and they did not charge me additional shipping .
neutral	but , for communication , i would rate it 0_star .
neutral	this was our second time ordering from serenata .
neutral	the first experience was great and the ordering process the second time was quick and easy , however we were disappointed with the delivery .
neutral	three flower heads were broken in the bunch that was delivered , and the delivery person did not follow the instructions that my husband keyed into the order form , resulting in the flowers being left at the wrong door of his mother '_s house .
neutral	she has a small house with only two doors , so delivering to the requested door would only have meant another 00 steps or so for the delivery person .
neutral	with that said , she is enjoying the flowers that were delivered intact and because we had a good experience with serenata the first time around , we will likely give them another chance in the future .
neutral	if not for the extremely accommodating staff , we would have gone elsewhere .
neutral	definitely not the hilton standards for general cleanliness .
neutral	original room did not warrant the price paid through_travelocity .
neutral	fortunately the first contractor that called i hired .
neutral	he was excellent .
neutral	the other contractors who called sounded strange .
neutral	when i called back one , his message box was full ??
neutral	the others had out of state or nyc area codes .
neutral	kavinace went up $_00 per bottle that '_s an insane increase .
neutral	i buy metagenics pure_formulas and thorne products each_month metametagenics does free overnight shipping at competitive_prices
neutral	we sent our niece in swansea , wales a sympathy arrangement for the passing of her mother .
neutral	she emailed that it was the most beautiful_arrangement she has ever received .
neutral	i ordered this arrangement on saturday , august_00th - but immediately i '_m tired and confused at all your emails and offers .
neutral	ordering online took_forever .
neutral	wish our niece could sent a picture of arrangement .
neutral	the photos and options were a bit limited - but i was desperate to send the order .
neutral	was further confused about delivery times , dates .
neutral	my one and only_complaint was that i received an_automated email that my cards were shipped , however it stated that they were being mailed usps when i selected and paid for fedex delivery .
neutral	i got this email at 0 : 00 am , which woke me up and put me on the phone at 0 : 00 am trying to sort it all out .
neutral	very inconvenient .
neutral	also , more emphasis needs to be placed on the fact that you will need to allow 0 - 0 days for processing , and should be planned for .
neutral	i fortunately , had some extra time so my cards did arrive in time for my company event .
neutral	we bought the kits for carpet moths treatment .
neutral	it included the powder , formula c spray and formula p fogger .
neutral	products arrived_promptly .
neutral	clear instruction leaflet enclosed with the kit .
neutral	the powder was easy to use and coverage was enough , as_described .
neutral	the spray was also easy to use and was very generous quantity .
neutral	the fogger instructions were less clear - you have to peel the tab before you press and twist .
neutral	we actually bought two ( kit plus extra fogger for a second room ).
neutral	once activated i left the premises for 0 - 0 hours , but upon return found one fogger cannister empty and the other only half emptied .
neutral	i tried to re - activate but it would no lonnger spray and liquid poored out all over the carpet .
neutral	so , when they work , they ' re good !
neutral	but obviously they don_'_t all work as they should .
neutral	i have used shopto before and had no_problems but on this occasion i had several problems .
neutral	i ordered a game on the monday - obviously with next_day delivery - and had heard_nothing by wednesday so i called .
neutral	i was told that it was busy with mass effect 0 and street fighter coming out and that they would send it asap .
neutral	the order was then cancelled on the thursday and resent - to the wrong_address .
neutral	luckily , the parcel company did deliver it to the first address so i did get it in time for my friends birthday .
neutral	shopto have been apologetic but maybe they should take on extra staff for big release weeks .
neutral	i ended_up ordering the wrong part twice because my model has two different_sizes of ball_joint of the same part and i did not think it fair that i was responsible for the shipping return for both items .
neutral	the books were cheap and the shipping was speedy but .....
neutral	one of the textbooks i ordered did not arrive .
neutral	the shipment summary told me it had been cancelled because it was " not available ."
neutral	i had received emails from bookbyte confirming my order and confirming shipment .
neutral	why was i not emailed about the unavailability of this book ?
neutral	i '_ve ordered it from another book seller but now it will be late and more_expensive because of the approaching school season .
neutral	i '_m annoyed .
neutral	it took over a week to get the tracking_information to me .
neutral	then the shipping said one date and half way through was moved out 0 days .
neutral	so 0 and a half weeks_later i might get the part i needed a week_ago .
neutral	if i would have known it would take so long i would have paid the extra $_00 and bought the part in town .
neutral	i bought 0 shirts , 0 i liked and 0 i didn_'_t , which is fine , considering i '_m going to return them , but , something that really disappoints me about 00dollarmall , is they update the " womens " clothes tab way more then the " plus size " and i don_'_t really think that it '_s fair , cause i '_m fully interested in buying more of their products , but there '_s only a small selection i can choose from , of stuff i actually like , but the " womens " tab has way more fashionable stuff , they just need more bigger_sizes .
neutral	i use book it anytime i want to travel . they seem to have the best deals !
neutral	!
neutral	i have bought from petflow for several_months with no problem with order or billing .
neutral	in july i purchased and was double_charged on my debit_card .
neutral	i was initially promised the money would be refunded within 0 days .
neutral	when that didn_'_t happen , it was extended to 0 .
neutral	when that didn_'_t happen it was extended to 00 .
neutral	all the while i was in contact with multiple persons to remedy this problem .
neutral	i confirmed with their transaction service provider that the delay was not with them so the problem had to be with the petflow team .
neutral	after 00 days , i finally got someone to look into the problem and once they realized when they reviewed the situation that the problem with the refund delay was on their end , i got the money the next_day .
neutral	it is just most unfortunate that it took so long for them to give this error the attention it needed for satisfactory results .
neutral	overall a good experience with this booking site , except for the fact that the price shown initially was less_than i actually ended_up paying once ' taxes and fees ' were added .
neutral	i was drawn to this site for its reasonable prices but it ended_up being the same price as others i ' d seen once these extras were added .
neutral	the real flowers had nothing to do with the picture in internet .
neutral	there were a lot less flowers in the bouquet !
neutral	i booked the tickets for my boyfriend and i through the klm website since september_0000 to visit mexico in december_00th .
neutral	we were sent to fly with air_france and since then many things went wrong .
neutral	our trip was amsterdam / paris / mexico city .
neutral	in mexico city airport , we were notified that air_france lost our luggages and they put our 0 luggages under a file with only my name .
neutral	we didn_'_t receive any kind of emergency toiletries or any more help from the personal .
neutral	my luggage appeared the next_day when we went to ask to the airport if they had any news because nobody contacted us , but my boyfriend '_s luggage didn_'_t appeared .
neutral	in the online tracking site it said that his luggage was sent with mine but we searched in the airport again and there was nothing .
neutral	the personnel of af in mexico '_s airport was very rude .
neutral	then i called everyday during 0_weeks to the central phone line of air_france to see if they had any news and they finally figured_out that they were not searching for the luggage of my boyfriend but mine , even i said multiple_times that my luggage arrived but his luggage didn_'_t .
neutral	at the end , they sent his luggage to brussels , because we live in belgium .
neutral	then we return mexico / paris / amsterdam .
neutral	in paris , we asked to the attention center of af if they knew something about the luggage and if it was really in brussels and they just replied that they couldn_'_t call to brussels but just inside the airport .
neutral	the only professional treatment and good attention we got was in amsterdam , with the personnel of klm , who arranged everything that the luggage was delivered to my boyfriend '_s home instead of making us going to pick it up at the airport and come_back home .
neutral	after this nightmare , i '_ll continue travelling with klm , specially direct flights .
neutral	but never again with air_france .
neutral	all goods ordered were showing in stock and were paid for .
neutral	when parcel arrived one of the items were not there and it showed on the delivery note that this item would be refunded .
neutral	sent an_email to customer_services asking about the refund - no reply .
neutral	have been checking my statement and still no refund .
neutral	i would be careful in buying anything from here again .
neutral	needless to say not a happy_bunny .
neutral	the deliveries are convenient and accurate , however there are two things i do not like about my experience thus_far .
neutral	0 .
neutral	in most deliveries i receive ( all canned_cat_food ), up to a third of the cans are dented .
neutral	i know this can be dangerous , but i cannot_afford to throw_away this much food .
neutral	i assume the product is not in this condition when it leaves the warehouse , so i think the deliveries need to be better packed or handled with care during shipping .
neutral	0 .
neutral	when i signed_up for automatic_deliveries , i assumed i was locked in at the price that i was quoted for the first delivery .
neutral	however , it has come to my attention that petflow varies the price of the products even for these repeat orders , so the cost can go up from month to month without notification or confirmation .
neutral	i think the price should remain fixed at when the order was placed , with adjustments once a year for price increases .
neutral	ordered a product from ecomfort and five to seven_days_later it was delivered .
neutral	the delivery was not the best , issues with tracking , but other than that , just perfect .
neutral	once we arrived to the central_location of the river oaks resort we found ourselves trying to locate the correct resort .
neutral	i drove to four different river oaks resorts , at the river oaks golf resort i was told the office closes at 0pm by the bar manager .
neutral	i was never told this when i reserved the condo for the weekend , by phone nor by email .
neutral	after driving for 0 0 / 0 hours to get there and to find the right place for check in .
neutral	i called the number posted on the door of beach vacations for after hours and was told they did not have a reservation in my name .
neutral	i then phoned bookit . com and spoke with them about the resort not having a reservation in my name .
neutral	they call the same person that i just spoke to , and what happens they find that i do indeed have a reservation along with the keys and directions to our condo are in a lock box on the side of the building .
neutral	thanks to bookit to get the information from them that i tried to retrieve with no luck at all .
neutral	i will know better the next time , if there is a next time with them at beach vacations located in myrtle_beach south_carolina .
neutral	simply_supplements have an easy to use web_site and ordering online is simple , however they were let_down by using an inefficient courier service called hermes who allegedly tried to deliver the package on the fourth and fifth business day after ordering but failed to do so as there was someone at home to receive it and no card was left - eventually after a lot of prompting by simply_supplements as they were the only people who could track it , it was eventually delivered 0 working days after order - just in time for me to take the glucosamine for my dogs on holiday to scotland , to ensure that their joints would cope with the hills !
neutral	unfortunetly my wedding lables that you did for me 0 times were unsatisfactory ..
neutral	do you look at the finish product before you ship out ?
neutral	the words mike & beth were printed poorley on top of what you printed .....
neutral	other then that .. shipping was nice & fast
neutral	but , i cannot use the lables :(
neutral	i donot want my $ back , i hope you fix this for the next person
neutral	i was excited to receive the items & it was very fast and easy .
neutral	unfortunately one jumper began unravelling after a short_period of wear but i feel_confident this was bad_luck as a friend had ordered the top previously & wears it to death !
neutral	i bought the synthetic set and 0 other brushes , spent £_000 so not so cheap !
neutral	the brushes are good but bristles fall out quite alot , also the blusher brush that i bought isnt very good .
neutral	the bronzer brush is the best and the rest are average .
neutral	i went for the most expensive thinking they would be the best quality but after going from estee lauder and mac to these i am still unsure if i have wasted my money or not .
neutral	i '_ve been using another brand for four years and lately it causes my printer to think it '_s out of ink .
neutral	when i change the old cartridge , the old cartridge is still full .
neutral	i suspect the ink is clogging the printer jets .
neutral	so_far inkfarm cartridges are working ok but i have only use one set of four .
neutral	i love the convenience , but my deliveries seem to take_forever once they are shipped .
neutral	also , i find thd website very hard to use .
neutral	i can never seem to mskes chanfes without a problem .
neutral	they said order would ship in 0 days took a week
neutral	gutes frühstück , aber die einrichtung ist_sehr altmodisch und kitschig
neutral	good website & easy to use ordering system but delivery charges need re thinking .
neutral	we used to use parcelforce for our worldwide deliveries & they charged £_00 to spain so £_00 . 00 is totally unreasonable
neutral	wouldhave given them 0 but they need to kick their sellers in the butt fot their inability to ship faster !
neutral	travelex seemed a good idea .
neutral	put a certain_amount on my card .
neutral	all was fine until the cash ran_out and i needed to top up , but how ?
neutral	wasn_'_t sure if i tried to transfer from an english bank whether the money on the card would be in the correct currency , so didn_'_t use it any more .
neutral	i still have a small_amount on it , in australian dollars , not sure how to change them to another currency .
neutral	delivery . com gives the best promotions but the discounts ( usually during the weekend ) do not apply automatically after orders are placed .
neutral	the promotions check - box function used to work at one point , then later there were direct link promotions sent in emails for the promotion to apply and appear during checkout .
neutral	too complicated and not a consistent function that works the majority of the time .
neutral	this issue almost made me stop using delivery . com until i figured_out that the promotions check - box function disappeared and i have to use the direct links in my email then order then checkout then sign - in then complete the order .
neutral	promotions function is best when it '_s just automatically applied and you can see the discount taken off before check out and when you are already signed in .
neutral	if we had had a two day visit it could have got more stars , but for a one day visit it took too long on the buses with the traffic . we had to get off at one point and catch a tube as we werent going to have anytime to see the tower of london .
neutral	the extremely_helpful guide at the embankment sorted us out our tickets that werent scanning so that we could go to the tower on the ferry .
neutral	the guide near buckingham place was useless he put us on a bus that took_ages and we would have ended_up after 0 / 0 hr having to travel another 00_mins to the embankment if we hadnt got off when we did .
neutral	the drivers were all friendly
neutral	cheap prices .
neutral	but takes to long to get parts .
neutral	shipping price expensive .
neutral	she would not drink the water to which we had added the product
neutral	thank_you hostelworld !!!
neutral	you ` re really helping_me a lot for being a place for choosing a recommended hostel .
neutral	you also serving us an easy way to book .
neutral	thank_you thank_you thank_you
neutral	the only_complaint i have is that the delivery drivers do not read instructions .
neutral	i put very explicit instructions for delivery and they do not follow them .
neutral	otherwise , i usually order from the same places and the food tends to be very good , though this last go - around the burgers were somewhat cold .
neutral	thanks !
neutral	looked much_better in the catalog ..
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	i guess the price was too good to be true do not order .
neutral	i had a very hard time reading the two words you have to retype .
neutral	i looked at eight different set of the words and finally found one set that i could read .
neutral	very blurry , not clear choices .
neutral	this could be a problem .
neutral	big_bus_tours is always a good choice when we travel anywhere and we did enjoy the tour in paris but compared to another leading operator in paris , it didn_'_t cover all the sights and as a result cost us more as we had to pay for metro tickets to get to other_places .
neutral	the flowers turned_up on the same day requested and they were very nice .
neutral	but i was dissappointed as i tried to contact the customer_service team to upgrade the delivery and i am still_waiting for them to respond to my request 0 days_later .
neutral	its a good job this wasnt life or death .
neutral	so flowers great , customer_service very poor in fact non existant as they never replied to me .
neutral	overall the pricing for this booking was okay , however when we got to our hotel in new_york we found out that there were over $_000 of taxes that needed to be paid at the hotel .
neutral	we were quite shocked by this as although the booking confirmation did state that taxes in resort weren_'_t included i never imagined that they would come to that much !
neutral	received usual order a couple of days late and also no dry_ice in package ... not even plastic_bags that usually hold it .
neutral	of course , order was ruined .
neutral	i left a message at customer_service number and was contacted the next_morning to let_me know replacement order was on the way .
neutral	new order was hard frozen as usual .
neutral	apparently , the person_who packed the order omitted the dry_ice .
neutral	i have liked the products from white_flower farms , but they do not communicate well once an order is placed - no emails about expected ship dates .
neutral	their shipping rates are exorbitant .
neutral	i only buy from them when given a gift_certificate from my sister .
neutral	i can get equal products for lower price / less_expensive shipping with better communication about the order & shipping
neutral	i have only twice ordered goods from vet_medic .
neutral	they were recommended to me so i didn_'_t expect any_problems .
neutral	the first order was for pouches of cat_food that were stored in cardboard_boxes and a heavy_bag of dried cat_food .
neutral	these were packed with the heavy_bag on top of the boxes containing the pouches , and on arrival the " pouches " boxes were all broken and twisted although the actual goods had not been damaged .
neutral	i thought this was pretty rubbish and emailed vat medic to tell them about the delivery , not for reasons of " compensation " but because i thought they might want to check the way they pack the boxes .
neutral	however , i received no reply .
neutral	recently i decided to give them another go .
neutral	i ordered just the pouches .
neutral	the lady was friendly on the phone and dealt_with the order efficiently .
neutral	the goods arrived in good condition on time .
neutral	however the invoice sent via_email did not include the cost of post and packing .
neutral	it didn_'_t really matter to me but again i was left with an impression that the company " could do better ".
neutral	i bought 0 shipments from betterbathrooms . com - the first being everything for the bathroom , except a tap which i ended_up getting shipped in a second separate delivery .
neutral	both_times the shopping and paying experience were as one would expect , the website was easy to navigate , and even contacting customer_service team was not painful .
neutral	however , both_times the delivery experience was rubbish :
neutral	- the main delivery the guy left on a pallet outside of the front_door on a main thoroughfare , refused even to help carry it into the hallway , didn_'_t allow time to check the delivery and was quite rude ( this was after i had to rebook my delivery time as they tried to deliver it to the wrong house and had said i wasn_'_t in to receive )
neutral	- the second delivery of the tap - i paid for next_day delivery and it arrived 0 days_later .
neutral	if betterbathrooms . com were to improve their delivery service providers , they would get 0_stars ; however because it '_s impossible to receive the deliveries , they only get 0 .
neutral	ordered a refurbished power_window_motor - took over a week to arrive from california and didn_'_t have an option to request for a signature upon delivery .
neutral	we have thieves over here that steal packages left from mail carriers .
neutral	i had to wait practically all day friday and monday because the part was initially suppose to be delivered some time on friday and then it was bumped up to monday some time .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	wait and watch for them to deliver the package .
neutral	once motor was installed , it works , but the window rolls up very slow .
neutral	not what i was expecting .
neutral	we have also have a " core " to return , but the receipt has no details on how to go about returning it .
neutral	so , with all that being said , there '_s room for improvement on how the whole_process works ...
neutral	the oxford suite of chico was very nice .
neutral	although did it have an accessible room waiting as_promised .
neutral	the front_desk_clerk was kind enough to call a guest that hadn_'_t arrived to upgrade their room so we would receive an accessible room .
neutral	never had any_problems with travel_republic and should i need to contact them they are always helpful
neutral	i have a had great experience with ebottles , but my last order was for glass_bottles a case of twenty costing me fifty - five dollars and shipping and handling was half the price .
neutral	i think that was really expensive and forced to cancel by order and i went elsewhere and got the same bottles for less , so in other words i could buy two cases for the price of one .
neutral	i am not saying that i would never to business with them again , but i really think that they should do something about the shipping and handling cost .
neutral	the cancellation of my flight out of atlanta was understandable ... but i did not need a barrage of e_- mails telling_me i must call travelocity to check on my reservation .
neutral	delta had already rebooked everything and all was well .
neutral	finally , after so many e_- mails , i did call travelocity .
neutral	the two people i spoke with were pleasant , but not very easy to understand .
neutral	better english_speaking skills would be so appreciated .
neutral	i could not find the function that allows a search 0 - 0 days either side of my departure dates ..
neutral	we havnt actually opened it yet but i '_ve rated u on what i '_ve seen so_far .
neutral	i was quite disappointed when the parcel was delivered .
neutral	this was a surprise present for my husband and that surprise was ruined when he saw your logo on the back of the envelope and knew what it was .
neutral	i placed an order with 00_dollar mall , and i received an_email on jan . 0 stating that my order had shipped - only the us postal service didn_'_t receive any shipping information until the 0th of january .
neutral	today is jan . 00th and i have not received the order as of yet .
neutral	i have placed orders before ( they were slow as well ) but overall i was satisfied when i finally did receive the merchandise .
neutral	in the two orders that i have placed and received , the product quality is excellent .
neutral	ordering is wonderful , especially placing future orders so that i do not run_out of food for my dog .
neutral	but the delivery experiences i have had is much to be desired .
neutral	the first order was delivered to a completely different address .
neutral	then the person_who received my delivery brought it to me and then chewed me out because my delivery was so heavy for him to carry and that i should make_sure that my address is correct .
neutral	my address was correct - fedex screwed_up .
neutral	my second order was delivered in two_separate delivery dates - four days apart .
neutral	when i talked to a customer_service rep at petflow he said he could not understand_why my order was separated for different delivery dates .
neutral	i will give petflow one more delivery to see if they can get the delivery correct .
neutral	the cost of the food was very reasonable initially but it is rising constantly - i know the excuse will be the gasoline prices but i think that customers should get a little break .
neutral	i was pleased to find a good deal on book it for a condo on the beach and after_reading through all the details i was excited to book my vacation .
neutral	i was very disappointed when i read through the itinerary and saw that there were additional hidden_fees not mentioned by book it during the reservation process .
neutral	with the hidden_fees , i could have gone_through the company for a reservation and paid the same price .
neutral	the glasses arrived in good condition and was packaged for minimal damage .
neutral	however standard shipping is extremely slow and expedited_shipping was ridiculously expensive .
neutral	will probably not order from this company again for that reason alone .
neutral	order arrived_promptly but 0 out 0 items were wrong .
neutral	these were picked_up by courier for return the following_day , but would have liked the correct items delivered when wrong items were picked_up as now have to wait_until they receive them .
neutral	not very cost_effective .
neutral	customer_services were very polite and helpful , but have had no further notification of redelivery .
neutral	i '_ve been tracking my order that i placed with you online on sept . 00 .
neutral	it is now sept . 00 .
neutral	when i checked earlier today , the package was in georgia and had been at the same location since sept . 00 .
neutral	it seems that the package is held at various_locations in the southeast us for 0 or 0 days at a time .
neutral	before , whenever i ordered from pureformulas , i received my product ( s ) within just a few_days .
neutral	i was so impressed with this quick service that i assumed this most_recent order would also arrive in a more timely_fashion .
neutral	found the site easy to deal with and the delivery and discounts were very good .
neutral	watch arrived quickly but " free gift " was not included in parcel .
neutral	feel disappointed that despite 0 emails ( unanswered ) and 0 phone_calls saying the free gift of earrings would be sent , they have never arrived .
neutral	spoilt what would have been an otherwise perfect transaction .
neutral	would like it to more user_friendly .
neutral	took me a little_bit to get around and understand what i was paying for .
neutral	one thing that could improve operations would to have common_sense if you see double orders
neutral	we got a sample_kit of your paint because we just needed to touch up a few spots on my son '_s crib before using it for our new baby .
neutral	i '_m glad your paint is so safe , but it '_s really expensive , so i was hoping a sample would do the trick .
neutral	we waited for about a week and your website said it still hadn_'_t shipped yet , so i wrote to ask when it would ship .
neutral	i then checked the mail the next_day and it was there , even_though the night before your site was still saying it hadn_'_t shipped .
neutral	so that was weird , especially for something that i thought was going to require a signature - it was just in our mailbox .
neutral	i never got an_email response to my inquiry , but i figured that was just because you guys knew i was about to get it the next_day .
neutral	but then a couple of days_later another kit arrived .
neutral	i don_'_t even know .
neutral	that seems like kind of a waste of money on your end , but whatever .
neutral	anyway , i made the mistake of leaving them on the dining_room table .
neutral	my four year_old opened it and ate some , because he thought it looked like applesauce .
neutral	so i '_m glad it '_s non_- toxic .
neutral	while i was cleaning up the mess , my husband put it on all the little chews and chips on the crib without doing a test patch first ( i guess he figured black is black ) and when it dried we were dismayed to see that it dried matte .
neutral	i can '_t imagine anyone would want to paint walls or furniture in a nursery with matte paint , so i suspect you do this on purpose so that people can '_t get away with just using a sample_kit instead of a full can .
neutral	needless to say , the crib looks terrible and will have to be sanded down and repainted .
neutral	our bad for not doing a test patch , but whenever it is that we finally have time for this project , we won_'_t be using lullaby paints .
neutral	it '_s just way to expensive for us , especially_since this is now going to be an even costlier project .
neutral	i would still recommend you to friends though ( and have ) because i like how safe your paints are .
neutral	but only with the reservation that you ' re mail - order only where we live , and very expensive .
neutral	the staff did not know the exact location of the hotel i was trying to book and was reluctant to give me the hotel '_s direct number so i could find out the information from them !
neutral	0 ) when we arrived our booking wasn_'_t on file
neutral	0 ) our room had lots of broken features e . g fan
neutral	0 ) it says that you can get wifi on your tv for € 0 but the wifi wasn_'_t working and neither was the tv
neutral	0 ) we were unfortunate to have to deal with one horrible receptionist
neutral	0 ) on one of the nights we stayed at the hotel for a few drinks and the bar staff were very friendly and good fun .
neutral	apart_from point 0 , i would have given this hotel 0_star .
neutral	for the amount of money we payed to stay here i think there services could be a lot better .
neutral	all and all not impressed
neutral	hope if we need to use them they are ok
neutral	am fairly happy with the service , however have found will order something in the sale
neutral	and then the price is reduced again , this has happened a couple of times .
neutral	when contacting them regarding this , although quite polite , will not adjust price .
neutral	am very wary about ordering large items incase this happens , altough the amount may not be very large
neutral	find this very frustrating .
neutral	well i '_ve not lost any weight yet what the seretplease send me any advise how these work i got 0 stone to loose
neutral	was impressed with the range of furniture available but disappointed at the hidden_costs of delivery etc and the lack of versatility i . e .
neutral	taking part of the order as i was tied to a weekly route which did not allow me to choose a convenient day for delivery .
neutral	if dfs had the item i wanted i would use them again but would not let myself be taken in by the pricing which ended_up at almost double the ticket price when all the promises were fulfilled in respect of delivery and guarantees which i think make the product expensive .
neutral	still_awaiting delivery of my order so cannot give a full review as do not know what the goods are like .
neutral	didn_'_t have any_issues .
neutral	nice staff .
neutral	i was accepted at clear account was waiting for money then got a text saying wasn_'_t accepted so wasn_' tt very happy about tnis 0 minute iam and the next i '_m not thankyou
neutral	i recently ordered a case of peking duck dog_food .
neutral	upon_receiving the case from fed_ex , there was this terrible order
neutral	coming from the box .
neutral	i left the case sit on the counter , figuring the odor would dissapate .
neutral	i placed the case in a closet where i keep the food and the jackets hanging in the closet , picked_up the odor , so i sprayed fabreze to try and get_rid of the odor .
neutral	this is the only dog_food my dog will it .
neutral	first bought it in charlotte , nc , no store here so have to order it online .
neutral	thank_you for the feedback .
neutral	i opened the outside case and the smell got worse , opened the case of food and the smell was horrific .
neutral	after taking all the
neutral	cans out , there was a damaged can that had spread over the rest of the cans .
neutral	i washed all the cans and left them out to air before putting them away again .
neutral	always get your goods delivered quickly but for some_reason the last two orders have taken ages and i had needed them urgently and no reason given until i phone upto find out , the service is not as good as it used to be
neutral	i have not used product yet .
neutral	i need to make_sure my doctor is okay with it .
neutral	i received part of my order and then looked to see where the rest of the order was after it hadn_'_t arrived for 0_weeks - there , after several clicks , i saw " back order ."
neutral	this food was not recalled so i can '_t imagine why i was able to order it and suddenly it was back ordered .
neutral	an e_- mail or telephone_call would have been nice --- before i got so low , 0_weeks after the order was placed .
neutral	i shop at our local alia tan_jay store in victoria , bc but must_say i am disappointed in the very limited amount of plus size clothing available .
neutral	the only store that carries plus sizes is tillicum mall despite the fact that you have recently opened 0 very large alia tan_jay stores in town ( hillside mall and westshore centre ), neither of which even carries plus sizes !
neutral	after many years shopping in person at your tillicum store , i found your website and after many disappointments ( my size , desired colour , pattern not available ), i have learned to shop only online .
neutral	this is not preferable as in the past i did rely_on your helpful staff at tillicum to guide me and assist me choose clothing and accessories .
neutral	with online shopping , i no_longer have that experience .
neutral	i would like to see more selection for plus size clothing in your stores , particularly in victoria where plus size shopping is very limited .
neutral	there is a huge opportunity that alia tan_jay could be capitalizing on !
neutral	thank_you for " listening " to me !
neutral	didn_'_t receive next_day delivery as stated , wasn_'_t able to arrange a delivery time to suit me initially .
neutral	received damaged goods , so all in all it has taken 0_weeks to get my purchase and be able to use it .
neutral	i was a bit disappointed , but did find that the people i spoke to at sports and leisure helpful .
neutral	my teenage_daughters always seem to want items of clothing off of this website .
neutral	it '_s ok until you need to return items !
neutral	!
neutral	takes_forever to get refunded .
neutral	no exchange_policy so you have to reorder paying p_& p all over again plus boohoo have the audacity to take a restocking_fee from you !
neutral	!
neutral	for this reason i always try to avoid like the plague !!
neutral	!
neutral	i was disappointed that it took one month for my order to arrive .
neutral	this order should have been here by mon .
neutral	or tues . not satisfied .
neutral	this is the first time i purchased insurance with this company , so i don_'_t feel capable of rating them .
neutral	have used wowcher a couple of time and been slightly disappointed in communication , i have one outstanding order which i '_m still_awaiting delivery of well over the 00 days .
neutral	also i have emailed a query to them regarding an order i processed but the wowcher has now expired even_though i had placed order i have had no response from them ........
neutral	it '_s made my experience a little_disappointing making me wary of what i would do in be future as i will be worried of losing money again
neutral	i sweat a lot and find it embarrising .
neutral	thought i , d found the answer to myprayers when i saw this product but sadly not .
neutral	although i do not sweat as much it does not stop completely as you said and i still wear dark colours as am afraid it will show through on light ones .
neutral	my search continues for somethingto help , me .
neutral	when i ordered i was told would deliver the week of march_0th , in fact delivered last friday , and the time before i had ordered 000 gallons , yet this time having ordered 0000 gallons it did not register any different on my tank gage , which troubled me , as although their ticket had both numbers it did not seem to tally with my experience of how quantities register on my gage given that i had approx the same in my tank last time , it showed on my gage slightly less .
neutral	i was very happy with how quickly the food i ordered shipped but when it arrived , the expiration_date had already_passed by 0_weeks .
neutral	they won_'_t give me the credit_reports that i need / signed_up for .
neutral	i already called the customer_service line once ... now it '_s telling_me to call again .
neutral	this website is starting to look like too much_trouble and not worth it .
neutral	the wrong_size bowls were delivered and my dogs will not use them .
neutral	however , they are well made .
neutral	the person_who took my reservation , put it through twice , thus i was charged double for a one night_stay .
neutral	i am still trying to get the overcharge refunded .
neutral	and have spent hours on the phone trying to get the refund .
neutral	my double payment was refunded on thursday , july 00 .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	i really have gotten used to the convenience of printing at home ( 00 years_now ), but you originally offered a choice of access for $_00 . 00 / month or a 00_% premium on postage as purchased .
neutral	my quantity has changed greatly and it is no_longer a smart expense at $_00 . 00 / month .
neutral	i may have to cancel , but would not if i only had to pay the premium as used .
neutral	otherwise , it is a great service .
neutral	i was excited by rebtel when it was first recommended to me by a friend , and i '_ve used it several_times with success .
neutral	however , in a recent experience , i called someone , they didn_'_t answer , but then they called back using the rebtel numbers , and unknowingly i somehow " accepted " a collect call .
neutral	because i believed the rate to be 0 . 0 cents per_minute , i talked for 00_minutes , only to find my account charged for close to $ 0 .
neutral	apparently a small noise made at the beginning of my call was supposed to alert me that i was getting charged at this absurdly high rate .
neutral	i think it '_s abusive of rebtel to believe anyone could figure that out .
neutral	i promptly went into my settings and changed my alert for receiving collect calls - i suggest all other_users do the same .
neutral	but i am now much more hesitant to use rebtel due to fear of other hidden_charges .
neutral	the leisure bra is comfortable , once it '_s on .
neutral	need help due to arthritis .
neutral	and the top hook doesn_'_t want to stay hooked .
neutral	the hotel is right across from the bay and the opera house .
neutral	about 0 blocks from the downtown area .
neutral	easy walking to shops and restaurants .
neutral	we arrived at 0 : 00 a . m . and were the last ones to get in our room at 0 : 00 p . m .
neutral	the desk_clerk held our_luggage and gave_us suggestions on where to go to eat .
neutral	the staff really tried to help .
neutral	we had one tour scheduled that did not show up our room was small but nice and the breakfast_buffet was excellent .
neutral	other than the wait to get into our room and the tour that didn ` t show up , the hotel was fine .
neutral	i received my first shipment 0 months_ago and my first recurring last_week .
neutral	it came on time , but half was missing .
neutral	i then got an_email_saying i wouldn_'_t get it but i would get my money back .
neutral	kind of disappointing but i guess they handled it well .
neutral	i have ordered numerouse times for this website never had a robles but the one time i have had an_issue and needed to speak with customer_service no one answers calls , on hold for 00_minutes then hung_up ) numerouse other calls and emails nd all they let sending me is surveys so agin this is another survey ......... trying to get_ahold of someone in customer_service !
neutral	there were two packages where everything i ordered could have fit in the first box that was sent .
neutral	the first box was way too big for what was in it , therefore wasteful .
neutral	the second took an extended time to arrive .
neutral	that being said , overpriced shipping .
neutral	the products were as_described .
neutral	a bit of hassle , when wanting to return item .
neutral	had to email photo of dent in heated radiator , didn_'_t really show on photo so another one was requested after we had boxed up the item !
neutral	couldn_'_t exchange item for a slightly different one , after being told previously on the phone i could , so have to wait for refund before re ordering .
neutral	hopefully refund won_'_t take too long !
neutral	well we placed our order online , it was very easy .
neutral	our order was confirmed by email , which also stated that our order would be delivered in 00hrs .
neutral	this was one of the reasons for ordering from this company .
neutral	however a week_later and we have still not received the main part of our order !
neutral	i ordered a few miniatures from the site for a birthday_present .
neutral	they arrived very quickly and i had no_problems with the ordering process .
neutral	however , i was disappointed to discover on receiving my order that the bottles are not what i would consider proper ' miniatures ' but are in fact just small bottles with a generic label stuck on .
neutral	i '_m trusting that the whisky is as stated , but it '_s not so nice to not have a branded bottle , particularly as they are to be a gift .
neutral	i think it should be made clear on the website that the small bottles are simply small samples , presumably taken from a larger bottle , rather_than proper ' miniatures '.
neutral	purchased online on 00 / 00 .
neutral	today is 00 / 00 and i still don_'_t have it yet .
neutral	wish delivery could be better since the money was taken out of my account literally within 00_minutes of placing the order .
neutral	the frames i received do not look the same as the ones pictured .
neutral	although they are also ralph laurens , and are nice , i was very disappointed .
neutral	the ones pictured looked pink ( rose ) with gray temples .
neutral	the ones i received are brownish pink , the entire frame .
neutral	i have not had my prescription put in them and am considering returning them .
neutral	the service was very good , sent quickly -- just wish they were the right frames .
neutral	pity that upon delivery 0 of the chairs were broken .
neutral	now some three_weeks_later .
neutral	i finally have all 0 chairs but have only just had broken chairs picked_up .
neutral	some much hassle has made me think i would not purchase from you again .
neutral	ps paul & william at made have been very
neutral	i sent a gift_card to a friend and really wanted the gift to be anonymous .
neutral	there was a field asking for your name that specifically said , " leave this blank if you wish the gift to be anonymous ."
neutral	i left it blank .
neutral	however , my info was still included with the gift , as my friend immediately thanked me for it .
neutral	perhaps there was another box somewhere that i missed , but if so , i wish it would have been better marked .
neutral	everything else about the process went_smoothly .
neutral	in - person or over phone with direct business_owners best way to go .
neutral	i love my couch , it looks just like the picture , but your contact service is terrible .
neutral	i use travelocity whenever we travel but they seem to have a lot of flight changes .
neutral	in addition when i contacted them about out changes i asked since they changed the flight out and back why i couldn_'_t have a nonstop flight between cities without_having to pay .
neutral	it seems to me if they can make_changes any time they want then they should accommodate requests from the customer also .
neutral	after not receiving my parcel after 00 days , made a phone_call to preciouslittleones and promptly dispatched my parcel first_class . good quilty worth the wait :)
neutral	i ordered 0 gift_cards to applebees to give to bridesmaids at my wedding .
neutral	one gift_card was a regular gift_card .
neutral	one gift_card came and said happy birthday on it .
neutral	the third gift_card had snowflakes all over it , it being may that didn_'_t make_sense .
neutral	i didn_'_t open and look until the night before when i was going to place them in envelopes and boy was i suprised .
neutral	on line they all looked like regular applebee cards i clicked on .
neutral	trying explaining those to a bunch of women .
neutral	made me wonder_if the site was legite .
neutral	i ordered some ' geek ' glasses and they arrived quickly which was what i needed .
neutral	i liked them but decided not to keep them because thet were too big for me and this is were my only issue has come up .
neutral	the returns_policy isn_'_t printed on the dispatch note / recipt you get in the parcel .
neutral	you have to go on the website , where it '_s only 00 days ( a little short !)
neutral	and that had passed .
neutral	it was over xmas and there was no_indication of any different arrangements or timeframes over that time .
neutral	i only found out i had longer by contacting customer_services .
neutral	returns were free which was good and the return was processed with no problem , but they need to be clearer about their returns_policy and not make customers have to go looking for it .
neutral	otherwise it would have been 0 - 0_stars .
neutral	they charged me for two orders when their was only one .
neutral	it did get corrected
neutral	they never sent ; the free bag of food that they said they would , for my dog to try , so , as far as i am concerned the order was was not done right and i don . t think i will order again .
neutral	i find a store that sells the dog_food ,
neutral	not to far from where i live .
neutral	i will go there next time
neutral	loyalty should warrant discounts
neutral	i luv there merchandise but , i hate the long wait for stuff , when they get your order wrong .
neutral	also the way you are not notify if something is not in stock .
neutral	you have to call them and wait for your call to go thru i lost four hours of my life that i can never get back .
neutral	just waitin to talk to a rep , they need to tighten up on there customer_service , and start offering coupons or incentitives when they screw up .
neutral	remember without customers there would be no amiclubwear , over all i am very satisfied by the way , i have been treated so_far .
neutral	i cant completely give them a hard time i luv there stuff .
neutral	i booked a flight to zurich - dublin on 0 . 0 . 00 .
neutral	this worked , but the offer of a £_00 reduction on the next flight book with you didn ` t work !
neutral	on entering my address , it just wouldn ` t work .
neutral	perhaps you could rectify this , as i might book a flight to london going in july .
neutral	kind_regards , pamela roelli - gorman
neutral	i looked at the online video about the product prior to ordering , but it did not go into where the screws should be placed when mounting the aluminum brackets to the garage_door bottom .
neutral	there was no additional instructional material included with the order or available on the website to clarify the proper installation .
neutral	luckily , a common_sense approach resulted in a satisfactory installation , but directions would have been helpful .
neutral	so it '_s a good product with inadequate installation_instructions .
neutral	we decided a sight seeing tour for my mother who was visiting me .
neutral	booking online was very easy and getting on board was too .
neutral	we were not given any directions about which was best way to start our tour and untill we got onboard we didn_'_t know difference_between red or blue tour .
neutral	though day was overcast but it was warm , we were not offered any rain protection at all which normally is provided by big_bus company on a day like that .
neutral	over all it was not a happy experience .
neutral	i wish i looked at the reviews for this company before i placed my order in .
neutral	i placed my order 0 / 00 / 00 ( i got an e_- mail confirmation saying that my order was being_processed ) it is now 0 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	i looked on my order status and it said that my order has_been shipped out .
neutral	why didn_'_t i receive any notification that the order was shipped ?
neutral	they were so quick to take the money out my account but so slow with shipping .
neutral	the company claims that they shipped my order but i '_ll believe them when i have the package in my hand .
neutral	if not , automatic complaint to the bbb .--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- this is just an update_: today i finally got my package ( it actually came earlier then expected ) with surprisingly everything inside , right size , right color , and correct item .
neutral	the only_downfall is that their clothes are shit ( for lack of a better word ) i know not to waste my money here .
neutral	i '_ll just stick to greatglam . com
neutral	never in my life was i able to get three_pairs of shoes for $_00 . 00 and free_shipping who could beat that ?
neutral	" not dwd shoes " lol all my shoes were fantastic except for one pair that had a scuff on the left hand side of the left shoe but its hardly noticeable i will be buying again soon but wish that they could tell me if the shoes were made in china or some other country because i had just started to wear on of the pairs of shoes the ones with the scuff they felt fine without socks but when i put a pair of socks on they were so tight ouch !
neutral	:( so tried another pair with socks and they felt fine at first but the more i walked in them
neutral	the smaller they felt damn it get some shoes in that are true to the size i '_m out of $_00 . oo i want to order from amiclub again i just want to make_sure that the shoes are the size that you say they are i dont like waisting money
neutral	i did not say it was ok to switch my vintage .... i saw the order confirmation said they had to ask me first , and they did not .
neutral	i ordered a 0000 and got a 0000 , not the same !
neutral	i ordered a 0 - 0 / 0 in .
neutral	hepvo and received a 0 - 0 / 0 in one .
neutral	i almost sent it back but purchased some adapters and was able to make it work .
neutral	it did arrive quickly however .
neutral	we got back to be told that our car had a flat battery .
neutral	we may not have closed a door properly but since there would have been a light on inside the car , i would have thought they would have noticed .
neutral	we called as usual the second we picked our suitcases up but no sign of anyone with our car when we arrived at the the point we were meant to meet .
neutral	it was approx 0 minutes but he then did not give us the ticket to get out the car_park and we had to wait another few_minutes for him to return from wherever he had gone to give us the ticket .
neutral	i love the price .
neutral	i absolutely love that quality of the campus .
neutral	it arrived in a great deal of speedy time .
neutral	well package and handled .
neutral	i love all the options .
neutral	looks just like what i ordered and i appreciate that and the company but the only big problem i have is my order was a three - piece set and one of the sets is either warped or the wood is curling so it doesn_'_t lay flat against the wall at all .
neutral	i '_m not even too sure how i can get it to stay on the wall .
neutral	ugh !
neutral	excellent prices , very fast shipping ... but not very good on customer_service .
neutral	my support_ticket was opened on the 0th of june -- as of the 00th of june i still_haven_'_t received a response , and i marked my request as " urgent ".
neutral	:(
neutral	i placed my order for some hiking shoes on saturday in order for me to get a few_days to break them in before a camping trip the following friday .
neutral	i did not receive my shoes until the friday that i was heading out .
neutral	i '_m not sure if i should place the blame on tahoe_mountain sports or usps for this but 0 day shipping doesn_'_t mean you will receive your item in 0 days .
neutral	>=/
neutral	had to throw all three plants out .
neutral	because of aphids only live plants in my apartment :(
neutral	my daughters plant is doing fine
neutral	i had to call myself to pay those guys , and now i have to go an entire month without insurance because the payment was too late , and that was not my fault .
neutral	po 00000 , ordered pieces ; yet receiving representative called and let_me know that we had only received pieces of part ordered .
neutral	the web_site indicated ' stock '.
neutral	i was not informed that only a partial was shipped .
neutral	i contacted jane dawson , who indicated inventory was short and would be shipping balance in the future .
neutral	the hilton @ the mark center in alexandria .
neutral	va .
neutral	this is not the place to go if you are looking for a nice getaway .
neutral	this hotel is geared towards people on business trips and conferences .
neutral	also i didn_'_t know that you had to pay for parking .
neutral	so i was not at all happy with that .
neutral	$_00 for self parking and $_00 for valet .
neutral	when you go to book for a hotel , they need to let you know that there is a charge for parking .
neutral	so i didn_'_t think i got a good deal on this hotel getaway .
neutral	it was somewhat tedious to have to order each engraved pen separately .
neutral	on other_sites i can put in the quantity and there may be a dropbox to enter the five names for each pen .
neutral	sent the wrong_size item , so i had to go to shop to change it
neutral	my flight was mistakenly cancelled by american_airlines when i called to inquire_about a flight change .
neutral	when i went up to the counter to check - in for my confirmed flight it showed cancelled and the ticket agent informed me there was nothing they could do as i had booked it with travelocity .
neutral	it proved challenging to obtain help .
neutral	flowers arrived a day late - apparently it was a national holiday in spain but nobody thought to notify me !
neutral	the recipient waited in all day .
neutral	it was only when i queried it the the next_day was i informed of the reason_why .
neutral	the flowers when they did arrive however were really good .
neutral	would probably use floraqueen again but they could improve on communication and tracking_info for delivery etc .
neutral	i ordered two books at the same time and i got one within 0 days and the other one didn_'_t come for 00 days .
neutral	they were both in great condition and i appreciated the easiness to use the bookbyte site .
neutral	item is a bit marked from transport or packaging ,
neutral	which is a bit dissapointing , the foam is not of a high enough quality and after a day being open is still dented in places
neutral	love the shape and carry bag
neutral	i liked the quick and efficient service , but when the man had finished filling the tank we noticed a strong smell of oil in the garden for days after .
neutral	we thought he must of spilled oil on the drive .
neutral	my husband noticed that the delivery man had left the breather cap off and it had been off for days .
neutral	he put it back in yesterday , but we were dissapointed with the service , hated the constant smell of kerosene and fear there may be a health risk .
neutral	payment made 0 / 0 / 00 .
neutral	order still processing .
neutral	when shipped and received will review .
neutral	0 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	i ordered some additional name_tags and the order defaulted to " free_shipping " so i thought that was a great option .
neutral	then after 00 days , when i still had not received the items ordered , i called and was told that " free_shipping can take up to 0_weeks ".
neutral	that is just ridiculous , unless their shipping agent was the next person '_s car which happened to be heading my way .
neutral	i would have gladly paid for usps in order to get my items promptly .
neutral	all helpful until the items were delivered .
neutral	dishwasher was not tested by installing team and proved to be faulty .
neutral	all went downhill from then on , and i had to pay again for my own plumber .
neutral	i am still_waiting for the faulty dishwasher to be collected .
neutral	trying to get in touch by phone is frustrating , so have resorted to e_mail .
neutral	i don_'_t know if i would use this site again due tto the fact that it took so long to get the book i needed i was in my second week of school before it came
neutral	i have not received my 0 orders from you yet so i can not rate you yet .
neutral	because of a difficulty taking large tablets / capsuls contacted the supplier prior to ordering and was assured product was a small capsule easily swallowed .
neutral	on receipt found the tablets were bullet sized and i now have to break open the capsule and take the content powder with water .
neutral	i ordered 0 plants , was supposed to get free_shipping but i was charged for it .
neutral	0 of the plants were supposed to be 0 gallon plants , but 0 of them were almost 0 / 0 the size of the others .
neutral	the roses were weak looking when they arrived .
neutral	i am still hoping they pop back up .
neutral	we will see how they are in another month , but they definitely were not as healthy or as large as what is shown on the website
neutral	after_submitting order realized i needed to change phone_number on engraving .
neutral	called immediately prior to order being_processed and was told the number would be changed .
neutral	it was not - old number is on my order .
neutral	customer_service said i changed it back during the call and that is not true .
neutral	i only changed it once from cell to home number .
neutral	very disappointed and did not have time to send back and have redone - was a birthday_gift for my grandson .
neutral	i ordered on dec . 0th and have not received them yet .
neutral	we purchased the first panel after_speaking with a customer_service agent who clearly was unfamiliar with the product .
neutral	he could not tell us how far the shower_head would protrude from the wall .
neutral	when it arrived we noticed that it was damaged so we returned it and noting that it was not a good size for our shower , we decided to replace our order with the octavia .
neutral	there was no problem whatsoever with the shipping of the return , and we received the octavia in a week or so .
neutral	unfortunately , our contractor had already proceeded to another area and by the time he got back to install the shower , he told us that the bracket enclosed for installation would not fit the shower_panel .
neutral	time had exceeded the limit but the wonderful people in customer_service accepted our return and told us that they would fix the bracket issue .
neutral	once the octavia was again available , we reordered the panel but again it has arrived with the ill - fitting bracket .
neutral	we have decided to have a custom bracket fabricated for us by someone here .
neutral	very disappointed in that aspect of this purchase .
neutral	so , the panel itself , agents a 0_star_rating , the customer_service agent , maryum , gets a 0_star_rating , but quality control ... not much .
neutral	for the price , someone at hudson_reed should know what they are sending out .
neutral	it took 00_minutes to book two rooms ... your customer_service agent was very polite but i don_'_t think it should have taken so much time to book the reservations .
neutral	i have rented a car through_argus many_times .
neutral	but , this tine i went to to the kiosk , a few_minutes walk from the airport terminal , ( with my 0 suitcases land traveling_alone ) .
neutral	as the documentation stated .
neutral	only to be told to go back to the airport to do the paperwork .
neutral	after walking back to the terminal_building , and completing the paperwork i had to return to the kiosk to collect the car .
neutral	this was a total_waste of time and energy .
neutral	no apology was given to the girl doing the paperwork , but then she struggled to understand_english .
neutral	very frustrating on this trip , but usually it is a quick turn_around .
neutral	this is my experience with viator .
neutral	one experience was very good .
neutral	our tour_guide from naples was great .
neutral	*****
neutral	another experience was not bad and we booked the eifel tower dinner and went to see moulin rouge .
neutral	the ugly , was where do i begin ?
neutral	the food was terrible .
neutral	we had the wine_tasting and food experience in umbria , and were left in montepuliciano when our tour_guide had the group find its way back to the drop_off point and we could not find it , since the village was huge and no one we came into contact with for help spoke_english .
neutral	when we got into contact with the local police he could not understand us as well .
neutral	after some time he did find someone to translate and help us get back to rome , which took several hours and a lot of money .
neutral	customer_service dropped the ball on this horrible experience .
neutral	we had left items on the left on the tour bus , and they were not returned to us .
neutral	i was told that we would have to get them and since we were boarding our cruise from rome the next_day we could not fetch them back .
neutral	very dissapointed .
neutral	this was my first order and i loved the fact that they will do price match / beat with the products .
neutral	my only issue was with the shipping .
neutral	it should either be free at_least with an order of a certain_amount or comparable to a company like puritan '_s pride that has a very fair shipping price .
neutral	if they will meet or beat price on the product they should do the same with the shipping .
neutral	although we have visited_london several_times our children had never been .
neutral	they wanted to see all the attractions so we thought a tour would be perfect to fit them all in in a short time .
neutral	the first half of the tour was done with a live commentry , which was good , but lots of it was about where famous people used to live , which to my kids was of no interest .
neutral	after a stop off we rejoined the tour and this bus was recorded commentry after one minute the kids were fed up of listening through earphones so no commentry .
neutral	overall , an ok tour but didn_'_t feel we got value for money .
neutral	wouldn_'_t do it again .
neutral	my first order was beautiful !
neutral	your site was easy to navigate , and was helpful in achieving the look i wanted with my business cards .
neutral	i loved them !
neutral	i decided to change it up for a second card to have a variety of my work on my cards but the second was fine right up to my website where the " m " from my . com was on a second line on its own .
neutral	i was disappointed to get 000 cards that i will never use .
neutral	i will order again in the future because in the end i was very happy with my first set of cards .
neutral	i don_'_t usually hang about waiting for the postman so i '_m not sure if my previous_orders have arrived on time exactly .
neutral	but my latest order is definitely late getting here .
neutral	i will phone and find out what '_s going on if they don_'_t arrive tomorrow .
neutral	otherwise they ' re a good site .
neutral	you absolutely need to add you 000 # to you website , emails , receipt .
neutral	this is the 0st time i had to use a company facebook_page for help w hinging am answer to a product i bought online .
neutral	while it all worked out in the end there was a moment i ws swearing up a storm thinking i hard been ripped_off ...
neutral	difficult to put front panels together as hard to put screws in on an angle .
neutral	the floor is very flimsy and really needs more supports .
neutral	the door_handle was bent and inside was in bits .
neutral	still_awaiting a new one a week_later !
neutral	had to put more supporting screws in some of the window panels .
neutral	once all these problems were sorted , it is a good space filler .
neutral	the hotel was in a great location just off the highway and very accessible .
neutral	the indoor_pool and hot_tub were nice , but they were doing some ceiling construction and things had fallen into the hot_tub and were left .
neutral	the breakfast was good - they had the make your own waffle and other continental_breakfast items .
neutral	the pet fee was a non_refundable $_00 , which seemed very high to me .
neutral	delivery . com has its ups and downs .
neutral	i had deliveries where i got my food correct and delivered right_away .
neutral	there are also times where i waited for 00_mins in the restaurant for an order i placed on line for pick_up because their was miscommunication between the restaurant and the website .
neutral	i like the products , but still_haven_'_t received them , even three_days after the expected devliery date ...
neutral	your website also wouldn_'_t let_me use a discount_code ( which has actually happened every time i try to buy something ), but your items are reasonably_priced so it '_s not the hugest deal .
neutral	veel assortiment .
neutral	fijn om alles in 0 keer te_bestellen .
neutral	ook fijn dat_ik gewoon door kan gaan met sparen van stempels bij la rouche .
neutral	jammer vind_ik wel dat_de verzendkosten redelijk hoog zijn .
neutral	wat maakt dat_ik dan toch de keus maak om bij_de apotheek mijn producten te halen .
neutral	qua prijs maakt het_niet bijzonder veel verschil .
neutral	i was very excited to get my new glasses as this was the first time that i included no - line bifocals .
neutral	it took a rather long time to get them , about 00 days .
neutral	when i received them , i thought they were too wide .
neutral	when i finally got a hold of someone to ask about exchanging them , she said that it would cost me half the price of the lens .
neutral	i was under the assumption that there would be a 00 day free_trial .
neutral	so , i felt that there was a bit of false_advertising there .
neutral	everything else about the experience was great .
neutral	delivery was okay and within time but i ordered rexel thimblettes and got a different make - no what i wanted but not onna bother sending back - too much hassle .
neutral	i have been booking with bookit . com for years .
neutral	i think they should allow more payment installments instead of the two they offer now .
neutral	big chunks of money is stressful to come up with when on a budget .
neutral	i would do more business with them if the installment plan went out to at_least 0 equal payments of the trip .
neutral	i do , however , love the 000 . 00 down payment .
neutral	i was very satisfied with he price of the product that i purchased but would like to see the product arrive in no more than 0 business days as with other online_retailers
neutral	the monthly surprise is okay but duplicating the same items is not .
neutral	please find something_else instead of repeating the same item .
neutral	decent prices - fast shipping but needs to expand product line .
neutral	the sizes were little of , items didn_'_t look like pictures and the shipping was too pricey .
neutral	overall i liked the quality of items , friendly customer_service and prices of items .
neutral	probably will not buy for there soon .
neutral	ordering the product was straightforward and i quickly received an_email_advising that my order had been passed to the delivery company .
neutral	it took several days for the delivery company to contact me so i could book a delivery date .
neutral	like coverage
neutral	ordering was easy an simple and i got a very good deal .
neutral	however , when i received my part , one of the brackets were already broken .
neutral	i didn_'_t want to mess with shipping it back , so my husband just fixed it and moved on .
neutral	it took a long time for my order to be filled .
neutral	i thought since it is shipped fed_ex it would arrive quickly but i didn_'_t get my order until 00 days after_placing the order .
neutral	update_: my initial review of this company was not favorable .
neutral	i want to take the time to say that once they set about addressing the problem i was experiencing , they stuck with it until it was fixed .
neutral	once we got past the initial problems , this company really went_above and beyond to make things right again .
neutral	i found your instruction extremely confusing and tedious to follow .
neutral	i will not order from your company again .
neutral	seemed easy to order but when i wanted to change the order i found it very confusing .
neutral	when i did finally make the change from deluxe to premium , i never did find out if it was done ??
neutral	therefore not easy to work with .
neutral	but the prices seem reasonable and access to site easy .
neutral	my order arrived in a few_days , but when i opened the package , ink had leaked all over the bag .
neutral	i immediately emailed the company and received a reply the next_day .
neutral	they sent me a replacement without_any hassle , but i had to wait several more days for my ink to arrive .
neutral	i understand that problems happen , but i really would have appreciated expedited_shipping of the replacement .
neutral	i found the fountain very easy to install just a shame it does not store the solar power .
neutral	only works if full sunshine otherwise totally useless so would not recommend to others .
neutral	the purchase was a waste of money .
neutral	the translation was really fast but the problem is the presentation of the document .
neutral	i received my documents today ( march_00th ) and these were perfectly translated to spanish but since the company shipped them without a folder i received my papers with lots of wrinkles and bended ( not a good presentation specially because i have to show them to an immigration officer ).
neutral	i was redirected to your site from trivago .
neutral	until this point i had not heard to easytobook .
neutral	despite the name , i would not say this site is easier to make bookings on vs competitors .
neutral	re payment , one section said full payment would be taken at time of booking , another stated payment would be taken at hotel .
neutral	confirmation_email quite standard and thankfully did confirm the info i felt unsure of ; that the room was fully paid for and the cancellation_policy .
neutral	ok experience - nothing special - didn_'_t feel 000_% sure about what i was getting myself into .
neutral	find booking . com a little easier to follow and prefer their confirmation_email style .
neutral	very easy on line but i thought you should have a phone_number if needed
neutral	having had boohoo recommended to me i decided to look online and place an order in time for the party weekend i had planned .
neutral	as_promised the order was delivered within 0 days but sadly only 0 of the 0 parcels arrived .
neutral	after numerous_emails to boohoo , who were quick at replying i must_say , my 0nd missing parcel was finally delivered - nearly 0_weeks_later .
neutral	unfortunatley the shoes i ordered didn_'_t arrive on time , so i was unable to wear them on my night out .
neutral	having had a bad_experience it is highly unlikely that i will never place an order again with boohoo .
neutral	on the positive side the billie dress i ordered looked great and the pink heart onesie is so snug and true to size .
neutral	the delivery was really quick but when the envelopes arrived some of them were slightly marked and creased , just a good job i ordered slightly more than i needed .
neutral	the facility was clean .
neutral	the girls that worked in the office were very helpful and courteous although there is one guy_who arks in the office that is very rude , not very helpful ..
neutral	i love that priceline lets me know which hotels accept pets .
neutral	what i dont love is that they often book the wrong types of rooms and when i check in at the hotel i have to go through a bunch of hoopla to fix it .
neutral	also , when i '_m trying to book an express deal or name my own price , i often cant be assured the hotel will accept pets .
neutral	that sucks .
neutral	i really don_'_t care if i '_m guaranteed breakfast or a pool , but i absolutely need to bring my dog !
neutral	!
neutral	the busses are great to get an_overview of the most_important sightseeing points and to get out at the personal points of interest .
neutral	all in all the tours are not as well_organized as experienced with other tour operators .
neutral	the guides on the red_tour are hard to understand because of the bad audio transmission quality .
neutral	sometimes , especially in the evening , you should plan a lot of time to change routes .
neutral	cordonbleu ist_einfach nur fertigzeugs !
neutral	rigatoni al forno waren ganz ok !
neutral	aber 0 € lieferpauschale für einen weg von nur 0km ist zu unverschämt !
neutral	da gibt_es bessere lieferanten die nix für lieferung nehmen .
neutral	i was able to order books from book_byte easily , and thought that they would be delivered within a week .
neutral	it took my books almost 00 days to get to me and the tracking didn_'_t update for nearly a week .
neutral	the math book was supposed to have a new access_code in it but it was scratched off , so i had to buy a $_000 subscription online instead .
neutral	if i knew this was the case , i wouldn_'_t have purchased the book online .
neutral	i had stayed in a hotel , and posted a review about the hotel stuff who were very helpful , they helped my child who was sick in the night .
neutral	and i '_m calling to hotel 0 times and asking if they read my review but they say no but anyway thanks for your positive opinion .
neutral	i feel damp !
neutral	!
neutral	on my group '_s final day in london they were stuck on the bus nearly three hours and were continually told to stay on the bus as the traffic was clearly .
neutral	there was a parade and the traffic never cleared .
neutral	they had to take the underground back .
neutral	needless to say it was time wasted never to be gotten back and they missed a lot of sights .
neutral	they should have been told to get off and the bus should have never taken that route
neutral	the onesie that arrived was a great product , exactly_what i was after for my sister '_s christmas_present .
neutral	the trouble came with delivery - the fault for which largely came from the delivery company - but i received no communication from boohoo themselves acknowledging a problem .
neutral	having paid for next_day delivery , the product finally arrived a week late - which was after i had left home for the christmas holidays .
neutral	saying this , boohoo did refund the delivery charge , which i am grateful for .
neutral	despite the faff of this situation , i would still use boohoo again .
neutral	i ordered some mobility equipment for my daughter and waited a long time for it to ship .
neutral	every time i would check on it the order was still in the warehouse .
neutral	i got nervous and read the reviews some of which were horrible on the customer_service end .
neutral	i fully expected to never receive my order and have my card charged illegitimately .
neutral	i told them to cancel my order by going through their " wizard ".
neutral	i did threaten a little .
neutral	to my surprise and relief , i did receive a refund in a timely_manner .
neutral	i don_'_t know if planet rx has some issues right now with warehouse or something , but i hope they at_least get some better customer_service and communication with the customer about whether an item is out of stock or on back order .
neutral	i also hope they make it easier to speak with a real_person .
neutral	my best_wishes to planet rx if they are really an honest company with issues .
neutral	i know how hard it can be to run a company , but hopefully they learn from their mistakes and make it better .
neutral	great service & moderately good selection of participating restaurants in my neighborhood .
neutral	i don_'_t like the overall interface when browsing for restaurants ...
neutral	seems cluttered and with unnecessary taps / stages .
neutral	least favorite item is utilizing the occasional promo email ...
neutral	it '_s frustrating to not be able to use the delivery . com app to take_advantage of the code .
neutral	having to order via the actual website ( clicked through via the email link ) is an annoying part of the process .
neutral	what if the email is days old and / or not synced with my mobile_device ?
neutral	would prefer a code to enter at the end of the check - out process that can be used via a browser or within the app .
neutral	you guys are the lowest_price ive seen for colored blend fresh look toric '_s i just hope you guys can keep that company from closing this brand down !
neutral	it appeared to keep changing my order without telling_me why .
neutral	i still don_'_t know what i ended_up ordering because my first order must not have gone_through .
neutral	now i will have to check with my credit_card to see if i ordered the same thing twice ?
neutral	i did not like having to join that visa program at the end , either .
neutral	need to exchange due to cuff snapping
neutral	delivery is not the fastest but they don_'_t promise anything other .
neutral	my only_gripe is that £ 0 is deducted for returns ..
neutral	... but they ' re getting worst and worst with every passing year .
neutral	the latest is that they ' re charging to list products in their " shopping " results which is pretty gross considering .
neutral	plus with their blatant desperate attempts to integrate their crappy social network google + into search_results , it just makes them and their results seems less relevant with every search .
neutral	i think it '_s time for google to sink a la myspace style and make room for the next big thing .
neutral	i ordered my bridesmaid_dress this past thursday , i had some issues with the page after i made my payment , but checked my online statement and it was charged correctly .
neutral	i have sent many e_- mails , tried to call several_times and also try to use the live_chat to ask them for an eta of my dress and i don_'_t get any response , i was getting nervous thinking the website is just a scam but reading these positive_reviews just calm me a little , if / when i receive my dress i ´ ll make another update about quality and eta
neutral	my outfit arrived right on time , but unfortunately it was not what i was expecting at all .
neutral	the little red_riding hood dress was far too short , as the website didnt state the length , so i assumed by the pic it would be mid thigh length , however when tried on it showed everything .
neutral	and the dress also had frayed thread around the waist and a missing tie so it could not be worn properly .
neutral	at_least i was fully refunded as it would of been upsetting if i wasnt
neutral	i had my service to begin on 0 / 0 / 0000 and it is fine i thought it was a little odd how i have already been billed and paid for my service with in the first ( less ) than ten days .
neutral	but my internet fits my needs .... at this time , thank_you for your time .
neutral	hostelworld usually has the most options , but the booking fees add up .
neutral	also , you cannot book a hostel the same day , which can become a hassle .
neutral	i ordered several dresses from boohoo . com , 0 in total i think .
neutral	i have only kept 0 .
neutral	the rest were all so poorly made that even_though they were cheap , they were not worth it .
neutral	0 of the dresses were so seethrough you could even see the small bow on bra through them !
neutral	however the parcel arrived very promptly .
neutral	the returns service was a little odd as there was no paperwork to put in the return parcel .
neutral	but it was free returns .
neutral	well when the product arrived i was horrified because the box was destroyed .
neutral	i was praying the item was ok and luckily it was .
neutral	there was no note from the delivery so i assume it left the company that way .
neutral	this makes me a little_leery of future orders especially from some of the stories i have heard .
neutral	i will try another part that i need and we will see from there how that goes .
neutral	if it '_s a good experience then i can seen me spending a lot of $$$ with you .
neutral	i am being honest .
neutral	must have the good with the bad .
neutral	i ordered a christmas_tree for my mom for tuesday .
neutral	however she didnt get it that day , but the online tracking status said it was delivered to her .
neutral	i emailed customer_service right_away that night , asking where they delivered it .
neutral	no answer .
neutral	next_morning , it was put in front of my moms house door ....
neutral	the product was fine but it took nearly a week to arrive , even_though i was paying for delivery .
neutral	i '_ve ordered things on ebay before ( with free delivery ) and they '_ve arrived within 0 days so i '_m not sure why it took so long .
neutral	this will definiately make me wary about using them again ....
neutral	i always refer to tripadvisor for travel and places to stay , so find it invaluable when visiting a new area or country .
neutral	however , some of the comments appear to be deliberately constructed to damage the reputation of the business concerned , and should be believed with caution .
neutral	0 bedrooms 0 bath , utilities ,
neutral	i bought a part that was under_$ 0 but with shipping the part was over $_00 .
neutral	i couldn_'_t find the part anywhere_else so i bought it .
neutral	the meds were fine when they got here but i do not understand_why it took so long .
neutral	cant seem to find how to contact you i would like to know where my order is
neutral	0 .
neutral	continual_problems with my account falling mysteriously out of the auto - program which required me to make calls to customer_service .

neutral	continual_problems with auto - ship_program not obtaining authorization from vet for prescription food in a timely_fashion that required me having to drive to the vet myself to get food because food did not arrive on time .
neutral	0 .
neutral	never once , with all of these continual_problems , have i ever been offered credit for a full purchase to compensate me for my time , effort and aggravation .
neutral	only compensation ever provided was credit on shipping_charges .
neutral	this is simply insufficient compensation .
neutral	i like this website always get books and other stuff i need ... always can trust it ...
neutral	service at my end excellent .
neutral	in bristol parcel brought to door , signed for and in one piece .
neutral	next_day two parcels then collected excellent .
neutral	to be delivered to same address .
neutral	recipient telephoned told parcels delivered .
neutral	did not ask for a signatureot .
neutral	left in doorway blocking entrance to apartment complex .
neutral	boxes damaged .
neutral	crumpled and with a hole in the side .
neutral	recipient had to carry boxes upstairs herself .
neutral	so not door to door and damaged boxes .
neutral	" my experience was ok .
neutral	the time it took for me to receive my repaired frames took much longer_than advertised .
neutral	i sent in my order via overnight mail on oct . 00th and didn_'_t receive the finished_product until the week of nov . 0th !
neutral	one pair of my repaired frames were done very nicely but the second pair came back with a very loose repaired arm but i '_m hesitant to return them because i don_'_t want to wait the length of time i had to wait to get them back .
neutral	very dissapointing especially because of the turnaround time taking much longer_than i thought it would .
neutral	i will say that i did speak with a customer_service rep and that experience was pleasant / professional ."
neutral	i have used your site on many occasions under ' cheap_smells ' with no_issues .
neutral	after paying £_000 nearly 0_weeks_ago i am still_waiting to receive my order with no updates other than to say my parcel had been dispatched 0 days after_placing the order .
neutral	i have ordered many items from other_sites since i placed the order with yourselves , some from overseas which have all arrived .
neutral	very disappointed and reluctant to use you again .
neutral	there was a long line at the counter and only one person working .
neutral	had to wait almost an_hour before i was attended .
neutral	i was automatically charged a full_tank of gas and told to return the car empty .
neutral	i wish i was given the option instead , i would have chosen to return the car full and save_money on the fuel .
neutral	prices outside were cheaper_than price auto_europe charged .
neutral	once all paperwork was done i had to wait another hour for the car to be ready , it was still being washed and prepared .
neutral	i had reserved a car for 0am but only received the car aftr 0am .
neutral	the return was fast and easy , glad to catch my flight on time .
neutral	the car itself was amazing , had a renault megane .
neutral	great car .
neutral	very happy with the blinds in terms of colour and mechanics but i was very careful to follow the guidelines for measuring to the letter to ensure the correct fit .
neutral	of the 0 blinds we ordered only one was a perfect fit - all the others needed to be packed at the fixings - thank_goodness my husband is handy otherwise we would have been stuck .
neutral	i really cannot_comment as yet - because i only ordered at the weekend for the flowers to be delivered on the 00th and so i wait to hear what the recipient feels about them .
neutral	as far as ordering it was nice and easy .
neutral	as far as giving a true rating , as i mentioned it depends on how the recipient feels about them before i can give a true rating .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	greetings .
neutral	we received a large box with 0 clematis plants in it , one packed on each end , with no notation on the box as to which end was up .
neutral	by the time we received it , although there was plastic wrapped around the pot to prevent spillage , all of the contents of one plant / pot ( which was upside_down when it arrived and was left on our porch ) had emptied on top of the other plant at the bottom , so the top plant was just hanging there with bare roots .
neutral	if you could ship in a smaller box , with plants side by side , and an indication as to which end is up , that would be helpful .
neutral	the plants are great and are doing well -- thankfully , we found the box just before leaving for a trip -- the top / upside_down plant likely would have been dead before we returned .
neutral	i was lured in by the great deals on products they offered then i ordered the limit of 0 they allowed .
neutral	i then got an e_mail indicating they were out of the items .
neutral	i would not have ordered the other items if it weren_'_t for the specials .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	i '_m not sure if it '_s a postal issue or a packing issue or both , but my package arrived completely destroyed and open .
neutral	i don_'_t think that the box was sealed properly prior to delivery , nor was it weighted correctly in order to avoid issues en_route ( filler paper was at the bottom of the box , and the food was at the top by the box opening ).
neutral	i may order again , but would be worried_about ordering loose items that could fall out .
neutral	after checking my order found to have an item missing , a do suit cable which was sent next_day .
neutral	my electrician cam to with the thermostat and on checking found that the heating mat was 000watt instead of 000 ., so not a good impression although thing were delivered and replaced the next_day .
neutral	fast delivery lots of choice but refund very slow
neutral	website is very easy to use and gives very detailed_information and instructions on products which helps you make an informed purchasing decision .
neutral	however , i was not very impressed with the return customer_service as i had to go through web chat , emails , and eventually phone_calls to replace a part that was defective , and after a 0 week delay they could not rush shipment due to being in the middle of " inventory " and did not offer any credit other than " we understand your frustration ."
neutral	easytobook is truely easy to book .
neutral	the side offers a good range of accomodations of all categories , search is very easy and you will quickly find what you are looking for .
neutral	unfortunately prices on the homepage differ from what you actually have to pay and you see the actual costs just before you complete the payment .
neutral	also customer_service is kind of complicated .
neutral	when you are not in uk / us phone_number is quite expensive , though you can reach easytobook via_email that takes some time .
neutral	around 0 days after i ' d posted the review below , the website had a new and somewhat interesting feature implemented .
neutral	it is called a " waitlist "!
neutral	a 0000 version of the old " wishlist " ( which still exists but services very little purpose ).
neutral	unlike the " wishlist ", the " waitlist " allows forever00 . com '_s users to select an option called " i still want it " on items that have run_out of stock .
neutral	it '_s still not as great as it sounds tho ', the option is available to only a very limited amount of items and is yet to be available for the majority of the items on the site ( and we don_'_t even know how many items will have the feature in the future , but here '_s hoping it will be available for the majority of the website '_s items ), more_importantly we have yet to see it in action as it has only been implemented for a few_days now .
neutral	i had actually never thought that forever 00 '_s employees read the reviews posted online , there are quite a few nasty ones about their customer_service , employees , return_policy and items .
neutral	as a result , i ' d written reviews out of sheer frustration and didn_'_t expect to be taken seriously .
neutral	after this , i '_m not sure that forever 00 is as horrible as the poor depictions of it on the internet .
neutral	i mean , when you make a major adjustment to your policy within 00_hours of a complaint , you are doing your job right ( although this adjustment is yet to endure the test of time and well , it '_s not as largely implemented as i ' d_hoped ,).
neutral	old review :
neutral	it '_s " okay ", not great ( but could be !)
neutral	the site itself is great and no , i have never had a bad_experience shopping there , however , i do have some comments regarding the items that are sold on the site .
neutral	like any other site , it '_s got items that are great and ones that are ... well , not so great .
neutral	naturally , the " great " items run_out of stock quickly , and are unfortunately rarely restocked , sizes small and medium run_out extremely rapidly and although the items receive great reviews and are frequently requested to be put back on the site , they ' re hardly ever back .
neutral	the site itself doesn_'_t display any info regarding forever00 '_s re - socking policy and when you email the employees , they respond saying that they don_'_t know if the items that are out of stock will ever be restocked .
neutral	the us store underwent a " makeover " recently , it no_longer has a " back in stock " category , almost as if they never intend to restock anything ever again .
neutral	this is extremely disappointing to me as a customer , i am a student so naturally i am incapable of purchasing everything i want right_away as i have to save_money for a period of time in order to afford shopping .
neutral	the fact that they are putting this out there in a way that makes it seem almost as if they are saying " boohoo .. you didn_'_t have the money to buy that jacket back then ?
neutral	guess what ?
neutral	it '_s gone now !
neutral	better try your luck with our physical stores .
neutral	oh and by the way , we know you '_ve tried that before and it didn_'_t work out but still , it '_s the cliche we ' re going to stick to !"
neutral	is just terrible .
neutral	i don_'_t think it '_s a bad marketing strategy to restock items that ran_out quickly , sold a significant number of units and are top_rated / frequently praised , so i can '_t think of any reason_why the site won_'_t put back the " great " stuff instead of putting " not so great new stuff " each and every day , it just hurts ... it really does .
neutral	i get that having more items will_definitely increase the site '_s generated revenue , but not all items are favorable .
neutral	plus , more money and customer_satisfaction can be garnered by gaining customers ' approval through good quality items , rather_than just " new " ones which may or may not be good .
neutral	it just makes it super easy for people with money to get the good stuff and for the not so fortunate to wear the " not so good " stuff ( if they ' re lucky they '_ll manage to get the stuff they want a size larger than their own before that one runs out of stock too !
neutral	), which wasn_'_t the purpose behind creating the brand in the 0st place ...
neutral	it '_s supposed to be affordable fashion for all .
neutral	i used to love yelp , but somehow i can '_t trust their reviews anymore .
neutral	plus , it '_s like the netflix recommendations -- after awhile , everything gets watered_down to 0_stars and its impossible to find any standout places to eat .
neutral	i will_continue to use them i guess .
neutral	the drawings for the invertor instructions were too small and caused some_confusion .
neutral	the quality of fit for key components of the invertor frame were also poor .
neutral	the final assembled item is now sturdy , although slightly out of alignment .
neutral	the vibrodisc was much_easier to assemble .
neutral	the vibrodisc plate is excellent , although the base and stand casing are of low quality plastic and the base split upon first use ( i am no where near the weight_limit ).
neutral	about to return this for a replacement ...
neutral	if you require top quality flowers then this is the company to puchsse them from .
neutral	excellent service and i always use tgem
neutral	the company we have been buying our air_filters from for several_years is no_longer selling residential .
neutral	they referred me to airfiltersdelivered and told me to order the merv filters in the needed sizes .
neutral	i went online , ordered and paid and had the filters within 0 days .
neutral	half of the order was great .
neutral	the small filters arrived with no_problems .
neutral	but the larger filters were not only the wrong_size , there were only half of what i ordered .
neutral	so i emailed the company and they immediately shipped out the correct filters , ( i think ).
neutral	that was yesterday .
neutral	so they are very prompt in responding but they made a mistake on our first encounter .
neutral	not a terrible thing but , well , you asked for a review .
neutral	the price is better that where we used to order and we do not have to drive 00_miles one way to get them .
neutral	found product cheaper elsewhere but ordered with bluefin as_promised same day dispatch - ordered monday_night so expected product weds but arrived thursday - no emails were relieved asto order status either so was anxious as required them urgently
neutral	product was well_wrapped and as_advertised
neutral	ordered antlers which we liked but , for the price they was very small .
neutral	compared to the other company we order them where their cheaper and larger .
neutral	otherwise we got them when stated and packaged well .
neutral	we may order from them again depending_on the sales .
neutral	you should help people more when their vouch ours don_'_t work or are running_out , i have missed several deals and lost money because of this .
neutral	other than that it does save_money if you pick the right deals .
neutral	good service and usually quite punctual .
neutral	the price and selection is the best around .
neutral	however , it took weeks before my paypal transaction was accepted , and a couple of emails .
neutral	so it is well_worth it , but be very patient .
neutral	i was really looking_forward to getting some new dresses for after id had my baby so i ordered some maxi - dresses in size 0 , i was already 0months pregnant when they arrived and i tried them on and they were huge !!
neutral	even with my belly .
neutral	so im pretty sure when im up and about following having my daughter that they are going to swamp me :'( and im sure boohoo must think we all have at_least dd size bust !
neutral	!...... unfortunately i do not .
neutral	when making our reservations we were asked if we wanted a patio room ( a room with a pool view ) no cost was mentioned , i said that would be great .
neutral	when we arrived expecting 0 rooms with pool views , we were told that our reservation didn_'_t mention it and it would be an_additional_$_00 for each room .
neutral	we declined .
neutral	the hotel was fabulous but we were disappointed .
neutral	poor customer_service also cost if returning items won_'_t use again will stick to debenhams
neutral	it was very inexpensive but now it is to high .
neutral	00 days from placing order to delivery
neutral	having left my mobile number and landline with sport and leisure and the delivery company i am disappointed that the couriers have been twice to my house without contacting me to say they are on their way .
neutral	i have been assured that they will call me next time .
neutral	also i ordered and paid for a table_tennis table which was out of stock .
neutral	my money is being refunded i have been advised ( although no confirmation of this has_been sent to me ) but we will have to reorder and possibly repeat the above exercise over again .
neutral	this has_been a huge disappointment to the kids .
neutral	the prices were however competitive and i am sure the items are worth the wait .
neutral	the mirror we purchased had two dings in it
neutral	didn_'_t receive my order till about a month after .
neutral	first order apparently as per customer_service email was sent somewhere_else and couldn_'_t send me another until certain date which i had to provide alternate address and a week_later i received them .
neutral	other than the delay order was fine .
neutral	going to place a different order and see how it goes .
neutral	i was happy with the price and the fact that the drivers were prompt in picking_up and returning the car but i thought it was completely_unacceptable that the car came back covered in dirt and brick dust .
neutral	when i questioned why it was so dirty after we had left it very clean the driver told us that it was because it was left next to a building site .
neutral	at no point was this explained .
neutral	there was no apology merely a shrug of the shoulders .
neutral	a quick rinse down before the car was returned would be the least they could do .
neutral	who_knows why underlying damage could be caused including scratching - we will find out once it had been cleaned .
neutral	i thought the skin i was buying would cover pretty_much all of my samsung_galaxy but when it came it covers the front around the screen well but just the middle of the back .
neutral	it looks a bit daft seeing the colour of my phone around the skin .
neutral	it would have been nicer to cover the sides too .
neutral	maybe i just didn_'_t look into it enough before i purchased it ...
neutral	i ordered a chandelier that i wasn_'_t satisfied with with .
neutral	after some convincing and me paying for shipping there and back i was able to return the chandelier for a refund .
neutral	i am glad that light in the box agreed to let_me return the item , for that i thank them .
neutral	they do have nice stuff on their website but it '_s difficult to purchase something like a chandelier without being_able to see it first .
neutral	i love the variety of styles i find on yesstyle that i can not find elsewhere .
neutral	however , many of their items are overpriced for the quality .
neutral	i typically wait til i find a decent sale before buying anything .
neutral	if everything were priced 00_% less_than their current pricing , they would greatly increase their revenue .
neutral	first experience , swim_suit got sent to nj instead of nh , took an_additional several weeks to receive .
neutral	price was right so we did purchase 0 more suits and a pair of goggles .
neutral	just received this purchase and goggles were wrong color .
neutral	they were shown on the website incorrectly .
neutral	we unfortunately need to mail back the current ones , and wait_until the return is processed .
neutral	this is not the customer_service i would have expected .
neutral	i would have expected them to ship the correct goggles right out , given the error is theirs ( wrong color posted on website ).
neutral	has a variety of styles that i can '_t get at the stores here .
neutral	i am unsure how good is the material but we will see when i get them
neutral	i ordered my contacts on - line with a guaranteed ship date of december 00 or 00rd .
neutral	however , it is the 00th and my contacts have yet to arrive .
neutral	when i check with usps under the tracking_number provided , i get a statement saying it was " processed through sort facility " in chicago on the 00st .
neutral	so they '_ve been sitting since the 00st with no further detail .
neutral	may i suggest a different courier once you get to the us ?
neutral	obviously our usps has not cared to continue the process of my merchandise .
neutral	i sent a parcel on a wednesday by collect_+ to a moderately remote part of scotland .
neutral	this was the only carrier offered by interparcel on this occasion .
neutral	when i booked , i was reminded of the remote location , and as a consequence was informed the parcel wouldn_'_t be delivered until the monday .
neutral	it didn_'_t actually arrive until tuesday , despite tracking showing that it had arrived at the nearest depot on the friday_morning .
neutral	the tracking_info given used an abbreviation which made no sense , and so i had no way of finding out what was going on .
neutral	this caused some problems and anxiety for both me and the recipient .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t trust delivery dates given for collect_+ in the future , and probably_wouldn_'_t use that service again .
neutral	a helpful service , but i think the website is overly complicated .
neutral	had i not known what i was doing , having had lots of printing experience , i ' d have been stumped and completely confused !
neutral	it was much_easier just to telephone the nearest branch and talk to someone .
neutral	upon_receipt of our design work , staff were quick with advice and the order arrived much_quicker_than we ' d anticipated .
neutral	petbest has a nice selection of healthy pet_foods and i appreciate the discount for the auto - ship option , but there are couple things i would improve :
neutral	0 ) give buyer more payment_options , right now you can only pay with credit_card , they should also accept debit as well as paypal .
neutral	0 ) search_engine is a bit funky , when i search for a product , i go back and forth to compare the brand .
neutral	instead of going to a previous page , it jumps back to all brands again , which_means i have to start doing the narrow_down process all over again , which takes up significant time .
neutral	i ordered part a 000 000 00 00 - an emblem for the hook of c000 mercedes .
neutral	i did not realize i needed to order a separate part ( two plastic nuts ) in order to attach the emblem to car .
neutral	does this require a separate shipping fee ( approx $_00 )?
neutral	product shipped quickly but i am still unable to use as i cannot attach it .
neutral	ordered a new_washing_machine . i paid_extra £_00 for same day delivery . delivery was up to 00_pm came a little later for me about 00 . 00pm they were verry nice men and took all packaging away for us good service apart_from the late delivery x
neutral	i ordered two gift_certificates for my son '_s birthday on a thursday .
neutral	by friday i had not received anything to allow me to print out the certificates , though i did receive notice that the purchase had been made and the money was taken from both paypal and my bank_account .
neutral	i called customer_service and the person i spoke with looked into it and said that their system must have been thrown off by my using paypal .
neutral	she said she ' d follow_up on it .
neutral	later that day i still had not received it , so i wrote to customer_service .
neutral	i finally received an explanation 0 days_later , and 0 days after my son '_s birthday , though i did not hear back from them during that entire time .
neutral	the note included an_apology , but not an acknowledgement that their internal issue caused me to not have a gift to give my son on his_birthday .
neutral	not the end of the world , but for me it was a disappointment i thought should be recognized .
neutral	i believe a part of the delay is due to the fact that their customer_service is only available during " bankers hours ".
neutral	that '_s pretty unusual in 0000 and would stop me from trying to juggle anything even relatively time sensitive from this company .
neutral	i can get almost anything i need in 00_hours from amazon . com , so my expectations are way more aggressive than 0 days for a gift_certificate .
neutral	so at the end of the day , i ordered a gift for my son which i wanted to give him on his_birthday .
neutral	i ended_up giving it to him three_days_later and five days after my order .
neutral	what '_s most noteworthy to me is that this wasn_'_t a shipping problem .
neutral	i hadn_'_t pushed it to the limit by trying to juggle express shipping .
neutral	i just wanted to have a couple gift_certificates , which should be a relatively simple transaction in this day and age .
neutral	i was frustrated enough to ask for a refund , but my son said he ' d_rather just have the late codes .
neutral	all that said , i do think they have some very interesting and unique products .
neutral	perhaps they are just getting started and simply need some process improvements .
neutral	ordered bully_sticks , regular and braided .
neutral	great price .
neutral	my dog usually loves them - jumps 0 feet in air for them ... until now .
neutral	does not like these from petflow .
neutral	she tried them , and left them on the ground .
neutral	usually can '_t even find them after a day .
neutral	i was so hopeful , and was so disappointed .
neutral	shipping was great .
neutral	ordering was fine .
neutral	bully_sticks - not quite .
neutral	goods were in stock but it took 0 phone_calls before it was posted . i think the order had gone astray because the third call produced it out for delivery in 0hrs .
neutral	i had one problem after another with my chairs .
neutral	i kept getting the run_around and talked to several different people i was offered 00_% back to fix the errors and after pushing i was only refunded 00_%.
neutral	i sent the guy that offered 00_% an_email with no response .
neutral	my chairs don_'_t match and the openings for the dryers were too small .
neutral	they will never receive my business again .
neutral	update ..... after my review they did their best to resolve the issue .
neutral	in terms of workmanship and friendliness i was pleased .
neutral	unfortunately , i was so turned off when one of the male staff_members approached the front_desk scratching his " package ".
neutral	i was disgusted .
neutral	i purchased 0 customized t - shirts & 0 out of 0 torn already after washing them .
neutral	i would have used 0_stars if delivery had not taken so long .
neutral	i bought two gift_cards on 0 / 00 / 00 and the order was not processed until 0 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	shipping took an_additional 0 days .
neutral	00 days for delivery of a gift_card is not acceptable .
neutral	i have used freightpros twice and on both occassions i had to follow_up .
neutral	first time , why the product did not deliver yet , and on the 0nd , why something was not picked_up when advised that it would .
neutral	i work in customer_service as well and we strive on keeping our customer '_s updated rather_than our customer '_s advising us to what is going on .
neutral	i recommend you always follow through to make_sure things are getting picked_up when they are suppose to and keep_track of the delivery of the orders so you can make your customer '_s aware that things are not going as estimated .
neutral	i think you should always confirm the deliveries and even give your customer '_s good news that things are going as planned .
neutral	i will_continue to use freightpros and see how things go but if constant follow_up continues , unfortunately , i will having to seek another party .
neutral	my name is not spelled correctly .
neutral	it is schulze - not .
neutral	chulve .
neutral	i pprinted out the reservation and immediately called to make the correction .
neutral	i hope this has_been done .
neutral	i received a call from my credit_card company notifying_me that someone was trying to use my card .
neutral	i said it was an_error and that i was aware . of the misspelling of my name .
neutral	i called to correct the error , but i am not sure if this was done .
neutral	i would appreciate knowing if the misspelling has_been corrected .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	i was looking for a driver_side_mirror for my ford_focus .
neutral	the price is cheaper_than the ford dealer .
neutral	while shopping online for the mirror , get the best price that you can_afford .
neutral	on selfstorage . com , i found a very affordable available storage_unit near where i currently live .
neutral	however , the website said that that location offered free truck use , if you call in advance to reserve it .
neutral	after i made my reservation with the storage_facility , they said they do not offer free truck use .
neutral	they only have penske trucks available to pay to rent .
neutral	i was very disappointed by the website '_s misleading information , and now i have to find a place to rent a van or truck cheaply .
neutral	i love the deals they are amazing !!
neutral	but i paid for 0 day shipping and it still look a week or longer to get .
neutral	i am getting extremely frustrated with the inability to purchase tan - jay and alia products in the stores in my area in plus sizes .
neutral	both oshawa and pickering stores no_longer carry that range and the nearest_store i have found is 00 kms away in cobourg , on .
neutral	that is very inconvenient to have to travel that distance each time i want to visit one of your stores .
neutral	i called the head_office of nygard about 0_weeks_ago and spoke to someone in customer_service whose attitude was less_than helpful .
neutral	this person reckoned it was up to each store to order their own stock which i find is untrue after talking to staff in the stores .
neutral	she also didn_'_t appear to give a damn ...........
neutral	i have not yet received my product so , i can '_t let you know if it showed_up in a good condition or not or if it was to my liking .
neutral	the finish around the buttons on this ( my third ) shirt could have been better
neutral	the site itself is fine and the length of time needed to make a purchase is fine and bearable .
neutral	however , the product details need to be clearer so that people know exactly_what they are buying .
neutral	for example , i thought i was buying a kindle cover although i ended_up buying a stick on skin for my kindle and when i checked online there was no sign or information where it told me that the product that i could purchase was a stick on skin and i only found out when it arrived at my home .
neutral	tour was good but we are a family of 0 and struggled to get a seat ( never mind sit together ) on most buses .
neutral	most of the tour buses looked the same think they all must over subscribe .
neutral	we spent a lot of money on a 00 hour tour and lucky if we got an_hour on the bus in total it was so bus .
neutral	to be honest traffic was that bad it would probably have been quicker walking .
neutral	i have been very pleased with the service .
neutral	their website is easy to use and easy to make_changes to .
neutral	the pet_food has come on time and in good condition .
neutral	i am happy with the free_shipping that i get .
neutral	but they sell product made in china .
neutral	i am considering not using them because i don_'_t want to accidentally purchase something made in china from them .
neutral	lilly the cat loves evo 00 duck food .
neutral	however , we thought we were buy the large 00oz can and were disappointed that they were the small 0oz cans .
neutral	the ad - i am sure - indicated the larger_size , which is all i ever buy .
neutral	so , yes , i was glad the order arrived , but i was disappointed in the size of the tins and ultimately , the price of the tins .
neutral	i found the larger tins at my local , flower shop / seed shop / pet shop selling the larger 00 oz tins for $ 0 . 00 each !
neutral	hard to beat those prices .
neutral	delivery was prompt .
neutral	that '_s about all i can say .
neutral	the staff was very nice .
neutral	i made my reservation and unfortunately , put in the wrong dates .
neutral	when i requested a change to modify ; not cancel , my reservation , i was charged for a full night '_s stay plus additional_fees .
neutral	in hindsight , it would have been cheaper for me to reserve the room from the hotel_directly ; at_least the hotel does not charge a modification fee as expensive as bookit .
neutral	most hotel '_s do not charge a fee at all to modify a stay .
neutral	this was a lesson_learned for me .
neutral	bookit '_s prices may be competitive , but cheap rates come with a price .
neutral	you are locked into a contract that costs heavily to modify or cancel .
neutral	i understand the necessity to charge a fee for a cancellation , but for a modification , charging a fee seems a bit stringent .
neutral	even if a fee is charged , a full night '_s stay plus additional_fees come_across as being punitive .
neutral	in other words , with bookit , you better not make a mistake when booking , or have a family emergency and need to change your plans , because you will have to pay ( heavily ) to modify the reservation .
neutral	if i '_m asked for a review , i don_'_t have a problem answering_questions but i would like to be able to offer a comment , sadly there is no opportunity to do so
neutral	the predesigned selection is pretty good and i appreciated that the website made the fee schedule for its cards easy to find .
neutral	i had checked the coupon websites and found a " free greeting_card " coupon_code , which i planned to use as these were intended as gifts .
neutral	however , none of the coupon_codes worked , even_though i was attempting to use them long before the listed expiration_date .
neutral	also , i ordered five cards which were shipped to the same address .
neutral	the shipping initially came up as $ 0 . 00 which made sense to me because they were all being shipped to the same address , but when i went to check out it had jumped to $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i understand that they charged me two bucks per card to ship them , but i wish they had told me that the charge was per card instead of just showing $ 0 . 00 and then hitting me with $_00 when i checked out .
neutral	i thought i would try the 0oz .
neutral	portions this time and was disappointed .
neutral	three of the pieces were ok , but the others were too small and end pieces .
neutral	while the meat of the fish is delicious , i will not order this size again .
neutral	i also tried the organic almonds .
neutral	they ' re ok , just overpriced .
neutral	after we return the wrong part and get the refund , please re - send the survey , if you wish .
neutral	so_far , the phone service was unsatisfactory as we could speak to no one .
neutral	the email process to gather info did not happen in 00hrs as stated ; it took a week !
neutral	on - line , we were unable to choose a correct_part for my wagon ... therefore we were could only order the wrong part ( for a sedan )..... further complicating the process .... which still goes on ..... as we will return the wrong part tomorrow .
neutral	received ok quickly , but 0 lights are not working in the pack .
neutral	some real nice clothes for plus size women but it takes to long to process , ship and receive the order .
neutral	good service , nothing special ... average .
neutral	the transcription was okay , but the formatting was wrong - it should have been in standard manuscript format ( 00pt type , 0 inch margin , double spaced ) with returns after the dialogue .
neutral	instead it was transcribed as one long file .
neutral	a veces los recorridos no están muy claros en_el plano .
neutral	uno de_los días el bus no terminó su recorrido completo , nos dejó en hyde_park y tuvimos que continuar a pie hasta nuestro destino .
neutral	el paseo en barco por el río no siempre es en_el barco anunciado , nos tocó uno cerrado prácticamente entero y no pudimos ver casi nada , tan sólo por las ventanas , el que anunciaban tenía todo el segundo piso descubierto como el bus .
neutral	por_lo demás bien , buena experiencia la de ir viendo la ciudad al aire libre .
neutral	i feel that your website experience is great and easy to use , i also get a lot of helpful emails_letting_me know when there are specials so i don_'_t even mind the barrage of emails sent to me .
neutral	i view all that as positive .
neutral	i had an unpleasant experience when i actually had to call and talk to a customer_service representative .
neutral	( didn_'_t have my computer at the time ) i prepared myself for the long wait , that wasn_'_t the issue .
neutral	the issue is that after the long long long wait , the customer_service rep quickly dismissed me without helping , told me curtly i had the wrong department and without so much as a thank_you transferred me ...
neutral	i then sat and waited and waited and waited and finally hung_up and decided not to buy my tickets that night but to risk the tickets being sold out and do so from my computer the next_day .
neutral	i ordered 0 collars with led_lights , a blue one for my male dog and a pink one for my female dog .
neutral	they are not made the same collars .
neutral	it is very difficult to adjust the size to fit their necks .
neutral	on the pink collar , the place to hook to the leash is in the middle of the collar , on the back side .
neutral	if i were to hook a leash there , it would choke my poor dog .
neutral	the lights seem to work well , which is why i ordered them .
neutral	i will have to use them along with their regular collars when i '_m walking them at night , which will not be comfortable for my babies .
neutral	my one size fits all medium pant was incredibly tight on me , but everything came timely and well_packaged .
neutral	my nephew and his fiancee will be in london just after christmas .
neutral	so i decided to buy them a big_bus_tour for their christmas_present .
neutral	this proved to be painful .
neutral	apparently you need to show the credit_card that purchased the tickets before being guaranteed entry onto the bus .
neutral	so i had to send an_email to big_bus_tours letting them know my nephew '_s details and that it was ok to let him on the bus , instead of me !
neutral	and he has to take a copy of the email with him as well as the on - line ticket .
neutral	what ?
neutral	i find this a ridiculous rigmarole .
neutral	i have purchased full day tours for other people before and none of this was required .
neutral	the big_bus_tour was recommended - so hopefully their experience will make up for the initial difficulties .
neutral	i hesitate to give a completely positive review until i '_ve actually taken the trip that i purchased .
neutral	the site was easy to use and there were a lot of options to choose from , so that was a positive .
neutral	le_produit que_j ' ai voulu échanger était disponible quand j ' ai fait ma demande de retour sur_le site , mais plus disponible le temps que mon colis arrive ... donc je_n ' ai_pas pu faire mon échange comme prévu .
neutral	i wanted to call to change the address on my order , i got through that evening to be told to call in the morning .
neutral	i did this and was waiting for 00mins then midday 00mins and close to the end of the working day 00mins again .
neutral	i hang up in all three attempts .
neutral	i paid for a next_day delivery only to have no option but to delay my order for when someone will be next available .
neutral	took an extra day to get dog_food .
neutral	not a big deal but not what i expected .
neutral	couldn_'_t drag big box into the house -- too heavy .
neutral	this may not work for me .
neutral	buying at store i can back car into garage and drag bag into house .
neutral	while i understand you must verify the purchase is valid , it was an incredible pain ...
neutral	i was ordering them for someone at work using their credit_card .
neutral	i understand_why it must be verified but it seemed to be cumbersome .
neutral	however , he thought the experience worked well .
neutral	while i was placing the orders , i ended_up having to put the order in multiple_times because it wouldn_'_t save the order while the purchase was being verified through his credit_card .
neutral	i ended_up ordering 00 gift_cards and had to put each of them in multiple_times .
neutral	i love wowcher , i think its a great service and i '_ve ordered several things from them .
neutral	however sometimes i see a good deal but by . the time you add postage on , its not such a heat deal .
neutral	however , its still worth looking if you need something .
neutral	site was easy and fast , but haven_'_t received them yet !
neutral	it '_s been a week , so when should i receive them ?
neutral	?
neutral	representative was great .
neutral	however i found that when i went directly on websites myself rates were cheaper .
neutral	i checked with hotels after that and found the room i asked for at the hotel was two double_beds .
neutral	he assured_me thats what it was .
neutral	when i spoke directly to hotel they showed 0 king with a pull out sofa .
neutral	u did not offer aaa_discount .
neutral	hotel does making the rooms 00 dollars_cheaper .
neutral	now im not saying inventory doesnt cross as reservations are being made however the cheaper rates dont change .
neutral	he did go out of his way to check every hotel i asked him to and he did with much courtesy .
neutral	wish i had paid more attention not noticing this was a third_party reservation center .
neutral	like directly to deal with hotel .
neutral	hätte mehr erwarte und_die paprika war definitiv nicht frisch !
neutral	sonst ok
neutral	i love being_able to get gift_cards online that are personalized ; however , i did try it in the past and the birthday card that was sent arrived well past the said shipment date and was late for my niece '_s birthday .
neutral	and in addition it did not arrive with any personalized picture on it .
neutral	all it had was her name and a white background .
neutral	i am giving this another try .
neutral	if my order is different from what i have selected , i will go back to buying gift_cards at drugstores and mail them standard shipping for about fifty cents and 0 - 0 days shipment guaranteed .
neutral	i have my fingers_crossed that this will work this time and i '_ve said an extra special prayers .
neutral	i have spent_hundreds of dollars on this site and this time i and looking for better satisfaction .
neutral	they did send me an_email to tell me the site was working but it was still an inconvenience .
neutral	the website is a little_confusing and it was tough to get an answer on the phone
neutral	i liked the ease of purchasing the gift_card but on one page in the process it indicated that shipping would be free with the choice i made .
neutral	then on the final page there was no free option .
neutral	perhaps i missed something but this should never happen .
neutral	it is false_advertising .
neutral	although the original quote was competitive , on pickup there were many additional_fees tagged onto the price .
neutral	also , after i returned the vehicle there continued to be additional costs deducted from my credit_card with no_explanation - not even an_email .
neutral	what i ordered was great ..... as far as the quality goes .
neutral	the only problem is that i can not even wear them .
neutral	if a small is what you normally_wear then you need to go with a medium or they are not going to fit .
neutral	its not even worth me sending them back for a bigger_size because i am not sure how they would even fit .
neutral	i have no_complaints about the service or the product .
neutral	what i am disappointed with is the multiple_emails and messages coming in , and together with the packaging , they are not discreet .
neutral	paid_extra for before 00noon delivery of my goods and mentioned i would only be out for 00mins for school run and missed the delivery by 0 mins therefore i had my plumber waiting around all day for the goods they finally arrived by 00 . 00 after making several phone_calls chasing & begging for them to come_back .
neutral	i wrote an_email that day to tilesdirect explaining and have not even had a reply !
neutral	:-(((
neutral	had my money and now feel they have no after service customer care ........
neutral	this is tnt '_s fault and not tilefix but they subcontract the delivery to them so there must be claw back to help the customer especially when extra is paid for guaranteed delivery times
neutral	the products i ordered are all good and now installed .
neutral	would not use again , no where do i recall reading or seeing there was a fee for sending the card .
neutral	cropped bottom losing peoples feet etc when there was plenty of space to crop topquality re colour etc good .
neutral	i liked the look of my product a lot , i was very excited to get it .
neutral	i needed it quite quickly so i got the next_day delivery which was quick and arrived on time but it cost far too much .
neutral	when my costume arrived the sizing was accurate and fit well but the material was quite cheap and ripped easily so that wasn_'_t great .
neutral	overall it was ok .
neutral	received my order fast but when opened the package it was a damaged bag that had been taped up .
neutral	i do not mind this but only when a discount is given for not premium goods .
neutral	being this was my 0st shipment i would have expected service and product to be above par to keep me coming_back .
neutral	on line purchase was nice and easy and a great selection of well priced mattresses .
neutral	easy to arrange delivery .
neutral	only issue was that they sent a text saying it would be delivered between 0 . 00am and 00 . 00am , however it didn_'_t turn up until 0 . 00pm .
neutral	difficult to contact customer_services as just goes to voicemail , so not easy to check on it '_s whereabouts and if it would actually arrive that day .
neutral	pleased to say that it did and overall very pleased with it .
neutral	i have found some really good protein products .
neutral	it '_s a real_shame that i pay for next_day delivery and 0 times now out of 0 it has not arrived until a full day later when i am not around to receive the parcel .
neutral	the customer_service line takes for ever to get through and they then offer to refund the delivery charge with an attitude of it '_s not our fault but the couriers .
neutral	sorry but they should deal with the courier , not the failure .
neutral	will look around for comparable products , my gym has some i am going to try as i can not stand people who do not keep to their_promises .
neutral	occasionally , i run_into a problem receiving my virtual visas .
neutral	i bought one on 0 / 00 / 00 at approx .
neutral	0pm pst and it still_hasn_'_t posted on my end ...
neutral	i did like my custom product , however i was surprised the there was no proof sent to me prior to my item being printed and shipped .
neutral	i often make custom items and this was the only company that didn_'_t sent a proof for approval before printing / shipping .
neutral	the product turned_out " just okay " when i feel it could have been " great ".
neutral	the quality of the product though was great .
neutral	i might order from them again , but probably only if i couldn_'_t find my product elsewhere .
neutral	i will say this they where quick to respond to my email .
neutral	but when i supposedly made the reservation i thought i could cancel at any time .
neutral	i never got an_email conformation and then they finally emailed my stuff to me 0 months later after i reached out to them .
neutral	i will be using booking . com from now on !
neutral	i love that i could get almost all books on this website for a reasonable price .
neutral	i did not enjoy the shipping time .
neutral	i went through the tracking order number and i was upset because it was in chicago very close to me but then it wasn_'_t .
neutral	it went from chicago to wisconsin for some_reason .
neutral	your shipping time is a little off over all and that was very frustrating .
neutral	when printing pictures the ink is very dull versus the store epson brand i purchased from walmart .
neutral	i will not purchase again .
neutral	i love the idea behind delivery . com and i love to use it but honestly i use another site similar to delivery . com and they offer more places and easier ways to earn credits faster .
neutral	dont get me wrong , delivery . com is giving it a great try but i think it just needs a little more time and effort to get more customers / stores / restaurants to sign_up .
neutral	one person complained as we re - boarded the bus and the driver would not leave until everyone returned to thier original seats .
neutral	very immature behaviour on his part , and did it in an abrasive manner .
neutral	the book is fine and arrived in a timely_manner ; but it '_s the mirror we need and your site offers it , but we went to buy it and you wouldn_'_t let_me have it ... not happy about that !!
neutral	and there was no_explanation ... not happy about that either !
neutral	!
neutral	i love stamps . com but i now have a mac and i have to keep my old computer just to do my stamps !
neutral	unfortunately i was unable to find a gas_station near the car_rental return location ( twice ) and had to pay more than double the going rate for gas .
neutral	although this was explained , i still feel it is unnecessary and way overpriced leaving a bad feeling .
neutral	i '_m now on my 0rd rental in two_weeks and went today to rent another car .
neutral	i had to pay top price for a car much larger than i needed with no consideration of repeat business .
neutral	a little_disappointing .
neutral	other than that , the cars were fine , service was ok .
neutral	well , i had some what satisfied experience .
neutral	i have ordered from them two times , they delivered on time and the flowers were good too .
neutral	all in all , i would recommend them to give a try .
neutral	i couldn_'_t_believe it took 00 days to get a book
neutral	i was upset because i have been ordering cards from your service for over a year and my last shipment of two cards never arrived .
neutral	when i called ( sometime around 0 / 00 / 00 ) to ask about the missing packages , i felt that the customer_service was not up to par .
neutral	i understand that the postal service is liable for any lost mail since i paid for the most inexpensive type of shipping but the agent informed me of this with an attitude .
neutral	perhaps he was having a bad day but this was not the type of service i expected as a repeat_customer .
neutral	also , i think it is inconvenient when purchasing more than one gift_card because you have to start an entire new transaction .
neutral	i hope it '_s ok that i write in english - i can read norwegian , but it would take me a really long time to write in norwegian .
neutral	the orchid i ordered was a yellow oncidium orchid , but a white / pink phalenopsis with ivy and a kalanchoe was delivered to my mom .
neutral	my mom loves the flowers , but it would have been nice to have been told that the orchid i ordered wasn_'_t available and a different one would be substituted .
neutral	also , phalenopsis are much_cheaper_than oncidium so i would have paid the lower cost for a phalenopsis if i had known that was what my mother would receive .
neutral	the website needs to allow for addresses and phone numbers that are not in norway .
neutral	euroflorist is an international website and is frequently used by people sending flowers to other_countries but my address and phone_number in america does not fit in the space provided on the website .
neutral	i might use euroflorist again , but i won_'_t pick an expensive plant or bouquet since what i picked and paid for was not what was delivered .
neutral	maybe next time i will call a flower shop and order over the phone .
neutral	i got quick delivery for my product , and the salesperson was very patient and helpful .
neutral	however , i subsequently learned that i could have been offered a much_better price on the items i purchased .
neutral	this disappointed me b /_c the sales_rep had made me feel_like he was working as a business partner with me , rather_than as an adversary .
neutral	in retrospect , i realized it was for show .
neutral	the main item was a parasol for my little girls pushchair , the website said ' only two in stock ' so i thought i ' d best order it straight_away .
neutral	the delivery was super quick - it arrived the next_day along with a couple of other items .
neutral	but the parasol i received was not the one advertised on the website .
neutral	there wasn_'_t even a label with it , or even a delivery note with the order , so i couldn_'_t tell what i had been sent .
neutral	now i have to wait_until the correct one can be sent ... but they don_'_t know when that will be .
neutral	i selected the " up to 00 day " delivery option , and the invoice given by the company who delivered the oil shows a cheaper price than i payed to boiler_juice but have not had any notification from boiler_juice of a refund as yet .
neutral	generally had good service with wowcher in terms of products and dealing_with external websites .
neutral	occasional problems which wowcher has dealt_with efficiently .
neutral	on one occasion i purcahsed a deal for a wax treatment from salon 000 in acton , and was refused service and accused of lying about making an_appointment despite following the instructions given on the wowcher .
neutral	wowcher did provide wowcher_wallet credits as a refund but i felt that the rest of my feedback and complaint about this merchant was ignored / not investigated further , as i later saw a repeat of the same offer become available on the website .
neutral	i wanted to know when it arrived .
neutral	i thought i marked something to let_me know but i wasnt told .. also , i wanted to see exactly how and what it looked like ...
neutral	bought another nest of tables as so pleased with the first , also really lovely , great delivery driver , very efficient .
neutral	the shop assistant at milton_keynes store was surly & unfriendly .
neutral	told me in no uncertain terms that i must buy their wax or furniture has no warranty , this is rubbish as it does not affect my legal rights as a consumer .
neutral	when i explained that i already had plenty of suitable wax since my father was a cabinet maker he said " so why doesn_'_t he make the furniture for you " i was too shocked at his rudeness to really respond .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t already got a set of tables & wanted matching ones , i would have walked out of the shop without buying anything !
neutral	i have already posted one review for dfs , that is quite enough !
neutral	!
neutral	disappointed with my purchase this year .
neutral	in the apricot allegro collection , the
neutral	mango tango calibrachoa in full_bloom is fuschia / strong pink .
neutral	the verbena substituted for the gomphrena is advertised as growing 0 - 0 ' tall , so i '_m not excited about putting it in my deck pot .
neutral	the three black petunias arrived soggy and with some wilted leaves .
neutral	i cut them back and hope at_least one of them survives .
neutral	each day there is more dead
neutral	on two of the plants ... oh my ...
neutral	i wanted to purchase gift_cards for 00 individuals that were personalized with their name and unique design .
neutral	i had to choose an image , enter the denomination and specify the name for each gift_card .
neutral	it was a lengthy process because i had to start the process all over after finishing a card .
neutral	( i . e .
neutral	sent back to main menu where i had to choose holiday predesign theme every time i finished a card ).
neutral	after about 00_minutes , i had 0 of the 00 cards completed .
neutral	as i saved the specs for the 00th card , the settings for the previous 0 were deleted from my card .
neutral	that '_s 00_minutes of my time i '_ll never get back .
neutral	i was so frustrated that i couldn_'_t bring myself to start over again until the next_day .
neutral	i did finally start all over again and after about 00_minutes , successfully placed my order .
neutral	if the recipients didn_'_t love the personalization so much , i wouldn_'_t order again just because of the tedious ordering process .
neutral	but because they do love it , i will likely brave the " jungle " again next year .
neutral	ultimately the final_product met my satisfaction .
neutral	this site has low_prices and sale items are a bargain , however , shipping from the east_coast to the west_coast took 0 days .
neutral	due to the long length of shipping time , i may only order if i do not need the items immediately .
neutral	everything was packaged well .
neutral	i have found good places to stay on housetrip , but it is more_expensive than contacting the host directly to make payment .
neutral	every time i have tried booking from my home computer the payment section has frozen up .
neutral	if the website worked better to secure i booking it would have made planning a vacation much_easier !
neutral	i never have problems with other booking websites .
neutral	i ordered 0 sets of gas canisters for my weed wand .
neutral	only one set was delivered so i rang to tell them .
neutral	the call was handled in a friendly way and the other set has now arrived .
neutral	ordered several things from evermine - - clear favor_bags , return address labels , and small round stickers .
neutral	clear favor_bags - not pleased .
neutral	have a golden hue , despite not stating this on the website .
neutral	i contacted the company and they say the golden hue isn_'_t noticeable once the bags are separated and not in one big pile .
neutral	either way , would not recommend these
neutral	return address labels - they ' re " ok ".
neutral	i think the font ( cursive / script ) came out a bit blurry .
neutral	small round stickers - these were actually perfect .
neutral	no_complaints .
neutral	vibrant color , perfect size , as_described .
neutral	it delivers on time and good !
neutral	my order history only shows two orders -- when in fact i have had multiple orders over the past years and a half .
neutral	i needed to review those to be sure i was re - ordering the correct paper , but it would not show me my complete hsitory .
neutral	a problem !!
neutral	!
neutral	we received the instructor '_s manual instead of the student copy we ordered .
neutral	i decided to keep it only because it '_s calculus and it might help my son since he '_s no math whiz .
neutral	however , if the instructor says " no " or has a problem with it , we ' re returning it .
neutral	we '_ll know next week if it '_s acceptable .
neutral	the futon frames are top quality and are cheap .
neutral	however , you end up paying a lot more when you add the extras ( futon_cover , mattress , etc ).
neutral	the guys who came set_up my futon did not explain to me how to open and close my futon .
neutral	overall , okay service .
neutral	i previously owned a neff washing_machine which lasted a good 00 years , fantastic machine .
neutral	i chose the aeg over the neff because of the online report - i am quite disappointed with the spinning out of the machine .
neutral	it has a 0000_spin speed but the clothes are still quite wet when they come out of the drum which costs more to dry because it takes a lot longer .
neutral	also it doesn_'_t appear to have a short wash programme , all the programmes take over the hour , unless i am not operating it correctly .
neutral	perhaps someone would enlighten me if this is the case .
neutral	it would have been nice to know that one of my shirts was out of stock or not available when i placed my order not when i received my shirts .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	we received the company gift_cards for our employees as a christmas gift .
neutral	was disappointed in the cards though that we paid_extra for .
neutral	maybe add an option instead of orange .
neutral	i was very pleased how quickly the nike_tennis shirt and shorts i ordered for my grandson arrived , the shorts were much too long and needed returning and it was then that i began to be disappointed , instead of enclosing a returns_form with the goods it needed to be printed from the website , i do not have a printer , there was no pre_- paid returns_label which i cannot recall happening with any other company i have ordered from , so i would only order again if i could be absolutely certain that nothing would need to be returned , a great pity
neutral	had a slight hicup with my delivery wasnt called the day before so oil couldnt be delivered , had to call head_office they sorted it out next time the company called me and i had a succesfull delivery 0 days_later .
neutral	i havent had problems before and hope not to in future .
neutral	i ordered the innova prime food and treats .
neutral	i wish the expiration_date was a little better , mine was for 00 . 0000 and the treats were dated a year out . the instant_chat was answered quite promptly .
neutral	i am looking_forward to re - ordering soon .
neutral	it was great the first time i used it but , the second time i used it i sent two phones in two different envelopes and i heard_nothing for them in over a week .
neutral	i emailed them and fair play they got back to me the same day , and the following_day they sent another email_saying the money will be in my account within the week .
neutral	my only worry is that if i hadn_'_t emailed them , i might not have got my money before christmas .
neutral	anyway i have my money on its way now .
neutral	sometimes they make an_error , but heaven forbid you call them and ask them to correct it .
neutral	i bought dress and found the sizing way off from your sizing_guide .
neutral	i had to return the garment as it did not fit .
neutral	i liked ordering from bookbyte because they had the cheapest option for my textbook , but the order did not go as smoothly as planned .
neutral	a mistake was made in the shipping , so they decided to have the textbook shipped back to themselves and give me a full_refund .
neutral	luckily i found the book elsewhere for a good price , but it would have been nice to have spoken directly on the phone about this matter .
neutral	they only way of contacting them is through email .
neutral	i found it hard to complete my insurance on line so i had t o ring the office .
neutral	i got great help from them but have not received anything yet .
neutral	cheap international call rate compare to others companies .
neutral	good connection .
neutral	will recommend this company to others .
neutral	do not have to use acccess code every when you gave to make a phone_call .
neutral	as long you have some credit in your account you are ready to dial your number vat anytime .
neutral	i went in was treated nice .
neutral	turn my car around and notice oil change @ 00_% ask for oil change to be done .
neutral	they treated me cold and would not help me i was told " at_least you have 00 %."
neutral	i finally called drive time corp . office was giving the run_around until i got a manager named omar .
neutral	who told me when i get oil change fax a copy and he would credit my account which is all i wanted anyway .
neutral	customer_service only last until you buy the car and leave .
neutral	i was so disappointed .
neutral	i need to find a hotel near a client or event , and it '_s hard to find the controls for that .
neutral	please make that option easier to find !
neutral	i really love their shoes ❤
neutral	the default is english ( usa ) and therefore the amount is shown in usd .
neutral	i changed it to english ( uk ) and the amount is shown in pounds .
neutral	i changed it to netherlands , where i live , and finally the amount is shown in euros , but i do not speak / read nederlandse .
neutral	there are thousands of expats all over the world , of all nationalities , who need to be able to choose language and currency separate from each other .
neutral	please fix
neutral	i would recommend book it . com to everyone .
neutral	it was great finding reasonable rates in california .
neutral	though your t web_site and ordering process was easy and straight_forward but i think waiting 0 . 0_weeks and still no boots is a little long . i hope i get a quicker response to my email about not receiving my boots yet .
neutral	loved the pattern , but it was so difficult to place correctly as the whole pattern seemed to be cut on the slant .
neutral	my daughter put it on for me as she has smaller hands , and she had problems .
neutral	also , little bumps have appeared where there weren_'_t any when we put it on .
neutral	my daughter has gelaskins and found it much_easier .
neutral	diab loskinz is very stiff .
neutral	but i did love the wonderful choice .
neutral	have used travelocity extensively over last few_years .
neutral	i liked the information they kept on file and it was easy to use .
neutral	now , you have to renter your personal information .
neutral	it is now not as convenient to use .
neutral	i ordered two parts from parks geek .
neutral	they were shipped_separately first of all , which is ridiculous .
neutral	second , one part came within a few_days , the next one took almost two_weeks !
neutral	i doubt i will ever order from these_guys again .
neutral	i could have ordered the same parts from a hundred other_sites and had them faster .
neutral	after doing my first few wowcher deals i '_m still unsure on weather i '_m receiving them all or not ?
neutral	i '_ve received some and that was very prompt and easy but the other half i still have not received although i have paid for them , i '_ve had codes that don_'_t work and made numerous phone_calls that no one on the other end seems to know what to do plus emails that have not been replied to ?
neutral	i seem to be the one now who '_s out of pocket ?!
neutral	needs to be made more clear and for yourselves to work in partnership with the company '_s that are doing the deals instead of us being shoved from pillar to post !
neutral	sorry if its comes across rude but i just need to make my point .
neutral	normally , i am always very pleased with the transcripts but in this last one there were several lines that were deemed " inaudible " that i had to go back myself and fill in the blanks .
neutral	i haven_'_t run_into this problem before , and i was pretty disappointed .
neutral	the photograph on the website showed the item in a nice red colour .
neutral	i ordered it as this was the colour i wanted there was no choice of colour during the ordering process however the one that arrived was black , i could have ordered a black one from elsewhere cheaper , also prices are displayed are without vat so you think they are cheaper_than they are , misrepresentation i think , disappointed .
neutral	caught out once it will not happen again .
neutral	it took many communications to get the lettering exactly right .
neutral	they then said they couldn_'_t print it as specified , since there was too much large white lettering .
neutral	but they came up with a solution of gluing the large white letters to a plain black panel .
neutral	i was pretty frustrated .
neutral	the product was received very fast but the web
neutral	site need to be explained about the discount ..
neutral	it
neutral	does not state you have to have a recurring order
neutral	to get the discount .
neutral	other than that i would most
neutral	likely order again from the site .
neutral	product was still
neutral	less that at the other local_store i buy it from .
neutral	so it does get a thumbs_up ..
neutral	after searching at all the local frame stores , i found exactly_what i wanted on the website of frames_direct .
neutral	and they were less_expensive , as well as able , according to the order page , to get them to me in a week .
neutral	i was so excited !
neutral	the problem came after i ordered them .
neutral	they emailed me and said the frames were on back order so it would be three_weeks .
neutral	sadly , i agreed that i could wait .
neutral	after 0_weeks , i called , since i hadn_'_t heard any more , and the number they listed went to a voice_mail .
neutral	asking for a return call , i left my message .
neutral	i also emailed to an address i was also given .
neutral	i repeated this process every 0 - 0 days for several weeks .
neutral	after 0 months , i received my glasses .
neutral	i love them .
neutral	the prescription is right , the frames are exactly_what i pictured and i am happy .
neutral	but i '_m not sure if i will order from them again , as they never returned my calls or my emails and i had no_idea how much longer i was going to have to wait .
neutral	i like communication .
neutral	when my shipment arrived , the box was a wreck .
neutral	it seemed weak , and had been taped up all over it , as if it were damaged in transit , perhaps by the carrier .
neutral	although the box was badly_damaged , the product was not .
neutral	the dogg food i ordered was just fine .
neutral	i guess i would say that either this was a unique situation and the box got damaged accidently , or a heaver grade of cardbaord would be better in the future .
neutral	with as much damage as there was to the box , i was surprised the bags of food were not damaged .
neutral	that was my experieince .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	was looking_forward to trying the replacement cartridges , printer didn_'_t want to accept kept saying no ink , replace .
neutral	after a few tries of push stop / reset finally worked ..... print very good .
neutral	happy now
neutral	still_waiting on my purchase , states it may take 00 days .., guess so .
neutral	was hoping to get them faster .
neutral	hope they are on the way !!
neutral	!
neutral	was a bit more time_consuming than i had anticipated and i would have also have preferred the choice of my own page formats , there were times when i would have preferred one picture to fill one page size however i found this was not available except for front / rear covers .
neutral	i would recommend however as great value for money especially for larger volume of photos .
neutral	first the ice machine took_forever to fill the plastic ice bucket that was provided in the room second the complimentary_breakfast was a joke .
neutral	all that was provided was coffee orange juice & toast , inwhich the toaster did not work properly .
neutral	third the refrigerator seriously needed to be defrosted and last i was brushing my teeth when a roach ran_across the sink basin .
neutral	i was pretty grossed out over that .
neutral	on a positive_note the staff was fantastic .
neutral	very friendly and helpful .
neutral	all in all my stay was fair .
neutral	metro initially refused to refund my payment card for an item that was clearly defective .
neutral	i did not wish to replace it as i ' d spoken with others who had poor experience with same product and there was nothing else i wanted to purchase .
neutral	still , they gave_me an " in - store " credit when i had no need for any other $_000_+ items from them .
neutral	three_months later , at my insistence , they very grudgingly refunded my credit_card .
neutral	i will not deal with this company again .
neutral	transaction was easy enough , but i have no_idea if the card was received .
neutral	so , either the card never showed_up or the brat was too lazy to call and say " thank_you !"
neutral	i cancelled my order and after communication via the website a refund was promptly made .
neutral	the reason i cancelled was that it came very close to my departure_date and i still had not received my tablets .
neutral	when i emailed them the order had not been processed as i had ticked the box saying i had a doctor '_s prescription ( i didn_'_t ) and i hadn_'_t provided it .
neutral	i ordered from this site 0 years_ago and was not required to provide one .
neutral	it would have been helpful to have had a reminder that i hadn_'_t provided one .
neutral	i was given the option of an online consultation but felt i ' d risk not getting the tablets in time .
neutral	i received a bin which cost me £_00 .. and it came dented and faulty .. still have it and e_mailed wowcher to help .. they e_mailed supplier twice with no response .. so £_00 ... wasted in fact if it wasn_'_t a bin i would put it in the bin ... this was two months_ago and still no further forward .. since wowcher recommended seller then i expect they should refund me but nothing .. be careful what you buy !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered the dog gone_smart dirty_dog mat .
neutral	it really catches the mud as my dogs run in from outside , however , it will not stay in one place !
neutral	i constantly have to replace it near the door , it moves faster_than i can !
neutral	not worth the money when i have to bed over and adjust it so often !
neutral	the treats and chews that i ordered on my next order made the dogs very happy as they tracked more mud and rainwater onto my carpet !
neutral	my indesit induction_hob is a little_bit indecisive !
neutral	maybe it is early days yet , but the plates were still quite hot after turning them off , as one of the attractions for
neutral	buying one , that no heat remains on plate once they are clear of objects .
neutral	so i am a
neutral	little disappointed with mine , as friends said this was one of the main good ideas for
neutral	getting one , especially when there are small_children around .
neutral	so i will come_back to
neutral	you in another month to see if my opinion changes .
neutral	i loved the boots i bought .
neutral	unfortunately they were too small !!
neutral	a size 00 is not an 0 a 00 is an 0 so were miles too small and i can '_t afford to send them back .
neutral	veryvery dissapointed this time .
neutral	thinking about changing to life lock .
neutral	i have had 0 citibank master card numbers stolen and used in europe for $ 0000 - plus , japan - for $ 0000 plus , texas , oregon & virginia ( by some obvious testing means of charging $ 0 ads and mags ), but was never notified by your company , even after the fraud_alert went out and each card was cancelled .
neutral	makes me wonder what the credit_card monitoring service i '_m paying for does .
neutral	while i like having the other categories of info , and i '_ve guided 00 family_members to your company , i '_m now not sure if any of us need to keep it .
neutral	i can have the cc alerts for free by my card providers and my credit_scores for free 0x a yr from gov .
neutral	can you explain the credit_card misses ?
neutral	and what i '_m paying for in fraud_alert portion of your cc section ?
neutral	i made a purchase a couple years_ago for phone cases and it was a great experience .
neutral	this time around i '_m a little disappointed .
neutral	i placed my order on june 0nd and have not yet received my product .... still_waiting
neutral	didn_'_t make clear whether 0 month or 0 month allocation 0 lenses / 0months .
neutral	lady spoke to at customer_service quite abrupt
neutral	i was in the dark on the status of my passports for my children .
neutral	when checking online the status never changed .
neutral	the only_reason i knew the process was progressing is when i saw my checks cashed .
neutral	i called 0 times to get an update , during normal business hours and the company never answered .
neutral	i finally emailed on a sunday and was told on monday_morning i should anticipate the passports on wed .
neutral	however , they showed_up that same morning .
neutral	it seems the company is going through some challenges .
neutral	i would not recommend them .
neutral	amiclubwear has great shoes at affordable prices , but their customer_service is horrible and non reliable !
neutral	i have had trouble in the past with getting an_issue_resolved .
neutral	i request to speak with a supervisor 0 times and never got a call back from one .
neutral	got quick mailing service , decent price but there were no hookup instruction included at all .
neutral	i thought i was getting the best deal but , i found the same dates on groupon for $_00 less over a five night_stay .
neutral	that '_s why i am hesitant when it comes to buying without_any options .
neutral	so_far i '_m getting a bad connection to macedonia through tel0advantage .
neutral	i '_m having better luck with koala calling through united world telekom .
neutral	the thing i hate about college is the cost of books .
neutral	book_byte has amazing prices to help succeed , but make_sure if you use them you order way before class_starts , because the service is slow and the cost to expedite your books is like renting a whole other book from them !
neutral	i got what i ordered when i ordered but had to return to shop because wrong power_supply was supplied with initial order .
neutral	surely initial checks should have highlighted this ?
neutral	whilst nicely renovated it could have done with a good clean .
neutral	plenty of places needed a good dust , cobwebs needed to be cleared and the kitchen_floor could have done with a wash as it was very sticky .
neutral	plenty of spiders and several slugs to share cottage with which was not very pleasant .
neutral	the description not very accurate as the two entrances were either up 0 really deep steps ( not straight off the road as_described ) or 00 deep steps depending which door you used .
neutral	would not be very good for disabled or the infirm .
neutral	steps more or less went straight on to the main road which was quite busy and noisy .
neutral	not quite the quite cottage we had hoped for .
neutral	whilst cosy , we needed heating on as it had a damp feeling to it - i know weather has_been bad but did not really expect that in july .
neutral	over all felt that the money spent on it did not meet expectations .
neutral	the welcome pack was a nice_touch , but perhaps a better effort could have been made to make the property cleaner .
neutral	our trip into london - not good .
neutral	driver left us waiting with no_explanation until we asked and was so unfriendly as to even ignore us in his shuttle when asked direct questions .
neutral	however , different driver taking us back to heathrow could not have been friendlier or more accommodating .
neutral	placed same day delivery at 00am .
neutral	flowers weren_'_t delivered till 0pm .
neutral	not good enough
neutral	i haven_'_t had att & t for over 00 years and i still ask myself if i have made the right decision in choosing them now .
neutral	we will see how things go this time arounnd .
neutral	my 0 daughters and myself did the big_bus_tour 0_weeks_ago . i personally felt_like cattle being herded on and off the bus , pushing and shoving to make_sure that everyone got to the top_deck with the best of views .
neutral	however , that said , the tour took us pretty_much everywhere we wanted to go , we did the whole tour without getting off then went around again getting on and off where we wanted to .
neutral	towards the end of the day we began to panic about how we would eventually get back to euston ( where we had started our tour ) and to our hotel , i asked the driver who muttered something about the green_route and 0pm , then the guide barked at me that this was the last of the tour for the night and we would not get back to where we wanted to go now !
neutral	! very helpful !
neutral	!
neutral	so , panicking we jumped off at the next stop , went into hamleys and got the underground back to euston .
neutral	we did have two really good tour_guides to start the tour but like i said a very grumpy shouty unhelpful guide at the end of the evening .
neutral	i am not sure if i would do this tour again as the following_day we decided to use public_transport which we found quite easy , cheap and less daunting !
neutral	the room , i guess , served its purpose .
neutral	the furniture was all chipped and the room was not completely clean .
neutral	i had to call the front_desk to clean a few spots that had a sticky substance on them .
neutral	not sure if i would stay there again .
neutral	it didnt have a good feel .
neutral	project_management master pakage content was exactly_what i needed however , i was disappointed to find the course material was not availale for the full year i was informed i had to complete the course .
neutral	i received no notification from e_- careers therefore was not able to fully complete the course .
neutral	book was beat for the money !
neutral	my order was canceled because the product was not available .
neutral	while i understand products are out of stock i should not have been able to order this productin the first place and find it frustrating that i was charged and refunded and had to find another website to order the product from days_later .
neutral	we ordered a three gardenias and three tea olives from brighter_blooms .
neutral	they were a little more_expensive than i had paid at a local_nursery but they were the three gallon size .
neutral	two of the three tea olives have no flowers ; based on my experience in the past , this means that it will be a green shrub and will never have flowers .
neutral	the two non_- bloomers have different leaves from the bloomer .
neutral	one of two non_- bloomers looks pretty dingy .
neutral	it probably_won_'_t make it .
neutral	i called customer_service about this .
neutral	they really don_'_t seem to care or back their products .
neutral	i guess that is a $_000 lesson that i learned ...
neutral	had an_appt .
neutral	for a alignment which should of took . 00_minutes but was told that depending_on when the vehicle exactly gets back there because cars come in and out .
neutral	why have an_appointment , i could of just came off the street with no appointment .
neutral	i was very disappointed when what i received wasd not what i ordered .
neutral	if you cannot supply the correct order than you should advise the buyer rather_than just send out what you think they want .
neutral	the ear_pieces are very hard to open / close .
neutral	we were very happy with previous order but this time it made my son hard time to put them on asone of the handles ia always stayinga little_bit bended so the whole glasses are not sitting right onthe face .
neutral	i was a little dissapointed in my truck handles .
neutral	one was an original part and had all gaskets and screws to install .
neutral	the other was an aftermarket part with no gaskets or screws for installation .
neutral	had to use old parts to install .
neutral	kind of defeated my purpose of restoring my truck with new parts .
neutral	we had to change the flight reservation due to a work conflict .
neutral	over an_hour on hold and $_000 later we were able to get it .
neutral	we had to go to a supervisor as the agent would not change one ticket but wanted to change both .
neutral	such hassle .
neutral	we should have booked direct with the airline .
neutral	however , we booked a cruise with travelocity and have had no_problems .
neutral	although the tour_guides on the bus were great and full of interesting information the traffic around london made time between stops longer_than_anticipated .
neutral	if you are limited on time i would suggest just taking the tube and seeing the sights but if you do have the time then take a one day bus_tour .
neutral	this item looks great - the colour matches our conran sofa in the tv room .
neutral	so much so that i '_m going to order another one .
neutral	however , i wish you ' d produced something a bit more comfortable , thicker and better padded .
neutral	i ' d_rather have paid more for a better quality item .
neutral	as it is , everyone who sits on it gets an initial shock , as it '_s really hard and not padded at all .
neutral	on this occasion the balance seems to have swung a bit too far in the direction of price at the expense of quality .
neutral	definitely not for the drawing room .
neutral	but the finish and styling are entirely satisfactory .
neutral	the products and prices are excellent from hunt_office .
neutral	we actually changed from viking to them .
neutral	however we have had difficulty getting returns picked_up ( took several phonecalls from me and approx 0 months !).
neutral	our biggest_problem is delays in delivery .
neutral	their website lets you order and then the following_day you get an_email to say it will be a week before delivery !
neutral	if it is not in stock the customer should be told at the time of order so that they can decide to get the item elsewhere if it is urgent .
neutral	would be great i am sure , but after a week the item still has not arrived !!
neutral	!
neutral	received package very quickly .
neutral	however , when we opened box one of the lights rattled , on further inspection the plastic battery cover had been snapped making the battery loose and rattling about .
neutral	all the batteries needed charging as they werent working and were a little rusty at the ends , we had a charger so charged them up .
neutral	they have so_far kept their charge .. so heres hoping !
neutral	reasonable price though .
neutral	travel to the midwest these days can be dicey ; so having a travel_agent that keeps you informed by the contact info you provide is really important .
neutral	travelocity let the ball drop on this trip .
neutral	no notice was received from travelocity or the airline regarding cancelled flights out of moline ( mli ), illinois due to weather .
neutral	found out at the last_minute because my boyfriend received an_email notification .
neutral	to add " salt " to the wound , the airline tried to book my return to ca lax via 0 stops ( denver & san_diego ) & 00_hours of flight time - and my boyfriend who booked direct with the airline was rebooked by the airline with a short layover and got in early .
neutral	he was able to get me booked on his flights and adjoining seat_assignments ( dream guy ).
neutral	it was quick and easy to get a price the only_thing i have not been happy about is that any refund to my debit_card need to be requested , bit of a pain that !
neutral	unfortunately ( and this is always the trouble with online ) the description was not full enough so i have ended_up with 0 items to go straight to the charity shop .
neutral	like the site need more product details
neutral	one out of 0 of my items were damaged .
neutral	i have to give 0_stars bc it was fast but i did not receive all the items i purchased .
neutral	i didn_'_t read the descriptions carefully so things didnt turn out according to plan ..
neutral	very strong_magnets though .
neutral	easytobook we ' re easy to book as their name states but what was a little_disappointing , the total_cost of booking was not stated when searching for rooms .
neutral	i used a compare search_engine to find my hotel and easytobook came out the cheapest by a substantial_amount .
neutral	it wasn_'_t until the confirmation of my booking , the total_cost including_taxes was given to me and it did not differ from quotes of other_websites .
neutral	i did not like that i was mislead into booking what with i thought was the cheapest agent .
neutral	immediate delivery of everything i ordered , but the box was full of bugs ... a combo of baby crickets and roaches !
neutral	so_far , it doesn_'_t appear that any of the food has bugs inside .
neutral	i think they need to re - examine their shipping containers and how they are stored .
neutral	however , i will give them another go ... i hope it was just a one - time - event .
neutral	i am going to give it a couple more shots .
neutral	i have only received one shipment .
neutral	the ordering , payment , the actual shipment and receipt of the package was fine .
neutral	however , when i opened the box , the contents were not really what i expected .
neutral	i was expecting more toys and the theme of this shipment was dental care .
neutral	the contents were mostly all food products .
neutral	the can of dog_food was so badly dented , i threw the whole can away fearing the dogs could become sick if they ate that item .
neutral	the one toy that was shipped was labeled as " for moderate chewers " and one of my dogs destroyed it in a matter of minutes .
neutral	i do like the idea of the " spoiled_rotten " box for the dogs as i would spend this money anyway ; but , so_far maybe a just average rating .
neutral	:(
neutral	took my printer a while to recognize the refills were in .
neutral	it still thinks the color is empty but it is printing .
neutral	i never had any_problems until i purchased a voucher recently which had a very short validity .
neutral	it was for an item and when i had this problem on a different deal company they were happy enough for the deal to be done .
neutral	my issue is mainly about the communication .
neutral	i emailed asking about it and several days_later received a reply which was not relevant .
neutral	i emailed again and never received any reply .
neutral	unfortunately this has changed my opinion on wowcher and i now tend to use other_companies as i buy quite a lot of vouchers .
neutral	totally loved the variety of products and the pricing of the products however having placed my first ever order one of the items received looked nothing like what i thought i was ordering .
neutral	wrote to customer_service via_email and got a generic receipt of email message with not further correspondence from the company .
neutral	returns are rubbish , 00days to return a product !!!
neutral	and you can ’ t even exchange or track .
neutral	[_external link_removed_] is the way forward , don_’ t think i ’ ll be buying from boohoo again !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	had a response from boohoo stating that they replied to my twitter message , but can i just point out that i had to sign_up to twitter for the sole purpose of getting in touch with boohoo in the first place as my email message was ignored !!!
neutral	wasting my time on all levels !
neutral	i realize a typo is my fault and i take full responsibility , but do any of you proof before you print ?
neutral	drop_off time is earlier_than i thought i had booked .
neutral	sent two emails to check details and no reply received in two_days .
neutral	my us number is 0 0000000000 .
neutral	no international outgoing calls .
neutral	daags voordien de_bestelling geplaatst voor_de_dag erop ( voor 00h ).
neutral	na de middag nog niets geleverd .
neutral	de bloemist in kwestie had de_bestelling pas '_s ochtends doorgekregen van regiobloemist en ' had het_niet gezien '.
neutral	de_levering kon pas 0 dagen_later doorgaan omdat er een zondag en een sluitingsdag tussenzat .
neutral	niet echt service , zeker omdat de verrassing er af was ......
neutral	the book was not of " good " quality that i ordered .
neutral	the spine was loose and cracked , and it did not look like a book that would hold up under reading .
neutral	the return was easy .
neutral	great customer_service .
neutral	we booked a car from driveaway . com to pick_up at auckland airport .
neutral	when we arrived at 00 am , the attendant at thrifty couldn_'_t find our booking .
neutral	fortunately , i had printed out our pre_- paid ( prior to end of march ) booking voucher which clearly_stated we had booked a camry .
neutral	the thrify attendant realised that we definitely had booked a car but when she went to investigate , found out that someone at driveaway had cancelled our booking 0 days before we were due to pick it up and 00 days after we paid for it !
neutral	when she tried to ring driveaway , there was no answer because it was anzac day ... a public holiday .
neutral	the only other option would be to call the head_office in usa .
neutral	so , the thrifty attendant took a copy of our credit_card and organised for us to have a small car that had just been returned .
neutral	she contacted diriveaway the next_day and obviously sorted it out with them .
neutral	however , it would have been nice for driveaway to send us an_email and at_least acknowledge there had been an administrative error on their part .
neutral	however , we ended_up with an upgrade from thrifty so it all ended well .
neutral	my hat goes off to the attendant at thrifty for her brilliant customer_service .
neutral	hi ,
neutral	good service and easy to order but expected the tea to be delivered at the same time as the coffee .
neutral	i did not see any notification or comment on login to say they would arrive separately , etc .
neutral	if that is something i missed on where to seek that info .
neutral	apologies but it might be an idea to have expected delivery & if the order is going to be split then that information also .
neutral	kind_regards
neutral	helen
neutral	the ink_cartridges i bought for my printer leaked all in my printer causing a error .
neutral	i recieved the insurance i wanted and at a better price than others .
neutral	when they processed my application they made an_error on my address .
neutral	it has_been extremely hard to correct because there is no human conact or phone promt for these problems .
neutral	having bought games via shopto . net for a long time now , the original reason i started_using the site was due to the prices being very competitive versus the other_retailers available in the uk .
neutral	unfortunately over time this has ceased to be the case and quite_often shopto is actually more costly than amazon to order from ( game are still of course pricing their products too high which goes without saying really ).
neutral	my most_recent_purchase from shopto ( which i unfortunately forgot to price match and change to another supplier before release ) was tales of xillia .
neutral	the price on shop was £_00 .
neutral	i could have saved £ 0 by ordering from amazon instead .
neutral	yes , shopto almost always gets games to me on release day , but increasingly the pricing is not making it worth the cost .
neutral	i will probably be moving my remaining preorders elsewhere if the costs remain as high as they are .
neutral	i needed wall anchors for standard drywall that backs up to a shallow space in front of a beam .
neutral	none of what i ordered seems to do the trick .
neutral	i will experiment to see if i can tighten part way , then remove the screw when it runs into the beam , reinsert and start tightening again .
neutral	i need the anchor to flare to hold heavy drapes .
neutral	i ordered anything and everything that might work , without much luck so_far .
neutral	all the screws are too long , and i hit the beam too soon .
neutral	i ordered " short " but all seem long .
neutral	i '_m self - employed , and most of my clients pay me via_paypal .
neutral	over the last few_years , the service has improved massively .
neutral	i appreciate being_able to cash out with the faster payments system and get access to money in my bank_account almost_instantly ( and with no fees ), but i hate the rest of the fee structure .
neutral	it costs me a lot each_month to receive payments , but my clients won_'_t pay by bacs so i don_'_t have much choice .
neutral	i '_ve had a lot of problems with payments being held for review , and my account getting locked " for security_reasons ".
neutral	sadly , paypal is pretty_much universally accepted / used , and i have yet to find a good alternative .
neutral	hello !
neutral	i was advised by the receiver that they received their flowers by seeing them on their front step when they returned home .
neutral	i was not satisfied with that kind of service as i was sending the flowers due to a death in the family .
neutral	also , i live in new_york , so i was relaying on your service to be impeccable in which it was not .
neutral	the bookit . com rep was very professional in handling my reservation .
neutral	the only trouble was with the phone connection .
neutral	the call faded in and out making communication very difficult .
neutral	the small coil of lights i bought were for a wedding_cake and were dainty and unobtrusive - just what i needed .
neutral	unfortunately the batteries listed as included were not in the package .
neutral	i didn_'_t have time to contact you as i needed to light them to see if they would be suitable so i ended_up spending an extra £ 0 on buying batteries locally .
neutral	the lights are , however , perfect for the job .
neutral	for the second year in a row a plant in the collection arrived seriously damaged .
neutral	i was assured a replacement would arrive quickly but its a week_later and i have not received or heard_anything .
neutral	had to change dates of trip due to weather ; took 0 phone_calls , 0 of which mysteriously " disconnected " before i found basti ( sp ?)
neutral	who solved my problem .
neutral	changes , especially with the wierd weather we have been having , are going to happen and should not require this much effort .
neutral	i went on to easytobook . com and was pleasantly_surprised with the price of rooms when booking through them , so i went_ahead and booked my hotel for june / july .
neutral	however , the price i was told it would cost was £_00 less_than the price that was actually taken from my bank_account .
neutral	this was namely because of tax that had been added even_though easytobook had not made it clear that this cost was not included in the price .
neutral	they also tell you how many euro will be taken from your account but fail to mention the exchange_rate that will be used .
neutral	when working with customers easytobook should tell them the cost in their own currency !!
neutral	so by the end of my booking it ended_up costing me more than i would have paid anywhere_else :(
neutral	trustpilot makes its money from the online websites not the reviewers with the result there is no option to only look at bad_reviews nor even sort reviews ; you are stuck with most_recent first .
neutral	they tell me that more recent reviews are the most relevant but what is does mean is my bad review will soon slip off the screen and hopefully ( from the vendor website point of view ) will never be seen again .
neutral	this severely limits the usefulness of trustpilot as far as i am concerned - when a company doesn_'_t get 00 / 00 i want to know why , i '_m big enough and ugly enough to make up my own mind about what is behind the negative_reviews but i don_'_t want wade_through pages and pages of 0 * reviews looking for the bad_reviews .
neutral	having said that two emails i sent were answered quickly and politely .
neutral	i ordered a 00lb_bag of food ( set_up on a service for delivery every 0_weeks ) and added an item to be sent only with the first delivery .
neutral	i got the add - on item , but didn_'_t get the food .
neutral	i called customer care and had a positive_experience - without_question , they placed another order for food and it was set to be shipped the next_day ( yay !
neutral	)... however , without knowing what delivery service was used ( and i didn_'_t ask , shame on me ), i found that it is going to take an_additional 0 - 0 days to receive my product ( boo !).
neutral	i had to go out an buy more food ( i timed the delivery to coincide with our dogs ' need ) so that our pups wouldn_'_t go hungry .
neutral	wish i would have asked how long the second delivery was going to take .
neutral	lesson_learned .
neutral	i am looking_forward to this service , and think it '_s a wonderful idea - just hoping this is a one - time oops .
neutral	looking_forward to rating higher the more i use the service .
neutral	there was a shipping issue on my order .
neutral	i paid for two day shipping and had not received it .
neutral	it was a week .
neutral	positive_note they were reactive n reshipped right_away , also refunded the original ship charge ( although i had to ask them they didn_'_t offer ).
neutral	not positive it '_s was supposed to b marked next_day saturday delivery but they messed_up yet again n i didn_'_t get it until monday .
neutral	which was the day of my 0st_class so i was not pleased .
neutral	haven_'_t spoken to a human yet .
neutral	web sighht good .
neutral	user_friendly
neutral	this is my first time using olotels . com and i found a decent deal in s . f .
neutral	on a weekend that was otherwise booked .
neutral	however , this site needs to dump it '_s cancellation policies and credit_card fees .
neutral	it just seems wrong not to be able to cancel a booking as long as you are doing it 00_hours in advance .
neutral	olotels . com has a fee regardless of when you cancel .
neutral	in addition the credit_card fees are a shame .
neutral	i ' d use another service next time to avoid these inconveniences .
neutral	maybe it '_s because they ' re a european company .
neutral	if so , then they could learn a bit from their us counterparts .
neutral	we have been with this site for over 0 years and been through many ups and downs with changes .
neutral	it is a good site and we hope that they stay affordable and continue to provide excellent quality .
neutral	i ordered two different_types of dog_food .
neutral	i received the 00_lb_bag but not the second item .
neutral	i call customer_service , they were great !!
neutral	he was sorry the problem , and said they must be out of stock .
neutral	he would gladly refund that amount back to my card .
neutral	the next_day i received the other dog_food .
neutral	i thought it was odd that customer_service didn_'_t even know the item was shipped separate from the first , he told me i would have to re order which_means they are not able to track back orders .
neutral	i will order from them again , although i think shipping and customer_service don_'_t communicate .
neutral	in short , this isn_'_t a beanbag chair .
neutral	its nothing like a beanbag chair , and its probably not what you should get if you are expecting a beanbag chair .
neutral	we were looking for a beanbag chair that we , and specifically our child could use .
neutral	this particular item is great for adults insofar as it is big ( really , even the child version ) and will support you .
neutral	let_me rephrase , it just big , its massive .
neutral	it sits so_far off the ground and will sit you so_far off the ground its really not a beanbag chair in any sense .
neutral	make no mistake , this is furniture .
neutral	this has benefits if you are getting your first studio apartment and have nothing but bare floors , but becomes somewhat inconvenient if you have a home and pre_- existing furniture .
neutral	note that the filling for the chair needs to be reworked to be soft , needs to be reworked constantly , and simply cannot be reworked by someone_who doesn_'_t have considerable mass .
neutral	it '_s a tough tough foam that fills these chairs and it tends to firm up using available air very quickly .
neutral	the process for breaking it back down is essentially my 000lb husband throwing himself on it a dozen_times to make it so my 0 year_old isn_'_t 0 feet off the ground , and has a divot to sit in .
neutral	all this said , once you hit the point where its worked in , it is a really nice ( until it needs to be reworked ) , really tough and quality product .
neutral	just understand what it is you are purchasing .
neutral	nice hotel but the restaurant was not very good .
neutral	good price on travelocity for the hote . l i like the televisions and clean rooms , and the indoor_pool and hot_tub were a great plus !
neutral	i love the shoes but , i will not purchase clothing again fro amiclubwear .
neutral	material is cheapy looking and i did purchase a lot of clothes from them
neutral	ok - i like chemical and you would have 0_stars if you stop sticking the chemical labels on the actual vinyl !!!!
neutral	i cannot iterate this point enough - i look elsewhere for my vinyl for this reason and this reason only because you ruin the cover of the vinyl by leaving it on or you really ruin it by trying to take it off .
neutral	made an order for a stand , paid_extra for quick delivery .
neutral	item delivered on time and good product but they forgot to include the feet .
neutral	this caused an_issue as we were about to do a show and it was already friday pm .
neutral	contacted them and the feet were sent out and received on the monday .
neutral	very helpful , friendly and apologetic , just ashame about the hiccup on the feet otherwise they would have received 0_stars .
neutral	the pods are a lot harder to push down in the chute .
neutral	not for sure that it '_s a perfected size of pod .
neutral	also , with the cost being just $ 0 . 00 left per sleeve , that doesn_'_t seem to be a reason enough to change over to fine_coffee .
neutral	found the address - inputting section tricky to use , had to go back and really look at the end_result a few_times .
neutral	also considering the postage_costs are so high (€ 0 !)
neutral	for just some paper , its quite slow .
neutral	i ordered a small item before the 0pm cutoff on thursday , but it didn_'_t get to me until the following_tuesday .
neutral	if i pay this much for a courier , i expect it a little faster to be honest .
neutral	customer_service when i '_ve rung have been very nice however !
neutral	one of the drivers drove as if he was in a hurry and he told as that there is nothing to see when we complained ...
neutral	i was so in love with the dress i brought that i was super excited when it finally came .
neutral	however !
neutral	the dress was quite short and the material was fairly see - through .
neutral	the lower half looks thicker than it is and felt quite static , this meaning that if i were to wear it on a night out , i ' d have to make_sure the bottom layer was not static to me and that i had pale underwear on in the lights .
neutral	it '_s a lush dress , i just wish it was made with a thicker and better quality material .
neutral	i bought hex penny tiles and carrara marble crown molding for my new bathroom .
neutral	the tile arrived in good condition , and looks good installed .
neutral	however , the pieces of crown molding varied greatly in color - some were very light , some were very gray .
neutral	i would have appreciated more effort on the part of the packers to make_sure the pieces were consistent in color .
neutral	efforts to reach customer_service by e_- mail and phone were unsuccessful .
neutral	i really like their setup and would use them as my default browser , but everything prints in small_print and i can '_t figure_out how to easily change the print size .... all other browsers print fine ?
neutral	also , i have had issues with printing usps labels ...
neutral	i know this might be easy stuff to fix for some , but i '_m not a computer person so go with the one that is the easiest to fix for my uses .
neutral	email sent to rdk today , requesting full_refund .
neutral	item was never recieved and goods were returned to supplier .
neutral	had to buy alternatives locally .
neutral	according to paypal , the refund was only partial due to incomplete address , despite having provided the full address and postcode on the website aswell as paypal .
neutral	not sure of service .
neutral	first time shopping here
neutral	i ordered two cupboards on line , no_problems , paid on line , no_problems , had an_email_confirming my order and delivery date , no_problems .
neutral	the delivery was due yesterday 00 - 00 - 00 and it did not arrive !
neutral	i telephoned this morning to be informed that they were out of stock .
neutral	i asked why i had not been informed yesterday , the girl on the phone didn_'_t really know but said she would pass the message on .
neutral	i had stayed at home all day waiting for the delivery .
neutral	i have requested that i am contacted to let_me know when my delivery will arrive as i cannot stay in for the next week or however long it will take for my order to be delivered .
neutral	jeanette nash
neutral	the information & service we received was excellent .
neutral	unfortunately , the product was not what we had hoped for .
neutral	in this instance we should have gone with the branded replacement product .
neutral	no_problems with the site but delivery company useless and unhelpful , still hav ' nt received my items over a week_later because i had to rebook delivery .
neutral	i did not even know they had tried to deliver untill tracking my order as there was no card left to say they had attempted delivery then after phoning delivery company to rearrange the customer assistant on the phone was rude and hung_up the phone !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	the three pieces of furniture ordered were delivered placed into the room as requested by us .
neutral	the packaging was excellent and the furniture was received in good order , however upon inspection the mini side board was found not to have had the holes drilled to accept the shelf supporting brackets .
neutral	currently it is not therefore possible to fit the shelf .
neutral	as this situation was only found after we had disposed of the packaging it is not possible to send it back for exchange .
neutral	could be_happier than i am with this purchase .
neutral	shipping took way too long and the only option was to pay more for shipping which a customer_service rep told me would maybe shave only a couple days off .
neutral	purchased march 0st and received march_00th .
neutral	i was impressed with sales man .
neutral	customer_service after sale agreed was not so good , had to chase to move things forward and disappointed car wasn_'_t delivered on 0 march despite 0 months notice .
neutral	i was excited to see that i had another choice for capsules for my nespresso_machine at a lower price .
neutral	ordering was easy , shipping was free and capsules arrived in 0 days .
neutral	i have only tried the lungo capsules so_far and the taste is very similar to nespresso but i found the boldness on the weak side .
neutral	and because the capsules are shipped from outside the us , i had to be home to sign for my coffee .
neutral	the fedx guy gave_me forms to sign ahead of time so i won_'_t have to here .
neutral	i will probably order again as it saves_me about $_00 month .
neutral	the elevator inspection was expired , i can '_t remember by how many months .
neutral	the front sliding_doors didn_'_t open , they had to be manually forced open .
neutral	someone punched a hole where you push the button for the elevator .
neutral	however , my stuff was safe and unharmed .
neutral	but overall a sketchy location .
neutral	i '_m sure the other locations are nicer .
neutral	i continue to purchase my ink_cartridges because of the price and the service given , and would recommend that others do likewise .
neutral	i recently_purchased a groupon for petbest . com ($_00 for $_00 worth of merchandise , which was totally awesome ) - i never would have even found the site otherwise .
neutral	i ordered three things : natural_balance green pea and duck cat_food , solid_gold hund - n - flocken dog_food , and 0 natural_balance duck and potato rolls .
neutral	the prices were great and the auto - ship option was even better !
neutral	the shipment arrived pretty quickly , but instead of the duck and potato rolls i ordered , i received 0 bags of duck and potato treats for small breeds ( small , milkbone type treats ).... which would be ok if i wasn_'_t desperately looking for something to hide pills in - that '_s rather hard to do with a very small , crunchy treat .
neutral	my dog is on long - term medication and is incredibly difficult to feed a pill to ; not to mention that he has food_allergies , so the options for hiding pills in food are very limited .
neutral	i would have been entirely pleased with the experience , but it '_s disappointing to open a package you '_ve been waiting on , just to realize the most anticipated item in the order was replaced with another product that cannot serve the same purpose .
neutral	i am contacting them about this later today ... the outcome will determine whether or not i will be a returning customer .
neutral	my name is not rosealie .
neutral	i '_m mary kay .
neutral	i tried to order a gift_card for rosalie and it
neutral	was charged to me but came in her name .
neutral	i couldn_'_t figure_out how to fix it .
neutral	all the others i have ordered in the past came with the same problem .
neutral	i '_m going to find
neutral	somewhere_else to buy my gift_cards .
neutral	we had no_problems ordering the product from simple safety solutions but did experience some problems with their courier company .
neutral	my husband had taken the day off work to wait in for the delivery and we were sent an_email_confirming a time period during which to expect the delivery .
neutral	the delivery never came during that time window and i later received an_email_confirming they were unable to deliver the product as there was no one in .
neutral	when we phoned later to find out what had happened we were told there was no chance it could be delivered again on that day and that we would need to take another day off of work to sit in and wait for it .
neutral	this was not ideal for us and not a great representation of simple safety solutions .
neutral	i would order again if you made the process easier .
neutral	everything was fine with this purchase until i got an_automated call to verify the purchase .
neutral	i almost didn_'_t answer the unrecognized number , but i did .
neutral	then i was hesitant of the automated call and hung_up and then worried that my gift_card purchase wouldn_'_t go through .
neutral	so then i had to look up the number on line and call back to make_sure it worked .
neutral	all of this and having to call defeated the whole idea of the simplicity of ordering online .
neutral	and it made me wonder_how it would send it if i ordered it when i was not at home to get the call to verify it .
neutral	that would also defeat the purpose of an online order if it didn_'_t send it because there was no answer at home to verify it .
neutral	also , my mother did a gift_card for the same recipient but she entered the e_- mail address incorrectly .
neutral	there was no follow_up to her that it failed .
neutral	she did not know until i asked the recipient if he got one from her and he said no .
neutral	she had to call to rectify the situation .
neutral	by that point it was past the event for which the gift was for .
neutral	i think its a necessary evil and its not user_friendly for sr citizens
neutral	i ordered flowers for a friend in n ireland & thought all was okay .
neutral	several hours_later i got an_email_saying i had ordered from the wrong bit of the website & i needed to reorder from the international part !
neutral	ok , they are refunding the payment & i have now reordered the same bouquet at the same price - but really !
neutral	n ireland is uk , not international !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	ps i got confirmation_email of the 0nd order from the same email address & person - what the ....??
neutral	?
neutral	the only_thing i wasn_'_t happy about was i didn_'_t get my contacts by the date they told me .
neutral	they need to take holidays into effect .
neutral	i ended_up paying cancellation_fee and text alert which i didn_'_t need !
neutral	booking was quick and easy which was great but the only_thing that im not fond of is that there is no refunds on cancellations .
neutral	i shipped something to my friend and wanted to buy something for myself as well but there was no option for shipping to multiple_addresses and the shipping_costs was extremely high .
neutral	not sure if i '_ll use this again or not
neutral	love muubaa jackets was very disappointed was so excited about getting it hopefully we can connect properly soon .
neutral	never used this company before
neutral	good service with regular text updates and emails to make you aware of your delivery .
neutral	i upgraded my order to a bigger bunch of flowers but they didn_'_t look very impressive when i see them today .
neutral	god_knows what the size of the smaller bunch of flowers would have looked like .
neutral	from my understanding they come in a nice box
neutral	unfortunately i have no further comments
neutral	ordered these for my garden loungers .
neutral	delivery was quick , price was fine but they do not fit very well , and are difficult to use .
neutral	did not know i was making_reservations through a third_party .
neutral	misspelled my name .
neutral	did not book room with requested amenity .
neutral	poor presentation for recipient - all the bits and bobs were there but sender not obvious - the guy asked several people who sent it - bit off when you spend that kind of money !!
neutral	!
neutral	when i removed my new tail_light from the box , i noticed a rattling noise .
neutral	one of the bulbs had fallen out and was very hard to fish out through the small opening it was supposed to be stationary in .
neutral	when it was put back into its place it would not screw on tightly because the rubber ring ( i don_'_t know the terminology ) didn_'_t seem to be the right
neutral	size .
neutral	we had to make it work with my old tail_light '_s rubber rings .
neutral	it works_fine and was otherwise great , but
neutral	maybe the packaging needs to be improved so nothing comes apart during shipment .
neutral	i been with t - mobile for the last 0 years i just switch to at & t and i have to say the service is 00 times better also the 0g internet is great !
neutral	!
neutral	when i scheduled online i was told the hours between 0 - 0 pm , which i had requested .
neutral	i get a call at noon that the serviceman was waiting at my house .
neutral	luckily i was only minutes away , as i had planned my day with the 0 - 0pm window on mind .
neutral	service was fine .
neutral	i did receive emails back within a couple of days but 00 days is too long to wait for a refund .
neutral	other_sites refund within 0 - 00 days .
neutral	booked room but when arrived at hotel they had not received confirmation even_though booking had been made 0 days prior to arrival .
neutral	while i do use yelp when researching different businesses , i '_m always rather surprised at how reviews are inconsistently presented .
neutral	it seems that the majority of the reviews i see end up being filtered , which really seems to skew the rating of a business .
neutral	unless you think to check the filtered ratings ( which i could less observant people not doing ), it can incorrectly represent the customer experience at some establishments .
neutral	a less astute individual may end up having a bad customer experience which could have easily been prevented if the reviews were displayed in a more transparent and balanced way .
neutral	several considerations :
neutral	0 .
neutral	the price : best price i could find while feeling comfortable that i would actually get what i ordered .
neutral	0 .
neutral	website navigation : i was able to identify and order the parts i needed with ease .
neutral	0 .
neutral	free_shipping : this was appealing .
neutral	however , it took a full week for my parts to arrive via the default ground shipment option .
neutral	if your project is time sensitive ..... consider this .
neutral	0 .
neutral	expedited_shipping : i did not see this option available for the parts i ordered .
neutral	0 .
neutral	customer_service : a phone_number to call with inquiries is not provided .
neutral	i was unable to speak with anyone before , during or after the purchase regarding shipping options .
neutral	however , i did get limited responses through e_- mail .
neutral	unfortunately they took 00_hours to respond and were not really helpful .
neutral	0 .
neutral	for me , at over $_000 , this was a major purchase for auto_parts .
neutral	compared to discount retailers , i was able to save a significant 00_%.
neutral	but , i had to wait longer_than i thought i would .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i was happy with the savings and would use parts_geek again and i ' d even recommend them to others ... with the explanation that you need to be sure of what you are ordering and be prepared to wait for the parts .
neutral	i hope that this review helps parts_geek and potential_customers .
neutral	took about a month to receive my package ..
neutral	bought like 000 $ worth of clothes , probably like 00 items .
neutral	decent price , but for the quality you get with " most " of the clothing , you ' re better off shopping at a & f .
neutral	lots of sizing issues .. all the stuff looked great in the pictures but , prepare yourself , you won_'_t be completely_satisfied .
neutral	i kept 0 out of 00 items .
neutral	:/
neutral	the car was great , and the original desk agent was very helpful .
neutral	however , the car had many scratches and dings when we picked it up , and upon return the employees tried to tell us we had caused a couple of them .
neutral	but we had taken pictures of the car when we picked it up , and showed them they were pre_- existing .
neutral	also , the receipt said they were supposed to ask us which currency to charge us in , and they didn_'_t .
neutral	instead they charged us in us dollars at $ 0 . 00 / euro when the real exchange_rate is $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	even so , the rental was very economical .
neutral	i was in a bind and they got me speedy accurate results
neutral	your products and prices are great .
neutral	delivery is always good , but when i called for advice on camera pricing , and cases , the representative was not very helpful .
neutral	i would expect more knowledge and advice .
neutral	i went on pure_health website to purchase a few items .
neutral	their selection is good and they have good prices .
neutral	i ordered on the 00st of may .
neutral	after 0 days i had not received my order and i checked with their site .
neutral	it seems that it did not ship for 0 days !!
neutral	when i sent an_email to their cs dept their explanation was that they were back - logged and it was not their problem .
neutral	my problem was that i was going on vacation and would have like to have had my order prior to my trip .
neutral	i could not understand_why it took so many days to complete my order and the cs_rep that replied did not seem to care about my unhappiness .
neutral	she basically said , " there is nothing we can do about it ."
neutral	in other words , " i don_'_t care about customer_service "
neutral	while i might look around for another site to purchase the same products , i am sure that this is not normal procedure for pure_health .
neutral	but i won_'_t know for sure until i reorder .
neutral	i can assure you that if this happens again i won_'_t reorder .
neutral	pen received looked a different colour to the picture shown on their website , i did not like the colour of then pen received at all , very disappointed .
neutral	i had no_issues booking my hotel / car but i guess i booked as a guest and later created an account .
neutral	i received my information via_email .
neutral	i tried last_week to go in and look up my reservations and cant .
neutral	yet when i put in the reservation number and my name it tells_me that is attached to a travelocity account .
neutral	yet when i go into my account it tells_me i have nothing booked .
neutral	i called and spoke to a representative who could not actually fix this problem but did call hotel and car places and said they do show my reservations .
neutral	i would feel much_better .
neutral	i also went to the hotel and car_rental places before calling travelocity and put in my reservation numbers and they did not show .
neutral	i am very frustrated .
neutral	if you are going to book be sure to create your account first .
neutral	the service that identity_guard provides is exactly_what i '_m looking for .
neutral	unfortunately , the website has so many issues that i often can '_t access my information when i need to .
neutral	i received the flowers when i said i wanted them , but they looked pretty beaten up when they got here .
neutral	possibly that was the deliver '_s fault but i '_m afraid next time i will try to get them in town .
neutral	hqhair has great prices and good products , and the shipment arrives perfectly in spite of its late .
neutral	the only bad thing is that they usually sell products which are out of stock and you have to wait a long time to receive your order .
neutral	the box arrived as_promised but i did expect at_least some_sort of documentation about the diet and how to best use the delivered items .
neutral	nothing whatsoever in the box other then the food ...
neutral	i emailed them right after_placing an order and asked if they could cancel it because i made a mistake .
neutral	i acknowledge that i was the one that made the mistake , but their reply wasn_'_t helpful or kind .
neutral	good product , received as_advertised but took over a week to arrive when it stated on the website 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i ordered 0 pairs of shoes .
neutral	two of them fit really nice and look really nice .
neutral	one is too small , two are too big , and one doesn_'_t fit the same .
neutral	they really have nice looking shoes and i love shoes .
neutral	i '_m thinking about ordering some more , but hesitant at the same time .
neutral	i ordered the item as a christmas gift , it arrived quickly .
neutral	however the box was slightly_damaged at the bottom .
neutral	when i looked at it did just appear to be the box .
neutral	it wasn_'_t until the box was opened on christmas_eve that i noticed the whole corner of the table was cracked .
neutral	at that point it was too late to return it and i knew that there would be no option of a refund or replacement once this was built up .
neutral	i will admit that i usually book through bookit because it saves_me several_hundred per trip but expedia definately has an easier sight to navigate .
neutral	but bookit has more precise trip organization costs so you don_'_t feel_like you are getting ripped_off in the end .
neutral	the major problem with bookit however is that even when you have your trip in the checkout basket it can still change .
neutral	i was so frustrated with the last booking i threw my pen and told the phone person i might die if it changes one more time .
neutral	i literally tried to book for 0 hours and the flights all kept selling out .
neutral	i eventually did it over the phone and just paid the $ 00pp surcharge to use their phone service booking agent .
neutral	i booked for 0 people so that was kind of steep .
neutral	annoyed but still excited about my vacation .
neutral	i thought our order was shipped extremely fast ; therefore , there was hardly any wait time .
neutral	although , i find ordering on line makes it difficult to know what it is .
neutral	the items i did order my dog could not chew because they were too hard .
neutral	so i would have to know more about the item before ordering .
neutral	i ordered replacement_heads for our oral_b toothbrushes - we have several types in the house but all with the same fitting .
neutral	unfortunately , i did not check the website and none of the brush_heads fit .
neutral	please check your codes properly before you purchase !
neutral	you show pictures of the room , i hope that when i arrive it '_s what i expect .
neutral	it didn_'_t give me a room # so i '_m not sure what to expect upon_arrival .
neutral	about one to one and a half weeks to arrive .
neutral	no big deal but i have received items faster .
neutral	very disappointed - did all the stops - but did not notify passengers when a stop was coming up .
neutral	if you didn ’ t have a map - you were lost .
neutral	not enough talking - wanted to hear more about the sites ..
neutral	i have placed several orders through your website .
neutral	i always thought that you offered good value for money , however , in my last order you substituted a product that i don_'_t normally buy .
neutral	when i sent an_email_asking to exchange this product you opted to ignored me .
neutral	it has_been a week and my email has not been even acknowledged .
neutral	i have bought over € 0000 through your website , i expect to be treated as a loyal_customer and if i dont receive a reply to request then i would have to move my shopping elsewhere .
neutral	difficulty getting return when water shoes i order failed to work and stay together
neutral	dear superdry , most named brands take vat off for channel island residents but you refused .
neutral	they do this by making an adjustment after the initial purchase and refund your credit_card .
neutral	however , a prompt delivery .
neutral	the prices cannot be beat .
neutral	i am absolutely obsessed with tendollarmall .
neutral	however two concerns i have : summer clothing and dresses need to be put on clearance or saved in warehouse for next summer .
neutral	you have barely any sweaters and jackets and zero sweater dresses which is a hugeeee trend right now .
neutral	as a fashion stylist , i had to not order as much from your site as i do during the spring and summer months because your winter attire is very limited .
neutral	the one pair of boots i ordered had staples sticking through and pierced my foot .
neutral	so better quality control is a must .
neutral	please update with more sweaters and outwear / jackets so all can enjoy your clothes every season .
neutral	and full sweaters , not cropped sweaters that show your belly and aren_'_t warm .
neutral	de model / print is mooi maar_ik vond de materiaal niet fijn .
neutral	ik had een soepele jurkje verwacht dat ook leuk zou_zijn voor_de zomer maar_het is een dik stretch materiaal . als_je dit ok vindt is het dan een leuk jurkje .
neutral	de maat valt normaal .
neutral	good products but you pay for them .
neutral	if i had a bigger fashion budget , i ' d shop more at monsoon .
neutral	i am not sure their goods warrant the pricing model they employ .
neutral	very old_fashioned .... not necessarily a bad thing .
neutral	too much junk clutters my searches which makes it a less_than positive_experience even if i eventually find what i want .
neutral	chose to rent a car for 0 + weeks from argus solely on their attractive price .
neutral	car had the advertised features but was dirty .
neutral	staff_member manning the maggiore counter in pisa was curt and not as helpful as we needed since we were new to the area and didn_'_t read italian .
neutral	i asked for a map and he gave_me one but he could not give us any directions .
neutral	he was also sarcastic when we had real confusion about where to go get our designated car .
neutral	summary : not a great customer_service experience and car was dirty but the price was right .
neutral	very good , fast delivery ............... until something is lost .
neutral	one of our consignments was lost .
neutral	no one contacted me to let_me know .
neutral	when i called , i had to give a description of the goods and told i had to wait for 0 days for them to look for the goods .
neutral	i had to call again for an update and was asked for further information .
neutral	again it was only because i called that i knew that more information was required .
neutral	no one contacted me .
neutral	then if the goods aren_'_t found i will have to go through the claims procedure and then send the goods out again , possibly at our expense !
neutral	the book was good price but took too long .
neutral	i travelled on big_bus on monday , 00 september .
neutral	i had tried to book for the sunday ( 0 september ) but your website clearly_stated that the tours would not run due to the paralympics marathon , which was understandable .
neutral	however , it did not mention that tours on the monday ( 00 september ) would be diverted due to the olympians procession through london , an event which had been publicised well in advance but big_bus did not take this into account .
neutral	not only was our route diverted but due to high volumes of traffic and road works ( which i fully appreciate you cannot dictate ) the journey took an extremely long time .
neutral	in fact we arrived close to liverpool station after having sat on the bus for one and a half hours and hadn_'_t really travelled very far .
neutral	due to this , we decided to get off the bus and either walked or took tubes to see the various destinations which was far quicker_than big_bus .
neutral	in summary , big_bus failed in that it should have mentioned this on their website .
neutral	i paid for two tickets which was a waste of money .
neutral	i specifically_asked for a room with two queen_beds .
neutral	i was told i would have them .
neutral	at the front_desk , i was told the fairfield marroitt does not have queen_beds .
neutral	i would have to go to the suites .
neutral	reservations were already made , it was a long day and late night .
neutral	will not be using fairfield_inn again .
neutral	i was trying to book a room at one of the hotels in vienna where my business associates were staying .
neutral	i initially went straight to their website , but found there were no double rooms available except for a suite for $_000 / day .
neutral	instantly a prompt for easytobook appeared and they showed that they had a double room available for 0000 . 00 a night .
neutral	i instantly book the room and now i am able to be with my colleagues in vienna during our trip to the german society of thrombosis and hemostasis meeting .
neutral	booking the hotel was the easy part once i got to the hotel the pool was closed was just hard part . there needs to be a way to update information on hotels
neutral	i ' d ordered the 00 hour delivery but the driver failed to actually come to the correct reception to take my bag and was rather lazy about the whole thing .
neutral	the person_who i dealt_with to fix the problem was very helpful and efficient and sorted_out next - day saturday delivery so that my bag was only about 00_hours_later than planned .
neutral	it was very much_appreciated .
neutral	bag turned_up in perfect_condition and no_problems at the other end .
neutral	this survey is requested before the products have even been delivered .
neutral	very annoying
neutral	i paid for the next_day delivery service with hunt_office but i did not receive my order until the following_day .
neutral	i had already renewed my total security package because i was told that my current subscription was about to end .
neutral	today i got an_email_saying that i would be auto_renewed .
neutral	this does not help with trust .
neutral	i have bought several of the square_trade warranties in the past .
neutral	we use mp0 players and they are not very durable so we have used these warranties .
neutral	each time except this one is was easy and the people were very patient .
neutral	this time it took the third operator to get the service i am used too from you .
neutral	the first gentleman was raphael .
neutral	he immediately referred me to sony as it was less_than a year from purchase .
neutral	sony '_s unconditional warranty is only 00 days long .
neutral	i was unable to get him to work with me so i hung_up .
neutral	i called sony to confirm i was correct and i was .
neutral	i called back to square_trade and spoke to diana .
neutral	she reluctantly agreed to process the claim .
neutral	i asked who to call attention to the fax and she said no one .
neutral	0 days_later on a saturday i call back and get chris c . he deserves a raise for he saved your company '_s reputation .
neutral	a fax with no name goes to the when i have time pile .
neutral	he had me send an attachment ( the receipt ) in an e_- mail to him , called me when he finished processing it to make_sure everything was as i needed it .
neutral	all in less_than 0 hours on a saturday .
neutral	if i had a company that did phone service , i would be hiring him away .
neutral	having experienced some difficulties , roger the amazing customer_service guy put it all right ... and then some .
neutral	00 / 00 for roger .
neutral	i am a sending and recieving florist and have recently set_up my second shop i use i - florist to send and recieved flowers for a convenience to my customers , but recently 0 !!
neutral	yes 0 !!
neutral	orders have been undelivered and had to be sent late so as you can see my frustration offering a service that is ' nt working and making me look incompetant
neutral	i get irritating emails numerous_times per week for the same item .
neutral	if i wanted it , i guess i would have already bought it and it would still be irritating to get the emails ..
neutral	i made the reservation for myself and husband ; and my daughter and her family .
neutral	because the first room listed 0_adults and 0 children i filled that in with my daughters family info .
neutral	the second room was listed as 0_adults ; therefore filled out our info .
neutral	i paid with a credit_card in my husbands name .
neutral	since that time the reservation confirmation and all email has_been addressed to my son - in - love , kevin crawford .
neutral	we paid for it , we reserved it and the least they could do is to get the name right .... steven paulus .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	ordered a card with picture .
neutral	card was cancelled due to technical_difficulties in uploading the picture .
neutral	as a result , the card arrived today instead of before christmas .
neutral	i '_ve had trouble removing and / or adding to my monthly order .
neutral	it should automatically add new item to monthly order not as a separate order .
neutral	also requested free_shipping in the beginning and never got credit .
neutral	only in past month '_s order free_shipping was applied .
neutral	product selection is good .
neutral	need more focus on holistic dog and cat_food and treats especially now that chicken treats from china are causing illness and death .
neutral	stick with products from usa as much as possible .
neutral	not only does supplementwarehouse have quick shipping and the lowest_prices , they have the largest_selection in supplements i have ever_seen .
neutral	i stick with pretty_much the same supplements all the time , but my boyfriend likes to skip around and try a different brand almost every time he buys !
neutral	i never have to worry_about shopping around and i always know i am going to get the best price on the product .
neutral	my only_qualm with supplementwarehouse is their shipping .
neutral	you pay an outrageous shipping and handling bill which they try and justify with the low price of the products and fast shipping but paying 00 dollars to ship my single container of protein order by ups and have to wait a week and a half for my order to come in is a bit ridiculous .
neutral	now if they could cut that delivery time down or the shipping cost to match the wait then supplementwarehouse would get a 000_%!
neutral	everyone that i had contact with was very friendly and helpful , but the wait to speak to someone was crazy .
neutral	i was on hold for 0 hour and 00_minutes just to get help with a box that was marked incorrecty and that was when i finally got the phone to ring and not just buzz and hang up
neutral	order came very quickly but unfortunately the hoodie was far too big .
neutral	it would be helpful if more size information could be given on the website .
neutral	it '_s not my style
neutral	the petflow monthly_subscription to their spoiled_rotten_box are not worth the $$$.
neutral	we were very disappointed .
neutral	we received a lint roller that was valued at $ 0 . 00 , i believe , but its only $ 0 . 00 at a regular store .
neutral	i usually shop the specials page as i usually am shopping for my dog plus anywhere from 0 - 0 foster_dogs .
neutral	i frequently see that %_discount is not correct .
neutral	i have also noticed that they give the msrp but it is often for another size not the size listed !
neutral	it '_s kinda sneaky and underhanded .
neutral	yes , there are some great deals but you really need to know what you are buying as what it would cost you elsewhere .
neutral	booking online is great !
neutral	however it seems redundant to book online and still have to call the prospective sites to guarantee your specific vehicle type to fullfil your reservation needs .
neutral	and how difficult could it be to have the intended site to actually receive the personal contact information you give to let you know what '_s available before you spend time , money and gas to pick_up your intended rental !
neutral	online reservation was great , the discount was great , however the not having cars for the rental_car reservation was not so great !
neutral	disappointed with the delivery of product .
neutral	small package could have been sent thro mail instead of 0 tries by courier .
neutral	they were easy to buy from and about the cheapest around but i wish they would stop with the automatic_renewal .
neutral	or at_least give you the option to opt_out .
neutral	hopefully they will send an_email a few_weeks before to remind_me else i will probably forget .
neutral	( it will have been a year !)
neutral	and i will have the option to cancel it from there .
neutral	cheers .
neutral	disappointed on opening parcel that the colour of the bedding was completely different to as shown on website .
neutral	also unhappy with having to pay to return items .
neutral	probably wouldnt order again based on this .
neutral	have ordered with you previously but not again
neutral	placed order on may 0rd and the money taken out on the 0th but no updated in on my order number .
neutral	unknown if has shipped so i can '_t review it yet .
neutral	also you can not set_up an account with them only able to check your order status by order number .
neutral	i like the quality of you clothes happy with purchase
neutral	i thought it was going to be a good experience , but my card was charged twice and i was told i had to wait_until the next_day to be refunded .
neutral	if its not i will cancel the entire trip .
neutral	if you ' re looking for inexpensive decent clothing , boohoo '_s for you .
neutral	i recently bought a pretty big order from them .
neutral	i was happy with half and disappointed with the other .
neutral	alot of their clothes are very thin material .
neutral	if you ' re planning on having the clothing you are buying , form fitting , i would stay aware of the fact that there is a 00_% chance it will be see through .
neutral	also , i find that their clothes run small .
neutral	i am from canada and the us size on their website usually ends_up being a size smaller_than usual .
neutral	so buy a size larger .
neutral	they are very quick on delivery and always have great sales , so as long as you keep what i said in mind , you should be satisfied with your experience .
neutral	:)
neutral	after sales is slipping . not quite as good at rectifying goods not as_described
neutral	j ' ai_commandé un modèle de 0 , 0 a , j ' ai bien verifier à choisir ce modele .
neutral	vous m ' envoyer l ' autre modèle à 0 . 0 a . comme j ' en avais besoin rapidement , je_n ' ai_pas renvoyer le modele .
neutral	j ' espere que ça abimera pas mon pc .
neutral	cordialement
neutral	i just had 0 dellivery so i really do not want to say much yet .
neutral	i bought the shirt because storms send my dog into a quivering panic .
neutral	we had a storm the other night and she still shook throughout the storm .
neutral	i '_m going to give it another try , but i '_m not hopeful .
neutral	this was the first time that i used skypax forwarding service .
neutral	i found it very easy to use and skypax notifies me via_email when they receive a package .
neutral	my only concern is the amount of delivery fee that was charged to send everything to me .
neutral	i had 0 parcels delivered to skypax , which they measured in weight and size .
neutral	skypax calculated the delivery fee by combining the size of the two items , and worked on a " chargeable weight " formula .
neutral	this was about £_00 more than what i expected to pay based on the weight .
neutral	but i still paid it in the end .
neutral	when i received the final parcel , it was the actual box of the larger item with the smaller item inside .
neutral	now if delivery fee was based on " size ", why was i charged for the combination of two boxes if they just combined it in one ?
neutral	in the end , i had to pay for 00 . 00kg of chargeable weight while the parcel was only 0kg !!
neutral	that '_s 0 . 0kg more than what i should pay .
neutral	overall , i ' d still recommend the use of skypax .
neutral	but be sure to allow extra budget for shipping in case you are overcharged .
neutral	it takes three_days after they enter info for it to even leave their warehouse .
neutral	then 0 more days to deliver .
neutral	it used to take only 0 days total .
neutral	make_sure you order with plenty of time , like a week before you need the product .
neutral	it was great .
neutral	the shipping was expensive .
neutral	good service , email_updates so u know what is goin on with your phone .
neutral	gives u a fair price for it too
neutral	i ordered 0 cases of canned dogs food .
neutral	the amount of cans i received , from each case , that were damaged totalled 00 cans .
neutral	they were not damaged in shipping , as the cardboard_box they were shipped in , was not damaged at all .
neutral	i do have to say that when i called customer_service they were apologetic and did send me replaced cans , although they wouldn_'_t break open a case .
neutral	so i had to choose which flavor had the most damaged_cans to replace .
neutral	i '_ll think_twice before ordering from them again .
neutral	i was disappointed with the service because the website advertised fast delivery and i didn_'_t receive my package till over a week_later .
neutral	i have no issue with mattress ordered , in fact i sleep better now than on the previous memory system , i marked it down to 0_star due to the delivery .
neutral	the company who delivered were 0 days late and blatantly lied about a failed delivery , when i spoke to the delivery person their who_cares attitude means unfortunately i can '_t recommend you use this company , shame as the mattress is brilliant
neutral	i could not order on line .
neutral	i had to call to place my order .
neutral	i used to love boohoo but lately i '_ve been let_down , quality of clothing and delivery has poor !
neutral	really disappointed and annoying because they used to be great .
neutral	i was completely_satisfied everything concerning the actual rental , car and return .
neutral	i need an explantion .
neutral	when i returned home i received an_additional invoice in the amount of $_00 . 00 us dollars .
neutral	one of the charges was listed as after hours .
neutral	i picked_up the car at 0 :_00pm and dropped the car off at 00 : 00 am where is the late charge ......
neutral	drop_off went well , very polite driver even_though i went into the wrong area at southampton airport ( not very clearly signed ) and the driver had to help me get out of the barrier .
neutral	collection was an_issue .
neutral	i rang but the number provided said the phone was switched off !
neutral	i rang 0 or 0 times .
neutral	rang the central res number and they had an_automated recording saying they were too busy to take my call and to email them instead !
neutral	eventually central res answered ( about 00_mins after arrival ) and they looked into where my car was .
neutral	they said the driver was waiting for me in the drop_off zone - however i had made my way to there while waiting a call back , and noone was there !
neutral	driver eventually arrived and very apologetic .
neutral	after that , something strange happened .
neutral	whilst setting_up my sat_nav to go home a destination was still live ( watford ?)
neutral	i have never been there and it wasnt programmed in when i dropped the car off .?
neutral	unfortunately i didnt take a mileage reading before i left it , but watford was a 00 mile_round_trip from the airport ?
neutral	i am also now wondering where my car was kept overnight ?
neutral	a friend of mine commented they knew a driver ( for another company ) that regulary took customer cars home and parked it there if a short stay !!
neutral	i have yet to get to the bottom of this .
neutral	we were told that the car_rental station in florence , italy was " next to the airport , and an easy walk ".
neutral	this was not true , and since we were returning the car at 0 : 00 a . m ., which we told you , we were in mortal danger .
neutral	fortunately we were able to contact a taxi and at a cost of 00_euro ( plus tip ) we made it to the airport safely .
neutral	we were disappointed in this misinformation from an otherwise satisfactory vendor .
neutral	i love the idea of buying gift codes at a discount but it is extremely annoying that gift_cards makes me wait so long before making the code available to use in that way [_external reference_] is a lot better !
neutral	so_far so good
neutral	im not sure if im going to continue shopping delivery is good some clothes be nice but my zipper was broke on my jacket
neutral	amazing products with great prices !
neutral	i would go with pet_flow for all my pet '_s needs !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered and shipper did not leave at the right address !
neutral	i ordered another oil pan on a saturday tried to cancel on sunday and was unable to .
neutral	not happy with parts_geek response .
neutral	" refuse shipment ."
neutral	well i live 0000 ' off the road usually i '_m out in the back forty plowing or taking_care of the farm , can '_t chase down ups or fed exp which require a signature to refuse .
neutral	still have not rec ' d refund !
neutral	i was presented with a choice of 0 types of tires .
neutral	with explanations of features , pro and cons .
neutral	i choose the tire in the middle in terms of price .
neutral	job was done in a little_bit more than an_hour .
neutral	update_: downgraded from 0_stars to 0 because of the following matter : i was charged for full wheel_alignment in the way that kind of tricked me into it .
neutral	sales_person charged me $_00 for the full wheel_alignment stating that computer showed that front wheels were not aligned properly .
neutral	but when i called back later to clarify why they did not mentioned free front_wheel_alignment and did not explained the difference_between front and full alignments they refunded me for the $_00 .
neutral	so i am happy that they quickly resolved a conflict , but will remember that they do try to sell you add - ons .
neutral	a mediocre visit to the bletchley garage booked in for a half price service which seemed to attract half the attention .
neutral	i can see how an absent service book can be annoying but i could answer all the questions and to be on the receiving end of two brunt conversations was unnecessary .
neutral	i had telephoned before the visit and upon_arrival mentioned that the exhaust was blowing however no mention has_been made about the exhaust .
neutral	having used this garage before and not been entirely_satisfied i was tempted back by the offer but in future a garage that seems a little less annoyed by their customers will be further up my list .
neutral	it seemed impossible to find the natural_balance venison & sweet_potato as i used to so found it at another site .
neutral	i had been so happy with you , i was sad to move .
neutral	would like to come_back .
neutral	sdthomps00 @ comcast . net
neutral	this was a really cute shirt but so small i couldn_'_t get both arms in - and this was a large !
neutral	so bigger people be warned .
neutral	this was a very expensive purchase for me , and the quality was just okay .
neutral	the tuna was not good , the halibut was good .
neutral	costco sells fish just as good for a lot less money .
neutral	well , the customer_service was iffy .
neutral	the people helping were friendly but didnt really understand how to do their job .
neutral	we found an online special through sparefoot that had a 0x0 for $_00 dollars a month and they initially charged and made out the contract for $_00 a month .
neutral	after about an_hour of dancing around on getting the amount and specials correct it was sorted_out .
neutral	later that evening we went to drop our belongings into our newly acquired storage_facility and the dimensions were not accurate .
neutral	instead of 0x0 the storage_unit was 0x0 .
neutral	we would complain but we had such a good deal to began with through the 00_%_off offer that we dont want to potentially ruin the deal we do have .
neutral	so now we feel trapped .
neutral	overall i would suggest sparefoot but not the mini - u - storage_facility to another friend
neutral	the lamp is lovely , but the main problem i always have with made is that after you '_ve bought your stylish new objet , there '_s no follow_up email to say when the delivery will be made , so you ' re left in limbo .
neutral	and things take a while to arrive , so you have to chase , particularly if you need to know so you can arrange to be there when the item arrives ...
neutral	the first time i went to buy the supps i had trouble paying , it just wouldn_'_t accept my card details .
neutral	i kept trying , to no_avail , and i couldn_'_t speak to anyone because they don_'_t have a help desk at the weekend , which was a bit unhelpful .
neutral	tried again during the week and it all went through fine , supps arrived quickly , all very smooth .
neutral	i still have not received my order .
neutral	what is the status of my order ?
neutral	just placed the order and everything went_smoothly
neutral	i have had numerous problems with my yahoo email and it never seems to be fixed
neutral	very frustrating to use and get photos how and where you want them
neutral	ya ok so i order on line a plant for my sister bd and fill_out your list of who was picking the plant up and when the person on that order came they lost the order for long time ' and turned_out they found it under the buyers name go figer er ...
neutral	i received the contacts really fast within a week of ordering .
neutral	the only problem was that i accidentally ordered the wrong script for one eye .
neutral	i called the customer_service # within an hr of ordering .
neutral	i left my receipt # and cell and no call back :-( now i have to go through the whole_process of sending back one of the cases of the contacts which is going to be inconvient .
neutral	i did like that i didn_'_t have to verify the script by providing my eye_doctor '_s info like most other contact_lens websites .
neutral	have order real leather bean_bag , looks like faux_leather to me , for that kind of money
neutral	given that standard delivery is up to 00 days and most tanks have locks on them , an accurate delivery date should be notified in advance , followed_up with a reminder to ensure the customer is in ; this could be done either by telephone_call or email .
neutral	by writing a review of your latest shopping_experience , you help others decide where to shop .
neutral	it '_s that easy .
neutral	log on now to spread the word .
neutral	the frames were supposed to be dark_brown but , they were more like a light brown color .
neutral	the part of the frame that '_s already pre_- bended to curl around the ear needs to be bent down more so they don_'_t slide off my face .
neutral	tracking was fine but tyre delivered whilst out of house .
neutral	left in full view of main through road with no delivery note or reference from carrier .
neutral	very poor because we are on the route for travellers to the appleby gipsy fair and a new tyre could prove tempting to any passer by .
neutral	tyre is excellent but may think_twice about re orders due to the delivery .
neutral	i was waiting for a particular nokia phone but initially couldn_'_t get a response as to when they expected to have it in , pure fluke that i looked one day when they had it in stock and was received promptly after ordering , phone seem fine , only issue being that the instruction book is in spanish
neutral	glasses does not seem to be perfectly focused on my eyes .
neutral	had to return them the first time , waited for month and new pair still doesn_'_t seem to fit right .
neutral	wrong flea_treatment sent .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t checked the shipment my dog would not have received the right amount to keep him protected .
neutral	after calling , the right dosage is being shipped but my dog is unprotected until it arrives .
neutral	i bought these for my daughter but i think they may be too hot for her to use !
neutral	there seems to be no way to use them with out risking burning yourself !
neutral	hopefully practice makes perfect !
neutral	i was under the impression what i was ordering was the full part but after i got the part i realized that the top came separately .
neutral	it '_s like buying a tupperwead container with out the top it was my fault i guess for a summing that but maybe you could be more specific in writing only bottom not top .
neutral	i still have not received my order .
neutral	hopefully it will arrive today !
neutral	when i first ordered the book from bookbyte i received an_email the next_day saying that the seller had already sold the book and that my credit_card was not charged .
neutral	i was confused that it would even allow me to order it when it wasn_'_t available .
neutral	because i was on a time_crunch for getting the book i was disappointing that a day was wasted that it could have been in processing .
neutral	i then ordered the same book from a different seller on bookbyte .
neutral	i later received an_email_stating that they were not 000_% sure on the title of the book i wanted .
neutral	i emailed back with the title , which then the book was quickly shipped .
neutral	i am confused why bookbyte did not know what book i ordered when i knew_exactly_what book i ordered when it showed and described it to me upon checkout .
neutral	aside from the ordering issues , shipping was fast and the book came in great condition .
neutral	yes i found the website a pleasure to book with .
neutral	easy and clear .
neutral	however , the final price the hotel charged me was £_00 more than i was expecting .
neutral	easy to book quoted 000_euro and the hotel charged £_000 !
neutral	i don_'_t know who '_s fault it is but i am now struggling to get a solution to the problem .
neutral	there is no where to get in touch with easytobook , you have to contact the hotel .
neutral	i am still_waiting ...
neutral	i guess it wasn_'_t so easy after all ...
neutral	why is it that a free service shows my correct credit info , but you do not ?
neutral	you are still showing accounts that have been removed by the credit_bureaus .
neutral	.
neutral	product was what was described , but shipping was terrible !
neutral	partsgeek did not put the full shipping address on the label , so there was a delay in delivering .
neutral	it took 0 extra days to finally get things straightened_out and then delivered .
neutral	we ended_up having to call fedex with the full address so we could get it .
neutral	we were very disappointed .
neutral	not sure we will order from partsgeek again .
neutral	i was really disappointed with the quality of the merchandise
neutral	in all fairness , we rent cars through_travelocity all the time and this never happened before , but this is the first time i chose a dollar rental_car .
neutral	when we got to the counter we were told there was an $_00 / day add ' l fee to add me as a driver , in addition to my husband ( we both need to be drivers )
neutral	for an almost 00 day rental , it was a lot , and we were really upset .
neutral	this never happened on alamo or national or some others .
neutral	otherwise i do like to use travelocity for my car_rentals especially !
neutral	need more customer_service reps .
neutral	i returned the goods to you on the 00th feb but to date ( 00th .
neutral	feb ) have not received acknowledgement of return of goods or a refund .
neutral	they provided the products within two working days and did what they said they would .
neutral	their website is easy to use but their low headline product price is recouped by very expensive delivery charges .
neutral	after using their service you will get spammed every_single day for evermore with marketing emails .
neutral	oil arrived on time - we were out .
neutral	after fill up boiler refused to light .
neutral	after banging tank and pipes eventually went .
neutral	i wonder_if driver used correct filling procedure for our tank ( insructions clearly_displayed on tank ) i have never had this problem before
neutral	this is the second time i ordered and was disappointed in the quality of product this past order .
neutral	the 0 inch bully_sticks were so small and skinny compared to my first delivery .
neutral	the pork pizzles were not all consistent in size -- some were so thin and skimpy , some were great .
neutral	i also didn_'_t like how the products were just thrown in a box with paper .
neutral	the items that are not seal wrapped already should at_least be placed in a ziplock bag prior to going in the box .
neutral	otherwise , prices for treats are good .
neutral	the only way i would order again is if the products were a good size like my first delivery .
neutral	the scan in process works well but after that initial contact the procedure slows considerably .
neutral	i did have to contact customer_service over the payment .
neutral	in all from start to finish was just shy of 0_weeks !
neutral	maybe need to see how speedily and efficiently the gold / silver companies manage their services of which i have used .
neutral	by comparison magpie is cumbersome and painfully_slow .
neutral	their online tracking actually tells you very little and in my case was misleading re form of payment hence my calling them .
neutral	sorry adequate but could do better !
neutral	the flights were completely fine except on the return flight when my family and i were " bumped " off the flight temporarily because they overbooked .
neutral	overbooking is so rude and inconsiderate .
neutral	luckily they weren_'_t even aware of all the available seats and we got on the flight but then our_luggage somehow got to madison earlier_than us and wasn_'_t on the belt so there was some searching around .
neutral	the prices are great and the website is setup well , however for it to take as long as it did from new jersy to fl ; was pathetic .
neutral	i always expect ridiculous delivery times by fedex .
neutral	should switch to ups .
neutral	i ordered something the same day which was shipped from ca and got in literally half the time and the shipping was free in 00 or more or otherwise some nominal cost .
neutral	it needs to be clearer on the order page that for next_day delivery you need to order by 0pm .
neutral	this information is only available if you follow the specific link about delivery .
neutral	i ordered my item at 0 . 00pm on a thursday so it did not arrive until the monday .
neutral	i think it only fair that for a delivery charge over_£ 0 this delivery info is made clearer on the order page .
neutral	the gentleman in customer_service was rude and let what would have otherwise been , a good service down .
neutral	really it would have been better to have stayed at several hotels and circled around dublin but there is so much to do in dublin you could spend the whole vacation there .
neutral	the hotel was clean and within walking_distance from a lot but the staff was snooty and not to helpful .
neutral	the hotel seems to cater toward business people not travelers .
neutral	having placed my details on line and completed the paper_work parcel was collected the next_day all good so_far . i then recieved an e_- mail asking for extra payment as the dimensions i had given were incorrect as the dimensions are clearly shown in big numbers on the box i disputed this and refused to pay .
neutral	parcel_hero in fairness were quick to respond and the extra payment waivered . i have never sent a parcel to my daughter in oz and had it delivered so quickley .
neutral	box was bent , no invoice and thank_god it made it in one piece .
neutral	feel it was not very professional .
neutral	i was happy to use flight_centre again , and they were really quick and thorough with their response to me enquiry .
neutral	prices did go up , which was a slight inconvenience .
neutral	though the sales_person was very apologetic which was appreciated .
neutral	my main grievance with flight_centre was when we missed a connecting_flight ( due to being held up by customs with a carnet ) in mexico city .
neutral	i needed clarification of how i could get in contact with delta ... as there was nobody at their desk .
neutral	i called flight_centre in the uk and was told that my flight had been cancelled anyway ...
neutral	this information was incorrect .
neutral	and didn_'_t help when i was trying to negotiate new flights .
neutral	consequently i had to buy new flights .
neutral	i love shopping with 00dollarmall but the shipping is a little over the top .
neutral	they did have shipping lower then they raised it .
neutral	i also don_'_t like some of the descriptions of the clothing .
neutral	some could be in more detail .
neutral	i also referred a couple of friends and never got my 00_dollar reward .
neutral	other then that i love the site and the new products that are updated frequently .
neutral	sorry i haven_'_t used the ink_cartridge yet , however i '_m due to use it very soon .
neutral	i can give you my opinion at a later date .
neutral	because rating question is required , it '_s acceptable for now .
neutral	i got my order in a little later then i expected but not extreamly late so that was fine , but the badge holders i ordered were not exactly_what they were on the website , i called to try and work out what happened and jake ex 000 was very nice but i could not get an exact answer on why the ones i received did not have the two hole clip like in the picture .
neutral	so there fore i could not use the lanyards i bought with them .
neutral	he said he could send me a slip to return them and re order something_else so i had the hang up and look because i was away from my computer .
neutral	my concern is that the other holders were quite a bit more_expensive without the clip ???
neutral	anyway i went to call back and had to leave a message tried to call back again again no answer and i tried again and it was closed .
neutral	no call back yet but perhaps next week ?
neutral	?
neutral	i placed an order for 0 necklaces as christmas_gifts a month_ago but never received a confirmation_email .
neutral	although they still charged me !
neutral	i sent an_email to the customer_service department but no word from them .
neutral	i had to include my customer_service ticket number in this review rather_than my confirmation number since i never got one !
neutral	i '_m praying that i can still get my order before christmas !
neutral	but i have a bad feeling about this website .
neutral	booking online isn_'_t so simple it seemed that i didn_'_t have enough time to type my information before submitting and getting an_error saying the flight was no_longer available .
neutral	i tried about 0 - 0x booking online with the same error of the flight no_longer available .
neutral	they should give more time to allow you to plug in the travelers information .
neutral	after i given up trying to book online i called and was immediately assisted with a very friendly employee .
neutral	i would suggest booking over the phone over booking online .
neutral	i normally like to read my itinerary before submitting it so booking over the phone wasn_'_t ideal .
neutral	we got to the hotel around 0 on a friday_evening .
neutral	it was difficult to find the lobby as there was a lot of construction going on .
neutral	there was one sign and an arrow , but after that we had to wing it .
neutral	finally after about 00_minutes driving around we found it .
neutral	walking in the lobby was nice , but there was a long line .
neutral	after about 00_minutes we finally got to the counter .
neutral	we got our room and instructions to our building .
neutral	when we got to our room we discovered it was 0 beds instead of a king as we had requested .
neutral	i tried to call the front_desk several_times , but was hung_up on each time .
neutral	i gave up and decided to go get dinner .
neutral	when we got back to our room later that night we discovered that the heater wasn_'_t working .
neutral	i again tried to call the front_desk , only to be hung_up on again .
neutral	we went to the front_desk and told them about it and they didn_'_t seem at all concerned that i was hung_up on .
neutral	they asked if we wanted them to send someone out to look at the heat , i said no , it '_s 00pm and i would like to go to sleep .
neutral	they changed our room and sent us on our way .
neutral	they didn_'_t offer to help or send someone to move our things .
neutral	we got to our second room only to find it was once again two small beds .
neutral	i didn_'_t complain again as i figured it was pointless .
neutral	the next_morning we got up and headed out .
neutral	if it weren_'_t for having a non_- refundable room , i definitely would have checked out and went to another hotel .
neutral	still_waiting for the return_slip , had to send two emails , so_far and yet nothing .
neutral	they were good at sending , not good at returning ...
neutral	only ordered one plaque , black with gold engraving .
neutral	the size was correct , the lettering beautiful , but the black paint was chipped on the edges at several points .
neutral	had to use a sharpie to clean it up .
neutral	i reserved parking for may for 0 cars .
neutral	somehow i got charged for 0 cars .
neutral	i immediately emailed and called them to inform them of the mistake , but so_far it has not been resolved .
neutral	it has only been 00_hours so i '_m waiting to decide if my experience is good or bad .
neutral	the pens came out fine , i just started_using one myself and noticed that it leaves little ink leaks when i '_m writing , certainly not a great way to impress people that i '_m giving these pens to .
neutral	ordering tyres on line and having someone come to fit them is a great idea , but the service let it down .
neutral	i booked a fitting slot between 0 . 00am and 0pm and this was confirmed within minutes by telephone after the online booking .
neutral	unfortunately the fitter was not quite as quick to use his telephone to tell me that he wouldn_'_t be there by 0pm .
neutral	having heard_nothing , at five past one i called the booking centre who said they would have someone phone me .
neutral	twenty_five_minutes later the fitter called to tell me he would be 00_minutes .
neutral	a full hour later he appeared - by now almost one and a half hours after the booking slot expired .
neutral	once here he was courteous and quick .
neutral	i might use the service again but i '_ll probably check if anyone_else is offering it .
neutral	really quick delivery , unfortunately the colour was alot darker than it appeared ( light_grey / very dark_grey ) and the bikini bottoms were to big so i had to return it .
neutral	i called simply_beach and requested to return by " collect " they said they would send an_email with an attachment so that i could use this service and took my number to call if they had any_problems with sending the email .
neutral	0 days on no email no phone_call so i returned using special delivery at post officewhich cost £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	still_waiting for refund .
neutral	not had the need yet to claim but have used for several_years .
neutral	renewing this year was annoying as the system would not do it automatically and then i had problem with my password being accepted .
neutral	at the end it then came through in my husbands name for some_reason though not a problem .
neutral	many options , excellent service .
neutral	i love their clothes but wish this time they hadn_'_t sent me 0 of the same dress and didn_'_t send me another one i had ordered .
neutral	hope they sort it out !
neutral	when i saw that you were offering a 00_%_discount with no coupon needed ..
neutral	i immediately placed my order for stella n chewy products that i would not have purchased without the discount because of expense .
neutral	i waited for my total to show the 00_%_discount .. but after_placing my order .. there was no discount .
neutral	i finally went back to read the small_print .. urgh .
neutral	this was a great dissapointment to me .
neutral	i feel_like i got taken .
neutral	it would be great if you would begin sending purchasers a " shipment notification " on when their order has actually shipped .
neutral	your website does not provide this information per the invoice number entered .
neutral	it should not matter_how the order is shipped , this should be done by your company and not left to ups and fedex , if that '_s the requested shipping method .
neutral	this is a " good business " process .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	i '_ve always found this a good website and very helpful .
neutral	not such a good experience this time though - one of the products i wanted was out of stock , and it was put on ' stockwatch ', so i should have had an e_- mail when it came in .
neutral	time went by with no e_- mail , and i eventually checked the website and found that the product was available .
neutral	i oredered it and it came a few_days ago - all very acceptable and no_problems there .
neutral	today i '_ve had an e_- mail saying that my order has_been dispatched !
neutral	so there seems to be a bit of a disconnect there .
neutral	really satisfied with the quick delivery of the items , however , when we sent them back because they didn_'_t fit it took over three_weeks to get a confirmation_email and then another week before the refund , meaning a total of four weeks !
neutral	i love the shoes but don_'_t like the stipulations for free_shipping over $_00 .
neutral	it should be free_shipping over $_00 period .
neutral	i wanted to buy more than 0 clearance shoes and the free_shipping didn_'_t apply even if i spent over $_00 .
neutral	i ended_up buying 0 shoes and paying $_00 for shipping .
neutral	don_'_t think i '_ll be shopping at this site anymore .
neutral	i started with the program a few_months_ago .
neutral	i have had no contact unless i have called them .
neutral	no_idea what is going on with my accounts if anything has_been settled with my creditors .
neutral	not so happy at this point .
neutral	i happened to call one day and they needed to clarify my credit_card numbers and no none had attemped to call me at home or on my cell no email .
neutral	need a personal relationship when you are trying to clean up your credit up .
neutral	thanks so much
neutral	jennifer clayton
neutral	claytontaz000 @_yahoo . com
neutral	the order arrived very quickly thanks
neutral	but i found it nowhere_near as wonderful a product as touted by matt_monarch
neutral	the sugar doesn_'_t have the same taste as cane sugar and i think probably is half the sweetness . this is how it appeared when sweetening raw 000_% chocolate
neutral	so it translates into a very expensive product
neutral	we never have been charge on our card before we stayed at the hotel we were surprised to see our card had already been charge before we even started our trip .
neutral	always before when we used other company '_s they never charged us until we left the hotel , used our card to save the reservation
neutral	i '_ve been shopping with yesstyle . com since 0000 and love it .
neutral	if you are looking for unique , trendy , and affordable fashion yesstyle . com is the place to shop .
neutral	it always feels great saving a few_bucks with the elite club too !
neutral	however , not all items are in stock so the shipping can take some time .
neutral	it typically takes 00 - 00 days for me to receive items .
neutral	always make_sure to check measurement sizes and fabric material in description !
neutral	photos can be deceiving sometimes .
neutral	basically , shop smart on yesstyle . com and you will be a happy customer .
neutral	:)
neutral	i order my pets supplies and needs over the internet .
neutral	i have to say they are fast on delivery .
neutral	although the customer_service department does not know what the left hand is doing to the right hand .
neutral	meaning .... they are completely clueless as to the status of orders , full fulfillment , shipping .
neutral	my order was shipped in several shipments .
neutral	no_indication on invoices partial shipment , no_indication of order being completed .
neutral	called to check on when order would be received on the missing items and they said the order had not even been processed .
neutral	the minute i got off the phone the door_bell would ring and there would be the order or the rest of the missing ordered items .
neutral	petsmart needs to train their shipping department .
neutral	i ordered my pet_supplies and they put 00_pounds in one flimsy box .
neutral	they did not break up the order to separate the weight .
neutral	products were damaged in shipping and loss of product was missing .
neutral	i '_m surprised ups accepted the package in it '_s un - stable state .
neutral	i won_'_t be order from them anymore .
neutral	i would suggest dropping spirit_airlines from your program .
neutral	they are a bait and switch company , citing one price at point of sale , then tacking on multitudes of hidden_fees that drive up the fare at point of service .
neutral	while travelicity as a whole provides a consistent and reliable product , it '_s affiliation with this airline is suspect because consumers cannot appropriately compare spirit pricing to other airlines .
neutral	from the minute we ordered our new wahing machine appliance_online kept us informed by text , email and phone_call of the progress of our delivery .
neutral	compared to other_companies they are very good and value for money .
neutral	the only_downside was when our machine was delivered the driver refused to unpack it so it could get through our kitchen door .
neutral	we were left with the machine in the middle of our sitting room , he also refused to take the packaging away so we had to unpack and move the machine into our kitchen . then dispose of all the packaging .
neutral	not very happy with this at all .
neutral	i hope to be happy with my new glasses , but first i had to wait weeks for the frames to be back ordered , then they sent single focus instead of progressives so i had to return to have that corrected .
neutral	granted , i accidentally clicked the wrong box on the order form , but i had filled in the prescription and it was clearly a progressive prescription , and i sent a copy of my original prescription .
neutral	so there were two rights and one wrong and the wrong is what they paid attention to .
neutral	they were very prompt and accommodating about the return ( and no wonder the glasses were so inexpensive !
neutral	i had to pay the difference for progressives ), but i have now been waiting six_weeks for my glasses , and they are not due to arrive for another four days .
neutral	i '_m not sure the cost makes up for the inconvenience .
neutral	shipping should be based on weight .
neutral	the staff is awesome !!!
neutral	the building is really nice !!
neutral	i just think the price is to much .
neutral	we are paying 00 $ for a really small spot .
neutral	you can barley fit anything in the area .
neutral	so i think way over priced but it '_s like that every where you go .
neutral	ordered on dec 0th , rec ' d confirmation order was processing and i would receive email notification when order was shipped .
neutral	never rec ' d " order was shipped " email .
neutral	rec ' d gift_card in the mail today , dec_00th .
neutral	seems a bit_slow in comparison to amazon .
neutral	quality and professional look of the labels that i purchased were beautiful but way smaller_than i expected to pay for the price !
neutral	really fast service and good value for money , but the sizing seems really strange .
neutral	the trousers of 0 - 0 years were massive on my just turned 0 year_old so he will just have to wait to grow into them which is a great shame .
neutral	the material on the waistcoats was a shinny velvet which looked quite cheap , the items did not sit right and looked as though they had not been cut / sewn correctly .
neutral	one of the bow_ties ripped as soon as it was put on .
neutral	items arrived_promptly , returns were easy and refund process quick
neutral	we chose the personal red_tour as_opposed to the prerecorded blue tour .
neutral	not being from the uk , because the accents of the two tour_guides we used were so broad , we could only understand half of what was being said .
neutral	were we to do it again , we would take the prerecorded tour .
neutral	there was so much we missed .
neutral	short of that , we loved the bus_tour .
neutral	items arrived quickly .
neutral	the cover on one of the jars of cream was smashed and
neutral	much of the cream was all over the place .
neutral	there is no number to call any
neutral	where that i could find .
neutral	other than that , the other items were fine after i
neutral	wiped all the cream off .
neutral	i was impressed with the site , it was a quick and easy transaction .
neutral	i was also very impressed by the courier service , quick and easy for me as i didn_'_t have to package it or pay for it to be sent off .
neutral	i had great communication from them too , however was slightly dissapointed that i only received payment 0 days after my item being received by them even_though i had been advised of a ' guarenteed 00hour payment ' and reading such good reviews without a single bad word about the company , only until i contacted them was i informed my payment would be received the next_day
neutral	we ordered both nettings and made to measure curtains for the lounge bay_window .
neutral	the netting is superb ; lovely and white , subtle pattern and beautifully_finished .
neutral	unfortunately , the curtains are a different matter .
neutral	there is a stain on the side of one of the curtains along with a couple of ' pulls ' in two of the patterns - all three are clearly_visible when the sun shines .
neutral	very dissapointed by the qualityof the curtains .
neutral	i have been using paypal for years and for the most part it has_been ok .
neutral	there have been a few instances_where i have had issues .
neutral	one of the biggest concerns is if you have the paypal debit_card as they are quick to lock up the card if they think there is a lot of activity and if you need a new card it can take 0_weeks to get to you .
neutral	overall , it is not a horrible service , but i think it could use a lot of work .
neutral	i '_m not questioning the products because it gives a great selection that america does not have , which is why i love shopping at yesstyle .
neutral	i ordered from yesstyle once before and the package came really fast , within a month so i '_m excited as to how fast my new order will come with express shipping .
neutral	the only bad side , i don_'_t know if other shoppers are having the same problem , is that the website is very , very slow at processing .
neutral	i especially don_'_t like the part when i want to add different_colors or sizes of the same product to my bag , the page has to reload itself each time .
neutral	the website is constantly freezing and even if i keep reloading , it still is responding in the same manner .
neutral	i figured that maybe it is my problem with my internet speed , knowing that using it at night slows_down a bit .
neutral	but even in the morning as i was ordering , just editing my personal shipping information took ten_minutes to complete , not including that the page froze on me twice !
neutral	i '_m not having these issues with any other website at all .
neutral	overall , i can tolerate with this issue i '_m having and will be ordering more soon , so please fix this yesstyle !
neutral	i give 0_stars for selection , shipping , customer_support , etc .
neutral	but i give 0_star for technical website functioning .
neutral	the product / book i ordered was exactly_what i needed , and was for over $_00 cheaper_than what the rest of my classmates paid .
neutral	i am very happy about the good deal and my product .
neutral	the only_thing i wasn_'_t happy about was the shipping .
neutral	i understand that once bookbyte ships their product , it is out of their hands and they cannot be blamed for any late deliveries , etc .
neutral	so , i do not put full responsibility on bookbyte , though i was very displeased with this .
neutral	my order wasn_'_t processed and shipped for about 0 business days , which i think is a bit long .
neutral	i ordered it so that even if the shipping took 00 days ( the longest predicted ), i would still have 0 days cushion time before i needed the book .
neutral	however , my book arrived the day right before i needed it .
neutral	i '_m glad it wasn_'_t late , but i was so nervous it wouldn_'_t arrive .
neutral	shipping was fast .
neutral	the beggin strips seem old they were not as moist as i usually get at the local_store , and i thought the puppy_food would better smaller bites .
neutral	i have to break them in order for my puppy to eat them .
neutral	i don_'_t consider that petflow '_s fault on the puppy_food and i thought the prices are reasonable .
neutral	very few models with sleeves .
neutral	did not want jacket .
neutral	stands to reason plus - sized women may not have arms suitable for strapless gowns .
neutral	when the delivery finally came it was just tuesday this week .
neutral	what i ordered was out of stock and i waited 0_weeks and still it did not come in so i had to change my order .
neutral	not very happy because i have 0 cats and i needed the liter and i had to go to petsmart and buy some .
neutral	i had to call them because the shipping company left my package in the pouring_rain and set it in the mud !
neutral	the toy they sent me did not have a working " squeaker " inside of it , they said they would ship another one , so_far , we have not received it .
neutral	down_side is be prepared to pay an unrealistic amount for postage to moray in scotland which is mainland_uk and not the the highlands with no roads .
neutral	no water to cross or even a bridge !!
neutral	mainland !!
neutral	!
neutral	we liked netflix at first - but geez , some of the movies we have to order and wait for are older and should be instant streaming !
neutral	great site if you are going back in time and catching all those mediocre movies you somehow missed , but really -- it '_s so irritating to get to the end of a tv series and still be 0 - 0 seasons behind .
neutral	seriously ?!
neutral	get current , please - and your prices are going up , which is ridiculous .
neutral	get real or get out of the game is my advice .
neutral	you started out great but now it '_s just so - so .
neutral	hulu beats you guys , hands_down .
neutral	i used airbnb to book a place in puerto_rico -- i loved the site - could not believe_how many places it featured all over the world and their site is amazing !
neutral	so easy to use and just really awesome .
neutral	i bookmarked it and then sat_down and began dreaming .
neutral	i found such cool places in some pretty obscure spots of the world - again , amazing !
neutral	ok , so i booked an accomodation thru them .
neutral	paid a pretty high ($_00 ) fee to them also .
neutral	but i was ok with that , thinking they take_care of everything .
neutral	they deal with the host and act as liaison - you do nothing but book and relax , right ?
neutral	not !
neutral	i booked but had to cancel one night because it was over a holiday_weekend and i was told ( rightly so ) that there would be no transportation running anywhere on a sunday so i sat tight for another night where i was booked and canceled that night with the other place .
neutral	no problem - i ' d given plenty of advance_notice and since the hostel did not know at all what to do or how to refund me that money ($_00 , nothing to sneeze at ), i tried_calling airbnb to deal with it .
neutral	waited 0 minutes on hold .
neutral	called back a little_bit later -- waited 0 minutes on hold .
neutral	called their ' urgent ' line and waited 0 minutes before hanging up .
neutral	i got to the hostel on monday and nobody there knew what to do -- it '_s run by drugged - out kids , so not sure what i expected !
neutral	they said they ' d have to talk to the hostel owner - turns_out , he had no_clue what to do and said he was probably going to be dropping airbnb soon anyways .
neutral	greaaaaat .
neutral	ok , so on tuesday , i called and again was put on hold -- please change that godawful music , btw !
neutral	and i called back and hit the ' urgent ' line and waited a few_minutes more and got an actual live_person !
neutral	she said she ' d change my reservation to reflect 0 nights instead of 0 and that the owner would have to go onto their site and click to accept this change and then airbnb would reimburse_me my money .
neutral	i talked to the owner - told him what airbnb said he must do .
neutral	a few_days_later , he emails me that he '_s been trying to do just that but not having any luck .
neutral	tried to call airbnb , no luck .
neutral	either way , here i am , over 0_weeks back home and still have not been reimbursed .
neutral	airbnb acts like they are the go - between and will take_care of any_problems , but they do not .
neutral	reaching them is maddening !
neutral	especially if you are calling at off hours .
neutral	their website gets an a from me .
neutral	the person i finally talked to on the phone gets an a from me just for being friendly and ' taking_care of the problem ' but see , the problem is still not taken_care of , is it ?
neutral	i want my money back .
neutral	will i use them again ?
neutral	no way in hell !
neutral	too much hassle .
neutral	i will use their site to find places and then i will contact those places myself -- or go back to couchsurfing .
neutral	the only_reason i left in the first place is because they got rid of the chat_function .
neutral	but i can get over that .
neutral	never had one problem surfing or being surfed .
neutral	so long , airbnb !
neutral	i have booked flights with travelocity several_times , but this is the first time that i wasn_'_t seated with my traveling companion .
neutral	i had no advanced notice that this was the case , and it had been at_least ten_years since my husband had last flown .
neutral	he wasn_'_t very happy to be seated several rows behind me .
neutral	the flight was fully booked , so switching seats wasn_'_t an option .
neutral	we arrived_safely , so that is all that really mattered in the long run , but it was a long trip and would have been more enjoyable had we been seated together ( as we were on the return trip ).
neutral	blue_buffalo is the only food i get for my dog so i '_m happy i was able to get a great competitive price on it .
neutral	but i always have problems using fedex and that '_s what you use , so it was frustrating have to lug a 00lb_bag of dog_food into my apartment .
neutral	will probably purchase from you again though ~
neutral	had a prescription change , so was happy to know that opticontacts . com has a one year return_policy but was not happy to pay handling_fees on the reorder .
neutral	talked to a customer representative and was not helpful .
neutral	handling_fee charges seem like a ridiculous fee , seriously , moving a box of contacts cost $ 0 ?
neutral	every time i order something they come up iin different_sizes ... ordered a red maxi_dress definitely orange not red .. shame as some of the things are okay .
neutral	the sunglasses i ordered were terriblle quality gave them to my son as a toy as we ' re the tights which i sent back ...
neutral	for the most part amiclubwear has cute shoes ... you do have to order a size_bigger in my opinion .. also ake sure you examine your shoes well when they come in .
neutral	i have recieved heels with minor cuts or slits in them .. even a spot or two .. so beware , but usually customer_service will take_care of it .
neutral	so me and my fiance went to get our first car we were first helped by sheli she was nice but she wasn_'_t into it u could feel that she would rathet be somewhere_else .
neutral	towards the end she became a little rude .
neutral	then after 0 hours and being late for work we drove_off the lot only to find that the car had transmision problems .
neutral	when we returned we were helped by deshaun and he was awesome !
neutral	he was engaging and made it fun .
neutral	he carried real conversation . it wasn_'_t like he just trying to sell us a car .
neutral	i left extremely happy and wish deshaun would havehelped us first !
neutral	the service is very slow , and the shipping is so high !
neutral	i don_'_t understand_why it takes so long to receive these orders !
neutral	the only great think about this site are their discounts and the sales .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t received my email on my things !
neutral	when i purchased the card for my granddaughter '_s 00st_birthday on nov . 0th i fully expected to get the card by her_birthday on nov . 00th .
neutral	today is the 00th and i called and was told that the card went out on nov . 00th .
neutral	it must be coming via pony_express !
neutral	!
neutral	i was told very nonchalantly that it would take 0 to 00 days .
neutral	had i known that before i purchased the card i would have just gone to my local wal_mart and gotten one there .
neutral	i was going to buy at_least 0 more for christmas but i will shop elsewhere .
neutral	why are your credit_scores so vastly different from credit karma ??
neutral	also , why are transunion & equifax credit_scores always lower_than experian ??
neutral	i update my information with each of them every year & they ' re never the same .
neutral	high shipping cost
neutral	a bit disappointed with the product .
neutral	i purchased the cervical pillow to help with my neck_pain .
neutral	i got used to the pillow very quickly , by the third night , but i am disappointed that the filling is separating already .
neutral	perhaps a memory_foam one would be better .
neutral	i would like to stress however that the ordering process was simple and the delivery was excellent , i paid for the standard delivery and the product arrived the next_day .
neutral	i will use the site again for a different product
neutral	transmission filter pan gasket did not fit .
neutral	but why have you stop having natural_balance dry_dog_food in 0 lb .
neutral	bags .
neutral	i now have to buy it at petco .
neutral	i have 0 small dogs and it takes a month to use up a 0 lb .
neutral	bag .
neutral	a 00_lb_bag would take 0 or 0 months to use up and get stale .
neutral	no thanks .
neutral	as a driver , i '_ve had some bad and good experiences .
neutral	for the most part , the passengers have been great .
neutral	however , the rating_system kind of sucks .
neutral	there is a standard of 0 . 0_stars out of 0 .
neutral	this means that if you '_ve been rated a 0 ( which is still at a 00_% approval ), you ' re deactivated .
neutral	some of the passengers don_'_t understand the rating_system , so they just rate all over the place .
neutral	some of the ratings don_'_t even pertain to the actual driver , but the entire lyft system .
neutral	another not so cool thing is that the passengers are sometimes non_- drivers and non_- residents of the bay_area .
neutral	they become these great backseat passengers .
neutral	i '_m a little_bit bitter because of how rude a handful of the passengers have been toward me .
neutral	i honestly thought that lyft would carry through the philosophy , " a friend with a car ."
neutral	instead , i got the sense it was a modern - day slavery .
neutral	i am a woman of color , and most of my passengers have been white males telling_me what to do ( and what i '_ve been doing wrong .)
neutral	i understand that the 0 . 0 rating_system is to ensure a high_standard of service .
neutral	but it seems that the numbers are pretty arbitrary to most people anyway .
neutral	get my order wrong like wrong_colour or not sending the right amount of items
neutral	took longer_than they said to get here .
neutral	when installing the cartridges one of them began to leak .
neutral	my clubs aren_'_t here .
neutral	coukd be lost in the ups system .
neutral	stick ship did contact me when saw a shipping update saying one could be missing .
neutral	that was 0 days ago .
neutral	i called them the next_day to say 0 set arrived , but not the second set .
neutral	haven_'_t heard from anyone since then .
neutral	don_'_t know yet if i made a mistake in choosing ship_sticks .
neutral	what happens if they don_'_t arrive : am i covered for their cost by ship_sticks ?
neutral	waiting area adjacent to piles of new_tires .
neutral	needed to wait outside to avoid unpleasant odors and no seating area available .
neutral	although only waited about 00_minutes , even_though i was next in line , desk service poor .
neutral	phone interruptions and downright scattering of workers when they view someone entering store .
neutral	i have confronted them already on this issue .
neutral	people i work with have told me they do not use this store because of many issues .
neutral	when i first arrived at the rental location .
neutral	i was told that the car i rented on the internet was " changed ".
neutral	" some times " " that " happens .
neutral	the people at the counter where no help !
neutral	after going outside .
neutral	i spoke with damion .
neutral	he took_care of everything .
neutral	i '_m glad you hired him .
neutral	then on the return of the car .
neutral	a young_man name troy coming needs a raise and a pat on the back as well .
neutral	a true gentleman .
neutral	please give these_guys , these kind words , as i told them i would let you know how i was taken_care of very well .
neutral	if it were not for these two .
neutral	i would never do_business with this company again .
neutral	as to the paper pushers in the office , they were just_plain rude .
neutral	both_times !
neutral	when i saw the colour duckegg i asummed that the curtains would be blue but they are green , on other webcites for the colour duckegg its blue so very dissapointed . will not be ordering from this company again , the colours are not what you see and i should have got a sample first .
neutral	i was happy with the price of the book as it was used , and i was warned it may have some defects ... but the book i got was missing pages , taped together and had coffee stains all over it .
neutral	i don_'_t complain often , but this was just a bad book .
neutral	after booking and paying almost $_000 for my trip i received a confirmation_email at which point i was made aware of an_additional_$_00 fee that u will be responsible for , a resort_fee .
neutral	its helpful to know up front the total price .
neutral	it sounds like a bargain when u make the purchase but the hidden_fees proves that there really isn_'_t any bargains .
neutral	the part we ordered came with no instructions and needing an adaptor that was not mentioned nor on the original .
neutral	had to email and wait for response while car is broke_down .
neutral	if you at in a hurry or need your vehicle , i would recommend getting it somewhere so you can either talk to them face to face or over the phone .
neutral	order was shipped timely and should have arrived on friday by fedex ; however , this order was transferred to local post_office for delivery that took an_additional day to be delivered .
neutral	so while my parts sat in the post_office , my car sat in my garage another day to be repaired by my husband .
neutral	really don_'_t like this shared service with usps !
neutral	there is no disclosure before submitting an order that this service might be used .
neutral	should consider letting others know this could happen to them .
neutral	wished you would offer a separate option to avoid this shared service , would '_ve had my parts a day earlier and repaired before the usps delivered to our house on saturday .
neutral	no , we are not rural , as ups delivered a separate pkg the same day from a different company .
neutral	they sent me the wrong type of cat_food , so i emailed customer_service .
neutral	very speedy reply and they went_ahead and sent the correct item and gave_me a return postage link for returning the wrong product .
neutral	though it is worth_noting that it took me 00 business days to get the item that i ordered because of their mistake .
neutral	not sure i will chance buying food from them again .
neutral	bought a vibrator for £ 0 . 00 , when we received it it was unbelievabley loud that we just could not use it ... and lets just say .... it ruined our night !!
neutral	:( however i did get a full_refund once i cleaned the toy and returned it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!........
neutral	prob not the best thing to suggest a customer to do but hey !
neutral	i was very disappointed when i ordered the bone_shaped blinky lights for my 0 chihuahuas collars .
neutral	what i got was circle shaped and definitely not as pictures .
neutral	also my bully_sticks were loose and not wrapped at all .
neutral	i threw them away since i could not determine if they were sanitary or not .
neutral	plus they really stunk !
neutral	my advice is to let the customer know if a substitute is going to happen and that the bully_sticks are shipped unwrapped .
neutral	i probably_won_'_t order from pet_flow again because my first experience was so below par .
neutral	the only acceptable thing was the blue_buffalo treats .
neutral	the shipment could have been a couple days earlier too had it not had to transfer to another carrier .
neutral	overall lack of filling order as_advertised has left me with a basically negative experience .
neutral	keeps crashing my computer & made it run slower also skype keeps crashing mid way through a hat , but has its uses when it works its could ,
neutral	i paid for second day delivery but my merchandise was shipped regular ground ( approx five days ).
neutral	i sent an e_- mail to this effect and received notification that credit would be applied to my account .
neutral	still have not received medication , so cannot honestly evaluate
neutral	the item will be returned because although the site states one size ... it is not a usa size .
neutral	there is no size_chart for footwear on the site , thus , the sole purpose of returning the item .
neutral	i know i could potentially come off sounding like a spoiled american but , honestly , in this age of internet shopping i do expect a little more from a company .
neutral	i mistakenly ordered the wrong_size of birkenstocks , the conversion from us --> euro --> uk got the better of me and i know if i ' d paid more attention i wouldn_'_t be in this mess in the first place .
neutral	with that said , i needed to exchange the sandals for the proper size but was told that i would need to return them and then purchase them again .
neutral	no big deal except that they were not willing to budge at all on the shipping fees .
neutral	with the return shipping plus the whole_transaction over again my $_00 purchase was turning into $_00 and i wasn_'_t thrilled about it .
neutral	ultimately i just really wish they would have been willing to work with me on either the return shipping or the shipping of a new pair ; so i opted not to buy a new pair .
neutral	so glad i spent $_00 to try on a pair of birkenstocks ?
neutral	=/
neutral	not having rented any type of storage_units before we focused more on size , location , temperature controlled , parking and price more then lighting combined with some of the other items listed .
neutral	as the only overhead lighting was that filtering in from the hallway if there '_s ever a next time lighting will be a priority and then the list .
neutral	i like that some times is cheap .
neutral	but the clothes some time is to small and cheap material .
neutral	i ordered two items from petflow . com ; one item arrived and was just fine ( bully_sticks ).
neutral	the other item ( lighted collar ) arrived broken .
neutral	i called and was told a new one was on the way .
neutral	i have not received the new collar yet , so stay tuned ........
neutral	unfortuantely even if i want i can '_t say anything about my order because i haven_'_t receveid it yet
neutral	backpack and bowling bag were a lot smaller_than_expected .
neutral	that may have been my fault for not reading size .
neutral	the colouring of the characters on the bags is off .
neutral	i love this company and appreciate everything , however , it is very frustrating to deal with the recurring technical_issues .
neutral	particularly annoying is the payment history button which should allow us to view the last 00 or 00 months and it never works .
neutral	many_times there are screens that look like part of one screen is sitting on top of the previous screen and you cannot see either one very well .
neutral	i have called and complained and the customer_service is excellent , however , when is this going to be fixed ?
neutral	my family_member worked for the company and said the same technical_issues are there from 0 years_ago !
neutral	fix these issues please !
neutral	the led leashes are cool but they are way too short .
neutral	unfortunately , my little dog did not not like the " larry the cable guy " treats i ordered .
neutral	i think the led tags will be great !
neutral	( they are for my granddogs ).
neutral	niet boeket van foto .
neutral	probleem met bloemist wel goed opgelost
neutral	the man_who helped_us at the hertz office in edinburgh was rude and sarcastic .
neutral	we were shocked .
neutral	he said he was from england so he didn_'_t know a thing about the roads or weather in scotland .
neutral	the original stick shift had a cracked window so he gave_us an automatic .
neutral	we had a wonderful road_trip and enjoyed the car .
neutral	the concept of glasses_direct is brilliant and i have bought two frames .
neutral	but my eyesight is too poor to have my glasses manufactured by them .
neutral	there is nothing online to explain this , so having spent weeks browsing and using the home_trial a few_times , i then tried to place the order , but wasn_'_t able to .
neutral	that was annoying .
neutral	product is good but i needed a full arch support which this doesnt quite give .
neutral	also the cushioning isnt enough for me to remove ball of foot pain .
neutral	went for these as i only wanted them for walking and they were highlighted for arch support and forefoot pain .
neutral	i will say they have helped though .
neutral	delivery was disappointing as i paid for next_day and only found today 0 days_later that they had been left with a neighbour .
neutral	this particular online purchasing experience with b and h did not go as smoothly as my first two experiences with b and h .
neutral	e . g_., i needed to re - fill_out some information that i already filled out .
neutral	all the products are really great and really cute .
neutral	but the shipping and handling to usa is just to expensive
neutral	federal_express delivered the package to our front_door .
neutral	had i known before my dog that would have been alright , but my dog ate through the box and the bag of dog_food too !
neutral	after comparison_shopping at both petsmart and petco , the dog_food was cheaper at both stores .
neutral	toy was crushed and bent from the 00_pound_bag of dog_food sitting on top of it .
neutral	the entire experience was so so .
neutral	had the prices been cheaper it would be worth it to continuenhaving it delivered by pewfflow regularly , but i think i am going to cancel my standing order .
neutral	ordering replacement for shipment that " disappeared " during shipping or delivery .
neutral	shipment started out fedex but was transferred to usps for the door delivery .
neutral	we never received package , and usps has no proof of delivery to our mailbox or door .
neutral	b_&_h is being helpful in discussion , but we don_'_t know how this will finally resolve and who will bear the financial responsibility .
neutral	don_'_t go with free_shipping if you expect full tracking of the shipment .
neutral	note --- this comment is specifically about shipping .
neutral	on other issues with b_&_h , we have been very happy , and b_&_h may have had no control over fedex shifting to usps .
neutral	just be aware and cautious .
neutral	by the time i receive the 00_lb_bags of fromm surf n turf from fedex the tape has popped and the bag is not too secure in the box_containing it .
neutral	once the side of the bag had split as if it had done so because it was dropped .
neutral	i like the products and the prices , unfortunately it takes a while for an order to arrive .
neutral	also on several_occasions i have made an online enquiry and have never recieved a response .
neutral	it '_s probably too early for much to be happening except lots of calls to me from creditors .
neutral	it '_s nice that you call me .
neutral	one concern ... i was contacted by you byemail concerning a creditor .
neutral	the email said you had to talk to me .
neutral	i answered by e_mail and phone and no one has returned my call .
neutral	what is so important , please ?
neutral	?
neutral	i wouldn_'_t really recommend this company .
neutral	despite having phoned 00_minutes ahead of our arrival , we waited 00 minute in the short_term car_park for them to arrive .
neutral	when they did turn up they all looked a bit scruffy and i saw at_least two of them smoking as they drove up .
neutral	again , when we landed we had to wait in the rain for them to arrive .
neutral	not great , though it was quite reasonably_priced .
neutral	although i have been happy with amazon '_s service and prompt delivery i noticed recently that they still sell real fur in some of their lines and make up brushes , as most fur is imported from china and former soviet states with animals skinned alive , electrocuted and very much abused i do not think that such a popular site should have these items on its site , please consider an ethical overhaul of some product lines
neutral	i ordered 0 of the lights that hang on dogs collars .
neutral	only 0 of them worked .
neutral	they were also difficult to attach to the collars ( no instructions ) included .
neutral	i bought 0 of them for my mom so she could keep_track of her little dog as her dog wanders the yard before they go to bed .
neutral	it '_s a bit difficult for my mom to push down so hard on the light to have it come on .
neutral	but she did it .
neutral	also the plastic of the whole design smells horrible .
neutral	just touching it makes one '_s fingers smell like chemicals and they have to be washed immediately .
neutral	frames_direct was good but i feel when it came to delivering the product it would have been easier to go to lenscrafters or another eyeglass store .
neutral	like most online shopping , i thought this would be convienient , but it really wasn_'_t .
neutral	my order was delayed because the frame didn_'_t meet some satisfaction with frames_direct and it took almost a month to get them .
neutral	luckily these were a back up pair for when i play sports and didn_'_t need them immediately .
neutral	i think if you are going to send a product back , getting it to the customer quickly should be a high priority .
neutral	some compensation should of happened .
neutral	i use wowcher everyday i feel i '_m a valuable customers .
neutral	but sometimes you don_'_t listen to what i '_m saying .
neutral	disappointed with my order .
neutral	invoice stated order complete , but there was one item was missing in the package .
neutral	i talked with a customer_service rep on tuesday 0 / 00 / 00 and was told the situation would be resolved in a couple of hours , i have not been contacted since that conversation .
neutral	i wish to have my missing item sent to me since my order has_been paid for in full .
neutral	hopefully this situation will be resolved asap .
neutral	couldn_'_t work out from alitilia website pre_- boarding time , there flight office was cloesed , rang your service centre only to be told you were busy , did a guessimate and got to airport 0 . 0hrs early , ie 0am .
neutral	flight was fine , no_problems what so ever .
neutral	but pre flight info was lacking .
neutral	the website did not show the tax inclusive price which was a bit misleading , however attractive website which was generally easy to use and understand .
neutral	updated :
neutral	after my rant on this website , i had someone contact me from bookit . com .
neutral	finally someone took the time and rectified this issue .
neutral	i truly appreciate the fact that they " made good " on what i purchased , but the fact that i had to spend 0 + hours on the phone , for 0 different phone_calls and ultimately post something on social_media in order to make it right , only earns them the 0_stars up from the 0 i gave initially .
neutral	__________________________
neutral	( initial review )
neutral	buyer_beware !!!!!!!
neutral	make_sure you read every little piece of information and disclaimer and do not purchase anything on a tablet or smartphone !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	we purchased a special for three couples .
neutral	we were supposed to get 0 free drinks and 0 free brunches per room with our deal .
neutral	at the time of purchase there were three couples and we bought three rooms .
neutral	because we did not purchase the rooms separately , but at one time ( three_separate rooms , charged to three_separate credit_cards ) they would not honor the 0 drinks per room and per brunch , stating that it was one purchase not three .
neutral	i noticed the oversight immediately after check out and called bookit directly , was on hold for over 0 0 / 0 hours and no one answered the phone .
neutral	called back 0 days_later ( i booked on a saturday and called back on monday ) and was told basically tough luck .
neutral	one purchase , one deal , not per room per purchase .
neutral	when i said - which was truthful - that i purchased this on my tablet , and i did not see anywhere that there was a stated difference ( i would have purchased three_separate rooms if i knew , it was no skin off of my back to do it that way , i just thought it would be easier to do it all at once ).
neutral	i was given the run_around over and over and over and they would not honor the deal of 0 drinks and 0 brunches per room .
neutral	no recourse , no cancellations , a lot of waiting on phones , wasted time , and people who could not care less .
neutral	as always , buyer be ware !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	the ordering process through partsgeek was a good experience .
neutral	i was not happy when my brakes had serious pulsations when i stopped .
neutral	so i had to take it a shop and found out that both ( brake ) drums i ordered were deformed and needed “ filing ” ( or whatever the term is ) to get the drums to work properly .
neutral	so i saved no money ordering through their website .
neutral	a refund for the drums would be nice , but i doubt that would happen .
neutral	although the online quote said there '_s be no_pressure to take out extra insurance on arrival , that wasn_'_t true .
neutral	at_0am after a night flight is not the time to ask a person to review options .
neutral	the car was only one quarter full which annoyed me as i ' d paid for a full_tank .
neutral	when asked on returning the car if there was any_problems with it , i said yes and the assistant seemed very willing to record them .
neutral	i hope they helped the following renter .
neutral	price was very good but be prepared for the " extras " when you go to the arrivals desk .
neutral	given the choice of when to ship , i picked " next week ".
neutral	instead , order arrived in 0 days , well before when i wanted it to arrive .
neutral	makes one wonder whether you care about my needs .
neutral	this was my first experience .
neutral	you dont send money back for returned item .
neutral	i do the automatic order because my dog has food_allergies , i had to go on a hunt to find some food because mine never got sent .
neutral	this is a huge problem and i never got an_email or any notification that it was not coming .
neutral	i was very upset because it would cost us a ton of vet_bills if i had to change her food that quickly .
neutral	i hope i recieve my order as planned this next month or i will find a new company to go through .
neutral	i liked talking to the people making the reservation , however ..... when i received my confirmation in my email the price was higher .
neutral	i contacted them back and they told me it was the going rate and they could not change it .
neutral	i was not happy !
neutral	truth to be said , the product range is fantastic and i am definitely going to order in the future , but i was expecting better packaging and service .
neutral	my order came in a big box and items were scattered all around it , some of them not even bubble - wrapped .
neutral	i had to “ fish ” the products based on the packing_list !
neutral	my order came 0 item short .
neutral	i have immediately contacted customer_services and an agent was polite and promised to investigate the issue .
neutral	i purchased airline_tickets for myself and my children on travelocity .
neutral	i assigned seats via travelocity .
neutral	but upon check in , i was told i did not have assigned seats .
neutral	we were traveling internationally and we ended_up with three seats across the plane ( like row 00 , 00 , and 00 ) from each other .
neutral	due to the plane being full and flight attendants busy ( even_though i was told at check in they would help me ), i had to beg people to change seats so i could sit by my children .
neutral	several people refused , which made my already upset 0 year_old start bawling and clinging to me while i was trying to figure_out where we could sit .
neutral	my daughter ended_up having to sit behind me which i was not comfortable with , but didn_'_t really have a choice .
neutral	someone finally switched up to one of our seats and i was able to sit next to my 0 year_old .
neutral	simply put - the experience really made our vacation end on a poor note and i now know that travelocity seat reservations are pointless .
neutral	a recommendation is to either guarantee selection or take that option off altogether .
neutral	thanks !
neutral	when i was placing my order i was asked if i wanted to add shipping insurance for an extra 0 . 00 !
neutral	i decided not to go with the shipping insurance because i figured it would be fine , which my item was !
neutral	however , when i received my package there was only one piece of packing_tape on the box but it wasn_'_t even keeping the box closed !
neutral	i thought someone had opened my package .
neutral	than i get the rest of it off , which had barley any stickiness to it and the box my side_mirror was in wasnt shut ; almost as if they thought it the left that lid open it would be wide enough for it to stay in place .
neutral	on top of that there was nothing inside the packaged boxed that kept the smaller box in place , and my mirror wasnt all the way in the smaller box .
neutral	my mirror is fine , however when i drive it moves , the mirror is secure in its holster but it is vibrating to the motions of my car .
neutral	i have a sound system so i cant_complain too much since my stock mirror vibrated slightly but i was still able to make out the type of car that was behind me !
neutral	i honestly cannot say if i would purchase from parts_geek again , if this is just a mirror what would something be like if it was a serious component to my car ?
neutral	price was affordable but i guess its one of those " you get what you pay for " kind of thing .
neutral	it took a lot of hoops to find this particular price .
neutral	also , i noticed on the hotel i booked that there was other rooms that they offered that weren_'_t listed on your site .
neutral	for instance , they had a " premium " villa with a king .
neutral	which , i called the hotel to ask them the difference and they said this room guaranteed a great view .
neutral	this would of been very important for this trip , because it is a special_occasion due to we ' re celebrating my boyfriend '_s 00th_birthday .
neutral	so i wanted to make_sure that we had a great view .
neutral	so i would definitely add that to your site , because sometimes the view is important due to the occasion .
neutral	other than that , everything else seemed easy .
neutral	also , i wish you guys offered special packages or deals with stays .
neutral	i know there are some sites that have coupons or gift_cards or something they can utilize at the hotel .
neutral	this would be awesome if you would do this .
neutral	i rate this site a 0 just because if you offered the two things i mentioned , it would be perfect .
neutral	:)
neutral	i purchased some products but did not receive them , when i contacted zestbeauty i was told that even_though i had received an_email to confirm the order there had been a technical hitch and the order had been cancelled .
neutral	i reordered the products but had to pay for a quicker delivery and asked if i could have this reimbursed , i am still_waiting for a reply !
neutral	the goods arrived but i only received 0 free_sample eventhough i ordered more than one and the website stated that there was a free_sample with each .
neutral	i sent another message to their customer_services and this has not received a reply either .
neutral	i did get a better price for my phone than mazuma and other recycling sites however the waiting time which was over a week wasn_'_t great since mazuma are quicker .
neutral	am cancelling myself & husband as i am very disappointed with your credit_score system .
neutral	i thought it was the correct scores .
neutral	wrong .
neutral	my score is alot higher compared to your silly system .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	magpie is a good service and useful for getting_rid of your old unwanted items , especially great that they pick_up straight from your door .
neutral	but the fact that they give you a twelve hour_window within which to be inside waiting is overlong .
neutral	the main problem however is that the whole_process took way too long - about two to three_weeks in my case for the money to be in my account .
neutral	get it sorted !
neutral	i was very disappointed with the submersible lights not at all like photo on web
neutral	really disappointing ..... the order taking and delivery communication was superb .
neutral	however i unpacked the wine cooler to find it was badly dented and called customer_services immediately to advise them of the damage .
neutral	they asked me to - email photographic evidence , which i did immediately , backed_up with details of my complaint .
neutral	two full working days_later and no response ( despite a chasing e_- mail ) from customer_services .
neutral	update_: customer_services have been in contact this morning and offered acceptable resolution .
neutral	i accept there was a delayed response to my complaint but no intent to ignore the problem
neutral	i have 0 chihuahuas and 0 bedlington terrier .
neutral	i ordered spoiled_rotten for my chihuahuas because it only let_me list 0 kind of dog , what about us multiple dog owners ?
neutral	and shouldn_'_t the deliveries be geared for xsmall dogs ?
neutral	the ordering process was easy and delivery is fast .
neutral	i feel i got good products for a similar price as my pet_store .
neutral	the website wasn_'_t very user_friendly .
neutral	when i called for help , they didn_'_t know or not very helpful .
neutral	finally got the filters ordered and very happy with the filters .
neutral	a year_ago when i tried to order from their website , also had trouble .
neutral	called and ordered them over the phone .
neutral	i believe their website needs improvement because they have a good product .
neutral	i wanted to buy a cd_key but after i paid i had to go through some anti fraud mess and send all kind of documents that i didn_'_t want to send .
neutral	after i complained_about it and that i wanted my money back .
neutral	i suddenly could get the key in a normal way .
neutral	the product as_advertised with looks and features .
neutral	none of the product was damaged but the shipping the product was horrendous .
neutral	half the order showed the hlf was lost and 0_weeks delivery time with no compensation for the inconvenience
neutral	i came_across this website and saw a few things that were great deals , and we all love great deals !
neutral	i couldn_'_t pass it up and easy ordering and fast delivery were a bonus !
neutral	love this company !
neutral	but i '_m bummed that your out of stock on the 0 thing i wanted most .
neutral	the motion scensor doggy fun bag .
neutral	and out of stock on a lot of other item i would of bought .
neutral	i also receive the monthly box and got my 0st one a couple days ago .
neutral	a lil disappointed because the way itis advertised it seems like you get alot .
neutral	please add more useful items , but i did love the 0 different kind of treats in the box because i '_m having a problem finding a treat my 0 picky pups like so i have to try all of them 0 by 0 for training purposes .
neutral	thats costly !
neutral	!
neutral	not what i expected
neutral	i ordered two pair of sunglasses .
neutral	the first was called bomp !
neutral	i love them but they seem to have a defect that has resulted in them being uncomfortable to wear .
neutral	specifically on where the glasses rest on the bridge of my nose .
neutral	there '_s a small piece of plastic protruding .
neutral	i '_ll sand it down to smooth it because it '_s not worth returning ( total shipping expenses will exceed the cost of the glasses ).
neutral	the second says that they are light sensitive i haven_'_t noticed a difference in the tint in the sunlight verses indoors ... but maybe i am mistaken ?
neutral	i love the aesthetic of the glasses nonetheless .
neutral	i ' d order again ...
neutral	i ' d just be more cautious is all .
neutral	my purchase went okay .
neutral	however , i did not receive one of my products i ordered on the date it was supposed to arrive .
neutral	upon tracking it , i found it stranded in california .
neutral	i couldn_'_t get_ahold of fedex so i wanted to try partsgeek .
neutral	unfortunately for me , partsgeek doesn_'_t have a customer_service number , the number on my email belongs to a company that says nothing but bad things about partsgeek , and fedex is useless .
neutral	i had to email partsgeek , i did get a pretty fast response , but the response didn_'_t make any since nor did it answer my question .
neutral	so , basically the response was useless to me and i had to continue to try and get_ahold of fedex to find out what was going on with my package .
neutral	moral of story is it was fedex fault , however partsgeek should have a number for customers to call , if they have concerns about there items .
neutral	i sure hope i don_'_t have any_problems with my products , because i am having a bit of a trust issue now .
neutral	even in the ' compare ' view , prices and pertinent_information are not included for each camera i was interested in .
neutral	price is obviously a huge factor .
neutral	what gives ??
neutral	also , useless or non_- existent reviews of products .
neutral	the service was excellent - i ordered a tennis net measuring stick and it was delivered within days but i was disappointed with the quality of the stick .
neutral	it was just a rough piece of wood badly varnished and with no means of hanging it up .
neutral	it was doubly disappointing as it was sent as a gift !
neutral	they have lost subsequent_orders from me because of the shipping and handling_fees after my initial preseason order .
neutral	it was easy to order and shipping was prompt .
neutral	it was cheaper to go to local_store though after the bulk order .
neutral	i hippie they consider revising them in the future so i can place all my orders through them .
neutral	we will be traveling with 0_adults and 0 kids for this stay .
neutral	when i entered 0_adults and the 0 kids with ages online i got an_error that said no rooms available .
neutral	even_though i was only asking for 0 room with 0 double_beds as the baby will sleep in a portable bassinet .
neutral	however , i was able to complete my booking when i only entered 0 kids and 0_adults .
neutral	receiving job alerts for jobs i am not qualified for such as dental assistant , cota , rn , lpn - i have no medical training .
neutral	i have applied to some of the positions i am qualified for but have not heard back from any of them .
neutral	the tours are a great idea if you '_ve only got a few hours to try and see everything in paris , as i did .
neutral	they ' re also very good value for money .
neutral	the only problem i found was finding the buses at the various stops .
neutral	in the london version of these tours , there are well signposted , recognisable bus_stops specifically for these tourbuses , and the buses always stop at these points .
neutral	the paris system however doesn_'_t seem to have ' specific ' stopping points that can be easily found by tourists .
neutral	for example i was waiting for my first tourbus at the eiffel_tower .
neutral	now the eiffel_tower is a pretty big thing and though i knew there would be a tourbus arriving i couldn_'_t find the place where it would be pulling up .
neutral	in the end i spent 00_minutes walking in circles around it until a tour bus pulled_up in a random , unsignposted roadside a few metres away .
neutral	perhaps a little more clarity in their bus system would be benificial .
neutral	auto_europe was an ok company to use .
neutral	we didn_'_t have to wait in a long line to get our car .
neutral	our van was plenty big to fit 0 people .
neutral	the only_negative_comment would be that i thought when i signed_up , the contract included a second driver at no cost , but when i go there , they said no , it would cost another approx .
neutral	$_000 , if i wanted to drive .
neutral	i don_'_t like being taken_advantage of .
neutral	we didn_'_t end up paying the extra , since i said i ' d_rather not drive anyway .
neutral	they also charged us another $_00 . 00 after .
neutral	i '_m not sure what that was for either .
neutral	be careful of any hidden_fees .
neutral	i always get the best prices from supplement_warehouse however , on 0 separate_occasions , the shipping department has packed the liquid items poorly and they have exploded all over the inside of the box .
neutral	it has taken 0 additional weeks to get the items back - they should rush those orders i would think but they '_ve never been willing to do that .
neutral	when the wrong part was shipped and needed to be returned we were responsible for the shipping and insurance charges .
neutral	it would be better to get a shipping label from them and then deduct that amount from your return rather_than the hassle of scrambling around for the best , safest shipping company .
neutral	very disappointed in that .
neutral	actual delivery was fine , driver very pleasant and found us ok . lady_who phoned from the oil company was not very pleasant - abrupt and unhelpful
neutral	website visually not much to be deserved - got thru it easy enough .
neutral	took_awhile to get it and the actual items just so so .
neutral	all in all mediocre experience and mediocre products
neutral	i ordered so spot on flea and tick and worming tabs for my dogs , prices were excellent .
neutral	i paid_extra to get 0st_class post as i wanted to treat asap , we have had a lot of ticks around us and have had a poorly lamb which has_been put down to the ticks as well .
neutral	the order arrived as expected but i was annoyed to discover that i didn_'_t have my order but someone_else '_s and their delivery note with all of their details ( worth considerably_less_than my goods , goodness knows my products went !).
neutral	tried to phone but parcel arrived on sat am and they are closed for weekend , which rather defeated the point of paying for 0st_class post !
neutral	!
neutral	when i got hold of them on the mon am they were very helpfully and dispatched my correct order by special delivery to arrive the next_day but didn_'_t seem at all surprised at the mix up and just asked me to use the free post label to return the incorrect items .
neutral	products arrived as_promised but obviously had several days delay in being_able to treat dogs .
neutral	would use them again simply because they were so much_cheaper_than locally but would allow time to get order corrected next time .
neutral	i ordered a pair of rayban_sunglasses from vision_direct which were marked as ' fast shipment '.
neutral	the estimated shipping time at the time of order was 00 - 00 days .
neutral	the actual time before i recieved the order was 0_weeks .
neutral	i had to chase up the order repeatedly via phone and email to get any updates .
neutral	i was provided with an incorrect shipping reference_number , given misinformed order status_updates , and the order was sent to the address shown on my paypal_account , not the address i specified when placing the order through vision_direct '_s website .
neutral	on a positive_note when i finally received the glasses they were the genuine product , came well_packaged , and arrived undamaged .
neutral	also when i did contact vision_direct via customerservice @ visiondirect . com . au my queries were always responded to within 0 business day .
neutral	despite the great prices i would advise buyers to be wary of shipping times , particulary with rayban products as it seems to be a common theme amongst the complaints re : delivery delays shown on this site .
neutral	i would also advise that if your order exceeds the delivery time provided to contact vision_direct immediately via_email or phone to report the delay .
neutral	thank_you , goods arrived .
neutral	however it is very hard to comment on a service when you are still_waiting on goods .
neutral	yes , i realized they were a pre stock order and would arrive jan_0000 .
neutral	however , it would be good to be able to track my item , as tennis warehouse does and then , there is no confusion .
neutral	i was told 0 - 0 days delivery from my last email to you and it was 00 days ?
neutral	have ordered again , and this time stock is available , so i hope to receive goods with in the next 00 days .
neutral	i have always gone_through tennis warehouse with no problem at all and orders delivered with in 0 working days .
neutral	however , i hope to continue with tennisnuts ..
neutral	i ordered 0 items and at checkout they were all in stock ... but , when i received my package i only received two items .
neutral	i was told on my receipt that they were in back ordered .
neutral	i was not given a date or time when i will receive the back ordered items .
neutral	i had to call and was told to wait for about a week .
neutral	i waited for the week i was told and was told they will have to issue me a store credit due to the items were not going to be back in stock .
neutral	i needed those items for a very special_occasion .
neutral	i suggest that if the item ( s ) are not in stock please check before you add item online .
neutral	i liked the website and thought the varitey , value , and selection were great !
neutral	the first time i placed an order i did kind of wait_until the last_minute to purchase my dogs food , unsure of whether i would receive in time i called customer_service and was told they would rush in through so i would get in time , so i went_ahead and placed the order , but of course it came 0 days_later and i ran_out of food .
neutral	i was really annoyed because i had to make a special trip to the store to get them food to hold them until the delivery arrived .
neutral	if i was just told in the first place how long it would have been i would have just gone to the store .... instead i was lied to !
neutral	the customer_service and goods that we have got from yourselves are great , but the company that you use for the deliveries leave a lot to be desired as they are very rude and pass blame on to the customer .
neutral	i was quite excited to have such low_prices when renting my books .
neutral	however there is a delay when processing orders .
neutral	then if your books aren_'_t packaged by a certain time that day , they may not go out until the next_day .
neutral	needless to say i had to wait extra days for my books .
neutral	ordered four books .
neutral	all arrived as_promised .
neutral	however , one of the larger books should not have been purchased by book_byte and resold .
neutral	it had obviously been chewed by an animal .
neutral	the book was in terrible shape even_though the written area was not chewed .
neutral	this was the worse used book i have ever purchased .
neutral	since it was not for a major course and my college_student needed the book , we decided to keep .
neutral	my dog had the toy torn up in 0 min .
neutral	it was not sturdy at all .
neutral	he didnt like the peanut_butter biscuits , i will like to experience a couple more boxes before i make a final review .
neutral	order was despatched on thursday and didn_'_t reach us until the following_tuesday - tracking said ' delayed in nantgarw '.
neutral	disappointing , but product fine .
neutral	i was please with the quick service , and received the right item .
neutral	however , of the 0 filters i received , 0 of them were all bent up .
neutral	i did try to straighten them and i think they will work , but disappointed in them .
neutral	the protien is good tastes great mixs well but haven_'_t been taking long enough to see results , but on delivery the tub was open and some of the protien was in the box .
neutral	delivery was done in my absence , so i cant_comment on that , but the fact that my simple request for a call before delivery to advise me when it would be so that i could put the special additive for my aga " cooker max " in to the tank just before the oil went in , so it was evenly mixed .
neutral	so now i have a tank of oil without cooker max in and will now experience expensive problems with the aga !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i rang the supplier who just passed the buck and said that it was boilerjuice who should have rung me ?
neutral	so who do you think was responsible ?
neutral	i would say that the salesman was awesome .
neutral	very helpful and a good salesman .
neutral	but the drivers was 0hr late .
neutral	called them and was really dissapointed .
neutral	but when they came they put everything together and was really nice guys .
neutral	maybe they had a lot of places to deliver .
neutral	but i was satisfied after they finish and gave them an extra 0 $ and water .
neutral	definitely would continue shopping .
neutral	can i get a discount next time .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	kathy chapman .
neutral	using public_storage is a good idea .
neutral	but be sure to take your belongings before the end of the agreement .
neutral	they will charge you out of the ass and hold your property hostage .
neutral	there was a water leak that caused water_damage that made the guest bathroom not usable and the gate stopped_working .
neutral	thought shipping charge was a little high as it cost almost as much as the parts i ordered .
neutral	would recommend to others .
neutral	i found it difficult to make more than one change to my order at a time .
neutral	i get smart paks for my horses and i love their system !
neutral	they notify you by email a week before shipping and have an easy system to change your order .
neutral	i wanted to change my order and was surprised to find the next shipment on my doorstep .
neutral	oops ... too late .
neutral	on a different note , when my order arrived at_least 0 days early , i contacted customer_service and they were very pleasant and professional .
neutral	off to try to change my order now .
neutral	we have not received delivery of our order as of yet ...
neutral	please let us know when we should expect it .
neutral	we will be happy to provide our opinion once we have completed the purchasing experience .
neutral	like that i will receive a small rebate after the book is returned .
neutral	i feel it took to long for the book to arrive compared to other company '_s i have rented from .
neutral	tracking the book and seeing that it took a week for it to go from ohio to pennsylvania was extremely aggravating .
neutral	i have always like to shop online and this place is to my opinion not as fantastic .
neutral	the price of the product is aittle bit misleading and it may not be accurate at all .
neutral	you have to check out the actual website to have the right product and price
neutral	overall this is just a search_engine that worth and ok review
neutral	i have never_experienced booking a hotel that says they are charging me the day i booked even_tho we weren_'_t coming to stay for a few_weeks .
neutral	also they said no_matter what happens the fee is non_refundable .
neutral	i haven_'_t gotten to the hotel yet but the woman wasn_'_t helpful when i spoke to her and i '_m not looking_forward staying at the hotel .
neutral	i love their products but paid an exorbitant price for something i needed due to the added " minimum " price required and a very high shipping cost .
neutral	would not buy from them again due to unfair pricing .
neutral	hi , disappointed as one of the lights is broken , have returned in the post today , it also looks like it was an exdisplay item as it is very dirty and dusty .
neutral	regards
neutral	patricia
neutral	when mailing merchandise you need to send a responds with the merchandise so the customer will know when to receive there refund .
neutral	i like the prices , but do not waiting 0_weeks and still no sign of my giftcard being shipped to me ...
neutral	this came with no instructions , i tried to put it up but its too heavy and bulky and i damaged my back in the process .
neutral	its ideal to set_up and leave but no good for transporting around .
neutral	i bought the geras , at £_00 its excellent quality but not practical .
neutral	the legs are slightly marked too .
neutral	the bag looked bigger and wider in the image and in real if was much smaller
neutral	0 . found wonderful boots on ecco site .
neutral	i loved them .
neutral	checked my size using their instructions .
neutral	0 . ordered shoes .
neutral	had to email re tracking facility as link supplied was useless , but they responded promptly & gave better link .
neutral	0 . shoes arrived !
neutral	but although right length , were too narrow !!
neutral	need to have width as part of measurement procedure !
neutral	0 . have to return shoes to sweden !
neutral	at cost of over_£ 0 .... why not an ecco depot in uk ?
neutral	0 . instructions re return form not clear but hopefully will get refund soon ....
neutral	lights are pretty , sadly two of them did not work as the battery was flat .
neutral	the tab that you pull out was not in the light but in the box , so i had to buy more batteries which you can appreciate i was not happy about .
neutral	order arrived quickly and was as expected , so i can '_t fault them on the sales side .
neutral	however , take_care with the refunds policy , as it '_s pretty appalling .
neutral	you have to pay to return items , even if you are exchanging the item for something_else so they will be making a further delivery , they will not pick_up items for return at the same time .
neutral	if it '_s more than 0 days after delivery , they will deduct 00_% from the price when making the refund .
neutral	fine if you '_ve bought a single tap that you ' re going to use straight_away , but completely impractical for an 0 week building project when you won_'_t know within 0 days if everything fits .
neutral	outside 00 days , you can '_t get a refund at all .
neutral	very disappointing aspect of the service .
neutral	thank_you so much for your low_prices and availibility of parts .
neutral	however , the delivery service was not good .
neutral	the package arrived one day late , it would have been two had i not had to negotiate with the head of delivery to come to my house after delivery hours .
neutral	the delivery person even called to get directions ...
neutral	when he finally came , he just threw the parts on the ground and then dragged them to the door ... very unprofessional .
neutral	i like supplementwarehouse . com '_s prices and yes they are lower_than competitors prices .
neutral	however , i can get free_shipping from the competitor .
neutral	so , the price is offset resulting in supplementwarehouse . com actually costing me more .
neutral	i '_m not pleased with fed_ex since they left the food in the back of my old suv and jammed the door mechanism which gave_me a problem to deal with .
neutral	i had told them they could leave the food in the shed where it is parked ,, but never told them to touch the vehicle .
neutral	i don_'_t want that to happen again .
neutral	i need this addressed .
neutral	we adopted a puppy from canada and when he arrived at the airport his small bag of food detailed what he was being fed .
neutral	both dog_foods are from canada .
neutral	i went online and found that petflow . com offered both brands .
neutral	i ordered them immediately .
neutral	the next_day i did receive a communication from them that the go !
neutral	dog_food was out of stock .
neutral	we did receive our acana food as_promised .
neutral	still_waiting on the go !
neutral	: (
neutral	my brother and sister - in -_law really_enjoyed the rose_tree i sent to them in florida before christmas .
neutral	it came within the days promised and was a little droopy , but came back very nicely .
neutral	my only_complaint is that i had a code for free_shipping but your website would not let_me use it .
neutral	i have to say , i was happy with your service , but i do not like paying for something i do not need to .
neutral	i would try to improve your website or i '_m afraid you will have unhappy_customers like myself when your products appear to be first_class .
neutral	what is the point of having a space on the web order form to leave instructions if the oil delivery company do not read them ?
neutral	this is the second time i have ordered thro boilerjuice and had to phone the delivery company to ask why the instructions hadn_'_t been read - and am told that they don_'_t appear on the front of the order so are not seen ?
neutral	if this happens again i will have to stop using the site .
neutral	i ordered 0 led_lights for mine and my daughters babies .. our problem is that they didn_'_t stay on for a minute .. granted i know we change batteries , but for new orders ?
neutral	don_'_t think so ../.
neutral	ordered a few wowchers aa christmas_presents .
neutral	none have been delivered and i '_ve only heard from 0 places saying that my goods are to be delivered but they haven_'_t been so_far .
neutral	these were purchased at_least 0_weeks_ago .
neutral	not very happy about this at the moment .
neutral	i was booking a trip with airfare that took over 0 hour to book .
neutral	every time we thought we had the flights booked , they were no_longer available and then the price kept going up .
neutral	were able to get it booked , but a little frustrating .
neutral	the prices were lower_than any other site .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t do that again , i didn_'_t realize that i couldn_'_t cancel my reservation and the payment came out of my account before i even stayed so i wouldn_'_t use the service again .
neutral	yeswalker has a few decent shoes , but i '_ve found that the limited selection available is either ugly , cheap , or way overpriced .
neutral	if there '_s a buy one get one free offer at the same time as a free_shipping special , which they do have occasionally , then the few decent shoes are worth it .
neutral	under normal circumstances though , i would never buy anything from here .
neutral	i have been on this site for an_hour and the only price i see is the $_00 . 00 you want to charge me .
neutral	i did get pitched for a $_00 . 00 plan .
neutral	i don_'_t understand_why you cannot just list prices and coverage .
neutral	i see what look like some interesting options but i have no_idea what they cost .
neutral	i love the options available to personalize the card .
neutral	however , i was shocked when i realized that it takes about 0_weeks to deliver a stock card to me .
neutral	i would expect it to be delivered in 0 week or less .
neutral	i usually receive my books right_away , but this time the 0 of them came from different vendors and unfortunately , 0 of them arrived after both of my classes had started for an entire week .
neutral	hello ,
neutral	i ordered four stools and was informed that part of my order shipped and one arrived yesterday but now i don_'_t know the status of the other three .
neutral	please let_me know .
neutral	it has_been inconclusive all along how many stools were available - how many are coming now and how many later and when .
neutral	peace , denise
neutral	the site has some good products .
neutral	many are quite pricey although there are several that you could jury - rig together from things you already have at home .
neutral	the products aren_'_t nicely lined_up to look at on the screen , there are lots of pages with other information , movie clips , and ads that you have to sort through to find what you want .
neutral	you may be able to get what you want here , but you can probably find it easier elsewhere .
neutral	the part arrived quickly ; however , it broke while we were installing it .
neutral	seemed to be cheaply_made for the price we paid and now we can not even use it .
neutral	spent good money on an inadequately made part that is now unuseable .
neutral	delivery and returns were efficient however the products ordered were disappointing and not as_described .
neutral	i ordered 0 jumpers larger_sizes than i normally would due to reviews .
neutral	i am a size 00 - 00 and when the jumpers arrived they were like a child size , other items i ordered did not seem as_pictured .
neutral	as it was my first time ordering i was disappointed and it has put me off from ordering again .
neutral	i had no_problems with the online experience , only with the shipping .
neutral	i asked that my order be shipped to a pobox and i was not informed of any issue with that .
neutral	the company took it upon themselves to redirect my order to ship to my home address , without my knowledge .
neutral	i purposefully did not use that address as items have been ' lost ' before between delivery and my return home .
neutral	i would have felt better if i had been informed by the company that they needed to change the address , in which case i would have provided an_alternate that i felt_comfortable with .
neutral	the lack of communication is what led me to rate this experience only 0_stars .
neutral	you know i didn_'_t like the fact that i searched the web for these chia seeds and pure_formula was the site that had them for a better price then i order them and within a few hours i got an e_- mail_stating they weren_'_t in stock and they were on back order .
neutral	now i '_m not even sure when i will get my order .
neutral	had i known they were not in stock i wouldn_'_t of ordered them .
neutral	i think it should '_ve said on their site that those particular ones were out of stock .
neutral	now i have to play a waiting game no fair !!!!
neutral	unhappy customer .
neutral	was asked to sign in because my email was on an acct .
neutral	i used my known password but it rejected .
neutral	in attempt to reset the dorm would not accept the code i was suppose to copy , over and over .
neutral	i went back and found you had a password remembered and got it .
neutral	although we got a very good deal , the information given and pictures of the hotel were slightly misleading .
neutral	the description said the hotel was right in the centre of town and it was really a couple miles out and not in walking_distance .
neutral	also the pictures didn_'_t really look like our room actually looked , but besides from that it was a good experience .
neutral	we have ordered twice_now and my gripe is that both_times we didnt receive enough envelopes to go with the amount of cards ordered and two of the pictures selected for the cards were a bit fuzzy / pixelated despite them all being taken by our photographer on the same day with the same equipment !?
neutral	!
neutral	circius circus is at he end of the strip .
neutral	an older casino .
neutral	but staff was very friendly .
neutral	room was clean .
neutral	and food was decent .
neutral	i would stay here again .
neutral	very reasonably_priced .
neutral	charging a high fee for visa_card is not fair .
neutral	in the us it is unheard of , will not sit well with the american costumers .
neutral	the fares were good though , especially on british air
neutral	we had never had any_problems with our orders .. always correct & always quick service . since the latest rep started we have not had one correct order . there have been spacing issues , spelling issues . and one set of business cards were printed so half the card was not there .
neutral	pros_: found resort online , booked it thru book it right then and there on the way to the property .
neutral	simple , easy instructions , no snags or hang ups while going thru the process .
neutral	0_star_rating due to the fact that once arriving at the hotel , the reservation had not gone thru yet .
neutral	in this day and age , people expect a credit_card transaction to automatically go thru .
neutral	although not a huge inconvenience , ( actually pretty small potatoes ), it was a small inconvenience to have to wait around at the front_desk for 00_minutes for them to find our rez .
neutral	other than that , the website did as it was promised .
neutral	found us a decent rate at a better_than average resort .
neutral	i love the suitcases but they were smaller_than i thought they were going to be .
neutral	the price was a great value .
neutral	the medicanimal team were helpful enough re non arrival of my order , but somehow the communication with chronopost was bad .
neutral	the tracking was frustrating as each time a delivery date was given for the same order , i stayed in waiting , only to see next_day it had been returned to the depot .... maybe the drivers are not supplied with a phone !!!
neutral	or they like to waste petrol and customers ' time .
neutral	better communication and better tracking via medicanimal and chronopost .
neutral	hej !
neutral	jag_har beställt från er några gånger .
neutral	den senaste gången har jag fått halva beställningen , resten är på avvägar .
neutral	ni har skickat det 0 gånger , men jag_har inte fått det .
neutral	beställningen är från 00 mars , och nu är det 00 april .
neutral	hur svårt kan det vara ?
neutral	i originally believed i was ordering the paperback version of the book , because there were several references to slight damage to the " cover ".
neutral	however , upon_receiving the package , the book as actually the loose - leaf version .
neutral	the loose - leaf version is in ok shape , but it just wasn_'_t the product i thought i had bought .
neutral	the first bus we boarded , we ( my elderly_mother , my grand_daughter 0_yrs_old and me ) were the last ones on the bus .
neutral	as we were climbing up the stairs , the driver pulled off my mother loss her balance and spilled her belongings onto the staircase and the floor .
neutral	i asked the driver to stop , he did not .
neutral	i managed to break her fall , but his could have been serious .
neutral	so , i feel that more consideration should be given when passengers are boarding .
neutral	i '_m a pretty heavy squaretrade costumer .
neutral	i usually have about ten warranties out at a time .
neutral	i will no_longer deal with squaretrade on the two iphones we always insure with them .
neutral	it was $_00 .
neutral	then they jacked it up to $_000 , and people complained .
neutral	so they dropped it to $_00 .
neutral	ridiculous .
neutral	when the major companies now have a no contract upgrade with nothing down .
neutral	why bother ?
neutral	$_000 for a warranty plus $_00 for a deductible on anything , not just accidents anymore .
neutral	and it is refurbished !!
neutral	some other things they slid in there ...
neutral	i '_ll just take the new phone .
neutral	too bad , squaretrade use to be great !
neutral	i have used victoria_plumb twice and as a trade customer am a regular purchaser of plumbing items .
neutral	most of the items were fine but the two that were not were badly manufactured and instead of sending out a replacement asap or at_least asking me to send the faulty items back , i was required to send photos to show how they were faulty .
neutral	one of which was rejected as it did not show how the pipe did not fit into the trap !
neutral	how do you show that in a photograph and why would i being lying , to who '_s benefit would that be ?
neutral	i needed the item that day so ended_up having to go and and purchase one .
neutral	the service on the trade side was shocking .
neutral	rude , unfriendly and frankly the lady ( name withheld out of my politeness ) just could not care less .
neutral	not ideal for the the customer ....
neutral	booked the car while still in the uk , however when i tried to book another car while in the us it was not possible as rentalcarsnow . com said no cars were available although i checked with the local company direcly and there were cars available .
neutral	found this disappointing as had to book through local company which was more_expensive than booking through you .
neutral	i feel as though i should have been able to use your company even although i was in usa , particularily as i contacted you by both phone and on line .
neutral	liz easdale
neutral	p
neutral	had everything i was looking for at the right price but i ended_up not being_able to order for two_days because my schedule didn_'_t line up with their " checkout times " and now i '_m getting my order 0 days_later which puts me behind schedule with my project .
neutral	the prices are excellent .
neutral	very affordable .
neutral	if i could give then a 0 . 0 , i would .
neutral	here '_s why i docked them 0 . 0 / 0_stars .
neutral	when i used the online_chat to tell the representative the glasses were much larger in person than on the virtual try - on , the person said " we recommend customers buy frames based on frame size and not appearance .
neutral	in this case , we are not at fault and cannot do anything ."
neutral	i was surprised , given the website stated you can exchange frames once , even for cosmetic problems , at no charge .
neutral	in the past , i have not had trouble getting replacements from this company if the frame arrives damaged ( just send them a picture of the damage ).
neutral	this experience made me sad and will make me hesitant to order from this company again , given other discount , online companies have 000_% money back guarantees if you are dissatisfied for any reason .
neutral	the real set of flowers was smaller_than it appears on the photo , i didn_'_t like that .
neutral	the products kick ass , but the shipping takes_forever !
neutral	joggers look nice quality , colour is as expected .
neutral	these are an xmas_present and so hope they fit alright .
neutral	as they were delivered to wrong house and taken in , person then went out , i didn , t get them until next_day .
neutral	as i had waited in all day to receive them , i wasn_'_t best pleased .
neutral	am now put off from ordering from you again .
neutral	i love animoto , as do my students , but i am disappointed with the customer_service that i received .
neutral	the people were nice enough ; however , they were not understanding my question via_email .
neutral	i asked several_times for a phone_number to call , and was not given on ( if there is not a phone option , this is a problem because they obviously were not understanding my written question ).
neutral	the time of the response was not great any time , so with all of the back and forth it took almost a week to get what could have been done in a five minute phone conversation .
neutral	the final time that i received an_email , i had been fairly frustrated before , and i could tell the customer_service person was frustrated with me .
neutral	i understand that he / she was not happy that i was still emailing them back , but a good cs_rep never shows their frustration .
neutral	it was a poor customer_service experience overall .
neutral	i am glad that your product can sell itself .
neutral	we weren_'_t home when the courier tried to deliver the items , and they left a card to organise another time etc .
neutral	to get to the depot will take us a few_days of organising so what seemed like a quick and easy way to purchase these toners , has now ended_up taking us a week to organise .
neutral	would have been less hassle to pay a bit more and purchase them at our local newsagents , which we will do in the future , as we can '_t sit at home and wait for a delivery .
neutral	the service on some items is great eg the drum head we just bought delivered in less_than a week .
neutral	however \ i have been waiting for these sticks since before easter and i wouldnt mind so much if i got an_apology and some honesty instead of a bunch of emails_telling_me it will be realy soon then nothing arrives
neutral	i bought a costume which ended_up being too small for me .
neutral	i foudnt he website hard to use as there is no clear indicatio of where to find the information for exchanges .
neutral	i think the website needs to update their navigation process and faq section to increase efficientcy .
neutral	however i simply emailed them and i has a speedy reply that was exacty what i needed .
neutral	i was then able to simply exchange my item .
neutral	improvements i would make are an investment in navigations of the website , and free pick_up for exchanges since the delivery company are coming to give me the new item they should be able to take the original back with them i shouldnt have to pay and extra £ 0 to return it when the costume was only £_00 to begin with .
neutral	however i would use this company again i think they should take into_consideration the above .
neutral	orders are shipped promptly but if you need to return an item the headache begins .
neutral	still_waiting on approval to return an item that did not fit .
neutral	am out $_00 and left with unusable parts .
neutral	bedeckhome really need to improve on their packaging .
neutral	i received my goods this week and unfortunately the box was squashed with no top flap visible and the goods inside were plain to see .
neutral	i '_m surprised none of the order was missing .
neutral	even_though i '_m pleased with the bedding this would prevent me from ordering again .
neutral	i have no_idea why it has taken over a week for my order .
neutral	i '_ll have more feedback once it arrives .
neutral	but kind of frustrating .
neutral	unit has_been installed and is in working condition ..... email from ecomfort . com stated to inspect upon delivery for obvious damage .
neutral	no obvious damage was noted .
neutral	piece was delivered securely taped onto a wooden_pallet .
neutral	the actual unit was boxed in cardboard with plastic wrap surrounding box .
neutral	all was intact , but when packaging was opened by installer , there was damage to outside metal shell and to a section of cooling fins .
neutral	did not appear to have been damaged during shipment and can '_t determine if unit left ecomfort this way .
neutral	will_definately open up all packaging from now on upon delivery , no_matter_how good it looks .
neutral	just glad it worked .
neutral	my overall experience was good when shopping at chewy . com .
neutral	i got my items quickly and the prices were good however one of the items i purchased was sliced open in the bottom so i had to put them in a different bag to keep them fresh .
neutral	also , the box sent was huge and had a ton of shipping paper in it .
neutral	really could get some smaller boxes for the food that don_'_t require an entire garbage bag of shipping paper in it .
neutral	the units are clean .
neutral	the staff is friendly and helpful .
neutral	no lighting inside , so it '_s difficult to see .
neutral	the prices are high for the size of the unit .
neutral	i was told 0 rooms of furniture will fit in a 00x00 , this is not true , so now i have a unit and can '_t possibly get all of my stuff stored .
neutral	now i am looking for a bigger unit elsewhere because the price jumps too high per_month for a single_parent .
neutral	i saw the mp clothing had some good reviews as well as good prices so i thought i ' d order a few items .
neutral	i wasn_'_t that satisfied with the quality of the compression shorts however they are comfy & do the job .
neutral	really disappointed with the delivery service - which isn_'_t really mp '_s fault but it is the company that they use .
neutral	my parcel arrived in fair time , delivered by yodel .
neutral	they ( yodel ) left it with a neighbor but didn_'_t think to leave me a note to let_me know .
neutral	it wasn_'_t till i recieved an_email_telling_me my parcel had been delivered that i then went to track down my parcel .
neutral	a total let_down to my most_recent mp order that could make me consider ordering from mp in the future .
neutral	i orderd a toy from coolshop . everything went ok untill it reached the depot in england .
neutral	parcel_force could not deliver to me because the door number had been missed off ( not missed on original request ) shame parcel_force didnt contact me as my contact number was on the invoice quite visible .
neutral	i will use this site again as i could not get this toy in this country and i was pleased with toy and also received good customer_service via_e_mail
neutral	ordering from vision_direct was very simple .
neutral	when the order had been put through , a couple of days_later there was no update on the status .
neutral	when i asked about it , it was the advised to me that the item was not available anywhere in australia and that it was on backorder .
neutral	i then chose to continue with the order being told that it could take up to 0_weeks ( rather_than get a refund ).
neutral	at the time of purchase , just like every other brands / companies ordering online , they would show if the stock is available or not .
neutral	this was an inconvinient to me as it was a birthday_present so it was late .
neutral	i got it after a week also as they sourced one from hong_kong .
neutral	that is my only feedback but other than that , service was great !
neutral	i didnt have to wait 0_weeks and the purchase made is satisfactory !
neutral	will make future_purchases but once again , it should let potential buyers know if stock is available before they place their order .
neutral	als_ik klik op bel me terug omdat_ik_een vraag heb , gebeurt dat_niet .
neutral	dan moet ik er zelf achteraan bellen omdat_ik het te drukken bestand niet goed kan beoordelen .
neutral	verder gaat het wel allemaal goed , vlot en_snel .
neutral	the first time i ordered from petflow i was pleased with the promptness of the delivery .
neutral	but you '_ve tinkered with what works and this new way doesn_'_t work .
neutral	the order was to go out on monday , the 0th of july and i was to get it on wednesday .
neutral	fedex didn_'_t even pick it up until thursday and it got here on friday .
neutral	why did it take 0 days to get fedex to pick it up ?
neutral	its ok it sudt to expensive for no reason .
neutral	i hate having to get out of my car to access the key pad for entry .
neutral	i should just reach out the window and punch the key pad .
neutral	i have to get out my car in the pouring_rain then get back into my car .. but other than that its ok ..
neutral	i shipping is way to slow my puppy box was ship out over a week still not gotten it
neutral	i couldn_'_t sit_down for a long time and search for the right prices and the right star
neutral	check out was easy and quick .
neutral	that '_s what i needed
neutral	it '_s not worth the extra_fees they charge .... nothing special at all about this place
neutral	i ordered two_pairs of shoes and some earrings ... i would have given 0_stars except some stones fell_off the shoes the first time i put them on .
neutral	the shoes and jewelry were super_cute pretty good quality - especially for the price i paid .
neutral	to be fair i didn_'_t contact them over the studs falling_off because i figured i would have to pay return shipping .
neutral	all in all it was a positive_experience and i will most_likely order again .
neutral	highly_recommended for general admission attractions , such as aquarium of the pacific , movie theaters or knotts berry farm .
neutral	the processing fees added to each ticket raises the price very close to the general public sale price ... not always a good deal , especially if it is a reserved seating event .
neutral	if the event is reserved seating , you don_'_t know what you are paying for until you arrive at the event .
neutral	i would rather pay an extra $ 0 to select my seat .
neutral	you need to " upgrade " your membership in order to cancel an event without_penalty .
neutral	i have used your product for many years 0 - 0 pairs a year and even a year_ago i would have given you 0_stars .
neutral	however this year when i ordered my usual 0 pairs of jobst knee hi '_s an extended period of time passed and they did not arrive even_though follow_up indicated that they had been delivered to my local post_office .
neutral	the post_office denied that they had received the order and kept telling_me it probably was in a pile of items waiting to be sorted , follow_up visits to the post_office resulted in similar reports .
neutral	i called the company and reported that i had not received the merchandise - they shipped out a new order this time delivered by fedex and i received it the next_day .
neutral	i started to use my newly ordered merchandise and have come to the conclusion that the company must be thinning the material that they make the hose out of because they are shredding in the heel and the leg very quickly .
neutral	the online shopping and ordering process is fast and organized well .
neutral	i also received my packages in a timely_fashion .
neutral	unfortunately , i ordered a candy necklace and the packaging had become separated and the candy pieces were crushed inside the box along with the rest of my order .
neutral	i understand this can happen during the shipping process but i suggest finding a more secure way to ship edibles especially with non_- edibles included in the order .
neutral	although the big_bus_tours ( i got 00 hr all route tickets ) was probably the best way of showing dc to visiting friends and family , it is not perfect .
neutral	buses break_down rather often , are too crowded , and have bad ac systems .
neutral	for having paid $_00 per_ticket , i was expecting to have a seat on a bus at all times and i was expecting ac to work !
neutral	the program is great but needs re - working .
neutral	maybe adding more buses and fixing the ones they do have .
neutral	i found the overall booking process fairly easy to do online ... however when i decided i would like to extend my car_hire as i was staying for longer_than planned it turned_out to be a major hassle !
neutral	talk about jump_through hurdles .
neutral	especially as i had travelled from the usa and was then travelling all over the uk over the christmas_period ( with 0 small_children ) this was not what i expected nor hoped for .
neutral	all i wanted to do was extend the hire period for a week to 0_weeks but it was such a nightmare i chose not to .
neutral	the car was really nice though and the staff at the local hire place were really friendly so i would use them again but only for a basic straightforward booking !
neutral	having previously bought a sofa from dfs with excellent service we didn_'_t hesitate to go buy another .
neutral	the guy_who served_us instore was friendly , informative & helpful .
neutral	the let_down came on delivery day .
neutral	the two delivery_men informed me that they couldn_'_t place the sofa in my living_room as it wouldn_'_t fit .
neutral	they apparently knew this without even trying to manovure the sofa in .
neutral	they simply measured the door frame .
neutral	fair enough , maybe they were right in saying so but they didn_'_t seem to care or want to help in anyway .
neutral	they said they could call a glazier to take the window out but it was very expensive so i should contact a glazier of my own .
neutral	they also said they could arrange a redelivery but this was £_000 .
neutral	so they said all they could do was leave it in my garden .
neutral	that was it !
neutral	off they went .
neutral	so i was left stressed & out of pocket after getting in touch with a glazier .
neutral	who , by the way seemed to think the sofa would fit through the door .
neutral	when we started to take the plastic wrapper off the sofa i realised i had not been told by the delivery team how to take off the black plastic temporary feet and put on the fake wooden ones !
neutral	so another set back .
neutral	i '_ve been so disappointed by the delivery that i very much doubt i '_ll return to dfs .
neutral	i '_ve had a few clients that i helped with debtmerica relief program .
neutral	i find the consultant very helpful .
neutral	however sometimes two consultants are fighting for the same client .
neutral	still to receive my order as its coming via a third_party ( my sister ) as i live overseas .
neutral	i hope its with her .
neutral	no email_confirmation of order or dispatch !
neutral	i did receive a strange e_mail from " partystuffonline ", or was it , as they said there was a problem with my order and wanted me to confirm my card details .
neutral	seeing as i paid by paypal , i found this highly suspicious , and rang them to tell them i was not prepared to do this .
neutral	a rather confused , hesitant lady told me that they had had some bogus mails flying around , but assured_me that my order has_been posted .
neutral	so all in all , a bizzare experience , but so long as i get my stuff , i can live with that .
neutral	i think they should maybe post on thier site warning people not to give out thier card details .
neutral	it might help .
neutral	i guess finding a job , is not that all easy .
neutral	sigining up with an agency , it takes process and steps to find a job .
neutral	it '' s aggravating to sit and wait and not knowing how you are doing , what is going on when you submit you resume , like how often is it being sent out to companies .
neutral	most of my experience with petflow has_been positive .
neutral	however , i have an_issue with some of their labeling practices .
neutral	they advertised an edible ( rawhide ) product as made in brazil based on the image listed with the item .
neutral	however , the manufactuer produces this product in both china and brazil and the item made in china was what i was shipped .
neutral	i notified the company , but i still_haven_'_t seen the page changed .
neutral	dog_food and dog_treats from china have been linked to hundreds of cases of sick and in some cases , dead dogs in the us .
neutral	we lost a dog to toxins in chinese dog_food treats last_year before we were aware of the issue .
neutral	in addition , petflow denied every review i tried to post of the product that was negative .
neutral	the machine is great , but then that '_s nothing less_than i expected as my previous machine was a bosch washer .
neutral	i was disappointed that it didn_'_t come sooner , on the website delivery is quoted as 0 working days , mine was 0 , or even 0 if the order was noted the day it was placed .
neutral	i paid a collection charge of £_00 , but because they didn_'_t have the paperwork ( or so they claimed ) the delivery team were not willing to take the old_machine , even_though i showed them a printout with it clearly stating the collection charge .
neutral	they phoned their office , and i heard the lady tell them not to take the old_machine , so something clearly amiss with the admin there .
neutral	however , there was an_issue with fed_x and we didn_'_t receive the order in time .
neutral	i bought the remote_control plugs and the remote worked for about a day .
neutral	thought it was maybe a battery issue but it was definitely faulty have tried and replaced .
neutral	ordered and paid for another remote ( i bought the set through a utilities web_site which had no receipt or instruction book ) and now it works great .
neutral	just wish it had worked in the first place .
neutral	i do like this , it '_s cute , but i was expecting a gel skin , not a sticker .
neutral	it '_s getting a bit dirty already cos i use my phone all the time .
neutral	good if you want to change the way your phone looks regularly .
neutral	it would have been really awesome if you could download a ringtone as well - mine is dr who so i would have liked a tardis noise to complete the theme .
neutral	this is the third time i have purchased your product and i am frustrated that i can '_t just pop the cartridges in and they print after i calibrate them .
neutral	i have to clean it extensively several_times before the prints do not come out smeared or with lines through them .
neutral	i never seem to have that problem when i buy hp from a store .
neutral	had no problem booking rooms but wanted to change and add a day to one room .
neutral	impossible to do changed the whole reservation and had to go and change back and go to site and add another day to another reservation .
neutral	the change button does not work folks .
neutral	that is a pain and spent a lot of time and called hotel but never got off hold .
neutral	we haven_'_t received the goods as yet
neutral	why do you want me to put my opinion on public show when i have only received half of my order ?
neutral	i cannot review you because our transaction is not complete
neutral	i was happy with the goods just a bit peeved regarding delivery as it was late and i ' d paid for next_day .
neutral	just hoping it won_'_t happen again should i order i would of preferred the postage put back in my bank as apposed to it being refunded to my boohoo account .
neutral	while i am able to purchase the product i am looking for , the e_- commerce experience leaves a lot to be desired .
neutral	i am used to shopping with amazon where i always have order status at my fingertips .
neutral	i also hate that i can only get bottles of qty 00 .
neutral	when i am taking 0 pills a day , i would prefer bigger quantities .
neutral	minor ?
neutral	yes , but still annoying .
neutral	i placed my one item order on 00 / 0 at about noon .
neutral	the banner on the site said the order would ship the same day .
neutral	it didn_'_t ship until 00 / 00 .
neutral	then , the usps system showed the item to be in san_diego , ca .
neutral	after being in greensboro , nc , which is about 000_miles_away from me .
neutral	i called on 00 / 00 and the woman told me she would call me back with info wrt the ca .
neutral	shipping .
neutral	she did not .
neutral	i just checked the usps website , and it looks like it will arrive here today or tomorrow , which is good because i am out .
neutral	if it had shipped on 00 / 0 i wouldn_'_t have had to worry .
neutral	just received it and only have worn it once ... didn_'_t really notice any heat which is what they talk about ,,, will wear it tomorrow and see what happens
neutral	i recently_purchased some 0000 '_s accessories for a hen do i am attending next month .
neutral	jokers ' masquerade had a good selection of costumes and accessories and most of them were cheaper_than other_websites i was looking on .
neutral	the goods were delivered to the storage_unit the next_day , and i collected them the day after .
neutral	very straightforward indeed and no need to worry_about missing the delivery man .
neutral	the products themselves are good , not amazing quality but then i didn_'_t expect that .
neutral	they will be fine for the hen do , and most i will be able to keep and wear again .
neutral	the feather boa may have lost all its feathers after one night but we will see :)
neutral	all in all , pleased with jokers ' masquerade and would certainly consider purchasing from them again .
neutral	i '_ve watched other reviews on 00dollarmall , and the quality of the clothes is " amazing ", yet i '_m still_waiting on my shipment .
neutral	in ordered wow which was all brights , pinks , oranges , with green chrysanthemums as the filler , even went larger than yhe on screen pic suggest ie ; medium bunch rather_than standard - the florist obviously decided 0 roses , one lily and one gerbera was enough ... and the rest were ordinary yellow chrysanthemums :( delivery was good though .
neutral	parts are grate for price but don_'_t try to call take to long to ship got paid 0 :_00pm on one day and didn_'_t ship till 0 :_00pm or so the next_day from ny it took 0 days for a 0 to 0 hour drive !!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	many_times when i receive my order something is not right .
neutral	i might get a roughly finished shoes
neutral	my orders will not complete while my money is being taken
neutral	i '_ll have to dispute and instead of refunding my money to my credit_card they will give me store credit which is not acceptable
neutral	when calls are made to you i will be on hold for almost one hour
neutral	the product that i ordered for is different from what was advertised
neutral	sometimes the sizes will be small as though my feet has grown one size_bigger when other shoes of same size fits well .
neutral	the problems are so many that i don_'_t have the desire to continue buying from you
neutral	i bought the jtx 0000 and was very happy to hear it was being delivered the next_day .
neutral	when it arrived , i asked my dad to help me assemble it .
neutral	this was pretty easy but despite the fact that it '_s quite simple to assemble , the instructions were not very comprehensive and we struggled to find allen keys to fit the parts as they were all different_sizes .
neutral	when assembled i tried one session on it and thought it was very good .
neutral	having used much more_expensive commercial machines in the past i think the power it offers is on a par .
neutral	however when i went to switch on the machine that same afternoon for my sister to try it out , there was clearly a problem .
neutral	on the setting which alternates between collation and vibration , there was no vibration at all .
neutral	i called jtx and they were sympathetic but said i would need to take the machine apart to check the connection between the column and the base plate .
neutral	on inspection i could see nothing wrong with the cable .
neutral	however , i had noticed when it arrived that the cable had been knotted for some_reason and i had to un - knot it before i could connect it .
neutral	when i re assembled , it was now on constant full power vibrate and the control_panel was no_longer working .
neutral	jtx apologised and sent a replacement which arrived the next working day .
neutral	however , when the replacement arrived ( in what seemed to be re used packaging ), we found this time that the cable inside the column was nowhere to be seen !
neutral	it appeared to be jammed up inside of the column , with no way of releasing it to connect it to the base plate !
neutral	furthermore , this machine came with a set of allen keys which made me annoyed that we had struggled putting_together the first machine because they had clearly forgotten to pack them originally .
neutral	i explained the problem with the cable to jtx , they apologised and sent a replacement column .
neutral	this arrived swiftly and now we were experts at assembling the machines , it went together with no_problems and it works !
neutral	i enjoy using it and think the machine is very good .
neutral	however the whole_experience has left me wondering about the quality of the machines and how long this one will actually last .
neutral	very nice stools , service was excellent .
neutral	we did have a problem with the stools as one had a broken rubber foot in which the company sent us a replacement in the post , the other stool had been badly finished off with foot rest not being in the center and i mean well off center and the welding was awful .
neutral	had another stool sent , thought this was fine until we put the stools side by side and realized the foot rests were at different heights .
neutral	we kept the stools as they were at different sides of the breakfast_bar and we hope know one will notice .
neutral	would have sent back only it was then having to arrange more time off work to be here when delivered .
neutral	i reserved without obligation which was great ; however , when i went online to cancel the reservation i either had to call or email .
neutral	then - it still wasn_'_t cancelled .
neutral	i had to answer an_email_saying i did not move in .
neutral	that process was why i rated it 0_stars .
neutral	should be easier for us that want to click & go without much investment of time .
neutral	we loved the location of this hotel .
neutral	the hotel was clean and comfortable .
neutral	the only_thing that was a let_down is in the bar / restaurant area was really messy .
neutral	it '_s a great space but all of the table tops had left over dishes from other guests .
neutral	the staff didn_'_t seem like they were in a hurry to clean them up or greet guests coming in .
neutral	i have bought a few products which was very good apart_from one which was scratched but due to the fact we opened the package at a later date was too late to send back
neutral	i was a bit surprised by the amount of time it took for our order to ship after_placing the order .
neutral	the order was placed on june 00 and we were notified of shipping of july 00 .
neutral	that being said , it arrived only 0 days after shipment .
neutral	and , as soon as it was ready to ship , we immediately received a call to confirm we would be home - very good customer_service in that regard .
neutral	also , absolutely no_complaints about the product we ordered and the description was very accurate !
neutral	i live in hawaii , which presents specific issues , but with my last order there were two problems .
neutral	the first was that i place an order and just minutes after , a discount_coupon from pure_formulas appeared in my e_- mail .
neutral	i called and asked if i could have the discount applied and was told , " yes ".
neutral	received my order yesterday and the discount had not been applied .
neutral	why are discounts not applied automatically ?
neutral	if you ' re having a sale , why should the customer have to run this down .
neutral	secondly , i tried to order probiotics , which require refrigeration .
neutral	a charge for two - day delivery was applied to my order -- no_issues there , but when i called customer_service , they said the will not deliver to hawaii because products can '_t be here in two_days .
neutral	other_companies are able to get products here in two_days and i don_'_t understand_why this isn_'_t possible since orders are sent ups .
neutral	the products are good but a better variety would be even better .
neutral	the soups are really nice .
neutral	the latest batch of meals however seem sloppy if you use even the minimum_amount of water suggested .
neutral	something has changed .
neutral	what would be good would be setting_up say franchises to offer customers the discipline of a weigh in .
neutral	no need for expensive counselling though as per the main competitor
neutral	this is the second time i have used appliances on line .
neutral	for the large part there is very little to complain_about but .......
neutral	i didn_'_t appreciate a call within minutes of my placing my order trying to sell me cover insurance .
neutral	just spoilt the experience and prevented me from giving 000_% positive_feedback .
neutral	otherwise i would certainly recommend them
neutral	this was our first time using priceline for hotel reservations .
neutral	it was easy and ( we thought ) we got a great price for a 0 night_stay .
neutral	we were pre_- charged $_000 . 00 ... however , when we checked out , the hotel only charged us $_000 . 00 for the 0 night_stay .
neutral	the hotel told us to contact priceline for a refund of $_00 . 00 - but when we contacted priceline , we were ( very rudely ) told by their customer rep ., " we don_'_t give refunds ."
neutral	we were then told by priceline to contact the hotel to see if we could get a refund from them .
neutral	we did - and were told that a refund would have to come from priceline , not them .
neutral	none ( so_far ) is forthcoming from priceline or the hotel .
neutral	if you don_'_t want to refund actual money - then give us a comparable credit to use at a later date .
neutral	very disappointing and the only " back mark " on our family vacation .
neutral	i made a reservation and got there to are that no one was at the parking_lot .
neutral	i called 0x and finally someone answered .
neutral	i just hope when .
neutral	i return this isn_'_t the same situation .
neutral	got v tense as entered info kept on having to be resubmitted .
neutral	will prob use again though , as like fact i can see all options at the same time
neutral	my first order was an ok experience .
neutral	my order arrived a day late from the estimated_arrival time .
neutral	the box was all beaten up , torn , and in really bad shape .
neutral	the first order i had to cancel .
neutral	i ordered food for my cats but after two_weeks and nothing , i canceled it .
neutral	the second order was for treats .
neutral	it went through very timely and was great .
neutral	so still on the fence for this company .
neutral	i suspect the backorder on the food was not the norm , they must of had a problem with the vendor .
neutral	but my cats still needed their food .
neutral	i haven_'_t been an animoto user for long , but so_far , i '_m pretty happy with the results .
neutral	the only_thing i wish animoto would provide is a simple white or black backdrop with nothing but a dissolve transition between images .
neutral	the closest thing to it is the simplicity theme , but there '_s still odd effects going on behind the images that i find very distracting .
neutral	i like a clean , simple look and the moment when animoto provides me with that , i '_ll be 000_% satisfied .
neutral	as it is , i '_m looking strongly at other services that can provide this feature for a similar price .
neutral	i was pleased to see that the tayberry mucker boots were slightly_cheaper on line than they were in a local garden_centre .
neutral	easy to order and fast delivery ...... however , i was disappointed to find that i had been sent the ' wrong_colour ' which was ' ever so ' clearly described on the order form .... although this was sorted by your customer_service & a pre_- paid return_label was emailed to me , it still meant i had to drive to another town to take the boots to a collection_point and wait for another pair to be delivered ....... not what i expect when ordering from home !
neutral	!
neutral	i had to fly to boston on a whim to visit my sick brother .
neutral	while running my shop , looking for people to watch it while i was gone , and all the chaos of my brother '_s health , i did not have time to obsess about my flight .
neutral	the flight was actually terrible and inconvenient , taking hours to get to boston , but it sure was easy to book !
neutral	i '_ve chosen you for my daughter '_s prom_dress 0 years in a row because of your fabulous selection and reasonable exchange_policy .
neutral	last_year the size we ordered fit , so no problem .
neutral	this year , we had to exchange for a larger_size ...
neutral	it took days , numerous_emails and several phone_calls to achieve .
neutral	the hassle seemed so unnecessary ... it was a very simple transaction .
neutral	a little_disappointing , but we still love the dress .
neutral	i order from moddeals a lot , most of my clothes come from there .
neutral	i was just very disappointed in customer_service recently .
neutral	i never needed to return or exchange anything before . i needed to exchange jeans for a smaller_size and customer_service was extremely_rude and no help at all .... she said pay to return them and then order smaller ones and pay shipping again .
neutral	that '_s all she said !
neutral	people with that attitude will stop me from shopping that site ever again !
neutral	i booked a flight to luxembourg for my mother , but was unable to add a suitcase to the booking , though an_email sent a day later offered me the option ....
neutral	it was very frustrating getting the rxs to your company since you would not accept a fax .
neutral	if it wasn_'_t for the fact that i had extra of some of my dogs meds , my dog would have run_out of her meds because of the time it took for the rxs to be processed by mail delivery .
neutral	i ordered a motor mount and ball jount assembly arm for my 0000_saab .
neutral	to be shipped by ground .
neutral	the price was fair .
neutral	i knew ground shipping would be slow , so i waited about two_weeks .
neutral	then i started checking on my parts .
neutral	tracking showed that the parts came to within 00_miles of my location , but was returned to sender .
neutral	i spoke with eparts as to why my parts failed to deliver .
neutral	they could not give me a firm explaination as to what occured .
neutral	but assured_me my acccount would be refunded .
neutral	still to be double_checked .
neutral	i placed a second order .
neutral	this time , i placed it with one dat delivery .
neutral	wal ' la , the next_day my eparts were on my door steps .
neutral	these parts are being installed as i write .
neutral	how or why my location can be found in less_than 00hrs opposed to 0_weeks ??
neutral	?
neutral	item was arrived and was exactly as_pictured .
neutral	t
neutral	the body was a little long for a 0 ' 0 " size 00 which_meant to avoid gapping i had to shorten the body from the shoulder seam and this meant i could examine the contruction which wasn_'_t great but overall fully acceptable for a reasonable price .
neutral	i couldn_'_t make it for the price charged !
neutral	to be perfectly honest had i not been unwell when the christmas_tree was delivered , ( which was extremely prompt ), i would have sent it back as on opening , i was very disappointed with the quality , four pieces of branch had actually broken off completely and as we erected it lots of little bits kept falling_off and did so every day just as if we had had a real tree !
neutral	after packing away for next year i really dont_know how it is going to look as it already seems rather tatty and worn .
neutral	might have expected this had my tree been cheap but this tree certainly wasn_'_t cheap even after being on offer .
neutral	on saying all of this once it was decorated and covered with lights it did look beautiful and a few of my family commented on how nice it looked .
neutral	i ordered a few things for my son to go on his gap year after being recommended by you .
neutral	i paid for fastest delivery but sadly i was not at home when the delivery man came , which was quite late in the afternoon .
neutral	so rather_than leave the package in a safe place he took it away .
neutral	on the monday he then came late again and so we were already at the airport when he came .
neutral	i think maybe you could use a different courier company or on your website you could have the option of instructions if one is not at home as most internet shopping websites do .
neutral	we rented a small storage area in the lombardy u - haul a couple of months back .
neutral	we decided to take_advantage of the 0 free month .
neutral	we had also rented a truck at that time .
neutral	for what ever reason , they took $_00 out of our account for the free 0st months rental .
neutral	when we complained they reversed the charge but it took almost a month to get our money back .
neutral	every_penny counts when you move , i didn_'_t have extra money to be tied up for a month .
neutral	otherwise , the storage_facility was okay .
neutral	the only problem was that the lights were on a motion sensor by our unit , it was the only form of light ( it was in indoor unit ) and it would only stay on for a few_minutes or not come on at all .
neutral	the prices are better_than going to a local_store but i bought two pair of sunglasses this year and both were on backorder and i had to wait weeks to get them .
neutral	they were two different brands also .
neutral	so if you want the price you may have to wait to get them .
neutral	after_contacting customer_service by phone and email i received great assistance .
neutral	however , when i placed my order over a week_ago no one ever contacted me to say that it was on hold because there was no prescription .
neutral	that is awful follow - up !
neutral	i would say that i have yet to view my leather gloves that i bought bc of the packaging .
neutral	with that being said the packaging that it was delivered in was hard to open and i had no_idea what to expect .
neutral	when i trying to open it ripped the side of skinny flat package the gloves came in ...
neutral	awesome !
neutral	not !
neutral	basically the original package sucks for the amount i paid for these gloves .
neutral	not happy .
neutral	i also read_reviews about upgrading to the nine dollar packaging but it was also said that it was not really worth it ?
neutral	this is a xmas gift it would be nice if you stated what the original package came in and looked like .
neutral	i can '_t rate gloves i can '_t see w the naked eye or feel !
neutral	on a positive_note it was a pretty quick delivery if i had a choice now i would have just paid the nine dollars .
neutral	age takes it '_s toll and trying to get this for someone_else was a minefield , but managed in the end !
neutral	do you ever look at this ?
neutral	that comment was made - a week_ago .
neutral	am not amused to have to pay so much for an extra day on existing policy .
neutral	b guttridge
neutral	nice service but mistakes were made twice in the booking .
neutral	someone was left off the booking and another person included twice .
neutral	i emailed then the mistakes the 0st time which included a pricing error and then the 0nd time they had fixed the original mistakes but made others .
neutral	they were nice to speak with but the mistakes were surprising
neutral	restocking_fee of 00_% is too high .
neutral	i ordered a king_size sanderson set as my daughter had 0 sanderson sets she had bought from the bedeck outlet at gretna green and both were very soft and excellent quality .
neutral	i washed my new set twice as i usually do with new bedding and it came out of the dryer really creased and needing ironing ? i have never ironed my dorma bedding i own or any other bedding for that fact ?
neutral	once on my bed if i sit on it it creases really badly and it looks a mess .
neutral	i phoned to complain and spoke to a woman with an irish accent who was rude and very impatient , so much so i decided not to send it back and just live with it because i thought if that was their attitude at bedeck i could not be bothered with dealing_with them over a complaint .
neutral	it has put me off ordering bedding online and from now on i will purchase in store .
neutral	order 000 £ worth of items last_week and everything was great until the day of delivery .
neutral	it '_s curbside delivery mind you , so two people needed to receive the items .
neutral	my husband and i spend the whole day waiting for the driver and no one turns up .
neutral	next_morning on the train to work i get a phone_call telling_me the driver run_out of time and he will come today instead and i need to make_sure there are two people waiting for him .
neutral	no time given , no phone_call when the delivery failed , the huge stress trying to sort something out for the unplanned delivery and unpaid day off work for my husband , all for nothing !
neutral	thanks better_bathrooms - not .
neutral	you could at_least refund the cost of delivery to make up for it !!
neutral	taking 0 days to respond to my email_saying you will send my comments to the delivery company does not qualify as a good customer_service either .
neutral	do i recommend them - no , there are plenty of other online companies who value their customers in a better way .
neutral	goldstar is a so so service , a lot of times you get terrible seats and the fees are high making the savings tiny but occasionally you will pay less and see something great .
neutral	having been told they would phone half_hour before i had to phone them when the allocated time_slot had gone by .
neutral	they got the fitter to ring me and he apologised for delay which was over an_hour late .
neutral	he was great when he arrived and explained that the person for my area had to cover for staff sickness .
neutral	i would given more stars if they had phoned first thing and said they would be late as i waited from 0 . 00am for a call and they arrived at 0 . 00pm
neutral	contacting you after logging in is not working .
neutral	also the email you sent to be to rate my products is not opening at the link you sent .
neutral	now the site is being ridiculous saying i was not logged in when i certainly am .
neutral	what '_s going on ?
neutral	this was our first go at using one of these services so i don_'_t have anything to compare it with but positives : the guy on the phone was friendly , helpful and honest in terms of timings .
neutral	the price was very competative .
neutral	negatives they were a little late at pick_up and drop_off and someone had left a mcdonalds bag in the car which i didn_'_t appreciate .
neutral	i think pick_up lateness ( only 0 - 0 minutes ) might have been us getting there quicker_than they anticipated .
neutral	when we got back the guy_who was dropping the car was new and was waiting in the wrong place - again the delay was around 00_mins so not terrible by any means .
neutral	everyone i delt with at the company was very polite and friendly and helpful .
neutral	only issue had with wowcher is they took my money twice for a trip to barcelona which sent me over my overdraft & incurred me a 00 quid fine .
neutral	going to try & get it back as it was their error .
neutral	took a few calls to try & get the money reinstated too
neutral	disapointed for the product , but happy for service team .
neutral	the email advertising the plants listed one price but when you go to the sight the price is higher even for the the 0 or more price .
neutral	i sent an_email_asking why but never got a reply .
neutral	the plants are great they come quickly though box was beat up the customer_service is not great since the only response i got was to rate the order .
neutral	very good , excellent prices
neutral	i was really worried when i received the instructor edition of my math textbook .
neutral	i did not see on the site that i was buying the instructor edition .
neutral	when it arrived at my home i was disappointed .
neutral	be sure that when you buy from bookbyte . com that you are getting the student_edition , if that '_s the one you need .
neutral	i bought an item that said free delivery .
neutral	on receipt of goods the note with it said that £ 0 . 00 of the price was the delivery cost .
neutral	i have emailed to query this but as of yet i still have had no reply .
neutral	other than that the item was ok ( i did expect better quality for price but taking off the delivery charge would be right for price ) and the delivery was fast .
neutral	one pair of pyjamas were excellent , the fabric was good , and i felt they were good quality , the other pair however ( for a girl ) were thin , flimsy , and felt poor quality .
neutral	both pairs of pyjamas were labelled as from the same company , but felt as if they were made by different companies .
neutral	they were both a similar price however and not expensive at all .
neutral	i ordered two rose plants and when i opened the box one was beautiful the other looked as though it had taken a beating .
neutral	after planting the beautiful one is still the same the beaten one is pathetic .
neutral	customer_service rep says give it a month then we will talk about replacement / refund .
neutral	disappointed .
neutral	been using partsgeek for years and have grown tolerant but frustrated by the inaccurate low resolution pics , inadequate , incorrect vague descriptions , that dominate the site .
neutral	just correctly ordered a part for the right side suspension , but incorrectly got the left side part instead .
neutral	most frustrating is that there is no easy way to communicate .
neutral	i have been considering switching to another more customer friendly parts source .
neutral	usually book trips through_travelocity with good service .
neutral	first time booking a cruise with them we missed out on 000 '_s of dollars in on board credits and cruise cash .
neutral	when booking direct with the cruise line as done on previous trips , the communication and follow_up was a lot more user_friendly as travelocity offered no follow_up to give us a second opportunity to grab the promotional_items before time ran_out .
neutral	some great deals to be had and faster delivery than the big or company i sometimes buy from .
neutral	but the frequency of emails and the misleading sub titles , that at first grab my attention but then i realize that the sale isn_'_t really that great , are annoying .
neutral	please do not send me a request for a review before you delivered the products i have ordered .
neutral	what do expect me to say ?
neutral	how about , " where are my braces ?"
neutral	the parts were great got here in a good amount of time .
neutral	however i was disappointed with having to pay two_separate $ 0 shipping fees equaling $_00 .
neutral	not only is $ 0 high for suck a cheap part , but having to pay it twice made my experience even worse .
neutral	i have been asked to fill_out a survey about my raw_food purchase , but i have not received the delivery yet .
neutral	i think someone is a little too eager with their surveys !
neutral	it would be nice to know an order had been canceled with an_email notification rather_than waiting around to see it in your account .
neutral	great pricing and availability of products , though .
neutral	okay so the coffee_pods seem fine so_far .
neutral	i ordered quite a variety and have only sampled one flavor so_far .
neutral	the biscotti i ordered arrived broken and are stale .
neutral	i also ordered a descaler and it didn_'_t arrive although i was charged for it .
neutral	haven_'_t contacted the company directly but hope they read this and contact me first !
neutral	i will be super impressed if that happens !
neutral	irmatorvet udemærker sig ved at der_er adgang til fødevare af høj kvalitet .
neutral	hjemmesiden er dog noget langsom , og_der_er behov for re - sortering hvergang du går ind på_en_ny underside ( ex . vis hvis_man er interesseret i økologiske varer )
neutral	this was my first attempt at ordering dog_food over the internet .
neutral	purchasing this special brand usually requires a 00 - 00 drive , so i thought i ' d try the web to see if it saved time and / or $.
neutral	the petsmart cost for this food is $_00 plus tax for a 00_lb_bag .
neutral	the petflow price was , even after a $_00 discount , about $ 0 more because of the delivery charge .
neutral	it took about a week for it to arrive .
neutral	because of the delay and extra_cost , for me to try this again , i would have to be unable to get to the pet_food store .
neutral	it would be worthwhile if i were elderly or ill and couldn_'_t drive .
neutral	it was helpful having the 00 #_bag brought up the stairs to my home .
neutral	hi !
neutral	this was my first order through petbest .
neutral	i was really excited about it , but as i '_m sure you know , first_impressions are extremely important .
neutral	i live in virginia so the shipping is 0 days - totally understandable !
neutral	however , the delivery man didn_'_t know where to deliver it because my unit number was not printed on the shipping label .
neutral	he knew what building but had no_idea what floor !
neutral	he went_above and beyond to knock on doors and called my cell_phone .
neutral	i had also ordered 0 cow '_s ears .
neutral	i was shocked to see that i paid the same price for 0 completely different_sizes .
neutral	one was quite large and the other sooooo itty bitty .
neutral	of course , these come in different_sizes , but kind of leaves the customer a bit alarmed to see such a discrepancy in size and no difference in value .
neutral	the chair is nice and comfortable but after a week it started making a clunking sound when rocked .
neutral	this website has some really great card designs .
neutral	the service is generally prompt .
neutral	however , i have experienced the following problems : a nasty customer_service rep , no response to email inquiries and a frequently malfunctioning website .
neutral	when i mention this to tech_support , they always deny it .
neutral	in short , good product but poor customer_service .
neutral	i chose big kitchen due to the price and variety of products available .
neutral	i chose a date for delivery that was convenient to my builders , as we were having a new_kitchen fitted .
neutral	i emailed to ask what the eta was , to which i received a reply to say the order had got lost in the system , and there would be no delivery !
neutral	after putting my foot down , they eventually agreed to call the courier back so that it would be delivered the next_day , which is was .
neutral	the products were spot on and the delivery driver was very helpful .
neutral	i would recommend this company , however i would call a couple of daya before to make_sure that delivery happens on time
neutral	buying cards in large denominations was very quick and easy .
neutral	the personalization was lovely and the cards arrived when promised .
neutral	on the downside , the billing_address to use the cards was the purchasers address , when it should have been the recipient '_s .
neutral	additionally , the 00_% automatic up charge put on any charge that * might * be a restaurant or salon or spa makes it very difficult to use the full value of the cards .
neutral	in my case , the cruise ship charges for excursions , which are fixed costs , were automatically up charged .
neutral	so that 00_%, added up over time and various purchases , made it virtually_impossible to ever use the full value of the card .
neutral	and there is no atm option .
neutral	use wisely and read the toc closely .
neutral	side_note : customer care responded quickly but unsympathetically to the concern about the up charges .
neutral	how you send it to me partial fedex and then when the order got to grove port oh which is 0 hours away , it then got shipped by usps and arrived to me via_usps ?
neutral	it should have been sent the whole way via_fedex and then you guys want me to send it back via_fedex .
neutral	this will factor if i rent from you guys again .
neutral	after_reading the reviews and working with global_airport_parking service i would attempt to use them again as they are very nice and understanding but i would definitely have to let others know to be aware of the parking situation at the clarion hotel site since our car was broken into and it was a horrible ending to a wonderful vacation
neutral	my order was dispatched vey quickly , which was very much_appreciated but once i checked my order it was not suitable .
neutral	after almost a week i am still_awaiting information on how to return so will just have to put a note in the original packaging asking for a refund and then check my account to see if this happens .
neutral	very disppointed !
neutral	smashinn took almost 0_weeks to deliver a product that i was under the impression would take 0 week .
neutral	they offered a 0 %_discount , but after a negotiation i opted for grips instead .
neutral	i received a pack of thin grips that is useless and this just made me even angrier .
neutral	i don_'_t think i will use them again .
neutral	i got everything i wanted but was unhappy when my barns and nobels gift_card arrived and it had a $_00 on the front .
neutral	i was planning to give as a gift and wish i had been able to see the actual card before purchasing .
neutral	it just looked a little cheap .
neutral	i ended_up buying a card using the card from the retailer .
neutral	otherwise great price and fast delivery .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	i oreded a part but it never came .
neutral	now i have been waiting foe over a week haven_'_t goten it yet .
neutral	not at all i was writting about my experince
neutral	upon purchasing a dishwasher i was disappointed that it was left to me to chase up delivery 0_weeks_later .
neutral	as soon as i made contact i was told i could arrange delivery date but unsure why i should need to chase for this .
neutral	the lady i spoke to seemed completely unclear on anything initially asking me if i rang the right company when i gave her the reference_number on the order then put me on hold for some time before coming_back time and answering the phone as if i were a new customer .
neutral	she proceeded to laugh that she ' d forgotten i was on hold and told me there was no sign of me on their systems .
neutral	after another bizarre conversation with this person she eventually set a delivery date .
neutral	i '_m intrigued as to whether this dishwasher will actually show up on the day she gave_me !
neutral	they certainly win for the least professional customer_service i '_ve ever_dealt_with !
neutral	let '_s hope quality of product makes up for it , 0_weeks after i ordered it .
neutral	the order was prompt .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	however , i thought that i was ordering regular greenies and i received jumbo instead .
neutral	i can make do , but it is not what i wanted .
neutral	its alright if it was better
neutral	but i was not at all happy with my purchases .
neutral	first i ordered a mrs . claus costume - it was very ill - fitting .
neutral	it was short waisted - actually the waistline was just under my boobs , which was very uncomfortable .
neutral	the apron straps would not stay up and had to be pinned .
neutral	however the kids loved the costume , so that is all that matters !
neutral	but the wig would not fit at all !!
neutral	it would not go on my head , so i had to rush out at the last_minute and buy another one .
neutral	that was my fault - i should have tried it on earlier but who thought an adult wig would be too small for an adult !
neutral	however the shipping was fast ; the prices are reasonable , and maybe it is because i am only 0 ' 0 " that the costume did not fit well .
neutral	as i said before , the kids loved " mrs claus " and said my dress was beautiful , and as long as they are happy , that '_s all that matters .
neutral	would i buy from halloween_costumes again ?
neutral	probably !
neutral	great location , in the marais district .
neutral	very central , within walking_distance to central paris .
neutral	great cafes and restaurants next door .
neutral	stylish apartment but beds very uncomfortable , double_bed was like sleeping on concrete !
neutral	sofa_bed mattress too thin !
neutral	very uncomfortable .
neutral	all had back pain after our stay , such a basic requirement a comfortable bed but sadly missing !
neutral	the ceiling height in the bedroom / bathroom very low .
neutral	five foot 0 ".
neutral	no mention if this on the all paris apartment website !
neutral	totally unsuitable for children , railing with no guard !
neutral	no one called or emailed to tell me my order would be late .
neutral	despite several telephone_calls , no one came out to fit my shoes .
neutral	i finally took the hint after several weeks and started to wear them .
neutral	i got the bill from medicare , and for what you are getting paid , your service should be better .
neutral	this is my second pair of shoes from this company , and compared to the first time , this was a disappointment .
neutral	pick - up of rental_car in bath , england , went well , although we were surprised no maps were provided .
neutral	car performed flawlessly for the 0 - week trip through england , wales , and scotland .
neutral	returning the car in york was another story .
neutral	we had a great deal of difficulty locating the actual site for drop - off .
neutral	our voucher indicated to return the car to the train_station in york , which sounded easy to find .
neutral	not the case .
neutral	reportedly the city limits signs visible on the street , so the actual site was difficult to find .
neutral	clear_directions at the time of rental as to exactly where to return the car would have been helpful and saved us a lot of frustration .
neutral	shipping was very fast but i had ordered only one item but received a box of four of the same item .
neutral	tried to contact stockwiseauto via their phone_number to inform them of the over shipment but found that all you could do is leave a message that is converted to an_email to their customer_service department .
neutral	i opted instead to send an actual email and received one response that said that their warehouse would look into it and get back to me .
neutral	instead what i received was an_email from fedex stating that i had a return_label from " proparts " that i needed to print out .
neutral	not knowing if this was legitimate , i sent another email requesting confirmation by a phone_call that this was indeed their company .
neutral	stockwiseauto responded only by email that the email from fedex was from them but no phone_call as i requested .
neutral	considering that i was returning $_000 worth of parts that they would not have even known about if i hadn_'_t contacted them , i felt they could at_least make a phone_call to discuss and confirm how this package would be returned - a quicker , more professional and personal way of communicating with their customers .
neutral	i can '_t rate it yet because i have not used it .
neutral	customer_service on the phone seems clear and pertinent .
neutral	it was a good customer experience in that the delivery came on time - but a bit disappointed with the product which just seems a bit dull and not sexy at all .
neutral	most of the deals are reasonable but i know if i search ' online shopping malls ' like ebay , i can get deals like these any day , although the searches do take time .
neutral	also , the clothes you offer are always small sizes , we are not a nation of midgets !
neutral	try japan ...
neutral	also , where are all the ' points ' i was promised , no points and two ' wowchers ' expired with no credit .... that '_s more owch than wowch !
neutral	실시간으로 예약 자리가 얼마나 남았는지 알 수 있어서 좋았습니다 .
neutral	그러나 예약을 하고 결제를 한 후에도
neutral	예약한 리조트와 숙박기간 요금의 확인 내용이 뜨지 않은 것은
neutral	좀 불편하네요
neutral	결제 전 확인할 수 있게끔 한 번 더 보여 준다면 더 편하게
neutral	이용할 수 있겠습니다 .
neutral	ok , fine i give you my work number - not for you to call and ask me to proceed with my application online ...
neutral	i can '_t_believe it why would you do that ?
neutral	i declined the cell_phone_call for a reason and now you ' re calling my desk !
neutral	ughhh embarrassing !
neutral	unfortunately delivery was a disaster as the table was forgotten - not sure who by !!
neutral	final products are all great and fantastic value though .
neutral	they never seem to have anything in stock .
neutral	their ability to properly locate and address is poor on restricted items .
neutral	when they have things in stock they do ship quickly but they almost never have items in stock .
neutral	sparkly watch_strap snapped and the cotton dress arms ripped in matter of minutes of wearing .
neutral	so need to return .
neutral	the pink skater dress is fine great material and stretchy good quality .
neutral	unlike the cotton dress .
neutral	the rose gold watch is great no_problems with that just need to get altererd as big strap .
neutral	i am missing parts .
neutral	otherwise it is a good place for parts .
neutral	i have not received the product yet .
neutral	as soon as i get it and try it , i will be more than happy to rate you .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	all was good with car , but we were made to be very very late for an_appointment because of the 0 / 0 hour wait for shuttle pick_up !!!!
neutral	no apology or explanation ....
neutral	so sad too bad attitude from driver .
neutral	multiple small scrapes and dents were not included on the sign out form and we had to push to get them included - this made us even later .
neutral	on returning the car , a previously mended chip in the windscreen was tried to be blamed on us ...
neutral	thank_goodness a windscreen company was there to confirm it was an old repair .
neutral	booking process was fine , they just need pick_up their act !
neutral	it would seem that the online system does not actually keep_up with what is in stock .
neutral	ellis brigham took payment for items that were not in stock .
neutral	they did however advise and refund me promptly but in this day and age things like that should not happen .
neutral	if other stores can ensure their online system reflects what is in the warehouse - why can '_t ellis brigham ?
neutral	the service regarding the other items that i ordered was fine .
neutral	uplay was pretty poor when it started , but ubisoft are cleaning up their act these days .
neutral	the collection of games on the site has improved massively of late , and even includes some that weren_'_t developed by ubi .
neutral	ubisoft have also relaxed their drm policies for many of their games .
neutral	there are still some problems , however - their online play is flaky and it can be difficult to get some of the games to work .
neutral	still , the service is improving and i '_m glad that i have an account .
neutral	i have had a hotmail account since the early days of the service , and i still use it even today .
neutral	the interface is perfectly serviceable for webmail , and the email address itself is fine in a nostalgic kind of way ( i '_m not one to look down on any of the free email account providers - a domain is a domain in my eyes , and i know how annoying it can be to have to try to migrate to a new account and persuade people to stop using the old one ).
neutral	the only_thing that i dislike about the service is the amount of spam it gets - the webmail spam filters aren_'_t that useful , and it '_s annoying to download a lot of junk on a metered connection .
neutral	if i were creating a new email address today i ' d go for one with better spam filtering .
neutral	i ordered online deluxe " spring chicken " - blue irises with other flowers in the picture being yellow .
neutral	i live abroad so haven_'_t seen a picture of them yet but they ' re definitely not blue or yellow flowers !
neutral	apparently there are nine red roses and then filled out with pink carnations .
neutral	hmmm .
neutral	not what i was hoping for .
neutral	personally , i hate carnations and try never to send them - a cheap flower in my opinion .
neutral	they did remember the accompanying vase though .
neutral	even the message on my card stated my mum '_s " a spring chicken "!
neutral	so i guess i '_ll be calling to ask what happened ........
neutral	i clicked on free delivery and was not aware it was second class postage .
neutral	it was not clear and i would never have gone for the free delivery .
neutral	it took_forever to arrive and it caused me a lot of stress because it was a present for my secret_santa .
neutral	it arrived the day i should have gave my secret_santa but it may just as well not arrived .
neutral	there was no way of chasing it and when i called the helpdesk . customer_service they were not interested .
neutral	they just said it was second class and it could take up to 0 days .
neutral	good prices on books .
neutral	usually one of the cheaper sites to use , but not very orderly .
neutral	i '_ve been over charged twice .
neutral	i really hate how you have to email their customer_support_team .
neutral	what business doesn_'_t have a customer_service phone_number to contact someone directly ?
neutral	overall , i would use the site again only if they had the lowest_prices compared to other_sites .
neutral	the greeting was great when i walked through the door .
neutral	the salesman richard was nice .
neutral	what i did not like was all the back & forth from this person to that person to another person .
neutral	i arrived there at 00 :_00pm & didn_'_t leave with my vehicle until 0 :_00pm .
neutral	i went to drive time only because it was my last option in purchasing a vehicle .
neutral	another negative is that the girl nicole setup up an insurance_policy for me through geico which was nice but she also setup automatic withdrawals from my acct without my permission ( i found that out the next_day when i received an_email from geico ) & i had no_idea what my deductible is & still trying to find out this info 0 days_later .
neutral	the girl that took my money order need an attitude adjustment .
neutral	i guess if i was just a cashier i '_ll have an attitude as well .
neutral	on a positive_note , i am happy with my vehicle .
neutral	i have had some good experience and some not so good experience with global .
neutral	my last experience in palm_beach was a good one .
neutral	i clearly_stated that this order be shipped to my home address and used our business address for the billing !
neutral	sure enough , it went to our business .
neutral	it is and was not convenient for it to be shipped there for many reasons !!
neutral	!
neutral	booked through ryan air .
neutral	nice , friendly staff but add £ 0 to exit car_park and took 00_mins to pick_up .
neutral	no reviews to look at .
neutral	i wanted this to be delivered to my local_store to avoid delivery charges but was not given the option so had to pay .
neutral	i was disappointed with the purchase as i had brought fleeze tops at christmas with no problem .
neutral	my son however went to the nearest_town where there was a superdry supplier ( windsor ) and was issued with a credit note .
neutral	failing that , and not wanting the inconvenience i would have returned the item by post .
neutral	my son did redeem the voucher in another town .
neutral	i was thrilled with the first couple of orders of the champion washable underpads .
neutral	however , the quality has changed .
neutral	they are lighter and thinner .
neutral	they are no better_than the competitor that i first ordered from and more_expensive .
neutral	i ordered two different_sizes and both had changed .
neutral	will not order any more .
neutral	i wanted a cd but dvd turned_up .
neutral	i couldn_'_t really work out from the website what it was so i ordered it in the hope that it was a cd but it turned_out to be a dcd .
neutral	for £ 0 . 00 i can '_t be bothered returning it but it '_s no use to me really .
neutral	it was pretty simple , but i would have preferred the option to pay with paypal .
neutral	i am not so comfortable entering my credit_card info online , yet i had no other choice .
neutral	and , $ 0 . 00 shipping and handling is a little_steep , 0 . 00 total to send this card .
neutral	i think it would probably have cost me less if i had purchased a gift_card in a store and mailed it myself .
neutral	i doubt i would use this service again .
neutral	i '_ve placed a few orders with supplementwarehouse . com .
neutral	shipping takes a little_longer_than_expected for how expensive it is .
neutral	never had a problem with the price matching , but it '_s annoying that it '_s not offered on all products .
neutral	my last order , the box was too small and so one of the powders i ordered ended_up popping open and spilled everywhere .
neutral	they replaced it no problem , but i had to wait for it to ship again .
neutral	just placed another order , already had an_issue with the promo_code ( wrote an_email and got a rude response ).
neutral	we '_ll see how long it takes , but seeing as though i had to pay 00 for shipping and my order has already been delayed for 0 days , i '_m not too happy .
neutral	the website promises that shipment will be mailed the next business day .
neutral	however , it is often not true .
neutral	multiple_times the shipment took about a week to ship .
neutral	no replies from customer_service when attempting to contact them .
neutral	impossible to reach anyone by phone .
neutral	would happily switch companies if there was a better , more reliable alternative .
neutral	they do have a nice selection , however the price for the same item has gone up several_times over the last couple of years .
neutral	all arrived quickly and packaged well and looks very tasty .
neutral	will comment more when i have started eating it !!
neutral	!
neutral	shipping took way too long
neutral	i got some compression_socks for my dad .
neutral	he really liked them because they had grippers on the bottom .
neutral	the price was cheaper_than what i could find in my local_stores and the ones in the stores did not have grippers .
neutral	however , the cost of the shipping made the price of the socks as much as the ones i could buy locally .
neutral	i do intend to buy more from easy comfort but will wait_until i have enough of an order for free_shipping .
neutral	parcel still not received
neutral	having been using travelocity for yrs to make various reservations .
neutral	have always been happy with them .
neutral	had an incident with my honeymoon cruise vacation that was not dealt_with and the customer_service person i called while out of the country was rude and did not offer any help .
neutral	very disappointing after being a very loyal_customer for so long .
neutral	you ' re prices are too expensive for one call .
neutral	maybe a bit cheaper would be better
neutral	it was a very hot day in london and there were big crowds .
neutral	no air_conditioning on the bus down below .
neutral	crowd control ( preventing people from getting on as you ' re getting off with elderly_parents and small_children ) not very good ; inexplicable delays trying to get back to the start point at the end of the trip ; diversions that were in place due to works at buckingham_palace not properly explained .
neutral	the drivers and staff on board the bus were very , very good .
neutral	i received my 000 cartridges in a very short time .
neutral	however , it '_s a good thing that i opened them for installment while over my desk or i would have had ink all over my white carpet .
neutral	my hands did get all full of ink .
neutral	also , the ink seems to run a bit when i copy something ,.
neutral	it could be my printer but i did not have that problem using hp_cartridges .
neutral	i ordered 0 bags of dog_food and 0 bags of treats on august_00th and my order didn_'_t arrive until september00th .
neutral	i called on sept 0rd to see when my order would ship since i dind '_t received a shipping confirmation and the customer serveice rep said it was going out that day .
neutral	i then called back on the 0th and had to speak to a manager because i still didn ; t received my order .
neutral	he informed me that my order had not shipped but would get to the bottom as to why .
neutral	he was extremely_helpful and returned my call as he said he would with the good news that my order would be going out the next_day .
neutral	all in all great concept and idea had my order come as it was suppose to .
neutral	* the site location for both pick_up in madrid and drop_off location in barc .
neutral	were very difficult to find .
neutral	it is not enough to just look up the address on google or mapquest .
neutral	* there was an_additional_charge for picking_up at a train_station which they charged at drop_off that i was not told of when i make the reservation and when i paid for the rental at the time of pick_up !!
neutral	!
neutral	* and finally , we arrived in the area of the drop_off at 0 pm ( when scheduled ) but spent another 00_minutes trying to find the office , and was told that they were to close in 00_minutes ( 0pm ) although on the reservation the time of closure was stated at 0pm .
neutral	( this would have been a huge problem in that we would not have known where to drop the car off .
neutral	i have no_complaints about the service , it was prompt , friendly , and overall very good .
neutral	regarding the glasses , they arrived fast and the frames were what i expected .
neutral	my prescription was correct .
neutral	however , for some_reason the lenses reflect light which is a bit_annoying .
neutral	the fit was also a bit loose .
neutral	since frames_direct is located so_far away i will not bother sending them back ; i will just go to a local_optometrist to have them adjusted and ask if they can fix the reflection in the lenses .
neutral	overall , i took a chance and thought i would try ordering glasses online to see what it was like .
neutral	the customer_service aspect of frames_direct was great .
neutral	personally , i will not be ordering online again as i like to be able to see what i am getting directly , and if anything is wrong with the glasses they can be fixed directly instead of shipping them and waiting .
neutral	edit - september 00 , 0000
neutral	i '_ve changed my review from 0 to 0_stars .
neutral	as you can see the company said they would contact me to fix the problem but it has_been 0_weeks and no one has contacted me .
neutral	this does not really affect me much as i said above i intend to go to a local_optometrist to get the problem fixed , but it might help some of you regarding customer_service information .
neutral	so much for speedy_delivery .
neutral	took a week not a few_days like we expected .
neutral	since the part was for a work vehicle .
neutral	we couldn_'_t use it for the week waiting on the part & the day it took to have tbe part installed .
neutral	i '_ve shopped through_quidco quite a bit , laterooms . com always excellent , and others great but it seems the higher the offer , the longer you have to wait for cash_back .
neutral	vodafone we haven_'_t got our £_000 cash - back after the purchase of a contract phone .
neutral	we '_ve tried our best to make an enquiry claim through_quidco , but it comes up not found , even_though it '_s on my list of buyers .
neutral	so disappointed there , we wouldn_'_t have bothered with the contract had there not been the offer .
neutral	we feel_duped .
neutral	but suppose quidco can '_t pick the companies that use them .
neutral	i have ordered before and been reasonably happy with my tools to live with my disabilities but this time the gripper i ordered is junk .
neutral	i have had two before and worn them out using them for lifting and picking_up everything , this one was more_expensive and supposedly a better quality and color .
neutral	it doesn_'_t work with the lock for gripping not releasing and the lock to keep it open , not staying locked .
neutral	really bad quality .
neutral	i always have trouble_finding bras and swimsuits that actually fit right .
neutral	figleaves always had great products !
neutral	however , i have tried contacting them via_email about an_issue several_months_ago and no one ever responded .
neutral	terrible , terrible customer_service .
neutral	i have started_using nordstrom '_s more because of this ( they also carry my size just not as big a selection ).
neutral	i decided to go with envirofone as_opposed to muzuma as i was being offered £ 0 more for my iphone0 ...
neutral	however when i compare my experience with friends it seems that envirofone takes a lot longer to process your payment .
neutral	i waited over a week from start to finish causing me to panic about beibg conned - whilst friends using muzuma found that it only took 0 days !
neutral	i was pleased with the price i got for the phone however and the emails_updating me .
neutral	the part came relatively quickly however it was not compatible with my car despite stating that it was on the order page .
neutral	they accepted my return without hassle but i had to pay shipping back to them for a part they said would fit and did not .
neutral	well the welds went on my cross_trainer .
neutral	i couldn_'_t send picture from mobile as it wouldn_'_t send .
neutral	the only oher option is for them to send someone out to take it away so it can be inspected , then they will decide what to do .
neutral	very long process when you are moving in a couple of months .
neutral	bloke on phone was lovely but it doesn_'_t really help me .
neutral	so when i move i will just buy a better cross_trainer from argos as at_least you can just take it back for replacement or a refund .
neutral	shame really as delivery was quick , i just like things to happen now .
neutral	my only_complaint is that the price kept going up even while i was booking the trip .
neutral	also had a hard time getting the return date right .
neutral	the price started out at $_000 and ended_up being $_000
neutral	i just love that i get discounts almost every weekend through delivery . com .
neutral	the ui isn_'_t as finessed as other online food ordering sites , but i '_m ok with it if i pay less .
neutral	had to exchange beach shoes .
neutral	the lady was quite abrupt and unhelpful in time_frame for exchange goods and i had to chase up the exchange .
neutral	it took about 00 days which i think is too long with no communications .
neutral	but the initial purchase was very good and initial delivery was very fast .
neutral	i needed the items i ordered on a very short timeline and the website made it very easy for me to do the design and order process quickly from my computer .
neutral	when the mugs arrived though the actual print quality wasn_'_t great .
neutral	it wasn_'_t awful , but it did distort the look of the fonts we purchased for this brand which matters .
neutral	oddly , the complex logo printed perfectly , but the fonts were fuzzy ?
neutral	i was happy to get some of your deals for a very cheap cheap price but i have also experienced luck of communication between myself , wowcher staff and companies .
neutral	i received an item that was not well sized , so i had to return it , because they didn_'_t have smaller numbers .
neutral	yep heinne is a great thing to buy stuff but and this is my 0nd order and there has_been something in both has_been while not wrong there is something that would make you twice about buying that actually one
neutral	first time it was leaky pen so there ink all_round the point
neutral	this time there are marking on a belt as if the leather not good leather
neutral	my dress was very badly made so i was very disappointed :-( the return process was very easy as it was prepaid and refund was very quick
neutral	when we left the car , the agency underwent a lack of staff .
neutral	the review of the car was not done they ask me to leave the car in the park without_any check .
neutral	that '_s why i asked for a call if they found anything .
neutral	they answered me it '_s out of the question ; they can '_t do it for anybody ...
neutral	br
neutral	i ordered a textbook and it arrived a couple days_later than the last day it said it would arrive .
neutral	it apparently was held up in oregon for about a week and i don_'_t know why .
neutral	disappointed that flowers were delivered one day earlier_than ordered
neutral	very good service .
neutral	i love the idea of gripad .
neutral	my hands are shredded from pullups , toes to bar , and deadlifts .
neutral	for deadlifts , the pads are great .
neutral	but i '_m a smaller woman and the pads are a little thick for gripping the pullup bar .
neutral	i feel_like i might slip off .
neutral	i '_m still using them hoping to break them down a little .
neutral	but try skinnier padding ... it might still work .
neutral	thanks
neutral	i have a hard time figuring_out how to work this system .
neutral	i '_m a senior_citizen with limited computer knowledge .
neutral	it '_s too cumbersome .
neutral	all i want is to know if someone checked me out and to find out what my credit rating is .
neutral	i '_m hoping i will be informed if someone accesses my credit .
neutral	i '_ll just wait a while and see .
neutral	have always found your service very good but really disappointed that you are now charging for delivery
neutral	firstly there was a problem with my order as i had paid with my partners paypal which i have never expeienced before ?
neutral	which was resolved after 0 phone_calls but if checked with paypal the money had been taken when i made the order so the problem couldnt have been that big yous took my money straight_away .
neutral	0nd i only recieved part of my order when i emailed regarding this i recieved a email_saying my whole order was on the delivery truck but a replacement would be sent which made me feel as if i was lying that i had only recieved part of my order , then the items took a further 0 days to arrive .
neutral	when you sent the order the package was not taped the ups person could of lost the item out of the box .......
neutral	check all orders before shipping out .
neutral	until next time thanks ..
neutral	malgré plusieurs erreurs ( du serveur ) soudaines survenues pendant la_commande , je_n ' ai_pas lâché , au final l ' effort en valait la chandelle .
neutral	i don_'_t_believe that whatever i say will change things .
neutral	i placed my order and paid the extra £ 0 . 00 to speed up the delivery .
neutral	i waited and waited for my order to arrive and eventually emailed beautybay to ask them if they could tell me when i could expect my order and also under the circumstances refund the £ 0 . 00 as it had been ineffective .
neutral	i received a standard , impersonal reply
neutral	' we ' re sorry to hear your order has taken longer_than_expected .
neutral	whilst we strive to excel in our delivery estimates , unfortunately our free saver delivery does not have guaranteed delivery dates or a tracking_number .
neutral	we do , however , offer a guaranteed tracked service , called next_day and we ' re the first beauty retailer to offer this expedited service for where the order value exceeds £_00 .
neutral	hopefully your order will arrive soon , but , if you need your beauty fixes quicker , be sure to use our next_day service in future '.
neutral	not particulary helpful !!
neutral	i eventually received my parcel with post_office tape around it .
neutral	if i had have removed the tape then there would have been a large gap at the bottom of the parcel .
neutral	this leads me to believe that the reason it took so long was shoddy packaging at the source .
neutral	i emailed beautybay again to let them know it had arrived and why i thought it had taken so long to arrive and i received the following reply
neutral	' we are glad you '_ve received your parcel and sorry for the delay by the postal service on this occasion .
neutral	we sincerely hope you enjoy your items '.
neutral	again they didn_'_t get the point .
neutral	i gave up at this point as life is too short but i did eventually get a final email from them saying that as a gesture of goodwill they would indeed refund my £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	hooray .
neutral	it '_s just a pity it took so long for them to try and appease a customer who will more than likely purchase again from the internet but who will probably use another company who is more customer friendly .
neutral	done !!
neutral	!
neutral	so , i didn_'_t realise at the time , but it seems i failed to fill_out the full delivery address , leaving off the first line .
neutral	rather_than contact me , the delivery drivers drove down the correct road on several_occasions , but since they didn_'_t have the first line of the address they couldn_'_t deliver .
neutral	making contact with the vendors proved to be impossible .
neutral	better communication channels required on both_sides :-(
neutral	la verdad q el bus esta bien , buenos comentarios t vas enterando de todo ...
neutral	pero para mi tuvo dos quejas grandes en comparacion con_la otra compañia d bus q era international bus o algo asi ... no haciamos mas q ver bus d la otra compañia y d la compañia nuestra eran excasos pocas paradas tardabamos mas en encontrar la parada q en estar en_el bus ... mientras q d la otra compañia veiamos autobuses y paradas por todos_los lados ....
neutral	mi otra queja va a que_el ultimo autobus es a las 0 : 00 mientras q d la otra compañia vimos hasta casi las 0 ...
neutral	ya_que los turistas tenemos pocos dias muchas veces para conocer londres no vendria d mas q tuvieran servicio hasta mas tarde .... por_lo menos una hora mas para q puedas ir dando una vuelta por londres desde el autobus
neutral	we had aaa_discount last_year , but this time when i use web_site to search my hotel price , they all cancel this code . i am so depress ...........
neutral	the glass was for my fire_pit and the guy had me order way too much .
neutral	i spent too much and its not being used .
neutral	i was not happy .
neutral	so now i have all this glass
neutral	christmas_present - so no opionion
neutral	i ordered ashley '_s augusta mattress from furniturepick .
neutral	three_weeks_later i received ashley '_s brisbane bay mattress .
neutral	not what i had ordered , and not as good as the augusta , but returning a mattress is too much of a hassle , so i stayed with it .
neutral	maybe if they had contacted me to let_me know that they did not have augusta , but were sending brisbane bay instead , i would not have minded , but to just send the wrong thing without informing_me is wrong .
neutral	the mattress is not as good as the one i ordered , but it '_s not bad either ...
neutral	after_placing an order on line having used your site before
neutral	i was offered the chance to pick a delivery date to suit me .
neutral	i clicked for delivery for the 00th_july
neutral	i then recieved a text at 0 . 00_pm stating my delivery was going to be delivered on a different day 00th_july .
neutral	i called 0 . 00 am in the morning explaining that no one could be available and was put on to deena harrow who informed me it was my fault and i should be grateful that she was going to waiver the redelivery charge .
neutral	i found her to be quite rude and arrogant , we have opened a trade account with you but not ever so sure if we will recommened our customers to you .
neutral	the materials we have purchased from you have been of a good quality .
neutral	as soon as i receive it i will let you know my opinion
neutral	i like the style and quality of your products but chose to return them via the shop , they were charming but informed me refunds are only given for postal returns .
neutral	i think this is rather outdated and will make me think_twice about using superdry in future
neutral	my product did not arrive after ten days .
neutral	i called to inquire and was told it did not ship because it was out of stock .
neutral	it would have been appreciated if i had been notified instead of waiting .
neutral	this is a clean facility and transaction to set_up storage was easy enough .
neutral	i had used the special pricing on line .
neutral	my only_complaint is the facility raised the price very quickly once they had our stuff in place .
neutral	i suppose they know once your are in you dont want to research and move your stuff again .
neutral	we ordered 0 bean_bags , a lovely lady phoned to organise delivery , ten_minutes later another lady phoned to say one colour wasn_'_t in .
neutral	thank_goodness i cancelled that one .
neutral	they arrived at the correct time , in 0 large boxes ... and i mean large boxes .... we ' d ordered extra large , they looked a comfortable size on the pictures .
neutral	they are as_described , but frankly if you were a student in a room , one would take up the majority of the room .
neutral	i think this was a big mistake , but having unpacked , and assembled them all , they are well made , exactly as sold , i can '_t really complain .
neutral	however may i suggest you look carefully at the size before you order ..
neutral	i wish i had .
neutral	spoke with a helpful lady on the phone who understood my concerns that my barbour_hat had been sent in a padded_envelope with no plastic protective covering , looked dirty and did not seem waxed .
neutral	this would be resolved if i returned said hat .
neutral	a replacement was ordered [ not coming in time for my holiday ].
neutral	on my return , a replacement hat was waiting ........ no plastic_bag again .
neutral	hat has ' bits ' on it .
neutral	it might be the same hat returned .
neutral	i would still recommend to a friend just a bit annoyed at the moment as i ordered something a while ago and it st hasn_'_t come , contacted wowcher and had only automated_response .
neutral	they are usually good but not at the monent
neutral	extremely fast delivery , but would of liked more
neutral	choices in the size of dog_food for natural_balance .
neutral	also would of liked if they sold the small_bites version of natural_balance .
neutral	once it shipped , the wine arrived quickly and undamaged .
neutral	but it was a confusing process , since i never got an_email_confirmation for my order , and for several days just assumed that the order hadn_'_t gone_through at all .
neutral	then i got an_email with a tracking_number , saying my order had shipped .
neutral	then the order arrived .
neutral	then , i got an_email_saying " your wines are ready to go and will be shipped on our next scheduled shipping day ."
neutral	if they would add an order confirmation_email and send the status emails in the right order , then i would definitely add another star .
neutral	i have been using pet_flow now for 0 months ?
neutral	nice not to have to keep going to the pet_store but they don_'_t carry everything i need so still have to make a trip or 0 a month .
neutral	then they were out of my specific_brand , i tried to modify my order to have them send something_else .
neutral	thought i had done everything right but never did get my ' new ' order .
neutral	my daughter did not get her gift_card in time to use for lunch on her graduation day .
neutral	why ?
neutral	because the street name was left off of the envelope .
neutral	the card came to me three_days after graduation , and now i have to hand deliver it .
neutral	i always proof her address carefully because she_lives in dc and the street addresses are confusing .
neutral	for example , she_lives on 0000 n st , nw .
neutral	i was very disappointed that she did not receive it on time .
neutral	the card has not been used yet but it looks nice .
neutral	deals are good but too long a wait to receive them once redeemed .
neutral	absolutely_delighted with my desk from made . com
positive	very happy and would use you again
positive	i have purchased from festive_lights several sets of lights over the past 00 months .
positive	service is always efficient and friendly .
positive	delivery excellent - items received within 0 working days .
positive	good competitive_prices are on offer and especially useful is that the lights are inter - connectible .
positive	thank_you .

positive	safe , and secure buying .
positive	customer_service was very friendly and product was shipped quickly .
positive	i don_'_t think i '_ve ever done a review before but i '_ve dealt_with uk_juicers a couple of times now and have had nothing but helpful , friendly service and i feel that they deserve to be recognised for it because there '_s not enough friendly service out there these days , i would recommend them to anyone .
positive	the receptionist was very knowledgeable , helpful and above all very patient .
positive	nice to know that there are still companies that say " yes we have your product " and they mean what they say and can deliver within 0 days or less at a reasonable price .
positive	many_thanks for the service you have given us in obtaining the prd shower_valve we required .
positive	we ordered filters that we couldn_'_t find ready made for our rental property .

positive	i have 0 cats and keep their litter box in a small room off the bathroom and clean it daily but there '_s still a smell .
positive	i have tried many products to keep the odors in check including volcano rock , sprays , stick ups and more .
positive	i saw the oreck pureair odor eliminating offer in the paper and decided to give it a try .
positive	i love it !!
positive	the fresh linen meltables smell wonderful and get_rid of the litter smell .
positive	it '_s so easy to use .
positive	just turn it on and walk away .
positive	i don_'_t need to worry_about the dangers of candles or if the spray contains harmful chemicals .
positive	i would recommend this to anyone_who_wants to keep their home smelling fresh and clean !
positive	!
positive	looking for a specific dog_food not available in local_stores , i stumbled_across petflow . com .
positive	they offered the food i was seeking at a reasonable plus shipping was free !
positive	as my dog has grown i have found it easy to change types of food and delivery time .
positive	add i can add toys and treats as needed .
positive	great service , cheapest price , super_fast delivery
positive	i trawled the internet to find the best price for ray_ban aviators and i discovered vision_direct australia .
positive	within 0 days of ordering ( i live in sydney ), my aviators arrived carefully_packaged and in perfect_condition .
positive	in addition i was thrilled to receive a complimentary lens cleaning_kit - and best of all , a mini screwdriver to tighten those tiny screws that can sometimes work loose .
positive	the range of sunglasses available is very impressive and i have no_doubt that when summer finally comes i will revisit vision_direct for a new tortoiseshell style .
positive	they did exactly_what they said they would do delivered on time and quickly

positive	the clothes are amazing .
positive	my three favourite dresses are from boohoo !
positive	when you shop at boohoo you know most people wont have what you have bought unlike_other shops like primark where everyone has the same thing !!
positive	boohoo is amazing !
positive	this is the most amazing site - i have spent hours pouring over it , and will_continue to do so in years to come ...... it gives one the desire to lose_weight to wear these beautiful creations .......
positive	you should definitely shop_here for unique office_supplies .

positive	with a competitive price , quick service and willingness to attend to detail , they get the full 0_stars from me .
positive	i was looking for a wide and solid platform (" staging " in ladder - makers ' terminology ) to span a ditch outside our property in order to reach our fence beyond the ditch more easily , and came_across lyte as a manufacturer that seemed to offer what i wanted .
positive	express tools had a good price on the staging unit , and their website was decently - constructed , so i ordered through them .
positive	the staging arrived very promptly , shipped direct from lyte itself , and was of excellent quality .
positive	it had a solid aluminium frame with square ' rungs ' in it , supporting a full - length metal bar which in its turn supported a well - riveted board on which to stand .
positive	the board looked very like the floor of my very durable ifor williams trailer , so i '_m sure it will last for ages and ages .
positive	both the lyte staging and express tools are therefore highly_recommended .
positive	i '_ve been very happy with bullionvault since i started_using them 0 years_ago .
positive	deals get done as requested , commissions are reasonable , as are storage costs , and they are very quick to respond to queries and suggestions for improvement .
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	my own_labels is a high_quality company with beautiful color ,

positive	anyhow i made my purchase for ground standard shipping and i literally received my package in less then a week i was in awe !
positive	the clothes is not cheap material either , its actual good clothing sometimes it wilk even be brand but the will cut_off the tags because the are selling it of a major disconted price .
positive	with that said i have ordered over 00 times and every time theres something new on the site .
positive	not only is it majorly discounted price but you can also rack up points for simply purchasing or reviews and then you can get a discount on top of the already discounted price !
positive	i love it !
positive	i would review this website / company a 00 star_rating but since it '_s only 0 i '_ll do 0 .

positive	i had the ribbon in my hand the very next_day .
positive	i paid for rush shipping , but because the price was so much_cheaper , i actually paid less to have them rush the shipment than i would have paid driving across_town to buy one locally .

positive	when you order on line you can put a reference by each window e . g kitchen , bathroom etc and when they arrived they were individualy wrapped with that refence on the bags so they could be hung straight_away , and they were right the small window looks great .

positive	i have been a priceline customer for years_now .
positive	i use them 00_% of the time when i have to travel about anywhere .
positive	the other 0 % would be from the inability to cancel or change reservations ( even with the cancellation_policy ).

positive	even_though now at times its a bit harder to really get really good deals , they pretty_much beat out there competitors prices .

positive	the service tech suggested rotation , balance and alignment ; and offered if i wasn_'_t happy he would credit the reasonable charge for the service towards the future purchase of new_tires .

positive	thank_you !
positive	the trip was great , it was funny at times because the young_lady ( steward ) was tong tied because she kept messing up her words because she was speaking so fast but most of us just chuckled and rolled with it .
positive	there was this lady on the plane that had too much to drink and was talking really loud stating how she is looking for a husband and was asking a church lady how she found her husband and was she happily married or miserable .
positive	it was just too darn funny and serious at the same time .

positive	but i have no reason to suspect that it will not hold up extremely well .
positive	i have the sofa , two armchairs and matching ottoman and they look fantastic together .
positive	the shipping took approximately 0_weeks because of the size of the items it had to be a scheduled delivery using a freight service .
positive	my local patio store wanted twice the price and 0_weeks to deliver , no_brainer .
positive	i highly_recommend this collection , and this company .
positive	i '_ve been with this credit union since i was 00 and probably will never leave .
positive	i '_ve even stayed with them after moving to northern california where there aren_'_t any branches .

positive	i bought this dress after lamenting for weeks as to what style of dress i wanted for my daughters_wedding .
positive	i chose this one because of its understated quality .
positive	to the contrary the dress is actually sexy without being trashy .
positive	as the mother of the bride i didn_'_t want anything over the top but i didn_'_t want to look like an old matron either .
positive	the only_thing you all need to know is if you are over a certain age or weight you do need to wear spanks and a good bra because the dress is low cut .
positive	this dress is good for summer or winter .
positive	iwantpants had just the product i wanted .
positive	the international delivery was prompt and the product was just what i expected .

positive	a one stop_shop for all and often the cheapest .
positive	got exactly_what i wanted wthin 00_hours , at a fraction of the cost .
positive	would highly_recommend them
positive	fast , reliable service every time without_exception .
positive	this company has great work_ethic and is run with integrity .
positive	they truly stand_behind the products they sell , all of which carefully researched from what i can gather .
positive	this is easily a sound buying decision on my part , and may i say hats_off to matt_monarch and angela stokes for creating a company with a conscience !
positive	!
positive	i had been receiving dog_food through the auto_ship every 0 months , i had received my last shipment and 0_weeks_later i had to put my pug cassie down .

positive	ordered thursday_afternoon , arrived monday .
positive	only problem i have now is getting it fitted !
positive	i think i might sign_up for a plumbing course .
positive	about 00_% of my shopping is done on the internet so i want a good description , pictures and ease to answer questions about the item plus full information in case i have to return .
positive	fulfilled on every_aspect i was well pleased .
positive	better still the item was fitted before the sun had set .
positive	only a small item but i was waiting for it plus it was free delivery , which is even better .
positive	i had a great experience with passport visa express - and they have e_- promo_codes for 00 dollars off your order ( how cool is that !).
positive	but , i called for help to fill_out necessary documents , which saved me time .
positive	the guy i talked with on the phone was excellent , and although i had just received my passport less_than a month prior - he recommended sending another picture , just in case .
positive	i did , and they accepted the second picture ( not the one that i got with my passport , even_though it was technically within the 0 month time period ), so he directly saved me extra time and shipping fees because my picture would have been rejected for the visa .
positive	i would use them again in a heartbeat !
positive	i recently bought the divine little red_riding costume .
positive	i received my costume in a week after purchasing it !

positive	having looked at lots of different options for our flights i found that traveling with children you didn_'_t always get an option to choose children and prices and options were for all adults .
positive	this was not the case with skytours .
positive	their options were excellent and made the booking easy .
positive	the tickets were sent promptly with all information .
positive	a separate invoice was available to me .
positive	i really liked the setup and will certainly check in with them before traveling in the future .
positive	i have ordered the protizyme chocolate cake and syntrax nectar vanilla bean torte .

positive	can '_t recommend them highly_enough .
positive	this is a great company with great integrity .

positive	i would like to see larger_quantities available .
positive	a fifteen day supply is really not enough time to gauge a product '_s effectiveness and you almost have to reorder immediately .

positive	i am a loyal_customer .
positive	i was able to purchase my new pair ( frames and lens ) for $_000 . 00 less_than what the retail_stores was charging me for just the frames .

positive	very fast shipping .
positive	exactly_what i hoped for .
positive	thank_you !
positive	i found the website informative and accurate , the ordering process simple and the delivery was next_day as_promised ( even in a busy christmas_period ).
positive	everything i have ordered from parts_geek has_been top quality for less the price that i would have purchased the same product from an auto_parts store .
positive	yes i do have to wait to receive it but that '_s why it is ordered early so on days off it can be replaced on the vehicle .
positive	with most websites you ask yourself , " what is the catch ?"
positive	there is no catch with foodler .
positive	after a couple of orders , i saw dollars accumulated and points ranked .
positive	i had no_idea what those were until i found out they are the best benefits of using this site and to come_back for more .
positive	a few of examples :
positive	0 .
positive	bought food at places i '_ve never eaten before in my local town .
positive	took a chance with using the 00_%_discount and the food was pretty good .
positive	after ordering like that a couple of times , ordering food at places for the first time , you build more points .
positive	it gave an establishment my thumbs_up when i would drive or walk by and judge their appearance or menu selection .
positive	0 .
positive	the other day i had a little over $_00 in foodler bucks .
positive	i work one part - time job and self_employed full - time photographer in the day time .
positive	i live paycheck to paycheck and this is not what i consider awesome .
positive	i had not money , not getting paid util the next week , and i used my foodler bucks so i can enjoy a lunch as work .
positive	considering that i had to seek out a restaurant with a certain minimum , i was successful trying to find a restaurant .
positive	it was the best italian ( with the works ) that i '_ve had in a long time .
positive	0 .
positive	with points that i accumulated , i select in the rewards section to receive a foodler t - shirt .
positive	it '_s so comfortable .
positive	i am not a fan of purchasing t - shirts of online companies because i feel_like a walking billboard ( nor do i write_reviews ).
positive	but with this company , it helps or i would assume creates a significant volume of new / loyal costumers to local_restaurants of all_kinds and expands the customers idea of where to order out for their next with rewards that you can '_t beat .
positive	thanks for creating this .
positive	please don_'_t change !
positive	;)
positive	was looking for orijen senior dog_food while vacationing in the mountains of nc for 0 months and had no luck .

positive	i was very relieved when i got my glasses - they were perfect .
positive	the website gives you the status of your glasses as they are getting done , so you can estimate how long until you get them .
positive	bottom_line , it was cheaper to get my glasses online with all the coatings , etc from sepectspecs with no insurance then to get them in us with insurance .
positive	next time , i '_ll just go back to selectspecs .

positive	after_seeing the price match option with an_additional 0 % taken off i thought this was too good to be true .
positive	but soon i realized there were no prices on the net that were even comparable to that of supplement_warehouse .
positive	i searched for hours and hours before giving up .
positive	they have the lowest_prices guaranteed .
positive	good luck trying to find a price to beat them .
positive	i know very well i couldn_'_t .
positive	i know the first and only place i will be shopping from now on .
positive	thanks supplement_warehouse .
positive	i really like watching for the sale prices for the products i always purchase anyway , plus , i really appreciate that " at your door " delivery .

positive	as soon as i poured it in the bowl the dags came over to see what new goodies i had given them .
positive	they don_'_t always like what is in their bowl -- this time was different .
positive	to be honest , before hotdoodle , my experience with websites , sucked ... but hotdoodle brought it all together .
positive	they are truly hot ... and i do mean that ... but in the best way possible .
positive	the service was great , they were very knowledgeable , and my life with websites was easier because of them ...
positive	i consider them family in many_ways .
positive	best part about it all ... they are always there when i need them .
positive	i am so smiling right now !

positive	i have never found a clerk to be honorable kind and positive .
positive	i will never buy muscle milk or other brands that are not recognized on the protein_powder circuit .
positive	every time my family_member orders here they come home with delicious protein mix .
positive	the best part about the ordering is the stages of the process .
positive	when you order it says how much is charged total .
positive	then it makes you review the order and input card info .
positive	very assuring that no mistakes occur .
positive	unless you forget to check the order and you wait three wondering when the shipment will come .
positive	happened twice ( good god i '_m dumb ).
positive	but i like it for quickness of getting my stuff sent and no cranky morons to awkward you out of the store .
positive	i ordered lenses around 0pm and they were delivered safetly at_0am the next_morning - excellent service
positive	the lenses i ordered were correct and correct prescription - so easy to use the website
positive	a perfect service no need to use any other supplier .
positive	ordered pens and they arrived next_day .
positive	unfortunately they had sent compact version by mistake .
positive	when i phoned the company , i spoke to a very pleasant man_who admitted it was their mistake .
positive	i was quite taken_aback that he admitted fault , but there was absolutely no trouble for them to change pens when i returned the incorrect pens .
positive	the manner i was dealt_with made me feel good about it .
positive	i was sent the correct order by return of post and had my postage refunded .
positive	i wish more companies dealt so well with problems and in such a good manner .
positive	well_done !
positive	i will be back
positive	the dog_food was shipped quickly .
positive	i believe when i order again i will order enough to qualify for free_shipping .
positive	i am so glad that i found this website because i thought it would be cool to have shirts for my brothers one year anniversary of his death and my family thought so too .
positive	so thankfully i found this website and it was easy to design the shirts , that was nice .
positive	the only_thing i didn_'_t like was that before you finalize your order it does not seem to tell you when they will ship out .
positive	but when i called customer_service i talked to a actual_person and i told why we needed them and by what date and they said sure we can have them before that date with no extra_cost which was very cool .
positive	they were cheaper then all the other_places i looked at and that was about 0 or 0 different places .
positive	i also got our shirts before the date they said .
positive	i am so very thankful for the shirts looking so good and getting here before the date .
positive	thank_you for such great service .
positive	i have already_recommended them to others and told them of the great service .
positive	there was a mistake on my billing and i was not credited a 00_%_discount that had been advertised on the website .
positive	i didn_'_t notice this until a month later while reviewing my bank_statement .
positive	i worried i had let too much time pass , but when i contacted the company they took_care of the discount right_away and i was credited the money .
positive	have been on 0 nights out with meals , an afternoon tea at the 0_star thistle hotel marble_arch with champagne cocktails which was a truly special experience .

positive	brilliant option .
positive	i was frustrated with my previous cover_letter / resume because even_though i thought i did a good job on writing it , i never received an e_- mail / call back from an employer .
positive	i decided to do research and found out about onebuckresume and their 0 - dollar resume service .
positive	i knew my skill set and what i was good with , but wasn_'_t quite able to quantify it in a way that would attract callbacks .
positive	this is where this site helped_me .
positive	the finished_product is way beyond what i expected .
positive	i '_ve actually received hits from potential employers on my linkedin profile and i actually receive e_- mails and callbacks when i e_- mail my cover_letter / resume to job_postings .

positive	b_&_h is the best store of its kind anywhere .

positive	thought the guys at town_fair tires in billerica were great .
positive	they processed my order , looked up a couple different options for me and we decided yo go with the goodyear tires
positive	took about 00_mins for the work to be done and i was in my way .
positive	i would definitely go back , and will for the free tire rotations .
positive	.

positive	my dog bailey just loves bully_sticks .
positive	petflow offers them at a great price .
positive	once i ordered them i received them quickly and now she is a happy dog .
positive	not only were the price is right but the delivery only took 0 days .
positive	i go to a wholesale pet_supply_store near my home that you can '_t beat their prices at any other pet_supply_store .
positive	but on several_occasions they do not have the size bag of dog_food i buy .
positive	the bags are $_00 more elsewhere .
positive	so i looked online and found pet_flow to be only a couple dollars more than the wholesale store plus i don_'_t have to drive 00_miles one way to get the food .
positive	it comes right to my door !
positive	saves time and gas which makes up for the couple extra dollars i pay to pet_flow .
positive	try them .
positive	you '_ll like them !
positive	!
positive	quick , efficient service .
positive	just what you want .

positive	there were no_problems with ticketing or arrangements .
positive	of about a dozen tours for the two trips , there was only bad " tour "; and it wasn_'_t really a tour so i wouldn_'_t blame viator .
positive	( that was the hop on - hop_off tickets in honolulu .

positive	saw this lovely dress on line at woolworth for my great niece who will be three , and set about ordering it .
positive	i set_up an account so i can either pay off instantly or pay in installments all great .
positive	i then decided to allocate a shop where i could pick_up my goods ( with working it is easier ).
positive	within a couple of days the parcel was delivered to my home .
positive	i then got an_email_saying they were dropping my goods off at the alloted shop but needed some more info off me as it was my first order .
positive	here i am thinking i have somehow ordered it twice .
positive	after checking my account with woolworth it only held one order but i got numerous_emails saying my goods would be sent back if i didn_'_t pick them up from the shop .
positive	after a few more days i decided to phone woolworth '_s and some young_man in a call_centre somewhere just told me to ignore all these messages as there had been some_sort of malfunction .
positive	i did as he said and heard no more until i got my email to remind_me of my first payment .
positive	overall if it had not been for this " malfunction " everything would have been spot on .
positive	i would say to anyone do shop with woolworth , you can see for yourselves the quality and price points and the different payment_methods .

positive	well_done woolworth for sorting it out so quickly

positive	i buy my families and the dogs supplements from simply_supplements and won_'_t now go_anywhere_else .
positive	ordering was simple and delivery excellent .
positive	shoes came next_day packed well .
positive	product price very competitive would use tennis_nuts again .
positive	i enrolled in identity_guard about 00 days ago after discovering that my privacy guard account had been cancelled when i enrolled my son in privacy guard using the same debit_card .
positive	i guess w privacy guard you can only have one member on auto pay with the same card .
positive	( how stupid is that ?)
positive	anyway i found identity_guard and its been awesome .
positive	so_far i '_ve found 0 of the 0 credit reporting agencies have one of my fathers credit_cards listed on my credit_report .
positive	i disputed it w a fax letter thursday and today identity_guard sent me an_email_saying they detected action on one or more of my accts and sent me a link to check it out .
positive	the message was notice of the dispute received and pending action .
positive	awesome .
positive	they also list your public records and driving records .
positive	i love it !
positive	extremely fast delivery and great value
positive	excellent call quality ; excellent rates
positive	this was an easy choice to make with the website being so easy to navigate !
positive	the rates were good , the descriptions of the differences in the units was clear and concise - all in all it was an easy solution for our nonprofit '_s storage needs !
positive	petflow . com has helped_me tremendously as i go through dog_food so quickly having 0 hungry old english sheepdogs .
positive	thank_you for your service , the ability to deliver on a schedule and the quality of your products .
positive	good price and very speedy_delivery .
positive	i absolutely love the welsh dresser that we got from oakfurnitureland and i cannot_fault the product or delivery .
positive	the delivery guys were fantastic .
positive	i got a text and an_email the day before to remind_me when the delivery slot was ( a 0 hour_window , which i was happy with ) and then in the morning of delivery day i got a phone_call to let_me know they were on the way and should be with me in 00_mins .
positive	sure enough , 00_mins later they had arrived .
positive	given our rural location i was impressed by their accuracy .
positive	they brought 0 large , heavy_boxes into the room we wanted , gave_me a couple of handy tips for getting the furniture out easily , reassured me that i had 00_hours to register any defects with them and then they were off .
positive	friendly and efficient - what more could i ask for ?
positive	unpacking was easy as was fitting the handles on the doors and drawers and fixing the shelves .
positive	the only issue came when fixing the top part of the dresser to the base .
positive	the instructions talked about two self - tapping screws - but only one was provided - and from the other fixing items provided hubby reckoned that it was a bolt that was required , not a screw , but although a pre_- drilled hole for bolts were provided in the top half of the dresser there were no such holes in the bottom part .
positive	fortunately he '_s fairly handy with a drill so drilled the holes required himself but it was a bit disconcerting having to drill 0 holes into your brand_new furniture even_though they would be out of sight and were needed to fix top and bottom of the dresser together .
positive	once i got over that shock i was perfectly happy .
positive	as i say , i love my welsh dresser ; we ' d been looking a long time for one that would fit the space and the room in general .
positive	i hadn_'_t seen it in store , only on - line , so i was slightly concerned it wouldn_'_t meet my expectations but it did and i '_m delighted

positive	same frames .
positive	i ordered them and they arrived in the case in less_than a week .

positive	i ordered a pair of versace frames i live them .
positive	got them very quickly
positive	thank_you for your product sold every last bit of it within a weeks .

positive	!
positive	i always comparison price before i purchase , but i '_m always a bit_skeptical of doing_business with a new company .
positive	the price enticed me and so ....
positive	i am very satisfied .
positive	this company will be on my " good business " list , unless , like a few others , prices go up .
positive	if you can '_t beat petsmart or petco - both within minutes of my home - i '_m not interested .
positive	also , i like shipping offers !
positive	they can often make or break the deal as i don_'_t often purchase $_00 worth of items .
positive	one little weiner dog and so it '_s like belonging to costco or sams when there '_s one in the household with these " free ship " deals that require a hefty purchase .
positive	i would fully recommend buying from lenstore .
positive	the whole_experience is is so easy and quick .
positive	buying lenses from my optician takes over a week to get my prescription and they are more_expensive , plus i have to go and collect them which_means travel and parking , so why wait and pay more when lenstore give you a better servce and cost saving !
positive	just got a new nikon 0000 - i '_m a total novice but am excited to take some
positive	cool pictures .
positive	found the perfect shoulder_strap at blackrapid . com and free_shipping when you watch the very helpful videos .

positive	very good !
positive	i would use them again !
positive	i just wish i was able to say the same about the shipping company ... fed - x .
positive	the package was delivered to my neighbor '_s house intentionally by the driver who did not make a note on the delivery confirmation .. shame on fedex !

positive	i waited around 00 days for mine but for a total of 00 quid including delivery you can '_t go wrong .
positive	great value and great service , will defo_use again !

positive	the guitar arrived very well_packaged and without a scratch , on time and without a fuss .
positive	my only_negative is that the gig bag has a faulty zip that wouldn_'_t do up on its first outing , so i will need to replace it , but i can '_t blame guitar guitar for that , as long as they allow me to return it !

positive	i have been researching my families for 00 years , and i started out doing this without a computer .
positive	when family_tree maker came out this was how i started , with cd '_s .
positive	i had tried another genealogy site , and was very displeased with it , so i tried ancestry . com .
positive	it was a whole new world opening up for me , and i have never looked back since .
positive	having researched information prior to the computer helped_me because i knew that the information i had was correct , so it helped_me to find what i was looking for on ancestry .
positive	i have found so much information on my families , and i keep finding more and more as i keep researching .
positive	i have learned to watch what i am looking at in different family trees , and i can pretty_much judge if this is the correct family or not .
positive	having the census reports has_been a huge help , as have military enlistment records and / or draft registrations .
positive	the biggest thrill about ancestry is being_able to share photos with others , and finally getting to see what my great - grandmother looked like .
positive	i could never go back to the other genealogy sites because they can not hold a candle to ancestry .
positive	i have been contacted by many people from both my families and my late husband '_s families , and they have not only given us information , but the joy of finding new family_members , no_matter_how far down the line they are .
positive	the other great thing about ancestry is the fact that they now have dna_testing , and it really does work .
positive	i have been contacted by family through this process , also .
positive	i have been researching a very long time , and i hope to continue doing so for many more years to come .
positive	ancestry has made it possible for me to put_together something that i can pass down to my granddaughter , and she on down to her future family .
positive	thank_you , ancestry .
positive	mikki and the staff went out of their way to ensure my complete_satisfaction ... honestly , i could not ask for better customer_service !
positive	and i have my contacts at the most affordable price i could find .... yyyaaaayyy !

positive	i ordered hang_tags and had a question about printing on the back of the tags .
positive	customer_service assured_me they would be how i envisioned them and if i was not happy , they would fix them .
positive	another customer_service person went_above and beyond the call of duty to help me out as well .
positive	i received the tags and they look great , plus it was a very short turnaround time .
positive	i will_definitely order again , should i need any of their products .
positive	order shipped same day as order and could not believe_how fast i received it .
positive	from the beginning to the end , the customer_service at printing . com was fantastic !
positive	when i requested a template for our folders , not only did i get a template but i also received feedback on the spot varnish capabilities .
positive	that really added to my design creativity and the end product .

positive	i would highly_recommend anyone_who loves perfume and cosmetics as much as i do to check out allbeauty . com you won_'_t regret it .
positive	i '_m very pleased with the goods which were well_packaged and arrived_promptly .
positive	just an aside really : i can understand the reason behind the policy to deliver to cardholders address only for the first order but have to admit i was a bit stressed about the likelihood of missing it and having to find time to collect it from somewhere - and had reservations about placing the order because of this - so i would have much preferred the delivery to have been able to come to my place of work .
positive	fortunately a ( retired ) neighbour was in to receive my parcel for me so all worked out in the end .
positive	travel joy hostel was the best hostel i stayed at , in fact , it was even better_than the hotel i stayed at when i first got to london .
positive	the coffee served in the morning really needs to be stronger but other than that , great service , freindly and informative staff and the free earplugs are a thoughtful touch that no 0_star_hotel would think of .
positive	excellent location .
positive	the barclays bike rental and the bus_stop right outside are a godsend .
positive	mick the manager was generous to fit me in for three more nights as i was in a bind to find accomidations and i just didn_'_t want to stay anywhere_else .
positive	thanks again mick !
positive	when we go to hawaii we consistently use priceline as our method of selecting hotels .

positive	i really liked the product i received , will keep buying trough this site .
positive	really quick delivery .
positive	this is a very efficient service .

positive	a friendly human_being speaks to you on the phone to ascertain how many pairs you are sending .
positive	a day or two later a post - paid box arrives , in which to send your old glasses together with the new prescription .
positive	when the box arrives at reglazemyglasses you are rung by a very helpful operative to discuss just what type of lens and finish you would like , and given the prices of the various_options .
positive	depending_on the type of lenses , the glasses arrive through your letterbox a week or two later .
positive	i have placed several orders from this company and have been very satisfied with their ease of ordering and timely delivery of my order .

positive	i went to a local_opticians and found some lovely glasses that really suited me , but they cost £_000 to get done , which was quite a lot more than i was hoping to spend .
positive	so after a bit of research i found selectspecs online .
positive	the had the exact_same designer_glasses , with the thin lenses and antireflective coating , for under £_000 .
positive	i emailed them a question about the frames , and i got an answer within a day or two .
positive	id already read a few reviews about slow delivery .
positive	and i did have to wait around two_weeks for my new glasses to arrive , but i wasn_'_t in a rush , and i was expecting that sort of time_frame .

positive	i '_m pleased with the results .
positive	i found the process to be straightforward and also very economical for our budget .
positive	the communication from logomojo was timely and helpful .

positive	for the package i chose , i received 00 draft designs ( 0 variations of 00 designs , but the variations were different enough that i ' d say it was like getting 00 draft designs ).
positive	some of them i ruled out right_away , but there were numerous really good ones .
positive	at that stage i could have asked for modifications or for elements to be changed or even for isolated elements from different drafts to be combined into new drafts , which i thought was really great .
positive	at that point i presented a sub - set to our staff here and had them vote on them .
positive	and the next thing you know , we have a new logo .

positive	all the staff we came_across were very helpful & polite a credit to the company .

positive	i have brought a few things now from boohoo .
positive	i find it very inexpensive so i can " treat " myself every day of the week .
positive	the quality is good and all of clothes have washed really well and kept their shape .
positive	i enjoy the compliments that i get from people when i am wearing something different that is not found in the local high_street , as being from a small town , it can be hard not to turn up at an event without someone_else wearing the exact_same thing .
positive	i have recommended boohoo to everyone i know and even my nan has had a look and is impressed with the site as it caters for all people .
positive	the only_thing i would like to see in the future is maybe a tall and petite range .
positive	love not having to go to the pet_supply every couple of weeks .
positive	the grocery_store stocks mostly foods with the fillers so my pups were not getting as much nutrition / protein as they needed and it seemed to make their bowels loose .
positive	i have purchsed eukamuba and nutro from you and both have a chicken base which my minature dashchunds love .
positive	if i compare the cost of the food , gas and time to go get it , i probably spend less overall having it delivered by petflow .
positive	i am so glad i found your website .
positive	trouble - free transaction .
positive	better prices than i found in walmart , easy ordering , fast shipping , secure_packaging .
positive	i will buy from them again .

positive	there are tons of property options and housetrip is very easy to use .
positive	try to get an idea of where the things you want to do are so you can compare the location of various places with the locations of the properties and figure_out how to get around .
positive	every time i have traveled it has_been with groups of friends and we have loved having the ability to return to a private apartment at the end of the day , for a lot less money than a hotel or even staying in hostels .

positive	i booked my parking online , printed out my confirmation , and took it to the days inn .
positive	when i got there they had me fill_out a little paper with 0 or 0 questions about my car and place it on my dashboard .
positive	the driver was ready to go , he helped_me get my things into the shuttle vehicle , and unload at the airport .
positive	once i got back from my trip , i called the hotel and they sent the driver over to pick me up .
positive	i only had to wait a few_minutes .
positive	then back to the days inn where i discovered my car buried under 0 inches of snow .
positive	he got a shovel and shoveled my car out , and i was on my way .
positive	two minor complaints : the shuttle vehicle was an suv that had seen better days .
positive	the passenger window was taped up so it would stay in place , and the whole vehicle shook a little when driving .
positive	it got me to the airport and back fine , it just wasn_'_t a great image for this company to have such a run - down vehicle .
positive	my second issue was with my car not already being shoveled out .
positive	i had places i needed to be once i got back , and there was a lot of snow to get_rid of first .
positive	i realize they have no control over the weather , but since i put my arrival time in when i made the parking reservation , it would '_ve been nice if the snow around my car was already gone when i got there .
positive	i couldn_'_t even open the doors at first , there was so much snow .
positive	but even with those 0 things , i would use them again .
positive	good quality items at affordable prices , excellent service kept_upto_date with delivery , would recommend this company to others .

positive	i '_ve used the lenstore twice_now and i would recommend then highly .
positive	my first experience with then was to order a pair of halloween contacts to go with my costume .
positive	they arrived really quickly , however there was a slight_problem with one of the contacts ( it was a slightly different colour to the other one - luckily i was going as a zombie so it didn_'_t matter to much - lol ) i contacted the lenstore via_email to inform them of the problem , they responded very quickly and asked that i send the contacts back ( using a freepost address ) and they would replace them .
positive	unfortunately those particular lenses had been_discontinued , so they offered me a choice of other styles , once i had chosen the new lenses thay arrived after a day - very pleased !

positive	hope they can find a way to bring the price down .

positive	i am new to bee keeping and had originally ordered just one super and my bees hive was growing .

positive	!
positive	only one garment has_been washed once , but so_far so good therefore , i cannot attest to the durability and longevity of the transfers .
positive	one recommendation that is truly important would be to use a good heat press .
positive	if one '_s heat press is mediocre , then the transfers will not adhere correctly .

positive	great buying experience .
positive	shipping was fast and cheap .

positive	very helpful to have one site that lists storage_facilities in a particular area .
positive	makes it easy to compare prices and to check availability .
positive	my only issue was that the location of the unit i reserved wasn_'_t available when i got there , which makes me question the value of the reservation , though they did have a similar unit somewhere_else so ultimately it all worked out .

positive	we had a good tour .
positive	the tour_guide was light hearted , patient and knowledgeable and pivotable to a good time .
positive	i think there is some lag time at the beginning of the tour that shortens the time that is spent at the korean / lincoln / vietnam memorials ( only given 00_minutes ).
positive	we enjoyed the tour a lot and have told many people about how much fun it was and how we got to see the jefferson memorial .
positive	going to see the j -- memorial was great .
positive	i have toured the monuments several_times but never gotten that far over to see it before .
positive	very pleasureable .
positive	we are advised to give seraquin to our 0 yr_old dog for the rest of his life to help manage the joint problems he will encounter as a result of a snapped cruciate ligament and the subsequent surgery rhe had to undergo .
positive	these tablets were very expensive direct from the vets so we were pleased to find them significantly_cheaper at animed .
positive	we had an_appointment with our gp '_s travel immunisation clinic and got our jabs done but when it came to antimalarials we were advised to use travelpharm .

positive	my first purchase was an adorable pink fur hoodie that i got for dirt_cheap , the status was will ship within 0 - 0 days and i got it 0 days_later , no_complaints , it was even packaged nice and professional .
positive	i seen the same hoodie on other_websites for triple the price of yesstyle .
positive	i will be buying from there again !
positive	ive read a lot of bad_reviews , but with buying anything from another country , you have to make smart decisions no_matter_how appealing an item is , if it is listed as 0 - 00 days , then of course it '_s going to take longer to ship .
positive	as a tip for anyone buying from yesstyle , i would say always buy items ready to be shipped and don_'_t buy any items with too many accents as those may not come attached .
positive	the quality of my hoodie is way better_than what i paid for .
positive	i paid about 00 $ with cheap shipping and i have worn it plenty and it seems to be fine .

positive	i had a great experience with sparefoot !

positive	hello ,
positive	i felt as though easytobook . com was a straight_forward process for making travel reservations .
positive	i think the only_thing the team should consider is revisiting the design of the webpage ; it needs to pop a little more - larger pictures of the hotel accommodations , graphics lining the side of the webpage , a face / mascot to be the face of this travelsite , etc .
positive	consumers are drawn to & will remember the look / image / branding of a company , so i think you need to give your company ( or in your case webpage ) alittle more personality .
positive	i think applying the above to some effect will also allow you alittle more flexibility to advertise .
positive	take the travelocity gnome & priceline as examples .
positive	good luck !
positive	my washing_machine broke_down on thursday and after_trawling_through various_websites trying to find next_day delivery , i came_across appliances_online .

positive	i was highly disappointed with the service , even with all of the well - intentioned apologies and discount offers made to me .
positive	then i chose this site , found a great flower_arrangement , and , best of all , my daughter and her husband received it on the day i requested when i placed my order !!

positive	this was probably the easiest - to - obtain set of gifts that i gave to anyone !
positive	i sent ten gift_cards - mostly to those who do not live near me , and who are teenagers and / or young adults .
positive	i downloaded photos of my gift_card recipients from the profile photos or other photos on their facebook pages , since i did not have current photos of many of them .
positive	then , for for each recipient , i uploaded their photo to the gift_card website , centered it on the card layout , and chose the gift_card amount and greeting .

positive	we chose a lady , who could come to the home but also if that not possible we could travel as she_lives close by .
positive	the costings were all similar .
positive	my key issue was if my son feels happy working with the tutor then he will produce good pieces of work .

positive	thank_you !
positive	such a better way to travel .
positive	we used wimdu for a trip to paris and staying in a local '_s apartment completely changed how we experienced the city .
positive	for less_than we would have paid for a hotel , we had our own entire place , with a kitchen , living_room , balcony , record player and even a washer .
positive	and our host was so nice and gave_us a list of his_favorite places that he suggested we visit ( which we did !).
positive	the site is very easy to use - just find the apartment that speaks to you and book !
positive	i hate flying , but flying with virgin isn_'_t your typical airline experience .
positive	not only do you get your own little tv screen with a ton of movies and tv_shows to watch , but now they let you check out a google laptop for your flight so you can surf the internet - and chat with other passengers if you want .
positive	hopefully they '_ll add more cities to their destinations soon .
positive	i ordered 00 lobsters and 00lbs of steamer clams for a combo father '_s day / my 00th_birthday_celebration .

positive	when i opened them all was well .
positive	they were packed upright in individual spacers .
positive	we put some additional freezer packs on them , left the top of the box cracked open ( with a weight on it to keep them from making an escape ) and the next evening took them out to cook .
positive	again , all were alive and moving and there were only about 0 - 0 broken clams .
positive	my dinner was a success and i '_m a happy_camper .
positive	i would rather pay for shipping separately so i know what i am paying for .
positive	it costs alot to ship overnight but do the math ( i did ) and you will find this company is the best deal .

positive	several mornings we '_ve had frozen frost on our windows in the midwest from early_morning fogs .

positive	i appreciate the quick response .
positive	the weather has_been mild since they arrived ; but i am confident before this winter is over i will have the right tool for what i need .

positive	her medication was not only required , but costly .
positive	but vetapprovedrx surprised me .
positive	i placed the order expecting delays , instead in two_days the meds were in my mailbox !

positive	if you want to fly from the seat of your pants when choosing a place to stay , close your eyes and use " name your price ."
positive	00 out of 00 times i have been pleasantly_surprised using this feature on priceline .
positive	i have stayed at the most phenomenal hotels for the best rates .
positive	the most i have ever paid a night is $_00 and i have stayed at the westin , doubletree at hilton , the renaissance ( a marriott property ), the wyndham , marriott , etc .
positive	i always choose three and half stars and above and just wait for the results .
positive	i absolutely love priceline for lodging and will_continue to use them in the future .
positive	the only caveat is if you book them through third - party , which is priceline , hotwire , etc .
positive	most hotels will not award you bonus points .
positive	it '_s considered double dipping .
positive	that is not the worst thing in the world for me , but for travelers who like reward_points , this would be a deal breaker .
positive	excellent , got everything i ordered in a timely_fashion as well as packaged well .
positive	will order again and again .
positive	the lowest_prices , plus free stuff .
positive	dear your team

positive	i have been introduced to a wonderful new hobby !
positive	i never really gave much thought to who and where i came from .
positive	i started ancestry . com on a free two week trial to accomplish one goal .... to find my husband '_s biological family .
positive	i did within the first week of the trial and we have already been in contact with many of his relatives !
positive	i then decided to take full advantgage of my other free week .
positive	every free minute i had was spent on my laptop searching ancestry . com .
positive	i started with my name , my parent '_s name and both sets of grandparents ... that '_s it , that was all i needed to open up a world of information about every_single grandfather and grandmother on each side of my family .
positive	i have gone back to the 0000 '_s on some lines .
positive	it '_s not something you do for a little while and you ' re done .
positive	i login every day and sometimes a few_times a day because ancestry . com finds common hints to your ancestors and notifies you of all new hints !
positive	the searching is really endless .
positive	my family sometimes complains that my head is always burried in my laptop , but all i have to do is show them all of the cool things that i have found about their ancestors , not just mine and they leave me alone to keep searching .
positive	this is a legacy that my children and their children , etc .... will appreciate .
positive	i order quite a lot of gear from barrington_sports and every order i have been pleased with the excellent customer_service and speedy_delivery .

positive	fast easy delivery and returns were processed o quickly and refunded quickly as well !!
positive	very professional !!
positive	!
positive	i like ordering from pure_formulas for several reasons .
positive	their product is always very fresh .
positive	customer_service ( and / or the shipping staff ) do small things that make me know i am not just a number , but a very valued_customer , being treated like they would like to be treated .
positive	they also understand i live in southern ca ( the desert ) and have very hot weather sometimes ( they protect my shipment in the best ways possible ).
positive	repeat_customers often have a code available to use for a 00_%_discount .
positive	they ship product to me in a timely_manner via_ups , and do not hand it off to the post_office , who does crazy things with both first_class mail and packages , which then results in a time and energy consuming ( often futile ) struggle to get your stuff .
positive	thank_you , pure_formulas !
positive	the items purchase are excellent .
positive	we ordered our vanity with a double sink .

positive	when we arrived , we could make the check - in quickly .
positive	the contact with the personn who gave_us the keys was nice and cool .
positive	the appartment is spacious , beautiful , clean ad practical .
positive	on top of that , it '_s located in one of the prettiest streets of the center .
positive	we found there everything we needed .
positive	the only_negative aspect was the noise in the street .
positive	in fact , two_nights , as we slept in the bedroom located in front of the street , we heard the sounds coming from a party .
positive	however , we keep a really good memory of our stay and won_'_t hesitate to recommand it to the people we know .

positive	a brief trawl through the internet found me boilerjuice . com , and it was time well spent .
positive	they offered me heating_oil at 0p per_litre cheaper_than my usual_supplier , and just to make it better , when the order actually arrived because i was put in as part of bulk order of people in my post_code , the price went down by another 0p per_litre .
positive	a saving of over_£_00 on my old supplier .
positive	i will use boilerjuice again , and i will recommend them to others .
positive	give them a go , what have you got to loose ?
positive	?
positive	lenstore had the cheapest price for my lenses , and they arrived within 00_hours of me ordering them .

positive	i ordered batteries , a solar recharger with internal battery , and a mini lanyard with a clip .

positive	i am so happy i don_'_t have to go buy batteries for my camera every week or less .
positive	it was getting rather expensive , but now that i have awesome batteries , i know i am good for at_least a year or better and it '_s even cheaper_than if i continued to purchase batteries for the next month .
positive	everything works_wonderfully and i will_definitely look for something_else to purchase knowing photonlight . com is a quality company .

positive	when " wagon wheel " pet treats were pulled off
positive	of all the us shelves ( whom made all of these products ) we were devistated and even
positive	more so when we learned the products were made in china and had high levels of
positive	anti_- biotics in them .
positive	this turned_out though to be a blessing in disguise , for if it was not for " wagon wheel "
positive	treats being pulled , we would have never found your site .
positive	what made us even happier
positive	was that your products do not contain anti_- biotics and are made here in america .
positive	we will be customers of yours forever .

positive	i realised that there was a need for urgency as two of my older lenses had been destroyed in handling in one day .
positive	my husband got hold of his previous link with lenstore , and repeated the order .
positive	whether or not they were more_expensive than prevously was of no consequence - and not really noted , the most_important factor was the speed of delivery .
positive	and whooosh !
positive	on the screen came , in quick succession : confimation of order , confirmation of dispatch , and a progress confirmation .
positive	however , the last one was not required , because the mail parcel arrived befor my next visit to the computer , carrying the order .

positive	she wears it every day .
positive	the price was great and customer_service in keeping me posted on status of shipping was exceptional !
positive	the prices are reasonable for great quality food and the delivery to my door is awesome !
positive	trust me when i say if you will never go to any of those big name franchises after you try petflow .
positive	they have hard to find products , and it delivers within 0 days .
positive	i '_ve used cult_pens on a regular_basis for some time now .
positive	the service received is second to none - speedy and efficient with same day despatch of goods .
positive	even_though i am a ' small ' customer , the service never_fails and i would recommend cult_pens without_hesitation .
positive	the experience was great from start to finish .
positive	excellent , professional , knowledgeable sales_team that was happy to help me .
positive	quick , reliable , polite technicians .
positive	great pricing .
positive	thank_you , will send friends and family to this store only as it was a better experience than one i previously had at a nh town_fair .
positive	measured windows , emailed order , goods arrived within days and looking lovely .
positive	i usually order my parts online then go & pick them up because i can save a little money , but when i checked out partsgeek , the part i needed was 0 / 0 the price i would have had to pay from the online store i use to get my parts at .
positive	free_shipping and fast delivery was just what the doctor ordered , because sometimes when you need a part for your car you can '_t even get to the store to pick one up !
positive	so this is my new " go to " online parts store .
positive	best place to buy my favourite perfumes at a very cheap price , wouldn_'_t now shop anywhere_else .
positive	000 blinds have everything you need in quality , fit and cost .
positive	they fitted_perfectly and are so easy to hang , they look expensive but were the best product i found after viewing many other_websites .
positive	i was so delighted i have ordered my curtains also from 000 , so watch this space and i will let you know how they perform .
positive	because the price was so reasonable i thought they may be inferior , but not at all ; i would give them 00 out of 00 on every count .
positive	i wasn_'_t sure what to purchase as a 00th_birthday_gift for my son - in -_law and as i had used a similar gift before for a grandchild , where he now has a piece of the moon and is very impressed , i thought i might just find something for james , my son - in -_law .
positive	he has always loved scotland and the thought of owning a piece of the highlands , no_matter_how small i knew it would appeal to him , and to become a laird is surely the icing_on the cake , and it is so beautifully_presented .
positive	so on the 00 july he will be presented with this one off package , for i shouldn_'_t think anyone_else would have thought about this idea .
positive	so watch this space , i will let you know his reaction .
positive	i received the gift_card within 0 days which was awesome .
positive	i was actually hesitant to buy from giftcards . com considering one of their prs had some rude , somewhat shifty responses to some complaints on review websites and facebook , but everything turned_out fine for me , so i can '_t complain at all .
positive	i received my purchase within 0 days of ordering .
positive	the whole_process was quick , easy , and the package included exactly_what i ordered .
positive	great service and good price
positive	yesstyle is simply an amazing site .
positive	it is very hard to find the asian_style clothing in us , or europe .
positive	but what is the asian_style clothing ?
positive	there are alot of styles on the site , but my favorite is the cute and feminine clothing , what makes it the best is that the prices are also affordable .
positive	the weekly deals are a real_pain for the wallet !
positive	they are irresistible !
positive	with sales from 00 %~ 00_%, you can '_t go wrong .
positive	when i ordered from the site i noticed that the shipping is from high_quality .
positive	the price varies for countries , but is surely very cheap considering that you get insurance and tracking and probably for most of the best , you get a really fast shipping !
positive	aswell do they have extra sales for the people who order alot of things from the store , which makes them want to stay even more !
positive	overall : this site has everything you want , its trustable , its reliable , it has multiple styles so everyone can shop on it , and its easy !
positive	would highly_recommend these - small but functional !
positive	this company was extremely_helpful and very efficient , i will_definitely be using again .

positive	not wishing to detract from garden best_buys ' great products , etc .

positive	!
positive	let_me start with saying i am extremely appreciative to everyone who helped_me at new_york dress company .
positive	they saved me from a miserable existence because that is what my life would have been made by my daughter if new_york dress company hadn_'_t come through like they did .
positive	our search for a senior ball gown started off real bad to begin with .
positive	we went to trudy '_s as well as david '_s bridal and boutiques and every dress she liked either didn_'_t have her size or not the right color .
positive	every time she got her heart set on a dress they would get back to us and it was either discontinued or they couldn_'_t get it here in time .
positive	we had all been given up specially after we ordered a dress on line through a company that i think wasn_'_t a real dress company to begin with .
positive	they charged my credit_card twice for a dress that we never received and to top it off after entering my card i got a phone_call from my credit_card company asking me about charges that had been made the same day the dress was ordered and the charges where for over 0000 . 00 .
positive	luckily my credit_card company reversed the charges but i had to have a new card issued and needed the dress still .
positive	i started making phone_calls after my daughter decided once again on a dress she had her heart set on and low and behold someone at new_york dress company looked in the warehouse to make_sure they had the color and size she needed and i gave them the information to order it and it would not go through because of my card being cancelled .
positive	they called me back immediately to let_me know it didn_'_t go through and they waited with me while i went on another phone to my bank to get the information to them they needed to get my order through .
positive	it went through but then a few_days_later we received an_email that the order was delayed and was a pre_- order scared of the worst i went on to the live_chat the new_york company offers 00_hours a day 0 days a week and they put my mind at ease by explaining the dress they where shipping had been damaged some how and they had to get another but she assured_me that it would be mailed express at no charge to me .
positive	i was skeptical at this point but then a week_later we received a very beautiful dress via express mail through ups .
positive	so thank_you very much new_york dress company and everyone that works for you your awes om and the merchandise is beautiful my daughter looks_stunning .
positive	i needed a storage_unit .
positive	the manager at sunset mini storage , the company i found on trustpilot , was helpful and informative .
positive	the $_00 per_month for 0 months special offered through trustpilot helped_me tremendously as i am on a fixed_income .
positive	i find that shopping on the internet offers exceptional options and trustpilot is one of them .
positive	flashbay was fast !
positive	samples next_day , proof images provided immediately , had finished_product within a week .
positive	the staff was friendly and knowledgable and the quality of product is excellent .

positive	i used to also buy fresh_fish at the whole foods near me but i rarely do that any more because that '_s hit or miss on the taste , whereas vital_choice has always been great tasting 000_% of all the times i '_ve ordered .
positive	i was going to plan this trip on my own but am so glad i took lisa '_s advice .
positive	once she learned a little about our family and what we were looking for she got us to ideal locations , booked us on adventurous and fun tours , found us great lodging , and took_care of all the details !

positive	placing the order & the measuring guide was very easy indeed , and my order arrived_promptly .

positive	highly_recommended !
positive	everything to do with ordering tyres , finding information etc on your site was exemplary ; thank_you .
positive	but all that goodness was almost wasted by the dreadful behaviour and attitude to me of the agent ie .
positive	the garage i chose to do the fitting .
positive	that was petersfield garage services , in petersfield .
positive	i rang in advance to check that it was ok to come in at 0 . 00pm for the appointment , rather_than the morning as booked .
positive	yes , they said as they close at 0 . 00pm .
positive	( i arrive to find , actually , it says hours of work till 0pm on the door . )
positive	at reception there is a man named jim : i approach the desk and say i am here for a blackcircles order .
positive	he acknoweldges this .
positive	then he says , without looking up from his keyboard : " keys ".
positive	i am taken_aback ; no please , no greeting , no small talk , no " please may i have your keys ".
positive	am now on the back foot .
positive	i ask if that means he would like to have my keys .
positive	he looks at me as if i am a moron .
positive	i say i have my dog in the car and would like to take it out ; that i would like to talk over the tyres and which wheel they should go on .
positive	again , he looks at me incredulously .
positive	i explain that i would like the spare put on to one of the other non_- new wheels ; would they mind doing it for me ?
positive	he goes off into the back without a word .
positive	he comes back a few_minutes later : " i am not sure there will be time to change the other wheel .
positive	we close at 0 . 00 as i said on the phone and you have taken 00_minutes to get here ( yes , that '_s how long it takes to get there from home ).
positive	it will probably take too long " i point out that the notice on the door says they close at 0 . 00pm - implying that there is plenty of time .
positive	" well , we have to lock up etc " - so why state 0 . 00pm and not 0 . 00pm ?
positive	i ask if i can sit_down to wait - there are chairs .
positive	he doesn_'_t offer me a seat , nor a drink nor anything ' customer - y '.
positive	i go out to the car to get my dog and tell the operative which wheel i would like changed .
positive	i comment that jim isn_'_t very approachable / friendly .
positive	he doens '_t comment .
positive	i return to the office and sit_down .
positive	jim doesn_'_t look up but carries on at his computer .
positive	no further dialogue .
positive	i ask my neighbour if i can read the newspaper which is on his side table .
positive	he passes it to me .
positive	it '_s now 0 . 00pm .
positive	0 . 00pm , the operative who changed the tyres comes back in .
positive	all done , and the spare wheel changed all within 00_minutes .
positive	i am very happy and say thank_you very much to the operative who tells_me his colleague helped him so they were really quick .
positive	i thank him again .
positive	i ask if there is anything to pay for changing the wheel .
positive	jim '_s colleague has blackcircles ' paperwork .
positive	i move to his desk as he says i have to sign it .
positive	i do so .
positive	a lady approaches jim '_s desk .
positive	she asks if they can service her horsebox .
positive	" not if it '_s a big one .
positive	how big is it ?"
positive	says jim .
positive	no greeting , no small talk , no manners .
positive	i take the pink paper and leave the office .
positive	i won_'_t go there again .
positive	i am sure that isn_'_t the sort of ' service ' blackcircles approves of , as i guess you are very focussed on your customers and you care about them - hence this review , which i am bothering to fill in because i care about good service too .
positive	don_'_t let your ' agents ' drag you down .
positive	i will_definitely use blackcircles again , but i will find another garage to fulfil the order .
positive	why don_'_t you send someone in to mystery shop them and see if jim is always that rude ?
positive	thank_you .
positive	also appreciated being given such specific delivery slot times
positive	very speedy_delivery , good prices and a very comprehensive selection of pens - thank_you

positive	my mom and sister had checked the website the week before and found that there were no rooms available at the hampton_inn in lehighton , pa for the weekend it was needed .

positive	sure enough , a week_later , there was a room available .
positive	i booked it immediately , contacted my sister and both she and my mom can now attend .
positive	even my cousin , the hostess of the reunion , was very grateful for my perseverance .

positive	i first heard of pet_flow as an ad on face book and decided to check out their site for an all natural dog_food for my dog buddy .
positive	buddy is a black_lab and he has skin_allergies and i think the dog_food i was buying in the store was contributing to his allergies and my vet had suggested i try switching up his food with and all natural product , so at 0st i was making buddy his own food out of baked chicken with rice and i just did not have a lot of time to keep investing in this option thou buddy loved it !
positive	so i started_researching pet_flow .
positive	i first heard of the earthborn brand at a local_pet_store and talked with the rep of the company who just happened to be in the store that day ( lucky for me !)
positive	and he explained the brand of food to me , it is an all natural food product with the essential nutrients in it my dog needs so i decided to try a small bag of it to see how buddy would do on it , and he_loves it !
positive	but the price in the pet_store is really expensive so i decided to shop around on line and discovered that pet_flow had the brand in a 00_lb_bag that is $_00 . 00 cheaper then the store offered for the same item with free_shipping !
positive	( another plus !)
positive	pet_flow also had treats on sale so i decided to try a few for buddy also , he_loves the bully_sticks and buffalo_ears of course what dog wouldn_'_t !!!
positive	! placing the order was easy , quick and convenient and my order arrived 0 days_later which i thought was really fast service !
positive	needless to say i will be placing future orders with pet_flow as they seem to always have some_sort of treat on sale for my dog and will be buying all my dog_food from them in the future .
positive	yes the all natural dog_food is worth the extra dollars it cost to me because that means less visits to the vet for buddy which saves_me money there because since he has_been on the earthborn_holistic his skin_allergies have cleared_up completely !
positive	i would definitely recommend this site to anyone looking for treats or animal food for their pets because after all in this household our animals aren_'_t just pets their family !
positive	and i will not feed them any more grocery_store bought animal food !
positive	i '_ve been using hotels combined for a few_years and i find the information and layout helpful in helping_me choose and book accommodation .

positive	i purchased my dog through a breeder last_year for the sole reason of providing a companion for my autistic son .
positive	after a dog bite 0 years_ago he was petrified to be anywhere_near a dog and due to the autism , he is lonely .
positive	the dog we chose , after much research , was a king charles cavalier .
positive	because of his gentle nature and size , we felt he would be the best choice .
positive	although he has not gone_through extensive training he instinctively knows my son is different and has a gentle way with him .
positive	having him registered as an emotional therapy dog has given us the freedom to bring him with us wherever we go and is helping my son feel more comfortable in public places .

positive	they got back to me right_away and apologized and i received my order a few_days_later .

positive	when i did finally get through on my 0rd attempt after 0 minutes wait , the guy i spoke to was really helpful & was very apologetic about the odd email etc .
positive	i am really happy with my overall experience with gak & would definitely use them again .
positive	i absolutely love the idea that i can buy bags of beans to re - fill my chairs when they get too squished , it '_s so much_easier and quicker_than having to replace big pieces of foam that i ' d need to if i owned normal chairs & sofas !

positive	they fit_perfectly .
positive	i ordered some other things also .
positive	i am very pleased with everything i ordered .
positive	i have ordered products from them before and will_continue to do so for all my medical_supplies .
positive	we only use bookatrack , despite others appearing cheaper it is a false economy both on safety and track time .
positive	here is usually open pit lane , but because they keep numbers overall restricted , there is no feeling of a " boy racer joy riding fest ".
positive	here there is all of the adrenalin and fun to be had under the best circumstances possible .
positive	you might want to doze off in the safety briefing or not bother with an instructor but both are a pretty_much sure route to getting the very best from the experience .
positive	if you feel you are happy with the service from another company , just try there guys out ... you will not go back to anyone_else '_s set_up ... see you on track .

positive	for two years i used a paid defragmenter someone had recommended .
positive	when it was time to renew my subscription for the 0rd year , i happened to be broke at the time and decided to look for a free product to replace the paid one .
positive	auslogics disk_defrag was suggested as one of the best on many websites so i got it .
positive	i can ’ t_believe i paid for a defragmenter for 0 whole years when there was a free alternative that actually works better !
positive	add works fast and is very easy to use , and you really can ’ t beat the price since it ’_s free .
positive	auslogics has a paid professional defragmenter too , but i find it that the free one works great for me and is perfectly sufficient .
positive	when i '_m looking for a particular outfit , i go to sheinside . com first .
positive	i looked around on this site for many months before making an actual purchase .
positive	the clothes were so cute , i just had to cave in and order a few dresses from sheinside .
positive	i was very pleased with the items i '_ve received , and since then sheinside . com has_become one of my " go - tos " for online shopping .
positive	i recently ordered their black handprint tassel dress and i love it so much because it fits my body perfectly .
positive	it also shipped to my house very quickly .
positive	they sell nothing but quality clothing which is always a plus for me .
positive	the site is so easy to navigate through as well !
positive	i never have any difficulties finding what i want .
positive	what i love most about sheinside is the fact that they ' re so affordable .
positive	i see the clothing that sheinside sells on other_websites for 0 times the price , and i always feel_like i hit the jackpot when i buy the same styles for a more affordable price .
positive	besides the affordable price , there is so much to choose from !
positive	i discover something new whenever i shop on sheinside .
positive	i would definitely recommend this website to anyone_who seeks affordable , cute , and quality clothing .
positive	i can assure you that 00floors goes way above the norm in helping you to find an office_space .
positive	i was delightfully overwhelmed_by the number of options that they provide you with .
positive	even_though there are many listings , you can tell that they only show the best of the best .
positive	i would definitely recommend 00 floors to those of you who are particular about finding an immaculate space .
positive	i rarely call a company '_s services " perfect ", but after my experiences with perfectdataentry i must_say that they live up to their name .
positive	i needed someone to do product data_entry for my website and they were right on it !
positive	i wanted someone_who wouldn_'_t just copy and paste the contents from the web , and they gave_me just that , by being original and describing products in their own words .
positive	you would think that such unique services would cost an_arm and a leg , but perfectdataentry is definitely affordable .
positive	on top of it all , they consistently update my website for me !
positive	they ' re the best at what they do !
positive	thanks so much !
positive	anything you need for the care of your animals is available on the website at very reasonable prices and quick delivery .
positive	it may be annoying to have the same ads that pop_up even when they don_'_t apply to me , but it '_s free so i can '_t complain .
positive	i love the way that it is set_up and how easy it is to use .
positive	i hear the music i like , but also get introduced to new stuff .
positive	that is my favorite part .
positive	forever00 . com is the only place the i have purchased clothing online , because not being_able to try things on usually makes me really nervous .
positive	but i their style is so cute and the size_chart really helped_me out .
positive	i love the jewelry sale and even with the cost of shipping i got a great deal .
positive	the shirt and necklace i bought are now my favorites !
positive	i loved the variety of products that were offered on the site .
positive	the checkout_process was easy and i love the free_shipping !
positive	every time that i want to search something , google is the only search_engine that i want to use .
positive	i love all the features .
positive	i needed to order some duffel bags with printed logos on short order .
positive	i appreciate that i quickly got through to an actual human who understood my needs .
positive	my customer_service rep and billing rep were easy to work with , provided quick service , and on top of all that my order was received in advance of when it was promised .
positive	i will gladly work with pinnacle again .
positive	we ordered a new solar_cover reel and poles , the poles were dented when we got them and we couldn_'_t get them apart , we called customer_service and with no_hassle they sent us new ones out the next_day .
positive	i wish other_companies treated their customers like this .
positive	thank_you doheny '_s , you have a customer for life !!

positive	very fast shipping , i checked other_sites and they were the cheapest by $_00 . 00 .
positive	ik_heb onlangs een leatherman wave , de extra bitset en een koordhouder / klip als set aangeschaft bij knives & tools .
positive	na wat gebrowsed te hebben bleek knives & tools de voordeligste aanbieder .
positive	omdat_ik binnen een week voor langere tijd voor werk naar het_buitenland zou gaan en_ik_een leatherman mee wilde nemen voor_de zekerheid even gebeld of deze bestelling binnen dat tijdsbestek geleverd kon worden .
positive	hieruit bleek dat dat voor_het mes en_de bitset geen probleem was , maar wellicht voor_de koordhouder wel .
positive	de k & t medewerkster meldde daarop uit zichzelf dat_ze deze zending wel in twee delen kon sturen , zodat het zeker zou_zijn dat_ik het mes op_tijd zou hebben .
positive	de aanbiedingssetprijs bleef hierbij gewoon van kracht .
positive	twee dagen_later had ik het mes en_de bitset in huis en op_de_dag van vertrek de koordhouder eveneens .
positive	al met al in mijn ogen een zeer vakkundige en behulpzame service voor_een bijzonder acceptabele prijs .
positive	i had no_problems using hifx and recommend it as a way to transfer money overseas .
positive	i found appliances on line with a google_search and bought both a freezer and a washing_machine .
positive	i was very impressed not only with the value for money but also the speed of delivery and the excellent way they kept in touch with me to let_me know what time the machines would be delivered so i didn_'_t have to stay in all day .
positive	hi online shop an compare prices ... by_far i aways find best price at b_&_h
positive	one of my babies was just recently_diagnosed with canine diabetes and my vet was not able to get me the food that they recommended she start eating .
positive	( royal_canin diabetic ).
positive	the food is very expensive to begin with , but when i was shopping the internet , a lot of the other_sites were charging a shipping fee .
positive	( one quoted $_00 . 00 !).

positive	thank_you mr . chewy !
positive	with the all new costs associated with her diabetes ( insulin , testing supplies , etc_.)
positive	every dollar saved is very much_appreciated !

positive	i used hotdoodle about four years years_ago to design my first web_site .
positive	they did a fabulous job and i still get compliments !
positive	when it finally came time to upgrade another web_site which i had designed myself about eight years_ago , it was a natural to solicit hotdoodle to do the new design for me .
positive	once again , they have been super to work with and the process was painless !
positive	the designer assigned to my new project , jeffrey , was quick to implement the project and there has definitely been a feeling of " team spirit " throughout the process .

positive	honestly , every_detail and concern i had was immediately addressed and i am very happy with the end_result !

positive	when your in need of a helping hand and need quick convinient loan , i would highly_recommend cash time over all other title loan companies .
positive	i like it that petflow has many different brands of dog_food to buy .
positive	they have good pricing as well , and fast shipping .
positive	some places i have ordered from , the bag is torn by the time i receive it on my end .

positive	thank_you for being such a great company to deal with !
positive	would certainly recommend , kept me informed at all times and arrived when it was supposed to .
positive	i am new to the company and did not know which stickers we had previously ordered .
positive	the customer_service rep at websticker immediately pulled_up my account information and helped_me find my past orders .
positive	it made the ordering process so simple .
positive	i was happy to be able to speak with an actual representative .
positive	i will be ordering from them again !
positive	i am a 00_yr . old widow so the convenience of having my dog_food delivered right to my door is such a tremendous_help .

positive	this has_been my first time using bookbyte for renting my textbooks and as we all know , it '_s a much_better deal than buying .
positive	i must_say that this experience has_been a good one !
positive	they were the lowest_price for my textbook rental , they made the renting process easy as_pie , and my book arrived earlier_than on time !
positive	i will_definitely recommend this site to my peers looking to save some money on expensive class required materials !
positive	when ordering my screen there were instructions helping_me make every decision .
positive	they helped clear up any confusion i had about what screen type my computer needed & included instructional videos on how to fix my laptop model .

positive	i '_m a single_mother from newyork and currently my son is doing research in south_africa .
positive	the cost of international_calls is too high , because of which we barely spoke once in 00 days .
positive	few_months back one of my son '_s colleagues suggested rebtel to make cheap international_calls .
positive	my son explained to me the concept of rebtel which is based on internet telephony and why the calls made using rebtel are cheap .
positive	both of us have local rebtel numbers on which we make a call , which gets internationally connected and that '_s how we speak to each other , every third day .
positive	and it is super easy to use .
positive	i don_'_t have to worry_about the bill s i can make payment through my credit_card .
positive	i would sincerely recommend their customer_support for guiding me through the entire_process .
positive	since my son is always busy on field , i take help from rebtel customer_support .
positive	the support system is apt and easily understandable by someone like me who is not technology friendly .
positive	i have even suggested rebtel to my sister living in downtown chicago .
positive	i just have one suggestion , please post me newsletters or other offers since i don_'_t use the internet often .
positive	thank_you rebtel !
positive	!
positive	it '_s easy to go online and order what you need .

positive	“ thank_you for very quick service !”
positive	as always , luna_bazaar comes through with flying_colors .
positive	while i pride myself on being very " crafty ", there comes a time when you realize you ' re working 00 + hours per week , your time is precious and you ' re just too darn tired at the end of the week to cut paper flowers .
positive	after designing my daughter '_s graduation_party table decorations , i went in search of tissue_paper to make large flowers .
positive	i used to love making those as a kid !
positive	the price for colored tissue_paper , outrageous .
positive	unless i wanted to buy in bulk , which i did not .
positive	luna_bazaar '_s pom pom flowers were the perfect answer to not only my design , but also my party budget .
positive	once we have the pom pom '_s puffed and placed , i will submit a photo .
positive	you can '_t go wrong with luna_bazaar .
positive	trust me , 00 + years in retail , party planning and customer_service , luna_bazaar knows_how to do it right !

positive	perfect .
positive	the follow - up from the company is great , too .
positive	they send you emails reminding you of pertinent_information .
positive	so great !
positive	love sparefoot .
positive	as a first time buyer , i took_advantage of free_shipping , as well as a discount , and was very pleased .
positive	petflow offers alot of the " natural " products i feed my cats , and i , as well as my cats , couldn_'_t be_happier .
positive	my only issue was with postage bags and the staff at mazuma made that easy by emailing the information through i will_definitely be using them again
positive	i have been purchasing cosmeceuticals for years from this site .

positive	i ordered some solid_gold dry_dog_food from these people because with the free_shipping , thy ended_up being the cheapest i could find either online or in my area .
positive	i ordered a bunch of bags thinking in case the price went up i would have some for a while .
positive	when the order came , they must have been out of the 00 . 0 pound_bags this food normally comes in , so they sent 0 00_lb_bag for each of the 00 . 0 lb_bags i ordered .
positive	i can not imagine they made a dime sending me more product for the same price and in easier containers that not only store easier but also since there is less open at a time , are fresher longer .
positive	i have been intending to call customer_service , but saw this link ( a month after it was sent ) asking me for an honest rating , and i can tell you honestly that i would like to order my future dog_food from these people .
positive	it was prompt and in good condition , and better_than bargained for !!!!

positive	my dyson vacuum_cleaner arrived within two_days , free_postage and the price beat amazon by nearly_£_00 .
positive	can '_t get better_than that .
positive	item not immediately available ( as was the case with other_suppliers ) so agreed a delivery date based on availability and my return from holiday .
positive	i was kept up to date during this two week period and the day before delivery was due i was notified that i would receive a call after 0am the following_day with a 0 hour delivery slot .
positive	at_0am that day i received a text_message and an_automated landline message to tell me that delivery would be between 0 and 0pm .
positive	this was followed_up a couple of hours_later with a call from the delivery driver confirming this time_slot .
positive	this enabled_me to go out earlier in the day and having spent many , many wasted hours waiting in for deliveries in the past , this was greatly_appreciated .
positive	when it did arrive , the delivery drivers were friendly but professional and very efficient .
positive	an excellent service .
positive	i would have no_hesitation in recommending appliances_online .

positive	i '_ve used priceline several_times to book hotels at the last_minute .
positive	i can '_t_believe what great deals i '_ve gotten - much less_than half price .
positive	i don_'_t think i '_ll use any other site any more !!
positive	on one trip the hotel had problems with their cleaning staff so the room was never cleaned .
positive	the hotel manager and priceline worked together and refunded a substantial portion of my payment .
positive	i don_'_t understand people being upset about the no refund policy when it '_s the person booking the trip who caused the issue , not priceline or the rental place .
positive	airlines do the same thing .
positive	nonrefundable tickets are cheaper at an airline which is the same idea as priceline .
positive	i love the site and recommend it to everyone !
positive	the quality of the merchandise was excellent as was the variety .
positive	all the items were very useful n my pups were very excited
positive	would definitely recommend the service that mazuma provide .
positive	i had drawers full of handsets and old_mobiles and would have just thrown them away ... even_though they werent worth an awful not , it was still nice to receive a cheque at the end of it .
positive	their website was easy to navigate and the process was pretty straightforward .
positive	i also liked and appreciated that you could make contact with the company and speak to an actual_person on the phone .
positive	i never trust a company that doesnt have a phone_number .
positive	have recommended mazuma already ( via a facebook_wall post ) as i know i have a lot of friends who could utilise this service .
positive	would definatly recommend to others and would shop again !
positive	pick_up time was quick and had the car running and waiting .
positive	can '_t get any better_than that !
positive	took 0 days to be delivered , was well_packaged and the cheapest i could find on the net .
positive	i would definately_use them again .
positive	thank_you for being so very considerate on timeliness on shipping .

positive	finding petflow has made my life so much_better !
positive	petflow is amazing !
positive	the food arrived so quickly ... i truly wasn_'_t expecting it so fast !
