neutral	it took over an_hour of constantly calling trying to get through hanging about in the damp and cold before somebody answered .
negative	they say they ship within 00_hours but they don_'_t !!!
positive	you might think these are a bit_pricey for t towel , but these are in another league with weight , design and quality .
neutral	the other product did not come until over a week_later even_though both were shipped within a day of each other .
neutral	i was not impressed by his service or his abilities as a driver .
positive	i would love you even more if you started making jiu - jitsu gis .

negative	the customer service person told me it will take 00 business days to receive my refund .
negative	i ordered a dress for myself and my daughter ( who was going to be the flower girl ).
neutral	selection / catalog is great , easy to order at website , but the size / quality of the items was not consistent .
positive	thank_you again .
negative	they are all perfect there .
positive	the only_thing we didn_'_t have was the transfers through jv as the cost was £_000 for 0 of us - nearly all the taxis seat 0 so the cost was high for a five seater .
positive	track it
negative	they can g - g - f !
neutral	we are 00 years old and carrying our own luggage three flights was hard .
positive	i used ebookers several_times without_any problem .
negative	well , that being said ; because of their inaccurate shipping estimate , gift_cards that i sent to family_members that were supposed to arrive this week ; are now scheduled to arrive a little too close to christmas for my comfort .
positive	sf_herb never has let_me down .
neutral	this is not the first time i have had boiler_juice problems and i am now considering using another route for my oil orders
negative	i '_ve since contacted amazon and reported the issue .
positive	i would highly_recommend you for your professionalism .
positive	didn_'_t have time to go to our local_store , so thought i ' d try the website for a present for our neice .
positive	i have tried numerous other_websites including others in the uk and ones further afield such as china and the usa .
positive	i was upset to find that rei and sport chalet quit stocking it so i ordered a new one ( after 0 years ) directly from photonlight directly .
negative	i suppose that '_s what you get with cheap !
neutral	in america you can ship a package and have it tracked without_having to sign for it at the time of deliver .
positive	entire_process was fast with great e_-_mail communication .
negative	" oh it '_ll be with you soon , it '_s in their warehouse ".
neutral	by time locate , it had been 0wks . may as well keep them .
negative	do not believe all the 0 * rating reviews , they are almost certainly bogus .
negative	dpd do not deliver my parcel to my home .
negative	not with avas_flowers !
negative	i say if your looking for what dr . oz suggests and go to this site , check elsewhere .
negative	i would not recommend this company .
negative	apparently the code for battlefield_0 they gave_me was not real , and ea themselves stated that the retailer you have purchased the game have generated the illegal key .
negative	after i obviously refused to pay the return shipping on the incorrect part , the customer service person put me on hold for 00_minutes .
neutral	so i had to call my vet and have them special order the food ( my vet doesn_'_t carry the one the cat needs to be on ), which they did .
negative	i don_'_t even want to discuss money . that is already resolved .
negative	sent him a separate bill for admin charges after he got back .
negative	you placed your order and paid the money … then you started the longest period of waiting in your life .
negative	again , i had to wait .
neutral	when i received the order i only received two as one was out of stock .
positive	he walked me through each tire to find the set that suited me needs most .
positive	great cs and helpful staff .
neutral	the customer_service at petswag ( or lack thereof ) does seem a bit unprofessional , which will cause me to hesitate before placing another order or recommending this website .
neutral	the ring was quite misshaped when returned .
positive	good service , always deliver within the time_frame .
negative	the first time i called the day they received it to make_sure that i would receive a refund .
neutral	signed on during the time i was waiting for the email and discovered they were in stock - ordered 00 day supply .
negative	i even filed with the better business_bureau and the case was closed because ami wouldn_'_t respond or provide information .
negative	additionally you ask me below to check that " i accept the terms & conditions , and privacy_policy which you did not provide and explanation what those terms and conditions , & privacy_policy are ?
positive	they very kindly deleted the one i ' d chosen and fixed the whole order within hours .
negative	first my daughters favorite flower is a sunflower and i needed them bad to make her smile , you see her gracie died sunday her sweet dog .

positive	not this firm , next_day delivery as i had asked them , yes i paid_extra but they kept their promised not like some firms .
neutral	i am still_waiting for a reply .
positive	i used to be on a contract with another supplier but felt that my loyalty wasn_'_t being rewarded so i shopped_around and decided to give boiler_juice a go .
positive	when i received them , they were easy to assemble .
positive	i have found this company absolutely amazing .
positive	it is incredibly convenient .
positive	great products and thanks !
neutral	waited_until 00pm and nothing .
positive	really excellent service .
neutral	i placed the order a month back and was told to wait 00 working days for delivery to singapore .
neutral	otherwise i would have given up when i realized how difficult it was to use the web_site .
negative	immediately , i called the support line and explained to the call_centre operator exactly why i believed that the visit ought not to be chargeable .
negative	i am holding them to that and if they make any charges to my account , i will have to contact my bank about it .
positive	great service and delivery , i was informed of delivery date , time_slot etc . excellent ;)
negative	however , we did not accept the delivery as it was not as ordered .
positive	two_days after dropping it off with ups , i received a full_refund for the receiver because it was not repairable .
neutral	det_var altså stadig d . 00 / 0 , der stod som seneste leveringsdato .
negative	i will not be using them again . by_far the worst online experience i have had .
neutral	another problem is that nobody_answers the queries .
positive	they are reliable , and with the new prices i no_longer have to pay taxes , which definitely does not turn me off .
positive	fantastic service and very competitive_prices .
negative	they obviously have no scruples or business_ethics .
negative	not the way to run a business - especially a prescription_diet for a dog that has to eat only this .
negative	reluctantly i returned it again , this time it was swiftly collected but again they held onto they pc for around 0_weeks .
positive	the free_samples let you try out some new product before you buy to see how you like it and if it is a fit for you !
neutral	this is exactly_what i was looking for , as my supply company sends me tubing that is flat - shaped and it often kinks .
positive	people always ask me where i get my clothes and when i say victoria '_s secret catalog they ' re surprised .
positive	:)
positive	no reason to shop anywhere_else for my supplements .
negative	i ordered scrub pants put them in my cart and checked out without a problem .
positive	this site has had everything i '_ve needed so_far for my 0000_saab 0 - 0 , and the prices are quite competitive .
negative	# wordstothewise
positive	i have to say that ink_farm and i are " just the right fit ".
neutral	they told me i '_ll be totally refund for the inconvenience but when i asked why the unlock couldn_'_t be done , they finally sent me the unlocking process email .
positive	always great selection of sale items !
neutral	why wasnt i offered the best price the first time ?
neutral	i '_m always waiting for my two perfums . where are they ??
positive	the service was simplicity_itself and i really appreciated having both a choice of potential suppliers , some good cheap quotes - and good service at the end of it .
positive	adjustable strap excellent .

positive	great service , great prices , great company !
negative	the only phone # listed had me on hold_forever and i wound_up hanging up after half an_hour .
neutral	i did a ph strip test on my culligan water after putting 00 drops in a liter of water .
neutral	read the full email because it clearly_stated that fitting could take 00_minutes per_tyre !
neutral	i ordered stereo knobs and there were 0 in the pic and 0 when i received them .
positive	thank_you !
positive	have loved it all !
positive	ordering was easy , even for an old_school grandad like me , & they kept me informed about the progress of my cooker .
neutral	if i see something on my credit_report i call identity_guard and they give me something different than one of the credit agency '_s says but they wont change it .
positive	einfach benützung
neutral	oh , well .

positive	it was in my paypal in less_than an_hour after i shipped the broken product back .
positive	so_far , from 0_weeks of use we have noticed an increase in product reviews and conversions .
positive	your staff ( melody ) was so patient and helpful in explaining the process for returns and in - store credits .
neutral	why ?
negative	i ordered a netball hoop set for my daughter and as i needed it for saturday_morning i ordered thursday , paid the extra for next_day delivery and waited at home friday for it to arrive .
neutral	their website '_s staff page does not contain one editor or proofer , rather , it shows several software engineers instead .
negative	only jetblue could assign that seat !!!!
neutral	i just received two more today and guess what -- they are 0 00 / 00 ".
neutral	love the room .
negative	you 0 : 00
positive	i got on your website and were very pleased with how quickly you got a hold of our vet and filled the order .
negative	can someone say trying to fix ratings ?
positive	all flights , transfers and hotels were spot on . i would recommend this company to anyone looking to travel .
negative	i was quite surprised when it arrived with a purple ribbon and not the red ribbon as shown with the open book on the web_site .
positive	why should i go elsewhere ?
negative	my guess is probably not !
positive	i would definitely recommend them .
positive	a loyal_customer
neutral	na_een mailtje was het opgelost .
positive	website is easy to navigate and understand .
positive	i have never been disappointed in the shoes or boots i have ordered .
negative	no one called me at 0 : 00 or after .
positive	agencies not 0 giving me a peace of mind .
positive	-
neutral	so we waited , and on the last day of the estimated shipping period the parts arrived and we buttoned the car up belated .
neutral	i ordered an oil pump for a 0000_toyota_camry .
negative	aaaaarrrrrggggghhhh !
neutral	remember , this is a big_bus_tour , not just a hop on hop_off bus ride .
negative	they are a terrible company to deal with and i wouldn_'_t touch them with a barge pole !
positive	however before i went to spain , i needed shorts , which i could easily search for across the ranges .
positive	convenient and great prices .
negative	what did ebay say ?
negative	and am well aware this is not how business should be done .
neutral	however , she was simply happy to have her laptop operational again .
positive	would highly_recommend them
negative	idiots !
neutral	fridge seal purchased for same fridge was £_00 !
positive	will_definitely recommend .
negative	they told me the part was useless , it cannot perform the needed tasks to clear the check_engine_light .
positive	overall a very speedy and pleasing service .
positive	i now have a really useful mango cutter that i did not even know_existed !
neutral	i was able to book my reservation through tobias , so all seemed convenient .
neutral	the quailty was soft and wearable with any casual wear .
neutral	everytime i order , it takes a week to even ship out and get a tracking_#.
neutral	i then transferred myself to a live_person and she advised me she would have the system send the card again .
neutral	i have to say that their customer service is not good .
neutral	another phone_call was made and this time i was told they would contact the warehouse and only after a small stock take of the item was completed then they would forward the item 0st_class recorded .
negative	we have also tried the salmon , which is great , but really to costly for my family .
positive	almost all the cars were bought from car_rentals or private owners who maintained their vehicles .
neutral	not cool .
positive	fast delivery , parts fit and work great , saved money .
negative	worst on line experience , wasted alot of time and money !
negative	who are you ?
negative	never , never never use this crowd .
neutral	fast delivery though

negative	not good customer_service !!
neutral	so i tried again with a tiny change in my address .
neutral	very unhappy that the original cruise i had paid a deposit on was suddenly changed - not the cruise agent '_s fault - but this should never have happened .
positive	meget_tilfreds !
negative	i chose an offer , accepted it , but they were unable to fulfill , as their screen message essentially said things are changing in real time and the offer was no_longer available .
neutral	in the end , after numerous_emails they offered a full_refund .
positive	i did not think i could get as good service from an on - line provider as i get from the local t - shirt print shop ; i was wrong .
positive	informative , detailed website .
positive	greatest selection and best price .
negative	waited over a month for glasses that never showed_up !
positive	expert customer_service , they deal with all types of problems to help you get your meds for your loved pets !
negative	i am beyond disappointed and plan on contacting bbb as soon as i can .
neutral	well i have had my say you choose .
positive	i was able to dry it out and get it to turn on but the microphone wouldn_'_t work .
negative	after a couple of days , i followed_up .
neutral	however , the surcharged delivery is a major problem that will_definitely stop me shopping with you again , unfortunately .
negative	i ordered a catalyic converter and not only did they send me the wrong one , they want me to pay the shipping_costs to send it back to them . and then tell me i may have to pay a restocking_fee of 00_% for something that is totally their fault !
neutral	please fix this so i can use your product !!
negative	who_wants furniture that everybody has sat on tried and tested it .
positive	will_defiantly do_business again
neutral	when i had a customer service question it had a reply instantly .
negative	it is ridiculous to pay $ 00000 in fees for companies that don_'_t provide real service .
positive	the product tastes so good , almost_half the tub was finished in 00h !
neutral	i had to go back through the designs , page by page , to find the ones i wanted .
negative	so how would your warehouse people even know that they were shipping the part that was ordered .
positive	order #_000000000
positive	i was amazed_at how prompt my order arrived .
negative	dyrt var_det också .
positive	we have two windows in our kitchen , one of which is very long .
neutral	item delivered on time as stated , good communication immediately prior to delivery by e_-_mail and text_message .
negative	they contacted me saying it was the power_supply , again there was going to be a charge , which i obviously refused to pay and the eventually returned it .
negative	she said nothing about the company not having contacted me about the delay in shipping .
positive	the follow_up was great .
neutral	nearly_impossible to reach . no phone_number . you must fill_out a form and wait 00 - 00_hours for a return email .
positive	even when i have orders shipped to other_places around the country , they are received quickly .
negative	this is a present for day 0 of hannukah , and looks like we will miss the date .
negative	that '_s ridiculous .
positive	i thought i got a geat deal and just loved this
negative	if it wasn_'_t the best protection i would go back to norton in a heartbeat
positive	my last order on monday was delivered wednesday .
positive	but i could order just a six pack at a time instead of twelve .
negative	the usps would not accept any responsibility for a mis_- delivery & when i called to inform you about non_- delivery i was accused of " stealing the item "!!!
positive	whenever i '_m shopping for electronics , i always check with b_&_h first .
positive	would definatly recomend
neutral	they pacakaged everything into the phone box which i found incredibly odd .
positive	i decided to order a giant supply of cat_food and dog_food from petflow .
positive	english is not his first language , i am sure , but he really covered everything very well with attention to detail .
negative	?
negative	received email for item shipped ( with no options ) totaling_$_00 . 00 .
positive	ads never hesitated and sent us a perfect set of lenses to self install .
neutral	used food warmer . could have been cleaned better .
negative	will never use again .
negative	unfortunately , if you notice the shipping time , that would come moldy and disgusting too .
positive	polite staff , quick service .
neutral	it maybe a slight thing to complain_about but i find the wowcher credits a good idea and a slight compensation especially when a wowcher i buy has_been really bad ie_: the swan pan set absolutely_ridiculous buy they were didn_'_t last 0 minutes and when i bought a dinner set and 0 of the cups were broken on arrival
neutral	ten days after_placing the order i sent an e_-_mail and a telephone message ( a recording could not speak to a real_person ) requesting shipping information .
negative	parts ordered were good quality but not right for the described application .
positive	great service , would happily_recommend and use again and again .
positive	from the sales this product has generated in just 0_weeks , it has essentially paid for itself .
negative	just look at your rating here .
negative	spoke with [_name ] about the terrible service offered twenty_five pounds
negative	it sounds_like a great deal , but it '_s all just really half pulled together .
neutral	room is clean & nice with the necessary basic needs .
neutral	i wasn_'_t advised how long it would take to get them shipped until i had already paid .
neutral	waiting 00 days is too long for an update .
positive	lights will look lovely in the garden in the summer .
neutral	i bought 0 bottles and i may have to return 0 since i '_m not convinced it '_s helping .
neutral	the email said it would be here by july 00 .
neutral	still_waiting on these items :
positive	i had ordered contact_lenses from another site who didnt bother to tell me they were on back order so after cancelling i went to this website and found the right lenses easily and ordered for normal delivery .
positive	the quality and mateial is excellent for the price .
positive	the price was the lowest i found and when i placed the order , i received my product the next_day .
neutral	one thing i should add is that their customer_support is very good if you catch them online that is , all i asked the customer_support representative was why was my cd_key banned and he immediately gave_me a new one , sure it made me wonder_whether they were expected this to happen , but still they were very prompt .
neutral	it could break very easy .
positive	i received my jeep tail_light_assembly from partsgeek as_promised .
positive	the price was good and the service was very prompt ( i did not pay £ 0 for next_day delivery being a mean old fart )
positive	thank_you !
positive	all in all pretty_much all you need when making an important appliance purchase .
positive	very quick shipment and receipt .
negative	i booked plane_tickets and car_rental when i want to cancel the car_rental , they
neutral	that is what i will do next time i have to send flowers .
positive	would recommend to anyone - in fact i '_ve brought a leaflet back for someone to look at !
negative	but on top of that they said there is a service fee for the airline , come on , i '_m not cancel the airplane ticket , it says clearly on my credit_card , 0 transaction , 0 for airline , 0 for car rent .
neutral	excellent service but fail to understand_why the price can vary by over £_00 within few_days .
positive	very cool costume and excellent turnaround on shipping .
neutral	no !
positive	brilliant
neutral	i ordered on the 00th and received it on the 00th .
negative	dear michael ,
negative	poor customer_service .
negative	obviously been sitting in some warehouse pile since midweek .
neutral	the upgrade with built in gps turned_out to be a mercedes_benz and the additional_cost ($_000 for the 00 days ) greatly exceeded what we had pre_- paid auto_europe for the basic rental ($_000 ).
neutral	the hat was nice and pretty warm and cute but skirt was missing .
negative	i usually deal with coventry west and have ordered a replacement .
positive	im just about to order some more .

negative	cost me $_00 to return hose .
positive	i really appreciate biz0credit .

positive	i '_ve bought from cult_pens twice_now , they have a lot of stuff i needed but wasn_'_t able to find here in rome .
neutral	!
positive	delivery faster_than_expected .
negative	not wont reply to calls , emails , nothing , they are keeping my money that i had in my account and will not give it back " host to god !"
neutral	quite frustrated .
negative	i am trying to contact someone to solve my problem and no one cares !
neutral	if you pay extra for the insurance i would think it should cover shipping the broken part back to the shipper at no charge to me .
positive	fantastic website .
negative	now stuck with a part that doesn_'_t work , $_000_dollars down the drain .
negative	what a mess and alpharooms customer service was terrible . they just kept passing the buck and we almost never got to go on our holiday because of their very poor customer service .
positive	i am more than happy with the service that dinopc provided and i would strongly_recommend them to anyone .
negative	a whole month and some days .
positive	parts_geek came through .
positive	the price of the item was the cheapest i '_ve_seen , so i purchased the item through their website to reserve the item - no money was taken from my card until the item was dispatched .
negative	you can go to amazon and purchase a squaretrade_warranty considerably_cheaper then on the squaretrade website .
positive	the products are all top quality .
negative	our conversation
positive	sam from transglobal has_been absolutely brilliant .
neutral	i absolutely_loved the frames !
negative	in fact , when i turned the car in , i asked for a refund , the attendant said that was all she could do , she told me i ' d have a $_00 credit , but only $_00 showed_up on my credit_card .
negative	i hope sometime in the next few_months i get some credit for that money .
neutral	it took two_weeks for the item to get to me .

positive	excellent service .
negative	i will advertise drive time all over this car .
positive	we love xprs capital , they are very timely in getting back to their customers .
negative	00_minutes on hold !

neutral	so cool .
negative	if it was you spending $ 0000 . 00 wouldn_'_t you .
positive	i would refer this web_site to others , for all there part needs .
negative	can i receive confirmation if this was delivered or credit if it wasnt ?
positive	however , the carriers damaged one of the tile_backer orbry boards in delivery .
neutral	rev is an electronic platform for clients and translators to post jobs and files .
neutral	my first time at town_fair .
negative	the call - in number is practically fully auto - mated and if your solution isn_'_t among those pre_- scripted , it will often go through a loop and you '_ll get no answers .
negative	also , they don_’ t return your e_- mails or phone_calls .
neutral	( although took a year to get there , hurrah !)
negative	i will never order another thing from this site again !!
neutral	two orders were terrible .
positive	so now all my friends know about you .

positive	that was not going to happen --- my cat is deathly afraid of the vet !
neutral	i feel_duped !
negative	i realize that the problem lies with fed_ex , but parts_geek '_s lack of help is disappointing to say the least .
neutral	i ordered a bunch of parts for many different vehicles and the tracking_number says it '_s in one part of the country but is actually on my door_step but only part of the order .
negative	i called the very instant i got the message ( several tries to get through , long wait time ) and was told that i would get the refund not credit .
positive	tim takes my order and despatches to my home
neutral	please use skepticism when shopping here .
positive	the flate rate shipping fee is fair and the shipping is super_fast !
negative	i rang a week_later and the problem evidently was in the internet ordering system .
neutral	the service provided by selectspecs was exemplary , my glasses were reglazed within 00 days which was good however the lens quality wasn_'_t up to stratch ( if you pardon the pun ) after a month '_s normal usage the lenses on the glasses have became rather scratched , despite the " anti_- scratch protection ".
neutral	yes got a double occupancy room but it was a double_bed which i had to share with a friend and although we know each other very well , and are good friends we didn_'_t particularly want to sleep in the same bed !
neutral	i contacted hostelworld with the problem and the were very unsympathetic to our problem and more or less said ' we will credit back the deposit but you need to book somewhere_else .'
neutral	got the extra super cover insurance which was very good indeed to give us peace of mind .
negative	00 days_later and 000 gbp the poorer we have no merchandise .
positive	i have a standard poodle that goes through big bags of food , and i use a brand that can '_t just be picked_up at any store , and i can try a different brand at the click of a button .
positive	i carefully check the market and have yet to find anyone to come_close on price .
positive	no more going to the post_office !
negative	i can get better prices from other website and better service .
neutral	print it out before you go to the airport they won_'_t let you on the plane if you try showing it on your phone funny bc you can print a screen_shot .
positive	it comes in about 0 days which is great and i always get a free gift , which so_far have been excellent .
positive	as i rely_on their efficient service for prescription medicines i have not yet had any_problems and most of all the " price is right "
negative	result , i had to return all the polo court / t - shirts to exchange for a size l . they didn_'_t bother to offer me the return cost ( my order was about £_000 though ).
neutral	vad gäller de 000_kr för tjänst ?
negative	now i have to order this food from somewhere_else and i have to pick overnight shipping and pay for it .
neutral	if only my menu was actually my menu , i would still be a customer .
negative	after advising the customer_service rep of this they asked for his gp to fill_out a form and i advised he wasn_'_t sick , he died suddenly after falling into a canal and drowned and was taken directly to the morgue .
positive	just what internet ordering should be - click to basket , comes a couple of days_later - job_done
positive	i love this shop the best priced games and everything is delivered super_fast also the deals on pre_- order games are amazing i buy all my games here and will_continue to do so as you cant_beat the price and speed of delivery keep_up the good work shopto
neutral	however very disappointed that i was unable to get refund ( only exchange or credit note ) for returns to shops - very unlikely to use service again for this reason .
negative	i didn_'_t believe at first but after entering a website that had a lower price to my surprise not only did they match lowest_price but i also got an_additional 0 %_discount .
positive	all our family will use fcc from now on !!
positive	excellent staff and i totally .
positive	i am very please with the timely service here !
neutral	i emailed them again about this , they would respond , i don_'_t know when ?
positive	i will be buying from them again .

neutral	generate a regular flow of reviews from genuine customers automatically with trustpilot business .
neutral	you must submit a form .
neutral	my order was shipped in 0 differenent boxes , since all the parts were small they could have fit in one medium box , they all came on 0 different days .
negative	my booking experience was great , your rep was wondering .
neutral	other web sights you ordered front or rear_rotors and it would have two front or two rear_rotors per box and it stated if it was one item per box .
negative	the lack of the correct part cost me $_000 for to replacement and $_00 extra to remove and install the part the second time .
negative	they are completely_useless and i would advise agaainst anyone ever using them
neutral	i called customer service , but they do not answer phone_calls .

negative	everyone i talked to blamed it on someone_else , travelocity blamed delta and delta blamed the insurance company .
negative	prices constantly higher_than others and for a holiday i am planning to norway i looked at their offerings in many different towns - always more_expensive than others .
neutral	my nearest best buy is quite a long trip from my home and workplace .
neutral	i think pictures or a diagram on the hiving instructions would be a great improvement and an_email_confirmation when an order is placed regarding the bee shipping process would be more comforting .
neutral	they absolutely did not give a shit !
neutral	unfortunately for millbryhill they use a useless delivery couriers who only deliver in the mornings and depot for collection is miles_away .
positive	a great concept and i shall_certainly order again .

positive	driver rung to say he was near by was clean tidy x very helpful everything was fantastic would recommend
neutral	customer_service via_email or phone .
negative	emails just get the usual " we are dealing_with it " response or disappear into the ether and simply go unanswered .

neutral	there was no option for over nighting the part , which i needed very much .

positive	never worry_about my transfer as it always goes through without a problem
positive	pretty_much everything i need .
neutral	this added nearly 00_% to the cost , negating any supposed discount !
positive	top_notch quality across the board on all products that i hace sampled
neutral	i receive bi - weekly emails_updating me on things that have happened nearby .
neutral	if you can spend money without calling , for them to pretend not spending is for your benefit instead of make it hard to cancel . that insults my intelligence .
neutral	but when i got those clothes , awesome .
negative	excellent chair and table , appalling customer_service !
positive	i damaged my iphone 0 beyond repair .
positive	this is the 0th year our community event has used affordable_buttons .

neutral	i feel the website could be more user_friendly and it wouldn_'_t let_me book my travel_plans .

negative	had to call for the second time the agent says you have to fax us the receipts .
negative	when i first started reading and collecting these i had my local newsagents put them up for me but nowadays i subscribe to them and get them all delivered to my door , this service is far easier , as you don_'_t have to worry_about forgetting to collect them each_month and there are also deals that save you money if you subscribe to multiple issues .
neutral	i was sent an_email the next_day stating they would be collected anytime after 00_minutes later !
positive	hampden , me

negative	i tried to cancel this purchase but they request to charge cancellation_fee , so i tried to explain about this situation to customer_service in order to wave the cancellation_fee .

neutral	with this in mind i chose the same product as before for my current project , but although the magnets stick to the metal frame as expected , unfortunately the ' glue ' to stick the magnets in place is not strong_enough , thus meaning i have to keep repositioning them when they come away , very frustrating .

negative	i called again today and they told me that the refund was never logged .
negative	the worst part of both experiences is the frustration of not being_able to speak with a live_person about the situation and how the return_policy works .

negative	yesterday i made my first reservation with easytobook . com and confirmed an erroneous date .
neutral	i '_m very picky and can '_t eat some foods .

positive	cant_fault rentalcars . com though .
positive	-
neutral	there are some good deals , however when something does quite work out and you want a refund you have to wait a few_weeks before you receive anything .
positive	oldies . com is the best value for unique and difficult to find cd '_s - dvd '_s - albums and books .
negative	corporate minutes
positive	key available in seconds ready for activation , no_frills , no_messing just the key that you need delivered superfast and at a kickass price , would highly_recommend and will be using again !

negative	i immediately attempted contact via ph and they never answered .
neutral	i sent the cartridge back but have still not received my missing component .

negative	000 - 000 - 0000
neutral	it was a special order item .
negative	very frustrating .
positive	they always have what i want and the service is better_than excellent .
neutral	some were okay , while others seemed packed too tight and barely allowed water through .

negative	i spend something like $_000 for both items and got no use out of them .
neutral	no_complaints about the build or the delivery , although the latter is needlessly expensive , but customer service could do with a reboot .

negative	i '_m cutting my losses on that 00_bucks it '_s not worth dealing_with them , they won_'_t even communicate with you .
negative	now it is a pure process of finding who will answer the phone at customer service to actually help .

positive	we were contacted on the day of delivery and were given a 0hr timeslot which was brilliant and did not disrupt the day .
positive	my order was delivered very quickly , everything was packed well and arrived in good condition , we were very pleased with the products ordered .
positive	thanks .
neutral	i thought i read quite a bit on the website , but either i missed something about the smell issue , or it wasn_'_t clearly indicated .
positive	they were so helpful and knowledgable .
neutral	it was easy to submit and ship the items , but since i asked for the amount to be sent to a charity , i have not received any proof of the amount nor of the donation in my name !
positive	it '_s a classic example of how customer_service should be , but so rarely is .
neutral	also their policy of not paying the shipping even if a mistake was made and it was their fault is really bad customer_relations .

neutral	adrienne nadler
positive	when i need supplies i reach for the phone
positive	so four jobs sorted in one delivery !
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	they ' re not what you would see in any mall in us , and the fact that they sell asian_clothing is appealing to me since i am asian myself ( and i '_m into these styles of clothing ) the price is another downfall for this website especially for low - income people such as students in this economy .
neutral	they call them updates , but they are only numbers with the amount of changes , you have to do the research yourself .
neutral	i can buy similar products that have the same , if not better , effects at a drastically reduced price .
negative	on the following_day i received a very short acknowledgement that my shipment had reached me .
neutral	things like cancellation_policy usually is the deciding_factor for me .
neutral	excellent service , record of past orders and delivery very efficient .
neutral	next time i '_m going to just use the online process rather_than try to accelerate the process by calling the store directly .
neutral	this was at about 0pm est , so it wasn_'_t in the middle of the night or some other off - peak time , and since this was a major winter_storm i would have never gotten another flight if i ' d waited two hours to rebook .
negative	totally unsatisfactory experience .
negative	not happy at all .
negative	the delivery did not arrive next_day i can except that as it is the christmas_period and it is very busy .

negative	i am going to buy the appropriate things needed for this sort of advertisement just as soon as i pick my car up from the dealer this afternoon .

negative	the splash backs arrived 0th april_0000 my kitchen was finish at last on the 00th_april_0000 .
positive	i have gone to this company for so many reasons .
negative	i finally found a place to open a " support_ticket ".
neutral	the scooter was literally falling_apart after 00_hours of having received it .
positive	competitive_prices .

positive	thanks to all responsible .
neutral	i picked_up my car in florence , the service left something to be desired , total disinterest and a long wait time , 00_minutes for the paper_work and 00_minutes for the car to actually arrive .
neutral	the only problem is returning parts is a long process .
negative	i had bought a pair of glasses from global_eyeglasses a few_years_ago and it was an okay experience .
positive	would definitely use again .
neutral	well , i think they have some really cute_clothes but their prices are too high for a full time student , such as myself and i once ordered a dress for $_00 and it was horrible .
negative	too_long , isn_'_t it ?
neutral	i didn_'_t check with my local toyota_dealership but based on other parts i '_ve bought i would expect to pay at_least $_000 .
negative	its just a pain .
neutral	so the hour i spent shopping and designing cards was totally gone .
neutral	so i '_m hoping to get my $_000 + core fee back but it sounds_like that may take a month after they receive the core .
positive	i once had a problem in which i did not receive the delivery because of something which was my fault and not theirs .
neutral	it would be fine to offer this service , but the choice should be yours .

neutral	i was pleased with the amount of produce for the amount paid , however on the website it clearly shows ice blocks , insulated wrap and more ice blocks .
neutral	i '_m sure there will be more of that coming before my trip takes place .
neutral	had the company been pro - active with contacting me (" sorry about the delay , we had an equipment problem , your items are on the way ", or " we '_ve been notified by usps that their shipping website is down .
neutral	other trucking companies do not seem to have this problem .
neutral	the niceness of those i spoke with obviously went a long way .
neutral	i can understand that you need to add the publicity but it is difficult what you have booked as it is tiny in a corner or in the middle of the advertisement .
neutral	customers shouldn_'_t have to ask .

positive	he was helpful and gave some great feedback on myu purchase options .
neutral	prices offered are very low regardless of competitors prices and market rates , also i did not write a review as requested to do so in order to receive these type of responses from envirofine , i simply voiced my opinion as requested to do so .

negative	i was told we would have to wait at_least 00_minutes before water would come_back on .
negative	then , out of the blue , they finally told us that we had to get a ticket in order to be seen . so there was a mad dash over to the ticket dispenser ( which hadn_'_t been used for ages ). and even with the tickets , they called the italians to the counter first ( even_though their ticket number came after all of the other 00 - 00 people .
neutral	i got no reply which in my opinion was very poor customer_service .

neutral	i also like to support my local business .
neutral	ground_shipping just took too_long .
negative	was sent a wrong part that didnt fit , visibly bad quality .
positive	large_selection of colors .

positive	i highly_recommend b_&_h . give them a shot !

neutral	shipment arrived yesterday and many of the items were damaged .

neutral	envirophone were good but the reminders that kept sending me about sending the phone even_though it had been sent were irritating !
neutral	so , in conclusion , the scores are very accurate compared with my bank pulls for refinancing my mortgage .

negative	sempre nel mese di ottobre mi avevate dato conferma del rimborso , ma non mi avete più specificato di che rimborso si tratta ( altro cellulare , importo in denaro . e quanto ?).

neutral	combining this with the lack of users that write more than 0 review , it doesn_'_t make me feel_like this is a site i ' d recommend to other people .

neutral	parts_geek is not the manufacturer and i '_m sure they would have exchanged part but extra_cost in return shipping would have wiped out any savings in ordering part online instead of buying at local parts store .

positive	there were no " promos " that turn out to have all_kinds of eliminations where you can '_t use them .
neutral	i had been in a queue for more than 00 min ( calling long_distance ) before i decided to end the call .

positive	working with rony was truly a pleasure , he made the whole_process
positive	less per mediam flat_rate box .
negative	the ' sell part ' in both situations in number 0 is that their counter - offer will nearly always be less_than what they quoted , just below the actual market value if you have come_across well in correspondents but because you have already been through the scam '_s initial hassle you are very very likely to just take this value .
negative	i can '_t find an option to email them and their automated attendant didn_'_t give me an option to speak with a real_person .

positive	mary lyon
neutral	he put me on hold over and over and finally sent me to customer_service who put me on hold over and over .
negative	chris : unfortunately we won_'_t be able to process payments for your account .
neutral	maybe the fault of the courier used / royal_mail but this is obviously disappointing as a consumer .
negative	we were based at the st pancras reneissance hotel and we had no information as to where the bus_stops were and no else knew where they as a result we had to get a taxi down to the london_eye we then came out of the eye and thought we would go on the river_trip and were told we had to go on the bus trip first by then the big_bus was a bad smell and had to get taxis for the rest of our stay the foyer that sold big_bus tickets could only tell us of one stop across the river that she knew of . we did download the so called map from your web and had to go speksavers to read it

positive	i wanted to get a stethoscope for my fiancée , and they helped_me with not only the purchase and engraving of the stethoscope , but also finding a nice physician bag to keep that and some other stuff in .
neutral	i phoned iflorist to ask about quality as there are no reviews on the website itself , and to be sure the flowers ( for my sister '_s funeral ) would contain the number of roses as shown in the image as all three sizes offered have exactly the same picture .
neutral	the price quoted on the website for 00 g0 halogen bulbs " from £_00 . 00 " is misleading .
neutral	which as anyone_who works knows who works all day this presents it own problems .

negative	the very next_day the item arrived in the size originally ordered .
negative	however , when they did not arrive , i was told i ' d need to wait a month before they could run an investigative trace with royal_mail .
positive	the staff are extremely friendly and resolve my issues if i ever ( rarely ) have any , i even find myself just having a general chat to them .

neutral	the outer_box was not bent .
negative	this scarred of some of the group members and they decided to go to other_retailers .
positive	she was right .
positive	i ordered my fog_light and received it very fast .
negative	now they indicated i did not need part anymore to trust_pilot which i can show the almost 00 tickets and numerous_emails trying to obtain assistance .

positive	having tried many other_companies i found these_guys have a range of products that are just what i needed with great taste and i must_say the protein_shakes do exactly_what they say on the packet feel great after taking them and for a good deal of time after .
neutral	after_researching , i '_m sure i read i can update my credit_report and score on a daily_basis .
negative	the skin does not cover the whole phone and it does not look as good in the picture .
positive	they came out beautifully and i got them within a few_days .
positive	pureformulas is as close to perfection as it gets .
positive	really pleased with the excellent customer service , gloves arrived within days !
neutral	i do have a couple of things that are frustrating however .
neutral	i was ordering several items from the same range .
negative	they asked for my feedback and never posted / used it on their website ad ??
negative	and finally their online customer_service who apparently are a " service failure ". but that i knew . before they even told me !!!!
positive	the service is better , quicker and considerably_cheaper_than my previous high_street optician , which incidentally claims to be the quickest and cheapest .
neutral	i phoned tnt , said i would be away for 0 days , not to deliver until i returned , which was confirmed by them .
positive	by time i had finished dressing the commercial came back on and i was able to write the name of the company and the phone_number as well as their website .
negative	so i contacted support :
positive	they ' re fast and really professional , great choice of products with competitive price .
positive	the only_criticism i have is the charge they have added if you pay with paypal .
positive	-
positive	!
neutral	ya !
positive	i would still give them 0_stars because of the quality and price of their goods .
neutral	communication with towequipe was great but the couriers claimed they had left a card when they had not even tured up , ( cctv ).
negative	apparently the way this company works is to absolutely ignore customers with orders that are out of the ordinary in any way .
neutral	i ordered a toyota in - cabin_filter ( smaller than an avg air_filter ).
negative	thank_god my credit_card company flagged a $ 0 , 000 purchase from macy '_s coming from an ip address from china .
neutral	i '_ve booked two_separate trips recently and have not received email_confirmation for either one .

neutral	i arrived at town_fair for a 0pm scheduled appointment , checked in and assumed that service would begin shortly_thereafter .
positive	i am very happy with the juicer , as we juice large_quantities of orange , lime / lemon , grapefruit and mandarin through the year .
neutral	now , as far as service goes , when i ordered the snugg , i understood that it was a pre_- order , but the website stated that it would be shipped on january 00 , 0000 .
neutral	takes a really long time to confirm cashback and some payments simply don_'_t get tracked .
positive	excellent service
positive	i also got another great rom in st . petersburg fl by over $_00 . 00 !!
positive	ha_ha .
negative	i disconnected the call , called back , and on hold for 00_minutes , finally disconnecting the call .

neutral	i have a large air boot that i wear from a torn achilles tendon .
neutral	i found the prices very reasonable , but it took almost two_weeks to get my parts .
positive	when dealing_with their customer service i '_ve always had an answer the same day most of the time within hours .
negative	i would never order from parts_geek ever again .
negative	tony cherry bsc
negative	so i am going to contact customer service again on monday and ask for the name of the managing_director .
neutral	why give a specific time if you dont intent to work to it , i was asked if i wanted to leave the car as clearly they were not ready to do the work .
negative	you cannot call and change your order .
negative	they do not .
neutral	all went_smoothly and i received my package in an efficient manner .
neutral	buses came reasonably frequently ( except at the end of the day ), and the audio tours were also helpful ( although the channel marked with the chinese flag gave japanese language ).
negative	i am happy to be a former customer .
neutral	i '_m just not confident in your company '_s service now .
negative	nor did they do so on mothers_day as they use royal_mail , despite the fact they alluded they could do so on their site .

positive	mrs . brenda is down to earth and very patient .
neutral	the driver told us he would be right back , and told_him to pick us up first since we were left from the last pick - up .

negative	this cost us a free nights stay with choice hotels since this was our second night in their stay twice and get a free night promotion .
neutral	this was irritating to find out , especially_since it was not written anywhere on the coupon .
positive	they are great !
positive	it allows me to pay off my student_loan in nz from australia without_having to pay the horrific transfer fees !
negative	partsgeek , apparently , very commonly fails to correct errors , and calling their customer service phone consistently drops your calls , and this was mentioned on the bad service website .
negative	we were booked into the wrong hotel , at a rate of 000 . 00 per_night , and the hotels highest rate was 00 . 00 .
negative	when i received the radiator , it was broken .
neutral	the mounting studs on the tail_light were a different size and thread and the new light did not include the correct nuts .

positive	there service is prompt and the customer is kept well informed at all times . i would recommend them to all my friends .
negative	i called to have it fixed .
negative	if you check out the times that each were booked you can surely see that we did not change our mind on our flight dates ,. it strictly was a computer error and we need to have the charges reversed .
neutral	part was to received by monday 0 / 00 / 00 . ups left a note on a neighbors door saying it needed to be signed for .
neutral	the part is still sitting at the house waiting to be picked_up and my acct had not been credited .

positive	with me in a day or two and at a good price .
positive	those frames are worth waiting for & i know that backorders generally are not the fault of the stocking company so i chose to wait .
neutral	if you want to order online , add online , one time order , repeat . easy and fast .
neutral	i revisited it because you sent me the 0 %_off offer - but to be honest there are a number of these services available ( i '_ve used them all ) and the prices all vary from day to day and i could just as easily have booked one of those if the prices worked out - so the 0 % deal was in no way enough to bring me back .
positive	after ordering a few_times from countryattire all i can say is that if you ' re looking for smart and durable clothing - this is the place to shop for it !
neutral	i found some designs i liked among the pre_- designed cards and wrote_down the names exactly .

neutral	brick and mortar still has some advantages .
neutral	be prepared to have to edit everything if you want a real functioning professional site .

positive	we have rented from them before .
neutral	a rear control_arm that was exactly as pictured and described .
neutral	however , 0 - star that are dirty , rundown , and have scary clientele are within priceline guidelines .
negative	or so i thought , after_reading the small_print it mentions if someone_else joins later they want £_00 more each person admin_fee .
negative	any time of the day you call you would get the same message which tells you that it is an auto message .
negative	which they then denied they had done , obviously so they could deny liability and refuse a return .
neutral	my recomendation woudl be to always challenge the amount companies want to block on credit_cards .
negative	used the logo for our conference as the graphic and paid the postage so we ' d get them in plenty of time for giving .

positive	we drove around western and central europe for 000 days with no_hassles at all and dropped it back near charles de gaulle airport with ease .
neutral	after several tries i did finally get through to someone on live_chat which seemed as though i was ignored with long pauses between conversation to finally get what i needed .
negative	my take is go with other rental sites , as this one may costs you more than extra money in the long run .

negative	i feel_like if i didn_'_t contact them they would have kept my money .
positive	i called the order in and spoke with two nice men and they both helped_me with my order and gave_me a better deal than ordering through the website .
neutral	however , i think the following are ways to improve and help us better in the future .
positive	i priced advance_auto , auto_zone , pep_boys and parts_geek and once again parts_geek was cheaper by a mile .
neutral	we had paid for the warranty so we called them and they said it is only a one time fix on something that we did to the couch and not something that they can take_care of .

negative	i purchased tickets and insurance through_travelocity and had to cancel my trip due to business problems , we are self_employed and had to change our plans 0_weeks ahead of time and found out none of our money , insurance of booking fee or airfare was refundable , all i can say is i believe they lead you to believe if you buy insurance you are safe , completely untrue .

negative	finally had to insist on a full_refund
negative	full_disclosure they did refund me and pay for me new room and my cab over ( which they did not pay the cabby enough so i had to pay the difference ) .

negative	i bought a black 000 ink_cartridge for my hp_printer to try out infarm .

negative	also , there is a loose flap or something flapping around in the drivers_side front_wheel well .

negative	this has to be some of the worst service i have ever received in australia .
positive	i love the clothes but to be able to get such a great service and delivery makes all the difference .

positive	palvelu toimii lähes aina ; välillä " päivän kysymys " linkkien vihje - linkit eivät toimi ja joskus ovat jopa viitanneet sivustolle jossa ei ole ollut vastausta päivän kysymykseen .
neutral	now , this may not bother many people but to me , business should be about building relationships rather_than just feeling like they are taking your money .
negative	anyone reading these reviews , thinking of placing an order - be careful and ensure if you are booking a hotel to attend a concert - make_sure its refundable .

neutral	the short of this is that if hombz would send shipping information as soon as available to the customer it would give all of us a warm feeling that we were really going to get what we ordered in a timely_manor .
positive	easy to use website , clear details , and with ready reckoner once item has_been chosen , there is no argument regarding cost .

neutral	i don_'_t plan to order any more .
positive	shipping time was very short .
neutral	i was in desperate search of a side_view_mirror for my husbands truck when i finally found one afforable on partgeek .
negative	this all happened about an_hour and a half after booking ( i emailed immediately after booking and it took an_hour and a half to receive a reply ) so you would have thought there would have been a bit of give and take !

positive	great service and quality products

neutral	we recently_purchased an afk arbour and were delighted with the price and no delivery charge from gardenbest buys .
negative	wow that narrows it down .

negative	b ) you think that it is probably not worth the hassle and just accept , the delivery cost to reject the phone back will reinforce this thinking .
negative	!
positive	they kept me up to date with my order as_promised , and the price was great .
negative	well , it took them 0 business days to get back to me regarding my order .

negative	several phone_calls , emails , and chats later i gave up and attempted to cancel my order .
neutral	their quality can be an_issue too , depends on what you buy , but their jeans are weird too .
negative	if you '_ve got any_problems you have to chat online to parcel0go as there are no contact phone numbers and hermes wont deal with you directly .
positive	sometimes it '_s the availability ; sometimes it '_s the help in ordering the right product ; sometimes it '_s the service ; but this time it was the price : more than 00_% less_than i would have spent elsewhere for the identical product .

neutral	booking my reservation was easy however it was very distractive and busy at the company end .

negative	but on its return it was exactly the same .
positive	quick delivery
negative	meanwhile , one of my fellow_travelers booked a room after i supposedly had a reservation .
negative	xdp advised the supplier that it will be delivered on 00 . 00 . 00 due to an error .
negative	i have followed the usual channels to take necessary action to recover my money but really do i need this hassle from a third rate shower like this , no , i have better things to do .
negative	i returned the one sent in error in hopes of just being sent the one i wanted to begin with .
neutral	two places would have been better with a two to three hour stop at each , since all are places you can easily spend a day in .

neutral	i was able to shoot an_email to customer_service and was answered ina timely_matter about my order but when i '_m told my books will get to me 0 - 00 business days it ' d be nice to stay true to that !
neutral	but the last couple pair off brand shoes were too big at size 0 . 0 , even some 0s .
neutral	the lady could not find it on the site but knew the name of the item so she got it ordered for me .
positive	i buy shoes from ami_club and i love their prices and products .
positive	i '_ve received my purchases quickly with no_problems every time !
positive	kwik_fit didn_'_t try and sell me four tyres - they checked my car and advised that i only needed two front immediately .
positive	we used the home delivery service which is very reasonably_priced and helpful
negative	i have been fighting with them for a refund , but they lack human understanding and will not own up to the fact that their own system gave_me faulty information .
neutral	couldn_'_t believe that there was none in stock ( ever ) and that all purchases get delivered by the van .
positive	it '_s definitely a five_star shopping website and its one of my favorite sites to shop at .
positive	!
neutral	turns_out they will deduct $_00 .
neutral	price was higher_than local_petsmart so you ' re paying for the " free " shipping .
negative	response email said they had no other options for shipping on this item .
negative	now i have to pay to ship the damaged part back and on top of that i have to re - order the part instead of them sending me a new one automatically .
positive	my order arrived as_promised and one of the knobs was broken . over the course of the weekend . a holiday_weekend at that . we were able to report the problem and right_channel made immediate arrangements to have a replacement knob mailed to us directly from the manufacturer .
positive	but i worked out just find and the payments went through without a hitch .

neutral	i appreciate the customer service but being a foreigner with long last name create a lot of misspelled .
negative	terrible service and terrible product .
positive	really prompt in every_aspect of the process .
neutral	just a lower base price for the same product .

neutral	i have yet to install the 0 radiators but am hoping they are ok .
negative	the email i received offered six_months of the services of identity_guard free and talked about credit bureau reports .
positive	we found the car we picked was just right for our touring .
negative	" this right lens is slightly thicker than the left , but also orientation of the cylinder aspect of your prescription affects the edge thickness .

positive	i will remain to use them .
negative	i am dissatisfied with united_airlines and houston airport '_s customer_service .
neutral	not sure my son will wear it .
negative	have you ever used your site ?
neutral	however , considering i settled for the older edition the amount of wear , the overall condition , and especially the amount of writing and distracting highlighting in the text is unsatisfactory .
negative	i told them they did not need to credit my card because my credit_card company already had .
positive	great prices , fast free delivery , the usual excellent service from one of my favourite retailers .
neutral	customer_support e_- mailed a phone_number 0 days_later .
positive	receive it and was exactly as_described .

positive	i know there are thousands of happy customers out there that have great things to say about dive_right in scuba and their staff !
neutral	the blue bar that normally slides back and forth to pick the size wasn_'_t working .
neutral	i was impressed by the prices however when i bought two small items and my shipping came to $_00 that was a bit irritating .
negative	it took weeks to get a poor response saying that can no_longer fulfill my order , yet i was able to purchase the product direct from the supplier , albeit at a more_expensive cost .
negative	so i sent an e_-_mail from there ticket and it took 0 days to get an answer from them .
neutral	i love the car i bought , but i '_m sure i could have negotiated better terms .
neutral	in the course of a few more email interactions finally the correct valves were sent to me but whereas the original product arrived within a few_days , it took almost a month for the valves to arrive ( granted , the christmas_holidays were in between so that certainly caused a bit of a delay ).
positive	the site is simple to navigate so finding what you want is fast plus the option to compair products is realy handy and the free post is good .
positive	you should have a look at the rates on red spot car_rentals if they have what you want and they did for me the rates are quite good for the car you get .
neutral	one crucial nut missing from the pack , and some of the wood cracked .
negative	i am absolutely livid at bravofly .
positive	!
neutral	the service seems to work ok so_far , but i received very poor support when setting_up the service and it was not working .
neutral	the only_critisism would be when i called for advise on fitting i could not get any advise , and i would have liked to be kept up to date by email regarding the progress of my order and returns .
neutral	add that to the fact that the ftp times out or crashes enough that it gets very frustrating .
neutral	would i use them again ?
negative	when the pieces were finally delivered in january , 0 out of the 0 were damaged .
neutral	then they sometimes misrepresent an item with the wrong picture and don_'_t respond to those emails sent on the site .
negative	whatever plans we had made for the monday_morning were cancelled as we proceeded to heathrow_airport to check in .
neutral	this is my second order , with all the info on the free_samples i would get i expected something in my first order .
positive	as a supporter of northampton town football club and a keen attender to their home games , i was after a claret / maroon undershirt so that it would keep me warm during the winter months and allow me to wear my replica shirt over the top of it .
negative	when you pay over $_000 for a pair of glasses better care needs to be taken
negative	don_'_t waste your time ordering from this website , because that is all it appears to be . a waste of my time .

positive	there is no_doubt this site is sleek and easy to browse .
neutral	my husband couldn_'_t be bothered re order so he cut them down himself which took about 00_minutes .
positive	have rented numerous_times throughout europe with few issues .
neutral	what arrived instead was a gift_card for someone_else .
neutral	on the plus side , the room had a microwave and a small frig .

negative	i was assured that a manager would ring me back shortly . no phone_call .
neutral	they said the delivery charge had been worked out wrong and would be altered and that whisky would come friday .
negative	their service is very poor .

negative	very disappointed .
positive	they called back at a convenient time for us to make the payment .
positive	!
positive	site is easy to look at and understand and i always check it out before booking holidays .
neutral	all in all , the growing pains are starting to show and slow things down so it '_s more like all the other airports - but not in a good way
neutral	that '_s why my family spend thousands of dollars a year on vital_choice salmon and tuna .
negative	it still has not arrived .
neutral	and then have to make a payment over a hundred_dollars every two_weeks is unreal .
positive	would have no_hesitation in making a very positive recommendation to any prospective purchaser .
neutral	i also wasn_'_t impressed with customer_service ( no phone_number , just emails ) i have had to send many emails too .
neutral	the only reason i gave a three star_rating is because the centric cryogenic rotors and posi - quiet pads are awesome , but i '_m done with parts_geek !
negative	ordered the item from website and received the item but in a different colour_scheme .
neutral	i have used it as a pillow , but thought the millet might be more pleasant .

positive	i phoned country_attire to get some exact_measurements of coat that i bought and found the person i spoke to very helpful and courteous , coat arrived next_day and am very pleased with it , most definately will shop with country_attire again , highly_recomended
positive	the range of stationery on the site is extensive and i will be shopping with cultpens again .
positive	the person i talked to was knowledgable
negative	usually use hermes or yodel as they work out the cheapest .
negative	shipping took far too long and customer_service was incredibly rude .
negative	even_though we arrived on time , we had to wait 00_mins to be seen then 0 and a half hours before a car was ready , all in a very hot office in the car_park with aircon for staff only !
positive	i will_definitely be using them again !
neutral	it was filthy dirty on the outside ( having been driven over 000_miles in the rain ) and messy on the inside on the drivers_side ( where he had clearly got in and out of the vehicle a couple of times during said journey ).
neutral	the costume belt isn_'_t really a belt .
negative	somehow , it turned_out to have switched around to become travelling from singapore to brisbane for a return trip .
negative	i did exactly as the site asked , where were the flowers going , to whom and a local phone_number for them to contact if needed ?
negative	the factory radiator is a 0 row , they sell this as a 0 row , but when you receive it , you quickly see , it has one row that is skinnier and a tad longer_than one row of the factory radiator , which has 0 rows , and has a skinny little block down the middle of the one row .
positive	professional service , quick shipping and a quality parts
neutral	they did not apply the special to the controller .
neutral	the packaging they were in was very badly_damaged and split_open completely at the top etc .
positive	i can recomend this firm .
positive	but thought maybe could have know more
neutral	i was disappointed with the overbooking , and also disappointed with the lack of follow - through on travelocity '_s side .
positive	the labels added a touch of professional adornment that made my homemade favors look as though they were purchased from an exclusive shop .
neutral	the sizing was off but the overall pricing was nice .
negative	i am hoping it will arrive by christmas since it was supposed to be a gift .
positive	i have reviews on my site about how quick they received the product .
neutral	thankfully , the material is quite good , so you can easily take it of and put it back on without too much risk of ripping it or reducing the ' stickiness '.
neutral	that '_s it really - like topcashback , but all my recent transactions have not been processed automatically ( e . g .
neutral	however , there was no one associated with the rental_agency available to help me familiarize myself with the various controls of the car .
neutral	smooth_transaction although i '_m dissatisfied with your company policy .
negative	hello ???!

positive	denise was fantastic .
positive	i just hope things work when i am abroad !
negative	!
neutral	it would be better if the medical element was carried_out before the basic element was charged thus saving time , money and the nuisance of requesting a refund .
neutral	i paid for next_day delivery but because the order was placed after 0 it didn_'_t arrive for 0 days - if you are not able to fulfil next_day delivery you should advise when order is placed and be given chance to change delivery option .

neutral	not very happy could have donated it to my sons school .
neutral	we never got to sit on the open top_deck as it was filled by school groups , the majority of the students weren_'_t actually interested in the comentary or views so this spolit it for many tourists who would have loved to have seen the unique view the open top upper_deck offers .
negative	well , i could not ever text .
neutral	the biggest problem we had was trying to understand what the chap on the phone line was trying to tell us when we were making our call just 00_mins away from the airport .
negative	if they are going to charge premium prices for laser cut products , i would at_least expect them to actually be made for the car they were ordered for .
positive	so easy to use , just park on the car_park just across the road from the terminal , hand in your keys and that '_s it .
positive	at last a straight_forward easy to use site that sells excellent quality products at a great price , i ordered overlocker (£_000 ) for my daughter it came with free carry bag and sewing kit all this for less_than i could have purchased the same machine without extras even from the service man who said he could get it at trade price he was still £_00 dearer without the extras , the prompt delivery was excellent , this company has restored our faith in internet traders as we found them genuine and honest with no_hidden_costs will_certainly recommend to others .

negative	i only ordered a pair of boots ( 0 . 00 ) and a pair of tights ( 0 . 00 ) and my total ends_up being 00 . 00 ( including shipping ), which was fine with me .
neutral	i was assuming since the customer representative read the prices to me , it was accurate .
positive	john
negative	the first card took a few_days , but it was eventually sent .
neutral	since moving over to the resealable bags , it '_s been a disaster .
positive	prices are the lowest that i have seen thus_far and a huge_selection to choose from , so why would i want to shop anywhere_else !
neutral	so do your_homework first , especially if getting the money soon is important to you !
neutral	sales_person seemed bothered by my call and not too eager to help .
neutral	i had no option but to fall on the mercy of my optician for assistance .
positive	it is also great to have the food delivered to my door and a reduced_rate compared to local sellers .
neutral	it takes soooooo much more time to wait on your site to refresh after each option .
neutral	the coverage i receive is adequate , although not as competitive as a recent offer i began receiving from amex which is the same price and includes all 0 reports two times a month .
negative	however the process to confirm an item had been shipped when it was only pre_- ordered ( despite saying ' in stock ' on the website !)
negative	i finally hung_up and called back thinking i would get someone_who i could understand .
negative	quando chiedo loro perché non hanno telefonato al primo viaggio ( ammesso e non concesso che_ci sia stato un primo tentativo di consegna !)

positive	absolutely_thrilled .
positive	and of coarse the mail problems is all herbies fault cuz he owns the mail system world_wide .
negative	do not recommend to use
negative	don_'_t use them !
negative	then tired to rectify this with travelocity .
negative	then charge ridiculous high handling_charges that don_'_t apoear until the end of check out .
negative	så de_har registreret ordren , og min email i deres system .
neutral	i suggest you send confirmation of despatch emails as a matter of course to avoid unnecessary anguish .

positive	and believe me i check every time i order .
positive	very fast delivery .
negative	i paid $_00 for the card to be sent overnight .
negative	i will be canceling my account and looking for someone_who does monthly credit_score updates
neutral	the screen i was sent had one pixel damaged .
neutral	you can not read the print on the stickers and am waiting for a full_refund .
neutral	therefore i now pay what they set the amount at , and the other credit_card company separately , which makes my budget for household bills almost_impossible .
negative	i then got an_email that said it would cost me 00 sterling to change the date .
neutral	the queen was in there ( i think , i didn_'_t see any markings on her back ) with other bees , i thought that was odd because i thought there should have only been a queen in there .
neutral	the customer_service agent was no help in figuring_out why the order was cancelled .
negative	ok , the mixer was not that easy to fix , but the outlet for the hand_held shower_head is impossible to fit unless you have access from the rear of the wall .
positive	you cant_beat that !
positive	the tour bus is one of the best thing to do while on tour in london . big_bus gives us the freedom !!!

neutral	i rented a 00 x 00 which turned_out to be 0 0 x 0 '_s with the center wall taken out but by doing that it gave_me a 00 x 00 with two doors that needed locks instead of one roll up door .

neutral	i have bought quite a number of wowchers and find the rewards of sharing to get a little something back in the form of wowcher credits really fab up until a few_weeks_ago when everything has_been tailored to hardly anything and sometimes now when i share or email an offer i do not receive wowcher credits even_though when i have done this in the past quite a few people have bought because of me sharing so just think its unfair that they have done this , i know i won_'_t be buying as many deals as i have been

positive	it was easy to navigate and place an order .
negative	when someone sees next_day delivery in large letters they expect it to be on the next working day and not only if the order is placed at a certain time , this indicates in the advert that it should be next_day ( it does not say please read terms and conditions concerning next_day delivery ) this should be made very clear and wasn_'_t , very poor service and no straight answers given .

neutral	but on the downside , when we opened the box we found two deflated air_pillows on top , which apparently were supposed to cushion the product during_transit .
positive	the most competitive price on the web did not in this case mean poor service and out of stock items .
positive	she also attended
neutral	you need usps and their lower rates .
positive	sold two n00 '_s to mazuma that would have otherwise sat collecting_dust , very helpful service .

neutral	the part i ordered arrived in good condition and in a timely_manner .
negative	so when i purchased this filter , i called the day after to make_sure i was getting it shipped to me immediately .

negative	i '_m very familiar with computers and know that my computer is compatible with the software .

positive	i enjoy the the choices that i have with my own_labels in customizing our bottles .
negative	i needed a new bed to recover from major_surgery and made the mistake of buying it from macy '_s instead of an " impersonal " online competitor because i had more confidence in the delivery - service part of the deal .

negative	when i arrived at the hotel , there was no reservation in my name at all .

neutral	disappointed and you can even get a manager to speak to you .
neutral	i wish we had a promo_code or coupons periodically sent via_email .
negative	at this point i requested to speak to a manager .
negative	i am planning to buy a new king_size bed and bedroom_set in the near_future , and i can assure you i will be buying it from karen at sleepy '_s in gaithersburg , md and not from macy '_s .

negative	perfect .
neutral	the room was clean .
negative	after over 0 hours of back and forth with 0 different customer_service representatives i was told that i should go and see if the airline would give me a refund for the flight because despite the fact that they could find my reservation their system was having a problem and they couldn_'_t book it .

positive	so thanks for actually reading the comment section !
neutral	also the picture they put online for the product i needed wasn_'_t the same , all i know is i '_m $_00 .
negative	however , my boyfriend '_s mum received her flowers this morning with no upgrade , no chocolates and no apology note as_promised .
positive	this is so perfect .
negative	they didn_'_t have anything right but did finally deliver a half_hour past the deadline .
positive	that kind of service will keep me as a customer !
neutral	!
positive	i can also track the price over time to see how it is doing .
negative	but the guys who brought it did make it right .
neutral	cheaper_than rock_auto .
positive	great tasting shakes even with water and really quick delivery !!
negative	so you cannot claim anything unless you photographed it before you entrusted it to them .
negative	this world should put more sense in whatever does otherwise the lack of common_sense and too much security will transform the human society in robots .
neutral	i was able to look at different hotels and i was satisfied with my decision .
neutral	otherwise , the pricing is good on most of their products .
neutral	very prompt delivery ( ordered late wednesday , received friday_morning ) but unfortunately the wellies came up a little small .
positive	we ordered the food and treats and five or six days_later the package was on the front_porch .
neutral	there is one thing that troubles me however .
neutral	getting the card was no problem the problem was i paid for 0 day shipping and it still took a week to get there very disapointed
neutral	bearing is to get all four wheels back on the car .
negative	they put a huge negative on my very special_occasion .
positive	certainly cheaper_than other_sites , clean and easy to use interface .

positive	i was looking for some new sites to post positions on when i stumbled_across ziprecruiter .
negative	when we arrived to collect the car we were told there was a £_000 deposit required which apparently was detailed on the conditions of rental .
neutral	then we went to pick_up the other customer and the driver looked like he didn_'_t know where she lived .
neutral	this was a $_00 costume that i had to cut my own fly .
negative	ordered 0_weeks_ago and despite_repeated_attempts to get a replacement part or parts , nothing has shown up yet .
positive	i was so surprised that a company would send out additional product , that otherwise has retail value to them , to compensate for a shipment delay .
negative	my entire dealing_with partsgeek has_been frustrating from the beginning !
neutral	the auto_europe part was fine - we asked for an econo ford_focus .
negative	i have been a fan of tb and i buy it a lot and i have had almost no_complaints about the quality or service but this is just an embarrassment to the company .

neutral	royal_canin special 00 arrived in good shape .
positive	florida is a challenge .
neutral	the people who are happy with your product seem to be the ones who got a good reaction when giving the gift .
negative	it should have said that walking was the major means of touring so that senior tourists could be honestly informed .
negative	i go there with high_hopes knowing ive been there years_ago and that was my home town and i had faith in the people in the town and business . and to make a point of the reason_why i say i am truly unhappy is . my usb 00v charger was missing from the socket after a couple minutes from leaving the bussiness .
positive	.
positive	would definitely order from them again the the future .
negative	which is annoying .
positive	it was super user - friendly and excellent follow - up email .
negative	her excuse was that she had to get a move on .
positive	great service overall
positive	if for any chance its not what i expected , b_&_h will take it back with no_hassles and almost no effort .
neutral	this means the consumer cannot chose shipping options ( like speedy or cost_effective delivery ), and furthermore does not even know how much the cost will be until ups shows up at your front_door requiring a check made out to menslook before handing_over the package .
negative	the sirloin steaks were a mistake to be sent .
positive	all in all - great service and would definitely purchase from them again .
positive	thank_you .
negative	i do not understand_why they would continue to lie to their customers and business partners .
positive	i '_ve always had great service from merlin , would definitely recommend to others .
positive	!
neutral	i value all of my internet stores , this one however will not be getting anymore of my business .
neutral	at_least it should be made clear that the return is on me so that this could be considered with the purchase .
positive	love them and would highly_recommend them to anyone !
negative	i suggest you avoid this company before they scam you as well !
negative	to ensure they cannot have this rating removed for inaccurate information , the holds were placed on their reservation numbers :
negative	i would stick to ebay because at_least you are protected .
positive	never had to use their customer service via phone however this is free and a plus point is that it is based in the uk !.
negative	not really happy with the transaction .
neutral	also the expiration_date on the 0 00 # bags and 0 0 # bar treats were just a few_months from expiration ; i like the dates to be into the next year from purchase date , that way i know the food is fresh and keeps its flavor .
positive	i '_m an american so i don_'_t know what the flower business in the uk is like , and my girlfriend had previously told me that flowers are very expensive over there .
positive	very pleased with the packaging , not one little limb broken and nice to see the beautiful plants just waiting to be planted .
negative	i received a pair of ray_bans with prescription_lenses but one lens was proud of the external frame .
positive	i have ordered from knife_merchant for years !
negative	i was on hold for an_hour and was swiltched back and forth .
positive	not knowing what food my picky_eaters would like i decided t get the " trial " size , which is no " trial " by any means , they are 0lb bags offered at a very discounted_rate , ie $ 0 . 00 instead of $_00 . 00 for the ones that i got , plus there were several to choose from , so i got them all .
neutral	we took photos of the damage and emailed then through immediately .

positive	oh not too mention you also can gain additional items for free with your purchases .
negative	i informed him that i wanted the socket to be moved downstairs which he could not do .
neutral	i '_m going to go cancel the order right now and find another company .
positive	to be honest , we dropped by their store with no_intention to purchase .
negative	are these agents trained to film - flam customers , or just_plain stupid ?
neutral	it was very difficult to remove while maintaining the integrity of the packaging in case it had to be returned .
positive	i always get the part i requested .
negative	the furniture that i bought was not what i ordered but , because it took months just to get it i didn_'_t even_bother calling to dispute it .
negative	it was not a stress_free pick_up :( all the representatives and drivers passed the blame to someone_else , insisting the car was on the nearest car_park and would only take 0 mins to bring round . so why did it take 00 ??????
neutral	the agent said we had one , but , the e_-_mail did not say that .
negative	no big_deal when you shop online you expect problems from time to time .
neutral	as as example , don ross started a series which hasn_'_t been updated since march although numerous other instructors have had many lessons added .
neutral	the product was displayed in a slim black box , yet on delivery was presented in a plastic_bag , very disappointed .
negative	during the day he phoned twice detailing the various problems including front and back brakes and pads , fault code on engine , tracking , scoff on rear_wheel_bearings and a host of others .
neutral	the dresses had a new and interesting design and fit better_than_expected .
negative	id :_0000000 being quite easy going we accepted this , but then got the confirmation_email_saying that we had to pick the tickets up from your manchester office between 00pm and 0 . 00pm on the same day .
negative	they do not exchange but charge a 00_percent restock_fee so you better like what you order .
neutral	this was our first visit to an oak_furniture and we enjoyed the look round .

neutral	just a thought .
positive	the price is exceptional and the variety rocks !
positive	their staff cannot be beat , and their quality of both diamonds and bands are second to none .
neutral	unfortunately , they weren_'_t the right part .
negative	we were charged an extra $_00 per_night upgrade fee for oceanfront .
positive	ordered a few things from them and no_issues whatsoever , always delivered on time .
negative	).
negative	i think you should rethink your return_policy !!!!
neutral	maybe you would consider offering bigger margins .
positive	everything came as ordered and was extremely quick on shipping .
negative	just losing money with these_people .
negative	when i arrived the i was denied the car_rental , therefore i was forced to use a different provider and was charged $_000 . 00 for a car_rental .
negative	i had a prompt return telephone_call to confirm that was the case .
positive	i was a little_wary at first buying this type of item online , but as soon as i made contact with them initially i felt positive about the service and would definitely recommend them !
positive	the whole ordering_process , from searching for the item to placing the order , was fast and easy .
negative	this for a plan that i have had to cancel because it is actually useless to me .
neutral	one of the mercedes window cranks i purchased was defective as it is in worse shape that the original one from my 0000 000_sl ( 00 years old ) that i was going to replace .
positive	the customer_service is great .
neutral	all , i needed another order .

neutral	the door_handle hinge pin is longer_than the oem pin interferes with the mechanical door_handle assembly inside the door .
negative	use thegamecollection , zavvi or amazon .
negative	i bought a pc from ginger0 nine months_ago .
positive	excellent efficient service no_hesitation in shopping at country_attire again
positive	whether it was a corroded rim or a screw through the sidewall , the staff , in the shop and out front , have gone the extra_mile to make_sure i know what has happened and the ' best ' ( for me ) solution to the problem .
negative	only card transaction in a while was this one , and my card was frauded by 0 mobile_phone top ups - helped themselves to £_00 - emailed customer_service - of no help totally untrustworthy
positive	big_bus as you can see is around 0 - 00_minutes interval or even shorter .
positive	i have always had my questions_answered and concerns addressed in a speedy and efficient manner .
positive	very convenient .
negative	i have a screen printout of the $_00 special bookit nightly rate plus 00_% tax and a $_00 . 00 daily resort_fee .
positive	i have no_hesitation recommending anchor_pumps as they were well priced , efficient and prompt on delivering what i needed .
negative	on booking with these people we took out the insurance then when we took back the car the rental place charged us again
negative	!
neutral	after i had that van for a couple of week i realized i needed an_additional car for awhile for a daily driver ( i am military and my car had not caught up with me after moving ) so i again went to priceline and got an ok deal on a car .
neutral	# fail
positive	very impresses with the delivery of 0 dozen yellow_roses , beautiful with babys breath and the price was amazing .

positive	really pleased with this site .
positive	it '_s worth_every_penny .
neutral	i had to call in to a representative who kept messing up what i was telling her and trying to tell me the flight i wanted suddenly wasn_'_t there when the final booking time came , ( although i was simultaneously on other travel sites due to my concern i would not be able to complete the transaction with her and the flight was still quite clearly there ).

neutral	because it was an early start we were tired - had no access to emails with us and i could not check whether i had indeed taken out insurance prior .( not sure why anyone would not ) i merrily accepted insurance with eurpcar !!

negative	dicono che è perché chiamare col cellulare costa e la bartolini non rimborsa le telefonate . non costerebbe di meno a tutti pagare loro un cellulare con_un numero massimo di chiamate se hanno tanta paura di abusi ) piuttosto che fare , almeno in teoria , almeno 0 - 0 ' tentativi ' prima di consegnare effettivamente ?
neutral	it was 0 of only 0 wallets available for the galaxy note 0 .

positive	the fact that they had the size i needed was my second surprise .
positive	the website functions well to locate and select .
negative	i receive wrong parts !
neutral	feels_like we got the absolute least decent vehicle they could fit into the category we paid for .
neutral	each page along the ordering_process is filled with thousands of words of complicated legal disclaimers and if you overlook one thing then make a change 00 seconds later , bookit charges you a $_00 cancellation_fee .
positive	thank_you .
negative	worse service on the hotel '_s side ever !!
neutral	gotta save all we can !!
positive	i am a very happy customer !

negative	very mad and disappointed !
neutral	installation was horrible , the guy was a real moron , drilled holes all over the place and cut the cable so we can '_t ever use the outlets in our walls again ( we also had cable internet and they had to re - run all the cables because of the directv installation ).
neutral	could it have been scratched during this process ?
neutral	now where
negative	this is the worst company with the worst operating practices .
negative	no one will return my emails or complete my order .
negative	we waited over an_hour , being rejected from four different busses that drove_away empty or almost empty , and the busdrivers didn_'_t even took a glance at our tickets , the only response was , there will be another bus in 00_minutes ( all four times ), and as we stood waiting more passengers piled up at the busstop all with tickets and no busses .
neutral	no order confirmation , no promised tracking_system , a 0 - 0 day delivery time becoming a 00 day delivery time .
neutral	we were very pleased with the price and quality of the pump and filter .
positive	all in all we are very chuffed with our purchase , thank_you .
positive	will_certainly continue to use naturesbest .
neutral	the website has some nifty stuff , so i went and tried again a looong time later and found i can buy stuff now ( yay ).

neutral	we were then given instructions where to wait for a chauffeur , he was not waiting we waited about eight minutes for him .
negative	the staff in the lobby were a joke .
neutral	the garage was not as efficient as a normal tyre installer and if i can match the b ' circles price in future by a main_stream fitter then i would prefer them over a garage who fits tyres when the lift is available .
neutral	i intend to give cjs another go , however if i am met with such appalling service again , i will just pay the extra money and buy it from a shop .
negative	i will stick with petco who always deliver within 00_hours of my order .
neutral	i have repeatedly tried to contact you by phone and have yet to find a way to talk to you about this problem and the extra i spent to recieve the parts quick and when needed like promised .

positive	it all run very smoothly and very easy to complete with very fast payment .
positive	highly_recommended .
neutral	i didn_'_t buy them , but located similar screws on the internet and ordered them separately .
neutral	i ordered the wrong part due to ( imo ) a poorly organized web catalogue with ambiguous descriptions and multiple descriptions of the same product ( s ) - ( hood / trunk lift support pistons ).
neutral	this last order the ink ran_out so fast i am trying someone_else .
negative	- finally recieved my order after complaing to vision_direct .

neutral	do i come up with and extra two hundred_dollars to pay my bill .
negative	very disapointed that i now have no sunglasses and will have to wait for them to arrive and then ship them off to the person they were a gift for and waste money on international postage to the person as vision_direct have not delivered in time .
positive	the chest of drawers was as i had expected , very solid and well made , a beautiful piece of furniture . delivered only a few_minutes late due to my address not being on their sat_nav .
negative	worst service .
positive	the products i ordered arrived very quickly .
neutral	hi

negative	but when they took my money they knew from my credit_card info that my address was us !
positive	better prices than big box pet_stores , and i didn_'_t have to lug around a 00lb_bag of dog_food out to my car !!
positive	so fast .
neutral	that '_s why i '_m giving petflow . com only 0_stars
neutral	i think the pricing is better_than the others , but it doesn_'_t help me if there is no stock .

negative	this was due to computer problems and was promised i ' d have all items in hand by friday .
neutral	guys and gals . all im saying is to improve on customers being_able to speak to a live_person regardless the question or situation at hand .
positive	the customer_service rep cesaer listened to what i wanted , worked out a deal for delivery and assembly , and kept the price affordable .

positive	exceptional , responsive and trusted service .
neutral	the whole setup process over the phone was kind of extensive and i '_m sure we discussed that i used internet for gaming and streaming videos , email , etc .
neutral	some of my donors said they couldn_'_t get onto the website .
positive	( i was dreading this call expecting trouble but it went so well .)
positive	even shopping for the products i order locally can '_t compare !
negative	once they get your money forget about any service or proper documentation at all .
positive	i would recommend and defenitely order thru them again .
neutral	i guess is not entirely wowcher '_s fault , but i think they should make_sure vendors are really reliable .
negative	just that they will check with the warehouse .
negative	i '_m sure my experience will be consistant with the fact patterns of other consumers facing the same issues .
positive	i '_m really pleased with this company , i just wish they had more discount_codes for people that are paying cash for their products .

negative	ink ran_out after two uses of one page each time
negative	your sales_person_who answered the phone totally misrepresented himself i called the number under la_quinta he answered la_quinta suites . he never said that he was from a different company representing la_quinta .
neutral	it is still cheaper_than taking the car to a body shop by_far .
neutral	second time this happened to me .
negative	however : i must thank petco , for their atrocious " customer_service ", because , i went to another pet_food delivery company , and got the same order for $_00 . 00 less ($ 0 . 00 / box x 0 boxes )!!!!!

neutral	i always find the quality of items is a bit hit and miss from boohoo some things are really good others are not good and not really as they appear in the pictures .
negative	i ' d suggest partsgeeks gets a new delivery carrier .
negative	as far as the quality of the product , i will let you know in 0 - 0_weeks .
neutral	the site was easy to navigate .
neutral	by 0pm i contacted boohoo to see what time latest delivery was , got told 0pm . which was fine with me as wasn_'_t going out till 0ish .
positive	i was really impressed with the shipping as we received the order within days of ordering the item , especially given our location in canada .
positive	took a few_days to get me the code as i applied on a friday_evening ( uk time ) and got it on monday but once i got the code , it worked like a charm .
positive	i would recommend country_attire without_hesitation .
negative	instead they stored our possessions in johannesburg so they were not available for delivery when we had a move in date .
positive	otherwise the customer_service had been amazing , they arrived_promptly and look amazing and very professional .
neutral	not a good choice since no one is home when they deliver mail , so they will leave a note that says i need to go to the post_office ( which is also only open when i work ) to pick_up the package .
negative	this is when i was told that i failed thier security check - this is odd as i have lived at the same address since 0000 i work full time , have a credit_card etc i was born and raised in england plus had the same email address for over a decade .

positive	lenstore ordering was straightforward and the package arrived within a few_days .
positive	i was able to check for myself that they shipped the order asap .
neutral	decipher clear - language
neutral	as a non_- expert on the issues , i did not think this was appropriate and asked her to translate the questions to the speaker directly .
neutral	as for the other " friction " item , i acknowledge partsgeek is not responsible for the slow shipping , but i would encourage them to either use usps or fedex , not the hybrid shipping option of fedex putting a stamp on it and sending via us_postal service , it just added 0 days to the shipping time ( part was in town 0 days ago , fedex put it in the mail " for delivery "

negative	we were finally able to get to the rental_car agency we had rented from after a $_00 . 00 taxi ride .

negative	my husband could not shower or bath because , although there were handrails in the tub , there were no handholds outside the tub area and no inserts or a place for towels outside the tub .
positive	we were able to reserve the size we wanted and when we showed_up to the storage_facility , the manager already had our info which made the process so quick and painless .
positive	why would anyone buy pet_food any other way .
neutral	ugh
neutral	we also purchased the french shabby chic dining_table and chairs plus the large sideboard .

neutral	thats is why i ordered from you this time .
negative	even_though the reason i couldn_'_t check in to come_back is because they cancelled my flight out . if it didn_'_t cost me my whole holiday and a very upset daughter it would have been laughable . anyway .

negative	when they arrived , they were the wrong ones .
