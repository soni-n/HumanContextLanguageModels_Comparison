negative	as others have said , i wish that i had seen this site before ordering .
negative	this is the first really bad_experience of on - line ordering for me .
negative	as others , i placed an order and paid for it , but the have not goods arrived - and i needed them for a deadline .
negative	as i paid by credit_card i shall go through the process of informing the credit_card company of the dispute , but it will take a long time to get my money back .
negative	in addition have made a complaint to consumer_direct ( i was referred there by trading_standards ) on 00000_000000 and recommend others to do the same .
negative	they suggested to me a form of words for a letter to be sent by recorded delivery .
negative	the complaints are logged , so the more people who complain to them , the more likely it is that action will be taken .
negative	placed request to switch through uswitch on 00 february_0000 .
negative	i was intending to stay with scottish_power and simply change on to a better tariff .
negative	when i heard_nothing i sent an e_- mail .
negative	no response within 0 working_days .
negative	phoned and held on for 00_minutes - gave up .
negative	a few_days_later sent another e_- mail from my e_- mail account and another via my account on the site .
negative	also requested a call back .
negative	they did to be fair call me back but basically couldn_'_t help .
negative	had no record of my switch request and talked about some data systems down and others inaccessible from where he was .
negative	basically said all i could do was apply to switch on the site .
negative	tried that but of course the deal i had signed_up for through uswitch was now unavailable .
negative	had a look at the deals that were available but absolutely no information upon which to base an informed choice .
negative	all it will give you is prices for low , medium or high usage - no information about standing charge or prices per kilowatt .
negative	have now done another switch through energy helpline but anticipate that scottish_power will miraculously find my switch request , attempt to switch me and then charge me an exit_fee as cheapest deal for me is now with a different provider .
negative	might have avoided all this is i could have got through to scottish_power when first advised that they were still the cheapest for me but ( a ) can you trust them and ( b ) difficulty in getting through on the phone .
negative	when i did speak to customer_services i put it to them that their company and its systems were in chaos and that if they could not find the switch request it might be the result of this state of affairs .
negative	he did not deny it and his carefully crafted words spoke volumes .
negative	i felt sorry for him but did not say so because too furious .
negative	god_knows when this will end .
negative	was told great things about this company and their products but unfortunately i have experienced neither !
negative	i have been waiting for my next_day delivery to arrive almost a week since placing the order and have been hung_up on 0 times after listening to what can almost be described as " i want to kill myself now " musak !
negative	( that '_s unfair , everyone has their own likes and dislikes with music - but seriously , i '_d rather hear coldplay !!!)
negative	the response , when i refused to give up on the mysterious hanger - uppers , was scripted , apportioning blame to courier and systems in place , and lacked sincerity and empathy - which i '_m not surprised by really as judging_by the amount of poor reviews on both here and fb , the " customer service team " ( hahaha ) must be on the same loop as the musak * shudders *.
negative	poor and in this day and age myprotein , you are failing in a lucrative market and should either pull yourself up by your wrist wraps or do what i had done to me - hang up .
negative	not a very good review i am afraid , i ordered a t - shirt for a birthday_present only for the wrong t - shirt to be sent , then was also advised that if i returned it , i would get a refund for £_00 . 00 max , when the t - shirt cost more than that .... will not be using 00_degrees north again ....
negative	so , it was my sisters_00th_birthday , i live in america and am the only family_member not able to celebrate with her so thought i '_d wow her with a surprise of beautiful flowers and lots of chocolates .
negative	they have a spot to let them know anything special so i said as much .... turned_out to be pointless .
negative	what they show on the site is not what you get .
negative	i paid the maximum to ensure the best bouquet and bought both dark and milk chocolates boxes , yes that '_s the 0 that they advertise on the site .
negative	the ballerina is what i sent and the picture she sent me , which i passed on to the company , didn_'_t even look like the regular !!!
negative	it was an embarrassment .
negative	to add_insult to injury she only got one box of chocolates .
negative	they were also not as shown on the site .
negative	it is purely and simply false_advertising .
negative	i told them to have more flowers sent out as they did admit they were not as full as they should have been .
negative	they refused stating that they were to value according to the florist .
negative	( lord only knows what she would have got if i hadn_'_t paid the max ) as to the chocolates , they didn_'_t have them so got one mixed box from another store !!
negative	!
negative	bottom line they acted like they were doing me a favour by refunding my card 00_% unbelievable !!!
negative	!
negative	that '_s the least they could do as i only got 00_% !!!!!
negative	!
negative	the whole point was missed , however ,.
negative	it '_s the wow_factor that we rely_on and trust these companies to provide for special_occasions !!!
negative	!
negative	if it '_s an average occasion you can put your trust this company , cos you will not get the wow_factor , nor your monies worth and to boot , whom ever is getting them , will think you '_ve been cheap !
negative	!
negative	we have always had good service from nitrotek until we sent our rc car on 0 .
negative	february for repair .
negative	all thru february i kept asking when it would be ready kept getting emails saying how busy they were what a backlog they had .
negative	then in march they claimed they had sent me an_email on00 february with an estimate which i had not replied to .
negative	how could this be when the same week they were still telling_me that no one had looked at it yet ?
negative	on 00 march i paid by paypal hoping it might be done soon .
negative	gain and again i emailed no reply , tried going via their website , no reply .
negative	finally i rang their sales line as there is no number for customer_services .
negative	i was told the car would be repaired and sent the next_day ... the following_day we received someone_else '_s car !!
negative	three_weeks_later i am still_waiting four car and presumably some poor soul is waiting for this car .
negative	do not buy from notrotek , they have made my 00 year_old very unhappy .
negative	good website but the actually car_park was dreadful , no waiting area if raining , car was damaged upon_arrival , bus was late on both arrival and departure , driver very rude and placed my baby in the car_seat with the luggage , i have sent a formal_complaint .
negative	about a year_ago , i tried to open a paypal_account using a new e_- mail address and was unable to do so because years_ago i had opened an account with a now obsolete e_- mail address .
negative	i was unable to and i contacted paypal for help , to this day i am still_waiting for a reply .
negative	will never use them again and consequently because of them i am unable to use ebay .
negative	total_waste of space and don_'_t even deserve one star
negative	ordered a standard flower_arrangement with e_florist at lunch_time for the following_day delivery .
negative	i was emailed at approx .
negative	0 . 00pm the following_day and told that they could not deliver , they couldn_'_t find a local_florist who had the type of flowers i had ordered !
negative	!, as i said there was nothing unusual about my choice of flowers .
negative	so ordered on line with [_external_reference_] and the same flowers were at my friends house in less_than 0 hours .
negative	they also emailed three_times , once to let_me know the flowers were being put_together by a florist in the area ( the same area that e_florist told me couldn_'_t do it ) a second to say they were on their way and finally one to let_me know they had been delivered -- now that '_s service ..
negative	thanks e_florist for requesting a review of your service .
negative	have been with flogas since 0000 and dealt_with the huttoft branch in lincolnshire things have gone from bad to worse . my husband has_been ill and had not checked the gas levels so we ran_out of gas 00 jan rag the huttoft number and explained the situation that my husband had been ill ( he is also disabled and cannot get around ) the man of the telephone said there was no chance of getting any gas today as he could not contact the depot as they were not answering their phone i explained this was an_emergency we had no hot_water of use of our cooker without it he said that he was sorry but he could not do anything about it .
negative	this company seems to go out of the way to upset people last time we ordered gas they took our money but could not tell us when they were going to deliver as again they could not reach the depot and give us a delivery time .
negative	i know the drivers have mobile_phones and carry extra cylinders on their lorries but that does not seem to matter .
negative	we are not big customers have 0 - 0 cylinders a year so perhaps we do not matter ,
negative	customer service is unknown to this company and after 00 years with them i have had enough .
negative	we will no_longer use them and will find another_supplier
negative	i had my baby registry at babies r_us in the u . k , and everything was fine with it .
negative	we then received a broken item , which we realized was broken when we tried to assemble it the same day it arrived .
negative	we called the customer service desk which was useless and a waster of my time .
negative	first , i was accused of breaking it myself , even_though it had only been delivered about 00_minutes prior .
negative	then i was told i would have to pay to send it back with the company that delivered it .
negative	trust me , they got it from me at that point .
negative	they finally after pissing and moaning_about it , arranged for pick_up from my house , as the nearest_store is 0 hours away , and i am 0_months pregnant and didn_'_t fancy driving all that way to replace something that was faulty on their behalf .
negative	so it was picked_up , and i tracked the delivery .
negative	it '_s been over 0_days now and they still_haven_'_t received it in their system , and therefore hasn_'_t been delivered .
negative	i phoned and was told i '_d have to wait at_least 0_weeks for the new one , even_though it '_s paid for , and they ' re not losing anything by sending it to me .
negative	i '_ve made many complaints to them , but nothing seems to get done .
negative	i feel 0_star is even too much for this company , and will never shop or make another registry again with toys_r_us , or babies r_us .
negative	awful service , useless customer service helpline , and all around ignorant .
negative	i love the coverage i got with my phone .
negative	but , try getting anything done through customer service .
negative	i was on the phone with them for 0 hour today trying to make a payment .
negative	they tried my debit_card 0 or 0 times and said the payment would not go through , because of my recent change of billing_address with the bank .
negative	the customer service is incompetent and the website provides no alternative online_chat .
negative	really appalling .
negative	update - called again to three to simply cancel my contract ( at the end of the 0 years ).
negative	they gave_me the wrong amount 0_months_ago when i paid off my bill in full .
negative	the customer service is incompetent and they will give you the run around -- taking your money beyond what they even explain that it is for .
negative	horrid horrid customer service .
negative	go with someone_else .
negative	i was so excited when i found out we could get 00 mbps speeds on our broadband service and signed_up for virgin_media right away .
negative	little did i know the incredible trouble i would have .
negative	the connection was shaky for months .
negative	it would go from 00 mbps to 0 mbps to 0 . 00 mbps to 0mbps to 0 . 0 mbps in a matter of a couple minutes .
negative	such a faulty connection meant that there were whole parts of a day ( 0 - 0 hours ) when i wasn_'_t even able to send an_email .
negative	making the problem more unbearable was the very unhelpful response from the technical_support crew .
negative	i called 00 times in a span of just 0_months and no one could figure_out the problem .
negative	they would ask me to do the same tests , change the same settings , over and over again , which ate up a lot of my time .
negative	finally , 0 . 0_months after starting my service , they determined there was a traffic problem in my area .
negative	after months of practically pulling my hair out trying to get the situation fixed and never having any real help , i finally canceled my service .
negative	i should say -- there was one very nice , helpful , and intelligent engineer who came to my flat .
negative	he actually took the time to try to figure_out if something was wrong with my router and finally determined that there must be something wrong with the line / traffic in the area as a whole , which was indeed later confirmed by the company .
negative	i should also add that , given the problems i had had , disconnecting was rather painless - a manager allowed me to disconnect in 00_hours and i was even given a refund for my last month of service .
negative	still , a pretty horrendous few_months with little help from the customer service team .
negative	the customer service at directsight is terrible ; they are unwilling to help in the event that the glasses do not fit your face properly .
negative	they have listed the " direct sight returns_policy " incorrectly on their website , stating that you will receive a refund as long as your items are returned in their original condition .
negative	they fail to state ( possibly in order to purposefully mislead their customers ) that you cannot return lenses that have been made to your prescription .
negative	the glasses i ordered were not the correct_size for my face and thus i could not see properly with them , but the customer service representative refused to assist me with a full_refund , even after a full_refund had been guaranteed to me a day after i received the glasses and called the customer service for the first time , in order to be sure i returned them correctly .
negative	do not trust directsight with preparing your glasses - they felt very cheap and , should they not fit your face correctly , you will be out of a lot of money .
negative	all in all , they are a bad company because their website is deceptive and misleading , saying " easy returns " and then listing incomplete and inaccurate_information under their online " returns_policy ."
negative	beware !
negative	sold an ipod in november , they said the money would be in the account by christmas_eve and still have not received the money yet .
negative	they also blocked my account for unknown reasons and haven_'_t yet sent me a letter to help me reactivate the account .
negative	this was last_year .
negative	sorry i am not impressed with the service taking too long and is more_expensive than normal will not buy from you again
negative	i ordered a bike from here on 00rd_december_0000 , it was delivered on 00th_dec , was too small for my husband .
negative	arranged for argos to come and take it back and refunded .
negative	for some reason refund takes 0 - 00 working_days to process dont understand_why this is as it doesnt take 0 - 00 days to come out of my account .
negative	anyway because of the christmas_period i allowed for th 0 - 00 working_days for my refund but low and behold not in my account .
negative	when i called was told refund was issued on 00th_december .
negative	strange as bike was not picked_up until 0nd_january .
negative	i then checked my bank and no nothing had gone in , rang them again and was told that it hadnt been scanned into their warehouse and did i know who collected it ?????
negative	after a very annoyed phone_call from me on friday 00th_january , i was assured that refund would leave argos account within 00_hours and into my bank within_00hours , here we are 0_days_later and still no refund .
negative	have contacted_watchdog now and am contemplating a solicitors letter to see if they respond .
negative	this is absolutely_disgusting argos is crap crap crap .......
negative	i keep being asked to review an item i havent received yet .
negative	despite ordering over 0_weeks_ago !!
negative	!
negative	this company appears professional but when it comes down to it they are not .
negative	we sent them a drive and after the allocated time we had to contact them where they stated the item needed parts ( samsung 000gb drive £_00 at most retailers ).
negative	their cost for parts and labour ( 00 minute job ) £_000 plus_vat .
negative	they wanted this upfront despite their claim no data no fee .
negative	now they do not respond to emails , we have no drive , no data and £_000 down the drain and no vat_invoice !!
negative	we have now had to instigate legal_proceedings , my suggestion avoid at all cost >
negative	just shows the type of company when they asked trustpilot to remove the same comments_below made by my director on the technicality that it was in my name .
negative	update 00th_february , fields_data_recovery in house solicitor ( that tells you everything !!)
negative	has now filed a defence arguing that as our hard_drive was broken it s worthless " despite the fact thaey had allegedly just fitted £_000 worth of parts !!!
negative	also that under their terms 0 . 0 using their free return service is by standard postal service and this is non traceable !
negative	they allege they have returned our drive and yet on the 0th_february we had an_email from customer_services asking for the serial_number type and any distinguishing marks so that they could find our hard_drive !
negative	!
negative	some interesting you tube videos about this companies activities in germany and also action by the ministry of justice against another of field group companies called action direct uk
negative	there is also internet allegations that positive_reviews are being written by out workers in the far_east all too strange for me i am afraid !
negative	described as oak , not even veneer !
negative	it was laminate .
negative	really not good value so returning .
negative	i checked on the website via live_chat that they would be able to still do next_day delivery in time for an office bbq for 000 people , they said yes .
negative	delivery tracking showed the order didn_'_t get dispatched , so can '_t blame city_link .
negative	resulted_in lukewarm food for our colleagues .
negative	wouldn_'_t recommend as they don_'_t deliver on promises even when asked
negative	i have tried contacting you several_times , no one ever answers .
negative	i have sent emails , no one has ever contacted me .
negative	i am very disapointed in the service .
negative	and i can '_t understand how you are still trading .
negative	will i ever get my order , i am just contacting my credit_card company to see if you have actually taken money from me .
negative	i bought a kitchen from the meir department stoke on trent . after fitting the kitchen i found out i had to purchase the edging strip separately unfortunately the store did not have the strip and i had to order the strip directly from scotland . i was asked to pay in_advance as they could not send or order the strip for the store as it was regarded as a special order . i was charged a delivery charge which i felt was unfair as this item i feel should have been available in store . the item was to be delivered within five days but after three_weeks i am still_waiting despite a number of calls to the store . very poor customer service .
negative	i have now sent two emails with no reply , i made a purchase online of flowers , vase , balloon and card for my friend , once i paid i got a receipt to say there was truffles added which i didn_'_t order .
negative	very unhappy customer and i want a refund
negative	after ordering and paying for 0 tyres last friday and speaking to a very helpful young_lady on the phone who changed the fitting day from wed 0st_feb to tues 00st_jan , and assured me that the tyres were in stock , i turned_up at my local_national_tyres to find that the tyres had not been delivered and further more , when they phoned up , the tyres were not in stock .
negative	at the moment the guys are getting tyres delivered from elsewhere and hopefully the problem will be resolved sometime this afternoon .
negative	what a waste of time for all concerned .
negative	i have used tyreshopper previously with no_problems , but so dosappointed this time .
negative	i have used this company twice .
negative	once when i first moved to london and the last time in 0000 .
negative	i thought they changed but they didn_'_t .
negative	they really are terrible .
negative	the customer service is appalling .
negative	the accommodation manager i dealt_with was kasia osinska .
negative	she sent me to view some dreadful places in london .
negative	so after wasting my time and my money i decided to go to a proper agency and i found the most amazing flat in fulham .
negative	the title sums this up the worst yet
negative	awful do not use this company if you can help it the are the worst i have ever dealt_with on line
negative	i ordered from asad online food shopping booked it in between 0 - 00 the next_day that came and went 00 0 0 0 then i get a call to say sorry it might be late at this point it 0 hrs late any way it turned_up at 0 . 00 over 0hrs late and not even a apologetic
negative	i ordered a ink_cartridge from them 0_weeks_later still not hear and customer service waste of time
negative	ordered a pair of shoes , they never arrived yet when i tracked them it said they had been signed for .
negative	when i contacted the site to explain this they emailed am back saying they had confirmed with the company that posted them that a female in her 00s had signed form them at my address .
negative	this is impossible as i was at work at the time and live_alone .
negative	when i explained this i was sent a missing parcel form to send off along with a copy of my id witch i explained i wasn_'_t comfortable sending a copy of my id as my signature had obviously been forged once , after this i heard_nothing back from the company , did not receive my shoes and have lost just over 00 pounds .
negative	customer service was terrible , they couldn_'_t even have the decency to reply when i asked who was supposed to have signed for the parcel as i knew there wasn_'_t anyone in the address to sign for it .
negative	couldn_'_t get in touch with customer_services to actually speak to a person rather_than emailing them .
negative	will never be using this site again !
negative	scam !!
negative	!
negative	i have used p0u on and off for several_years and have always been impressed by the wide_range of products and fast delivery .
negative	this time , however , i found it hard to search for items , received no confirmation of my order once i '_d placed it , and after 0_weeks have still not received anything .
negative	customer service provided me with the tracking_number for royal_mail so apparently the goods have been sent , but neither rm nor my country '_s postal service has any record of it .
negative	customer service initially offered to resend the parcel but when i requested this they started dragging their feet .
negative	so , on the whole , no - i think i will shop elsewhere in future .
negative	i ordered linking balloons in 0 colours which should have all been the same shape .
negative	some were sausage shaped which i couldn_'_t use and 0 had holes in them so were useless .
negative	poor and hence won_'_t be using again .
negative	i ordered goods i needed by a srpecific date but it didn_'_t arrive due t courier error
negative	ordered a sewing_machine 0 july_0000 , today , 0th_august nothing has yet appeared .
negative	in the meantime , phoned , emailed and been sent up the garden path .
negative	just phoned and been told that on the 0th of august it should arrive .
negative	told by a bad tempered , rude person_who spoke bad french .
negative	no apology from him .
negative	with difficulty extracted the name of the transport people from him and date of arrival .
negative	looked the transport people up in the yellow_pages ( la redoute guy had no phone number ) but they are not responding .
negative	this is the last time i buy from laredoute france !
negative	!
negative	compare that to amazon or ebay_sellers !
negative	i '_m really unhappy with the service and product .
negative	i ordered ( and paid for ) next_day delivery on 00st_march .
negative	it was a sunday and then a bank_holiday but i expected it on the wednesday 0rd as it stated when i was ordering .
negative	i was waiting ( and tracking ) for both products as i was flying to france on the 0th to run a marathon but they had still not arrived by 0pm on friday 0th when i left so i had to go without .
negative	i arrived home to find both products , too late to use , and one wasn_'_t what i had ordered !
negative	i won_'_t be ordering from you again .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	this is a bad company .
negative	i would seriously recommend not using them .
negative	we purchased a cabinet and the delivery driver who assumed my wife was on her own proceeded to bully her ( bearing in mind that she is only 0ft 0 ".)
negative	the reason being is that he was refusing to drive the cabinet round the back of the house , even_though he was politely asked to do so .
negative	throughout the entire ordeal he was making sarcastic comments and being generally intimidating .
negative	she was so concerned for her safety that she had to call out her nineteen year_old_son to protect her .
negative	when he realised she was not on her own he began to be very polite and apologetic .
negative	what a coward .
negative	we will never use this company again solely because of the delivery driver , and i hope the company sees this comment and looks into the matter , this cannot go on .
negative	and just to put the cherry on the cake he left a 0x0 foot pallet in the front driveway
negative	to cut a long_story_short , they allege two failed_attempts to deliver but no card was ever put through my letterbox .
negative	parcels ended_up being returned to the company web - blinds , despite three_separate promises that they would be redelivered the next_day .
negative	eventually agreed with web - blinds that they would be delivered on saturday 00th .
negative	received text saying that they would be delivered between 0 . 00 and 00 . 00 by dan .
negative	he turned_up at 00 . 00pm and brought the parcels to the house .
negative	he asked me to sign for them .
negative	when i pointed_out that there were not 00 items , he said that he knew that and to put in the comments box that only 00 items were delivered .
negative	i did so .
negative	today when i advised web - blinds that 0 items were missing , web - blinds checked with city_link and were advised that i had signed for all 00 items .
negative	i can only_assume that ' dan ' has adjusted the screen in some way to delete my comments .
negative	i am_furious and will never use a company again that uses city_link as their courier .
negative	ordered a jacket on the 0nd_december as a christmas gift .
negative	the site said it was in stock and i should receive it in 0days .
negative	on the 0rd i got an_email_saying that they didn_'_t have it in stock and i would receive it closer to the 00th .
negative	on the 00th i checked the tracking_system for my order only to see that trekkinn . com still did not have the stock .
negative	it '_s the 00th_dec and i still_haven_'_t received my order and the online tracking_system says they still don_'_t have it in their stock yet .
negative	the contact phone numbers don_'_t work and when i have been able to get someone they tell me someone will call me back and noone ever has .
negative	i contacted them via_email on the 00th_dec and got a reply_saying that they '_d posted my order on the 0rd and it was a postal order .
negative	only when i went on their public facebook_page and pasted previous emails stating that they didn_'_t even have the stock yet did they admit that they haven_'_t posted my £_000 order .
negative	i was told that someone from the warehouse would be in touch on the 00th and i '_m still_waiting .....................
negative	i paid for a 00 month subscription in_advance in september .
negative	i paid again as bt had an accounting problem , bt refunding ny first payment .
negative	even_though i paid a year in_advance , i am still being charged monthly too !
negative	bt won_'_t even reply to my requests to sort it out .
negative	very very unhappy customer .
negative	hello , just wanted to say thankyou for not booking my connecting_flight to manchester .
negative	luckily there was a seat available on the flight and i was able to just make the flight after having to explain to people at singapore airport that i had paid and booked this flight .
negative	i hope you have a very good explaination for not booking me on the flight and causing me a lot of unecssary stress and upset while trying to travel back home .
negative	leanne
negative	i ordered a wedding planner one for myself and one for a friend . these were a offer , and on for free and cost 00p p_&_p .
negative	what arrived was a cardboard checklist .
negative	not a planner , not as_described and not worth the 00p_each
negative	i have waited ages for this product
negative	i was disappointed in this service , my local_garage in falmouth would not take the parcel , despite it being well within the sizes , the shop owner said he had no room to take .
negative	i don_'_t understand_why certain places offer collect_plus if they have no storage ?
negative	very annoying !
negative	one 0k turkey , a very small jar of cranberry sauce and some goose_fat .
negative	some chocolate buttons , a very small bag of stuffing and some choritso nibbles .... two wine_glasses were suppose to be free .....
negative	i dont_think so somehow .
negative	wont_be doing it again .
negative	i have had the worst customer service experience from pet_supermarket that i have ever had in my many_years of shopping online .
negative	i would say their customer service is completely non - existent as you can not get your issue resolved .
negative	i order a box of 0 x chicken chips pet treats a number of weeks_ago and was puzzled when a few_days_later i received a single pack in a jiffy_bag .
negative	i called their expensive telephone_number and was on hold for around 00_minutes .
negative	i explained the situation and was assured the rest of the order would be sent out and it was just a mistake in their warehouse .
negative	a few_days_later another jiffy_bag arrived with a single bag yet again .
negative	i called again , on - hold again for quite a while , i explained the situation again but the girl seemed uninterested , she said she would get the other packs sent out though .
negative	i also sent a complaint email to the address on - line .
negative	i have not received the rest of the order to this day , also they have totally_ignored my complaint , not even an acknowledgement so it looks like i will never receive the rest of the goods i have paid for .
negative	i have now resorted to opening a paypal claim ( i am glad i paid by paypal ) and they have not yet responded to anything paypal have sent them so hopeful i will receive a refund .
negative	i would stay well away from pet_supermarket , they are cheap for a reason and probably subsidise their business by using an expensive customer service telephone_number .
negative	my experience with the company was good a few_years_ago and my order came quickly .
negative	however , this time things were different .
negative	there was no sign of the gloves i ordered for about 00 days .
negative	i was sent a royal_mail tracking_number but it was not valid on the royal_mail website a week_later , so they did not appear to have been posted .
negative	my email to the company was unanswered .
negative	after a conversation on the phone i was told they were looking into it with royal_mail .
negative	i pointed_out that the gloves were needed for a trip very soon and after more telephone_calls they agreed to send a pair but said they would cut_off the cardboard so i could get them quicker .
negative	this didn_'_t sound ideal but i was assured this wouldn_'_t affect my right to return them if they didn_'_t fit .
negative	they ended_up being too small and i returned them using the address and instructions on the website at the time and sending an_email to let them know .
negative	over a month later i have no refund !
negative	after an unanswered email and another lengthy conversation by phone i was told they hadn_'_t had them back as nothing had been logged .
negative	unfortunately i did not use recorded delivery so cannot prove they were sent or received , however , it seems too much of a coincidence that royal_mail lost the both gloves originally sent and those i returned !
negative	my hunch is either the company are extremely disorganised and have lost my return package , or they decided the gloves are not resaleable without the cardboard label so not to give a refund .
negative	it is too easy to blame_royal_mail but i have sent and received many things before and never had a problem .
negative	once when something went_astray it was returned to me , however there '_s no sign of this package .
negative	i am disappointed to have lost money and would not advise others to use this company .
negative	while i accepted that there was the possabolity that the surgery i had might go_wrong , i did expect there to be a " pulling out all the stops " to make_sure i was well looked after should it do so .
negative	sadly , not so .
negative	i had corrective surgery in one eye and was dissapointed to find they over - corrected , leaving me long sighted in that eye .
negative	while they assured me they could re - correct the sight by further surgery , i have been singularly underwhelmed by my follow_up care .
negative	this is my eye_sight - rather important to me , but seemingly of little importance to the staff at newcastle '_s optical_express .
negative	perhaps i should have expected nothing more when my surgery was over three hours late with no explanation and little apology .
negative	i '_m hoping further surgery will correct the error they made , but hey - looks like i '_m the only one who could give a damn .
negative	come on optical_express , you may not get it wrong often , but when you do , surely we deserve to feel cared_about ?
negative	ocado cancelled my delivery just saying my payment details cannot be verified .
negative	the truth is that they are not happy to see i only ordered products on offer .
negative	they want you to buy expensive items .
negative	truly , most of the ocado products are more_expensive than similar ones in other shops .
negative	so i will never shop with ocado again !!!!
negative	!
negative	daughter had problems with boohoo . com do not touch at all spread the word to avoid theft by them !
negative	awful service , rip_off thieves , unhelpful customer_services dept .
negative	did not listen to problem , their way is right you the customer have no rights .
negative	wrongly labelled ( size ) item returned and customer charged for it .
negative	disgraceful response three_times from customer_services .
negative	i strongly_advise everyone to avoid using this company
negative	i ordered a pair of glasses that were described as black and yet they were red !
negative	after numerous e_mails to the customer service department , they refused to acknowledge that their description of the glasses was at fault and said that i could return them but must pay for postage .
negative	i will never wear the glasses as they are the wrong_colour .
negative	total_waste of time and money .
negative	i will never use this company again and will tell all about how badly i rate them .
negative	no stars !
negative	i too wish i had read the reviews about this company before ordering .
negative	ordered two items in early_december which have not arrived and i have now cancelled order following two unanswered emails .
negative	i have requested immediate_refund and will use small_claims court to reclaim monies if not received .
negative	i am writing this review in tears .
negative	i placed a large order for over 00 items for my sick pets who are approaching the end of their life .
negative	every day they llive is a blessing .
negative	0 of the items was out of stock .
negative	this item is very small in size and weight .
negative	it was not made clear that the whole order of 00 plus items would be delayed .
negative	i am devasted .
negative	i will never use viovet again .
negative	viovet should send this 0 tiny item separately - it isn_'_t my fault this item is out of stock .
negative	it should not affect the rest of the order .
negative	it is completely_unacceptable and a common_sense policy should be applied .
negative	sent my order to the wrong_address , and asked for more money to redeliver , despite my proving my postal address was correct at paypal checkout .
negative	again like many others i bought from them , money has_been taken and they have not sent the item .
negative	i have tried to contact them and you hear nothing .
negative	my 0 year_old_son is now without his present , regret ordering from them .
negative	0st order experience has_been horrible , bad communications from courier .
negative	and two_weeks after cancelling order ..... no refund received as yet very disappointing !
negative	went to the shop to return the item , with my receipt and the original packaging and coat ( paid £ 0 . 00 to park at the car_park in the shopping centre ) was told that they could not accept it as i didn_'_t have the correct returns_label and they could only give me an exchange .
negative	i understand that this is in the small_print but expect much_better customer service when i am actually standing in the shop and have paid over_£_000 for a jacket ( that was much smaller_than a standard size 00 ) suffice to say that after paying £_00 to post it back !!!!!
negative	i will now never , ever shop at superdry again .
negative	yodel is by far the most useless courier firm i have ever come_across .
negative	shower of excrement doesn_'_t even begin to cover it .
negative	i would give them no stars but unfortunately that isn_'_t an option .
negative	i ordered some boots and to be fair they tried to deliver them 0 times ; all within the same hour each day .
negative	sort of like banging your head against a wall and expecting an outcome to pain .
negative	the driver , who texted me his mobile number seemed unable to work his mobile , either to answer it or pick_up his messages .
negative	did he think i was calling for a friendly chat ???
negative	the call_centre staff are nice ( except the last one , who just sounded_bored to tears but then i can '_t really blame her ) but despite message after message left with them were unable to let the driver know ( which a 0 year_old could probably work out after 0 failed tries ) that since they deliver between_0am and 0pm , perhaps they could try any other time other than the 0pm hour .
negative	bored girl informed me that they have a set route and even_though their only job is to deliver parcels and they must have known this would not be fulfilled , they won_'_t change the time .
negative	so basically their delivery times in my area are from 0pm to 0 . 00pm !?!
negative	yeah , really handy .
negative	cheers for that .
negative	so in work on monday i '_ll try to get_hold of someone on the phone and get no answer .
negative	then on tuesday i '_ll call at the same time and get no answer .
negative	i '_ll repeat this 0 more times , leaving my number but never answer their calls .
negative	i haven_'_t done my job but the boxes are ticked .
negative	bottom line : if you want a lot of cards through your door , order with a company that uses_yodel but if you want a parcel , forget it .
negative	my husband opened the outer_packaging and called me out into the garden .
negative	he hadn_'_t torn_open the plastic_covering because he noticed one of the arms had a small_crack and had started to rust .
negative	obviously i didn_'_t even want the washing line after that !
negative	i made the first payment to tt on the 00th_december .
negative	until now i still don_'_t have a broadband / internet_connection .
negative	i called every week since december and i think i spoke at_least once with every_single person that works in customer service / fault department / cancellation departments .
negative	i had a visit from an engineer everything is fine inside the house and with the modem , oh , it was the bt guys who didn_'_t activate the line from outside .
negative	they will come on tuesday .
negative	not sure if they came or not but still no internet for 0_weeks .
negative	called again for around 00_minutes , did all the line testing that i already do with my eyes_closed .
negative	swith on , swith off , change socked , open the socket , flip the modem , dance samba with modem , everytime the same expertly advised procedures .
negative	oh , you stay home from work from 0 to 0 ( thats not vague at all ) and a bt_engineer will visit you .
negative	never showed up .
negative	called again - 00_minutes .
negative	oh , no the problem is with the exchange .
negative	bt is fixing it , i promise with my life and soul i will call you in 0_days .
negative	until now .
negative	called again today , i want to cancel the contract .
negative	another round of testing for 00_minutes ( took a nap while doing them ) and now , no_faults anywhere , dont_know , let_me send you another engineer ( lucky me , there is one available in 0_weeks time !)
negative	no , i want to cancel , thank_you .
negative	let_me direct you to the cancellation department .
negative	0 minutes on hold .. tcha nam ...
negative	i someone hangs up the phone in my face .
negative	after going to hell and back , called the cancellation department .... 00_minutes with a broked connection ... oh let_me direct you to the faults department .
negative	what ?!
negative	they directed me to you .
negative	after 00_minutes on hold ... fault department , another round of line testing !!!
negative	nothing wrong , do you want an enginneer in 0_weeks time ?
negative	no , thank_you , just want to cancel the contract - sorry ma ' am , cancellation department closes at 0pm .... its 0 . 00pm .
negative	guess i dont need to say anything_else ....
negative	i bought an engraved bracelet for my niece for her_birthday .
negative	it arrived in good time , which is why i have given the company one star .
negative	the bracelet was of such poor quality that i would be embarrassed to give it to anyone .
negative	the engraving on the item was so small it was almost illegible .
negative	the whole litem was extremely disappointing .
negative	i rang the company to be told that i could not return the item as it was personalised and the website apparently stated this .
negative	i have revisited the website and still cannot see anywhere that actually says that you cannot return personalised goods if you are not happy .
negative	all i can say is ; poor quality , poor customer service and therefore overpriced .
negative	please be careful if you order anything from this website .
negative	i have just wasted nearly_£_00 : (
negative	i recommended you to my daughter , she had 0_weeks wait for delivery of pet_food with only a " pending " email sent from you & no explanation of future delivery .
negative	meanwhile daughter had to buy pet_food elsewhere .
negative	the birdwater dish was broken when it arrived .
negative	your staff asked for a photo as evidence of the breakage !
negative	we do not have a digital_camera .
negative	i never recieved my brushes and the help i recieved was non_existant , im not £_00 down with no brushes .
negative	very angry .
negative	one year later , two lost houses later , £££ in wasted phone_calls and recorded delivery costs the underwriter finally contacted me yesterday to tell me the decision in principle issued by hsbc was wrong ( delivered in a manner suggesting this error is somehow my fault ) all couched in extremely xenophobic terms .
negative	if your name sounds ' foreign ' ( their words , not mine ) walk_away .
negative	now , i '_m told my original documents are lost by the bank ( again as though this is somehow my fault ).
negative	the bank will abuse you in every way possible save for actual physical assault .
negative	for goodness_sake , don_'_t waste your time , energy and goodwill .
negative	banks are bad , but not this bad .
negative	we were only applying for 00_% ltv as premier customers and still untold misery ensued ..... oh and by the way , don_'_t bother_writing to the md / ceo as his department doesn_'_t bother responding to correspondence .
negative	is first direct really a subsidiary of hsbc ?
negative	how can it be any better .
negative	notwithstanding those rave_reviews and tempting switching fees , i will never touch an hsbc related company again .
negative	if there was a zero star option that would have been generous .
negative	i ordered 0 pairs of merrell_shoes for my elderly parent and having bought this brand regularly for years i had no reason to believe there would be any issue with the size .
negative	when the shoes arrived , one pair looked worn with the elastic side strap already lose and stretched and the boots were designed so badly the angle at the ankle made it impossible to fit the foot into the boot .
negative	considering the boots are advertised as " slip on and off " this defect was unacceptable .
negative	the shoes were advertised as new and in perfect_condition .
negative	i immediately notified outdoor_kit within 00_minutes of receiving the shoes .
negative	i am shocked at the response from this company which is attempting to deprive me of my statutory_rights .
negative	having taken a great deal of time and effort , to clarify the defects in detail which could cause a serious injury to my elderly parent , i received an_email_confirming the order would be refunded when the goods were returned .
negative	the return_label emailed following repeated requests was actually the label used to post the goods to me .
negative	i then received another email_stating the refund would only be processed if there is a defect with the size of the shoes reneging on the earlier agreement .
negative	in the meantime , i still_haven_'_t received a valid return_label .
negative	it has_been an aggravating experience which is far from over .
negative	i regularly buy goods online but i can state with some certainty this is not a company i would trust again .
negative	very unprofesssional company run by a person_who will quite happily make arrangements and subsequently hang up the phone and fail to attend appointments without reason .
negative	dealing_with cookersolutions wasted a lot of my time and effort and my cooker in the meantime is still not working .
negative	don_'_t waste your time on this company .
negative	it seems amazing a company as large and established as pixmania could have such draconian processes .
negative	more than 00 days after_placing an order it still_hasn_'_t arrived yet i have been charged_twice for the same item .
negative	trying to resolve even simple matters by email is impossible as the staff are determined to misunderstand every communication and when calling the company i was cross examined about my personal_circumstances by a barely litterate undereducated rude adolescent .
negative	low quality service by undertrained staff .
negative	this is only my second order from pixmania and i won_'_t be making any more purchases with this company .
negative	having spent hours surfing the internet for the right watch at the most competitive price i ordered a rotary sterling_silver watch from the watch_hut .
negative	the order was confirmed and payment taken .
negative	at that stage the watch was also available at other_outlets for the same price .
negative	later the following_day i received an_email from the watch_hut telling_me the watch would not be supplied having been_discontinued by rotary .
negative	i contacted rotary and discovered the watch is still available as a current line item .
negative	the watch_hut simply shrugged off its lie telling_me this is the standard response in such circumstances .
negative	of course , by now the other_outlets had sold the watch .
negative	i even tried reporting the problem to rotary without effect .
negative	apparently rotary is happy for its authorised distributors to use its brand to lure customers with non - existent products .
negative	my advice ?
negative	buy a different brand from another shop .
negative	i ordered a christmas star for my tree paid express delivery as i needed it asap i chose it based on the colour in the photo .
negative	when i received the star it was completely_different in colour to the photo , it was also chipped and missing chunks of glitter .
negative	i email the company and still have not received a reply .
negative	i was complety ripped_off .
negative	please do not waste your time or money with this company .
negative	bad service .
negative	wallows product as the market !
negative	i oredered a miss chamilia braclet for my nieces_birthday .
negative	she_loves peppa_pig so ordered the pig charm and the cup_cake charm aswell as purchased the braclet at the same time .
negative	so i spent a good £_00 - 00 with them but when i received them i had a cow charm , cup_cake and braclet !
negative	!
negative	when you spend £_00 on a little charm you expect the correct items to arrive .
negative	all they said was they '_ll send out the correct charm in the next post and a returns envelope so i could send the cow charm back .
negative	i would of thought that they would of atleast offered my delivery charge back or maybe a certain_amount of discount of my next purchase but nothing as it was their mistake as on the invoice it says i ordered the pig charm .
negative	not happy with them and won_'_t use them to buy anything_else .
negative	the most disgraceful customer service i have had in a very long time .
negative	a dpd driver contracted by o0 to do a swap of a live replacement i phone would not give me 0mins at the door today to delete my contacts and more_importantly pictures and images of my children .
negative	background : o0 had agreed to replace a faulty iphone for me and i was told i needed to swap it with the driver who would call within the next two_days .
negative	i needed to keep my existing phone live , with all the contacts , until the switch over .
negative	my experience with the driver frank chimezle :
negative	the dpd driver was at my door for less_than 0 minutes when i told him i needed to just quickly erase my personal_data .
negative	without speaking to me he phoned his depot keeping hold of my existing phone so i couldn_'_t even make use of the time he was taking to enquire as to whether he should allow me time to do this .
negative	he was unpleasant from the outset .
negative	he confirmed with his warehouse during this call he had only been at my door for now 0 minutes when they asked him how long he had been with me .
negative	he finished the call and told me he would give me back my old phone only if i gave him back the new one and he would come_back tomorrow and do the swap as he had other deliveries to do .
negative	he was a very unpleasant and intimidating person .
negative	he stood very close to me in my front_door way , despite lots of room for him to stand back , and he made it perfectly clear to me he would not listen to a single thing i had to say .
negative	he was aggressive in a passive way refusing to answer any of my questions and not even looking at me .
negative	he very obviously bad tempered and angry .
negative	i tried closing the door on him and he jammed his foot in it insisting i signed for the package .
negative	i had to put my hand out and squiggle something on his pad just to get him to go away .
negative	i was shaking once i had the door closed .
negative	i phoned his depot to complain and was told he would return and i would be given time to delete the personal_data off my phone .
negative	he returned and again was instantly unpleasant and angry .
negative	he didn_'_t even greet me or attempt to deal with the situation in an appropriate way .
negative	he was aggressive and again intimidating .
negative	he stood unnecessarily close to the threshold of my door and he was on the phone to his warehouse talking in a loud voice for me to hear his conversation .
negative	he never spoke directly to me and never took the time to try to explain / resolve the situation in a professional way .
negative	i was totally amazed that despite what i had been told by dpd a different member of staff was now saying to him he had to take back the new phone , leave my old one and redeliver / swap them tomorrow .
negative	pausing there to think about the logic here , what they were suggesting would have required me to have sufficient time to remove the sim_card from my newly delivered phone which by now was up and running , get the packaging together to give to the driver , he would then return my old phone to me and complete the paper_work and redeliver the next_day !
negative	all to save 0 mins .
negative	not a very cleaver or helpful use of this driver ’_s time .
negative	i have looked at the company '_s website under the heading of what is required to be a driver at this company .
negative	mr frank chimezle doesn ’_t even get close to that !
negative	customer_services just as bad .
negative	i have complained to o0 and thankfully they are very very concerned_about this driver ’_s behaviour and the company '_s attitude_towards one of their valued_customers .
negative	just as well i had not ordered anything important , ordered on 00 , supposedly sent on the 00th but as of 00th it has still not arrived .
negative	i was told as it was sent second class i should give it another week before i email them again .
negative	i am well versed in royal_mail 0nd_class_post , i sent several items to customers .
negative	generally they arrive two_days_later and at a push three .
negative	i think it is sloppy customer service to just blame_royal_mail .
negative	pharmacy_0u charge £ 0 . 00 for second class_post whilst the actual cost is £ 0 . 00 .
negative	great i got a message_stating when i was getting my delivery .
negative	so i couldn_'_t take my dogs out and the dogs didn_'_t alert me to the fact that anyone was trying to deliver something .
negative	like knocking at my main front storm doors which have no post box ot door_handles .
negative	or a door_knocker , or bell .
negative	it does indicate i don_'_t expect people to use that entrance unless the storm doors are open to my front_door .
negative	this not being the case .
negative	you would as many have done knock on the door or bay_window driving the dogs potty .
negative	this didn_'_t happen .
negative	i have a drive way leading up to a large double gate where 00_% of people take automatically as it is the obvious main used entrance to my home .
negative	i was then told having waited in a further day that the parcel was just outside my frontdoor , strange i hadn_'_t seen it beside my electric_wheelchair or the dogs chalet with veranda .
negative	or behind the gates into my garden .
negative	a few hours_later the dogs go nuts because someone is outside our house and low and behold at the gate is the delivery with a lame_excuse of having been here 0_days before yeah and my dogs are suddenly deaf .
negative	i don_'_t know if the heater is working yet as my dog is awaiting the birth of her puppies and she always takes panacur during pregnancy .
negative	placed order as chosen by my little_girl for her big brothers_birthday .
negative	order didn_'_t turn_up .
negative	contacted " the happy_puzzle_company " the item was not in stock but would be in in 0_days and they would send it up first_class .
negative	one week_later still no item , phoned again ...... item still not in stock .
negative	now will not be here in time for my sons_birthday .
negative	disappointed son and daughter !!
negative	now have to drive 00 miles round_trip on a saturday and tackle parking difficulties and charges with my little_girl to get something_else .
negative	how difficult would it have been happy_puzzle_company to e_- mail at the time of order and communicate with me that the item was out of stock ?
negative	that would have saved a lot of disappointment and extra_expense !
negative	!
negative	the prices offered are very competitive but items they claim are in stock take a long time to arrive - fine as long as you are aware of this beforehand .
negative	all my orders have had a delay of some sort .
negative	i cancelled one of my orders after it did not arrive before it was needed despite_being advised that they would make it a priority order .
negative	00 days_later , many phone_calls with long waiting times and many emails , i still have not received any refund and am told it may be at_least another 00 days .
negative	i am getting quite concerned - the customer service officials are polite but can offer no assistance of any kind .
negative	they just offered to email on my behalf .
negative	please_beware - i do believe i will eventually be refunded but connstant checking / ringing and emailing with no response is very frustrating .
negative	my photobook had a small rip on binding , as it was a gift i didn_'_t have time to return it , i did inform them of this , i won_'_t use this company again
negative	appalling customer service , i would not recommend using this company .
negative	they say the dispatch within 0_days but after 0_days i had to ring them .
negative	they had taken my order knowing they were having delays with dispatch but didn_'_t tell me this .
negative	they claimed they ask to note things like birthdays but this is not signalled during the order process , its buried in the fine print somewhere .
negative	they offered no help to get me my present on time and were very rude to me on the telephone .
negative	awful experience and a very disappointed birthday boy .
negative	although the flowers that arrived were ok they were in a box loose and not arranged / tied in any way .
negative	my mum could not find a card so at first didn_'_t know who they were from and she also said that the delivery person was rude and off hand .
negative	not a great mother '_s day experience and will not use again .
negative	i ordered a rug 0 week_ago .
negative	it still has not arrived despite saying on the website that it should have done !
negative	i '_ve had one email to confirm the order and the money has_been taken from my account but i have heard_nothing since .
negative	i called up and the lady was very unhelpful and quite_abrupt .
negative	she gave_me a tracking_number reluctantly and the tracking_number does not work !
negative	if my rug does not arrive in the next few_days i will be calling back and will be cancelling my order and expecting a full_refund plus compensation for my time and phone_calls wasted !
negative	i ordered starlight flowers .. what arrived was a full blown azalea with a small fern in a basket .
negative	i suggest you do not use this florist again .
negative	i require a full_refund .
negative	this was a special present to an elderly_lady and when i asked her fort an honest description of what the flowers were like she described them as " very poor and could be bought for £ 0 somewhere_else ."
negative	this has deeply upset me and spoilt christmas .
negative	0 parcels expected this morning .
negative	0 parcel came around 00 . 00hrs .
negative	i told the driver that there should be 0 parcels but he was adament there was only 0 , even_though the box said 0 of 0 .
negative	later in the afternoon i received a text which said my parcel would be delivered between 00 . 00hrs and 00 . 00hrs .
negative	we sat in and waited and no parcel arrived .
negative	tried to ring to find out what had happened but the number given was automated and kept telling_me the parcel had been delivered and signed for at 00 . 00hrs .
negative	at 00 . 00hrs i received an_email to say " tried to deliver your order from scan computers however no one available to accept delivery ".
negative	how ridiculous , we were home all day waiting , have 0 dogs who bark loudly when anyone comes through the front_gate so there is no way we would miss anyone calling at our house .
negative	therefore we have the case for the computer but no parts to put in it and had arranged for someone to come this evening to put it together .
negative	very disappointed indeed at this bad service and what a wasted day considering it is so near christmas and we could have spent our time getting the bits of shopping .. the driver obviously went home early or couldn_'_t be bothered to do all his deliveried .
negative	estimated delivery 0 - 00 days .
negative	it has ben 0_weeks i haven_'_t received my item .
negative	i '_ve just received an_email_saying there will be delay another 0_weeks .
negative	this is a joke .
negative	ordered flowers online for a handover on a new property .
negative	online ordering was very easy and i needed to change the date and rung up to do so and staff were helpful .
negative	when i arrived on monday_morning to collect the flowers i waited at information , there were two staff on , both with customers , neither acknowledged me or said we wont_be long , after a few_minutes i went into flower area , rang the bell and no - one responded , returned to information where another lady was in the queue by now , she walked off referring to lack of service .
negative	still no acknowledgment .
negative	i returned to flower area and the same lady that had been on information walked by , i said excuse me i am here to pick an order up where do i go , she stopped with a huff and said ' what kind of order ', i said flowers , she said go to information .
negative	back to information , 0 minutes later same member of staff comes round and ignores me further until the lady she is serving says , ' please serve the other lady as i am taking some time ' she did not want to serve me and then said ' next ', i said i am still_waiting for the flower delivery i told you about 00_minutes ago , she replied ' we are only two staff and busy with customers . she brought my flowers , put them down and said nothing , i said do i need to sign or is that it and she replied ' thats it '.
negative	i work in customer_care , i have been in it for 00 years , and if that is the way longacres cares for its customers i will not be returning .
negative	i have also been coming to longacres for more than 00 years .
negative	i will also tell my friends and family not to bother .
negative	nothing but trouble , keep thining ill try again but always some issue !!
negative	!
negative	i was charged_£ 0 00 for express delivery then i wasn_'_t in when delivered after three working_days at_least it was left in an accessible place i cant tell you what the product is like as i have not got it yet
negative	i did not make a recent_purchase because you would not recognise my e_- mail address .
negative	why can '_t i puchase from you without having to sign in and have a password .
negative	you make the whole_process so difficult .
negative	if you don_'_t recognize my e_- mail address when i try to purchase something how come you can send me this e_-
negative	you '_d never be my friend .
negative	the first time i '_ve_used you .
negative	customer_care ?
negative	you sent the product with two different batteries , one of which didn_'_t fit .
negative	no_surprises i have returned it !
negative	if you can get that wrong - what else ?
negative	i placed an order customer number 0000000000 order delivery enquiry 000000000 and i received a confirmation for my order but did not receive my items and my order disappeared from the site !
negative	i contacted customer_services who promised to resend my order , then nothing
negative	i contacted customer_services again & this time my order was sent out but i had an e_- mail saying i had set_up a credit account when i hadn_'_t but this is ok if i get my order at the original price charged ie £ 0 not full price without the discount accepted on my original order !
negative	i need a response to my e_-_mails as i will keep the credit account and order again in the future if i am only charged the original amount of my order ie £ 0 otherwise i will have to return my order and close my account and not order ever again , thank_you !
negative	i like the prices of the items but i still expect to get the item pictured & the boots i were sent were a good 0 - 0 inches shorter_than in the picture of the item onsite !!
negative	!
negative	the 0nd_pair i ordered killed my feet on the first time of wearing them and so are useless to me now too as are not just extremely uncomfortable , not true to size and they left me with numerous blisters !
negative	!
negative	i expect the items i purchase to be functional and fit for purpose as well as the actual item sent as in the picture not shorter boots which they definitely were
negative	i am not a happy customer & if this is not resolved in a satisfactory way i will be going to trading_standards with my complaint as the boots were not just useless but not as shown on site either and the other ones left scars on my feet :-(
negative	( p . s i do not see why i have to pay for return postage and nothing was said in regards to the other pair which are useless and unwearable and neither of the issues are my fault as i bought them both in good faith !! )
negative	was horrified to find that two payments had been taken for my recent order to hungry_house , now yes e_- mail of apology sent to me explaining it would be back in my account in 0 working_days but i am on income support & on a very limited_budget so to treat_myself to a take away is a rarity and of real importance to me as in quality of food and service as i don_'_t have money to waste !!!
negative	!
negative	the meal itself was dire , i had to wait nearly 0 hours for it and it was cold on arrival & the delivery driver had a car parked_outside my door with around 0 other guys in it at 0am with me in my nightclothes & i felt very uncomfortable & find this to be extremely unprofessional plus like i said the food was dire anyway but my issue is the extra £_00 . 00 which was taken from my account was actually for my electricity for over the weekend !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	so to find that money gone from my account meant i had no money for my electricity for over the weekend and my electricity ran_out this morning ( i had used the emergency credit ) so i was panicking of course and i cannot even describe the hassle i went through to borrow money to put on my meter and actually spent my saturday_afternoon in tears thanks to hungry_house and it is not just about an e_- mail of apology and a refund of my money in 0 working_days as it is of no use to me when it was my money for my electricity for over the weekend !
negative	:-(
negative	i have decided i want nothing more whatsoever to do with your company & you can keep my money i am so appalled with your company that it is worth it just to get_rid of you and the stress caused out of my life , so pocket the money & i hope you do well with it & all the best for the future for you and your staff !
negative	:-) x
negative	( please_note i do not want my money back , i do not want a refund - i am so disgusted with your company & what they have done today that you can keep it , thank_you !! )
negative	where is my gift voucher ?
negative	!
negative	after 0 attempts to get someone to talk to me about the thermonet and what i needed to order ended_up talking to thermonet direct and i must_say they were professional , efficient and knowledgeable about the product .
negative	emailed me exactly_what i needed to order from walls and floors and emailed walls and floors direct to get them to call me back and confirm my order .
negative	i was so shocked by the lack of knowledge at walls and floors that i requested a manager to call me back - which didn_'_t happen .
negative	ordered a new bulb for my fridge_freezer make and model correctly spoecified and one arrived twice as big !!
negative	!
negative	so much for ordering the correct_part from partmaster .
negative	i ordered my product on friday 00 january at 00 :_00am , and paid_extra for next - day delivery .
negative	however , as i was not given the option to select saturday delivery , the products arrived on monday .
negative	i needed the products for an event on sunday , and i feel that the company should make it clear on their website that " next - day delivery " and " saturday delivery " are in fact two different options .
negative	i have now paid more for the products as i had intended to , due to the delivery costs , even_though i have no use for them .
negative	also , when i e_- mailed to cancel the order as i would not even be able to collect them , i was told that the product would be delivered and i had to pay to send them back !
negative	i now have 0000 bags that i cannot use , and it will cost me almost the same price to send them back as i would get refunded .
negative	i feel let_down and scammed by the company , and feel that it is their fault as the website is not clear .
negative	however , when i rang up to request a refund on the delivery charge , the people i spoke to were abrupt , and quite rude , and would not take_responsibility for the company '_s mistake .
negative	i would not recommend the company to friends or family , as i feel they will be as let_down as i was .
negative	i ordered a yamaha digital_piano on line , together with pedals and bench seat .
negative	estimated delivery date was wed .
negative	i changed to thurs .
negative	i received order confirmation but no further emails .
negative	i checked my order on the wed only to find the delivery date had been put back 0_days with no notification .
negative	i telephoned customer_services to be told that the bench seat was out of stock because i changed the delivery date and so nothing was being delivered .
negative	why no email , i would have settled for the piano and pedals and waited for the bench to be delivered at a later date .
negative	customer_services offered delivery of piano 0_days hence ( estimated ) no good as i work .
negative	if i had been informed immediately i would have arranged for delivery on my next_day off but as they did not seem too worried that no emails had been received informing_me what was happening i just cancelled the order
negative	very poor communication , and do not appreciate that some people order on line and arrange delivery dates because their free time is limited !
negative	selected a tyre - in stock , ordered and payed .
negative	half an_hour later a call to say not available .
negative	offered me an_alternative but difference was that this was not a run flat as i requested and need for my vehicle .
negative	would not offer me anything_else and only a £ 0 discount off the available premium_brands .
negative	would i use again - absolutely not !
negative	more_importantly , would i recommend - no !
negative	furious .
negative	i ordered flowers in plenty of time for my sisters_00th_birthday with serenata .
negative	they failed to deliver , much to my disappointment and embarrassment .
negative	in reading the small_print , i read that they reserve the right to deliver until 00pm at night , so i had to wait_until then before contacting them , adding to the frustration .
negative	as they do not offer telephone contact , one can only get in touch by mailing them .
negative	i received a reply the next_day saying they '_d take 00_hours to confirm what happened .
negative	around 00_hours went past before i contacted them , having not received a reply .
negative	they told me they could offer to redeliver or refund .
negative	i asked for redelivery and a refund of half the price of the flowers to compensate me .
negative	they refused and so i asked for a full_refund .
negative	i will not be using them again and would not recommend them .
negative	mistakes can happen , but i felt they should have done more to put it right .
negative	in my view , they are unreliable and the whole_experience of after care was annoying , time_consuming and frustrating .
negative	on line ordering was fab
negative	consistently conflicting_information from different personnel .
negative	consistently mucking up my 0 accounts .
negative	consistently , informing_me i cannot run 0 accounts from 0 email ( which i can ).
negative	consistently making me change a password ( don_'_t know why ) but think it is because whoever reads my emails can '_t actually be bothered to get past the first line .
negative	consistently not turning_up for appointments .
negative	i suppose they are consistent !
negative	even when suggesting i could save money by using a different tariff they said ' but it is probably too much bother for me to do '.
negative	oh i can '_t wait to change providers .
negative	and now asking me to click to link to my bill - i can '_t .
negative	it took four deliveries of the same blind for it to arrive undamaged .
negative	every time they said they would give it more padding but never did .
negative	the blind is very nice but what we had to go through to get it !!!
negative	not worth it .
negative	no apologies either .
negative	i ordered crackers on the 00th of december .
negative	0000 .
negative	it is now january 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	they still have not arrived .
negative	i have repeatedly phoned and emailed this company .
negative	they do not answer my emails , whether sent directly to their sales address or by using their " feedback form " on the website .
negative	when i ring them , if i get an answer at all , they keep telling_me someone will call me back and no - one ever does .
negative	i have now had to resort to requesting that my credit_card provider reverse the transaction since this company has taken my money , not provided the product and refuses point_blank to discuss the situation .
negative	avoid at all costs and find a reputable_company to deal with .
negative	i placed my order on 00nd_march part of which was a fruit basket to be delivered on the 00th , this did not arrive and at 0 - 00 that evening i was offered flowers to be delivered the next_day , not happy , the other part of my order was flowers to be delivered on the 00th which i ordered a winter bouquet and a bouquet of pink flowers arrived and 0 of the roses where already dead .
negative	i find this totally_unacceptable .
negative	my order no :_000000
negative	i bought a samsung laptop which arrived yesterday .
negative	it will not connect to the internet .
negative	after hours on the phone , being pushed from_pillar to post , calls not being returned , it was finally agreed that the laptop was faulty .
negative	misco then refused to take it without an authorisation from samsung ( which i had and which i gave them ) - even_though under the sale of goods_act the product is their responsibility - and put the phone down on me .
negative	customer_services do not know anything about consumer_law .
negative	i have spent £_000 and received nothing .
negative	terrible service with no apology at any stage .
negative	we employed a cleaner for about six_weeks and everything seemed to be going well .
negative	they did a good job and aside from a broken glass and a couple of things lost behind a cabinet , everything was great .
negative	then our cleaner cancelled for a couple of weeks running .
negative	we didn_'_t complain because we thought there was a personal issue .
negative	the next week , she '_d obviously let herself in , but no housework had been done ( at first i thought we '_d had a break - in because it looked like someone other than our cleaner had been in the house ).
negative	after several calls to maid0clean , they said she was refusing to do anything because we '_d left too much washing up ( we '_d had friends over the night before ).
negative	we '_d not asked her to do it , but hadn_'_t had time ourselves - but the way the maid0clean office spoke to us , it was like we were animals for leaving a few plates and a couple of baking_trays out .
negative	i '_d only hired a cleaner because i '_d been struggling to keep_up at home because of a very demanding job , but rather_than helping , my dealings with maid0clean and the insulting nature of the calls almost reduced me to tears .
negative	we '_d already paid a direct_debit for three_weeks when the cleaner hadn_'_t cleaned anything , but maid0clean refused to refund us for that , or a payment for the next four_weeks .
negative	so the experience meant we paid maid0clean for 00 weeks work and only got six_weeks .
negative	but as frustrating as the financial side was , the disgraceful comments on the phone sealed maid0clean as the worst company experience i '_ve ever had .
negative	i bought a lazer pen and the guy on the phone couldnt have been more helpful and polite but the product was not fit for purpose .
negative	i tour_guide at ely cathedral and need a pen that will have a range of more than 00 feet and i thought this one had but alas it only goes a few feet before peetering out so back to the drawing_board !
negative	my partner brought me a pair of shoes from " new look " on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	he had also paid_extra for next_day delivery !
negative	i was very excited , so we both decided to stay in and wait for them .
negative	they were due to arrive between_0am and 0pm today ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ).
negative	i checked the " hermes : parcel tracking " only to find that at
negative	" 00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 courier to re - attempt "
negative	i went straight to the letter_box and no card had been left .
negative	we got on to the phone to new look and they told us we had missed the courier , but how could we ?
negative	we have been in all day !!
negative	i new look wont even refund us delivery charge as we are supposedly the ones at fault .
negative	i am very angry and appalled at the way we have been treated and i hope never to do_business with these couriers again once i finally receive my shoes !
negative	i upgraded to a new phone with o0 unaware that they were using yodel as their courier service .
negative	naturally i was excited .
negative	00 / 00 / 00 - i got a text from o0 stating i would receive my phone this day between_0am and 0pm .
negative	all day i waited and waited for my phone to be delivered .
negative	at 00 : 00 i got another text from o0 saying i had missed the delivery , i looked at the online tracker and it said " no one to receive card left " at 00 : 00 .
negative	i looked for a card and there wasn_'_t one .
negative	i called the courier straight_away and told them i '_ve been in all day and missed a days work , so it would of been impossible for me to of missed them .
negative	the courier said " oh i '_m new to this round , and i don_'_t know the area , so i didn_'_t come ".
negative	what a joke !
negative	its your job ?
negative	what kind of excuse is that ?
negative	" erm i '_ll do it tomorrow " they spoke to me with no respect what so ever .
negative	can '_t_believe they didn_'_t even have the courtesy to call me and let_me know what was going on .
negative	well thanks for your blatant incompetence !
negative	you might be a slacker but i '_m not , another day thats going to be wasted !
negative	00 / 00 / 00 - when i checked the tracker early this morning , i noticed that my phone wasn_'_t actually anywhere , i had no idea where it was .
negative	i repeatedly tried to contact the courier with no luck .
negative	eventually i got tired and gave o0 a call .
negative	all of a sudden the courier text me saying they would deliver between 00pm and 0pm .
negative	they did turn_up with my phone at 00 : 00 , it was a relief .
negative	although the courier was polite when she arrived , i found the whole_experience very stressful and i hope to avoid this company in the future .
negative	i will be going to watchdog .
negative	on the upside , i love my new phone .
negative	i have purchased soft_cover booklets from other_companies but they are by far better_than yours .
negative	i was impressed with the price so decided to give you a try .
negative	two other members of my family also purchased at the same time and are also extremely disappointed !
negative	!
negative	ordered for a christmas_present and arrived with a stain .
negative	had to make a special trip to kingston and pay parking and petrol to change as no time before christmas to sort_out .
negative	one of the biggest cons going , promises were made on the website which certaintly were not fufilled .
negative	they made a stressful journe , y due to torrential_rain , even more stressful when we arrived at the airport to leave the car , we waited 00_minutes for anyone to collect the car .
negative	the journey home was made even more stressful when the tank was empty on departure and were made to find a petrol_station as soon as possible .
negative	there is a lot more that could be said but i am still too angry and we have been home a fortnight !
negative	certaintly giving the name to friends never to use the company !
negative	got mis_- sold a package , had to repeat myself 0 times to the fella an he was english , but hadn_'_t a clue .
negative	went to cancel the package , well within my rights , took me over half an_hour , passed on from one indian to another , i dont mind that if people are trained , poor poor service
negative	moved from ups to fedex , used them for 0 month then went back to ups .
negative	in a nutshell ...
negative	rep signed us up then ignored us ... goods damaged in shipping .
negative	we tried to claim for one of the high value items we shipped , the rep said he would deal with the claim then did nothing .
negative	we chased him then went direct to the claims_department who siad they would look into the issue .
negative	then we had the bill ..... told accounts that we wouldn_'_t pay until the claim was processed as we had not heard_anything back .
negative	their accounts_department got in touch with their claims_department who said thay had not heard of us .
negative	we forwareded the accounts_department the emails we had had from their claims_department , suddenly they remembered us !
negative	we were told the claim would be setteled but then heard_nothing from them then we got a legal letter chasing for the bill and £_00 legal fee .
negative	we paid bill but not £_00 immediatly .
negative	00 minuets later told our claim would not be paid and we would get a minimum £_00 refund !
negative	just had a refund of £_00 !
negative	the £_00 - £_00 legal fees we did not pay !
negative	no offer of an_appology !
negative	complete_waste of time £_00 doesn_'_t even cover the original carriage_charge .
negative	we are down about £ 0000 !
negative	i recently ordered a seat_belt with you for my kia carens .
negative	i waited a few_days for it to come and it didn_'_t arrive .
negative	i rang up to see where it was only to be told that the delivery driver had delivered it to the wrong_address .
negative	as it was the only seat_belt you had i would have to have a refund .
negative	i '_m still_waiting for my refund .
negative	i '_m not happy that you didn_'_t ring me to tell me that the seat_belt went to the wrong_address .
negative	i will now have to go to another company to get the seat_belt .
negative	odered roses pot to be delivered to my friend .
negative	on the delivery day i received a call and was told that they dont have it in stock .
negative	i agreed to a replacement bouguet .
negative	i chose the bouguet from eflorist website which looked really nice .
negative	i actually happened to visit this friend 0_days_later and saw the bouguet - it was nothing like the one on the website .
negative	looked very cheap and not colorful .
negative	hopefully someone had better experience bug i dont_think i will use eflorist again or would recommend ...
negative	i put 0_star for the service but there was no rude_conduct really
negative	i ordered my special prescription dog_food from medicanimal on 00th_march .
negative	i had calculated that there was going to be a bank_holiday but this date would give me enough food for my little sick dog to cover a short delay .
negative	today is 0th_april and my food is still not here .
negative	i '_ve had to put my dog on rations and i '_ve even contacted medicanimal to ask when it would arrive , i was told tomorrow , which was yesterday , or monday at the latest .
negative	the food was only shipped to dpd last night !
negative	what a sorry_state of affairs .
negative	my dog cannot have any other food .... but ... other_companies do sell it on the interenet .
negative	if i had been told there was going to be a severe delay i could have ordered it from another company .
negative	in these situations its not also cost that counts .
negative	thank_you [ i bet you wished that you had never asked ] and my food has not arrived yet !
negative	had a very urgent parcel to be collected and they give a time_slot of between 0 . 00am to 00 . 00_hours .
negative	i received a text from them to say it would be collected before 00 . 00 but needless to say they never turned_up .
negative	you can '_t ring them so have to just use ' chat ' and all they do is rebook for the following_day , which is what we have done .
negative	they still_haven_'_t collected the parcel and i have now stayed in for two whole days which has cost money .
negative	will now have to pay someone_else to deliver the goods , probably hermes as they are supposed to be good .
negative	would never use this company again and wouldnt trust them to deliver the parcel let_alone pick it up !!!!!
negative	i put them on a par with citylink who very kindly lost a £_000 caravan awning !!!!
negative	!
negative	two boxes collected from a address in bolton ( caravan awning brand_new )
negative	only one containing the poles delivered the box with the awning is missing , value £_000
negative	still_awaiting a report , the courier in question is citylink .
negative	won_'_t use used cash_back website was refused cash_back won_'_t of bought item in first place
negative	i ordered tickets for a ferry trip and when i was sent the e_- mail confirmation the desinations were wrong .
negative	i phoned to amend them after 0 minutes and was told i would be charged an extra £_000 on top of the £_000 i had already paid .
negative	when i said i was not paying that and wanted a refund i was told i would still be charged_£_00 !
negative	for what im not sure .
negative	i feel totally_ripped_off .
negative	i would never use your service again .
negative	i ordered a basket of freesias for my brother in laws funeral flowers .
negative	on delivery i found it to be a tatty mess of what i call filling and only a few freesias dotted about in it .
negative	the basket shown on line was lovely , the basket had a handle , the one delivered was just a shallow posy bowl / basket and the main flower being very scruffy / uneven michaelmas daisies - definitely not what i wanted to see for a much mourned relative .
negative	as a regular online shopper i would advise anyone to think carefully before using very .
negative	my very first order three_weeks_ago never arrived and despite many emails , telephone_calls and queries the situation has not been resolved .
negative	in fact very '_s response was to cancel my order , refund the money to my account ( which i would not use again ) rather_than my card minus the delivery charge ( for an item that was not delivered !)
negative	and then inform_me if i still wanted the item (!?!?!
negative	which i would not have ordered if i did not want ) i had to reorder at the full price ( discounted when i originally ordered ).
negative	shocking customer service - i will not use again !
negative	avoid , avoid !
negative	!
negative	not impressed ,
negative	i attempted emailing initially , still no response .
negative	they took my money on 00 / 00 /_0000 , know happily earning them interest , while i chase my tale .
negative	after my call to the ipswich call_centre where dan , was unable to answer my query , where was my order promised by end of may0000 ?
negative	his response i can have someone call you !
negative	to date no call .
negative	so i wrote to phansord @ thompson - morgan . com managing_director , mr paul hansord direct email
negative	to date still no answer , no delivery of outstanding goods , or explanation of when they '_ll arrive ?
negative	i also contacted bbc_watchdog and will place my review or experiences of this online sales site on international social_media sites .
negative	this was my third order over three years , and every one has_been mismanaged by this company enticing me back with a voucher_code that never works .... their strange way of saying sorry !
negative	utter_rubbish , on my credit_card statement
negative	00 / 00 /_0000 0000 ******** xxxx auth : genealogybank . com , 000 - 000 - 0000 , usa debit ($ 0 . 00 )
negative	not free 00 days as they took my money .
negative	despite offering several ways to pay me the promised cashback ..... still nothing ... just excuses .
negative	certain clients of theirs don_'_t pay cash , only love to shop vouchers , which can be refused due to terms and conditions .
negative	it is supposed to be cashback ... not vouchers back .
negative	they have my uk bank details , paypal .. emails .... which they recommended , my home address , just waiting for them to ask for first born or blood type .
negative	forget double pay promise ... still_waiting for topcashback to cough up that too ... that '_s nothing to do with their clients ... just them being lazy .
negative	family i referred are also feeling conned .
negative	quidco have never had a problem paying up , their rates maybe less ... but you actually see cash .
negative	since_joining in 0000 earned about £_000 year .
negative	response is poor and very pro_forma ....
negative	i have attempted to select pay me , supplied emails , paypal , bank details ... now they want tesco_club card info ... all i am getting is ...
negative	*** please_note that due to restrictions in place with one or more of the merchants for which you have requested payment , we ' re unable to payout via this method .
negative	please can you choose an_alternative payout method .
negative	the merchants with this restriction in place are shown below ***
negative	that is every merchant ( topcashback '_s clients , not mine ), i have purchased from for every payment type .. except i can get some from lovetoshop vouchers , which in past i was denied using in four stores listed on voucher ... why would i want these ?
negative	you also have to sign up and provide profiling data to them to get a card ... so they can spam .
negative	still owed £_00 . 00 according to topcashback , but i still_haven_'_t been paid any cash ?
negative	definitely not no . 0 cashback site .
negative	just want to be paid so i can close account .
negative	this company is very cheeky and quite rude .
negative	firstly , they claimed cheapest online price of £_000 for artisan kitchenaid stand_mixer .
negative	but when you visit the site , it is very difficult to locate actual prices , unless looking at each colour individually .
negative	lots of vague from prices .
negative	so i sent query which received a response following_morning , at which point i created an account selected my item at £_000 , and went to transfer money to my payment card .
negative	i was referred by quidco cashback offering 0 %.
negative	when i returned less_than 00_hrs_later , all prices had been changed and my basket selection price also increased from £_000 to £_000 !
negative	after 0 emails , and no sign of them wanting or needing my business .. i left their site .
negative	but happily placed my order with harts of sturs , and received exactly_what i wanted stunning service with £_00 free gift , free 0 day shipping ... and a 00 no_quibble return guarantee .
negative	ordered friday , my kitchenaid artisan mixer arrived today :)
negative	reading thru ' some of the lessor reviews for go - electrical ...
negative	they demand returns within 0_days for online sales .... could be a breach of distance_selling regulations .
negative	very glad , i didn_'_t buy from this site .
negative	today , i emailed all the board of directors of sportsdirect .
negative	in principle the site and store is a great idea , unfortunately not run by people for customers .. with too many expectations they fail to meet .
negative	i have slipped in their store , due to debris in isles of the poorly managed store in norwich .
negative	staff were unhappy , unhelpful and made mistakes , refused to open additional registers , leading to long unnecessary lines .
negative	there was a constant fear of something falling on you .
negative	wheeled cages of stock everywhere , even blocking access to the elevator .
negative	it was dirty and unclean .
negative	a mess .
negative	my online order worth more than £_000 , arrived in good time , but poorly packaged , dirty and damaged .
negative	it looked like it had been spilt and swept up , or just left for people to walk over .
negative	the box was barely taped and very weak .
negative	00 contact attempts later , emails , web contact forms and several phone_calls , including a message left on voicemail of dave forsey ... without response i spoke to the receptionist carol at head_office .
negative	i am far from happy with this company , my credit_card will action a section 00 or chargeback on the 0st oct_0000 .
negative	the delivery driver signed a statement saying the package was received in without examining and poor condition .
negative	one shoe , was sent .
negative	00_% was dirty , damaged , with a size 00 footprint on the item and box .
negative	shop with caution , the reviews tell the story ... wish i '_d seen these before .
negative	since violet have changed site and web_site big problem i placed an order on the internet and arranged for delivery by royal_mail after 0 dags nothing arrived rang violet to find they had sent my order to my previous address but still billed me at my new address .
negative	the people at my old address say they gave not received the item and royal_mail say the parcel has_been delivered so i an left to pay a bill for something i '_ve not received when contacting violet they said it was because my old address had not been delegated off their web_site so they can not take_responsibility funny how they have previously sent orders to my new address not happy will not use violet again
negative	bought some apparel from online store , and upon_checking on the parcel for more than 00 times i really had it with the last update ... ' 00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 courier to re - attempt ' - reattempt to what .... deliver ?
negative	my house is right next to the reception ; where all parcels arrive .
negative	and unless you are telling_me that my receptionist took off for the day ; there is no way that you cannot deliver the parcel !
negative	please ... after all the bad_reviews you lot are still not going to look for ways to improve your service ???
negative	- shocking .
negative	don_'_t do what you don_'_t wish upon yourself ... think - how you feel if you are on the waiting end ?
negative	!
negative	i am not hard to please , when i get what i ask for i am usually fine .
negative	i ordered 0 iphones from tmobile , and twice they mess the orders up .
negative	for the first order , they sent me a wrong sim .
negative	and the customer service girl on the helpline told me the fastest way was to get to a nearest tmobile store and pick_up replacement sim at £_00 !
negative	to this customer service girl - seriously you need re - training !
negative	why would i pay again for something that they should have sent correctly in the first place .
negative	oh , one more thing , no apology whatsoever !
negative	0nd order , my phone was switched with another customer and only found out when i log on the site to check my account online , that i received the wrong sim - yes , again !
negative	and i had to wait another couple more days for the sim to arrive .
negative	one improvement was the 0nd time round , the customer service ( male ) was more empathetic and able to offer satisfactory solution .
negative	i wish tmobile look into their delivery department .
negative	there is no excuse for mucking orders up , especially to the same customer twice and i bet i am not the only one who had this experience !
negative	if your staff is not taking their job seriously , its time to get new ones because they are destroying your reputation .
negative	i emailed you from the states .
negative	my mother got her flowers 0_days early with no name card .
negative	thought i was buying full insurance_cover for hire_car but when arrived in uk got hit with a £_000 charge .
negative	not clear online .
negative	waste of time & money .
negative	gutted :(
negative	i booked 0_months_ago for my parents and myself and husband to travel to rome in june_0000 .
negative	unfortunately my father has_become too ill to travel .
negative	i contacted expedia and they said they could refund all the hotel costs but only a portion of the flights and they quoted an amount i would be refunded .
negative	on the strength of that , i gave my parents their money back .
negative	after waiting 00 weeks not for the refund , and after emailing them for the 00th time to find out what is going on , i just received an_email_saying they are only refunding a quarter of what they quoted .
negative	now i certainly can '_t go to my parents and say they owe me hundreds of pounds .....
negative	i can '_t afford to carry the cost as my husband is battling cancer and doesn_'_t work .
negative	i have two jobs to try and make ends_meet .
negative	do you think expedia care ????
negative	?
negative	no !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i am so angry and frustrated by this company but there doesn_'_t seem to be anyone who will take_responsibility for this .
negative	so many bad_reviews but they continue to rip us off .
negative	is there a governing body that can look into this ?
negative	:' o (
negative	i have forwarded my complaint to an ombudsman and a travel watch organisation , so fingers_crossed they can help .
negative	i was bought £_00 worth of vouchers as a birthday_present .
negative	with small children and a busy_life it wasn_'_t easy to get to the nearest shop which is quite some way away from where i live .
negative	when i got my vouchers out to go on a well earned shopping trip minus the kids , i found that they are only valid for 00 months .
negative	i called the company to explain only to be told that there was no way they were going to honour the vouchers .
negative	when i tried further to see if there was any room for manovre , all i got was ' my supervisor says no '
negative	well i say not to cath_kidston - is this really how this ' lovely english , good old_fashioned values ' retailer really wants to treat its loyal_customers ?
negative	i think that this is outragious - they have taken £_00 of my friends money and i have been robbed of an opportunity to purchase the 00th_birthday_present she intended me to have - shame on you cath_kidston !
negative	youe have lost a customer
negative	very easy to book parking but on the day still had to pay full price .
negative	on the plus_side , when i did contact them to complain , i got a quick response and fill refund .
negative	nevertheless could have done without the hassle .
negative	i first won items from 0st june , to date i have received about 00 items , i have won about 00 / 00 .
negative	i won a sony viao ( 0_months_ago ), this week , after several emails , they eventually tell me the item is no_longer in stock .
negative	they want to replace with a toshiba , they say this is an upgrade ( 0gb to 0gb ).
negative	after i refused , they replied stating this is in the terms & conditions that they can replace any item won with another and its not based on rrp , just an upgrade .
negative	does anyone know where i stand legally ?
negative	whenvever i find out that yodel are delivering my parcel ( of which i have many ) my heart sinks .
negative	on this occasion i received a text at 00 . 00am ( after everyone had left the house for work ) to say my parcel would be delivered within two_days .
negative	at 00 . 00pm i received another text to say they had tried to deliver and would try again the next_day .
negative	does yodel really expect anyone to sit in and not make a noise ( in case you miss the knock on the door ) for two_days ??
negative	[_external_reference_] can give you an_hour time_slot with previous warning , so why can '_t yodel ??
negative	i always leave a note on the door to say leave on the doorstep if no answer ( we are in a rural_area and our doorstep is very secure ) but only yodel are unable to carry out the customers wish '_s like their_competitors .
negative	i have no issue whatsoever with the delivery guys - they are always polite and understanding as to my frustration and i understand they have strict rules , but i do have a real issue with yodel as a company .
negative	suggestions - give the customer a one to two hour time_slot with adequate notice and if the customer indicates a safe drop_off point then allow that delivery to be made .
negative	on this occasion it was a pair of flip_flops that took two delivery attempts !
negative	potential_customers of yodel - please think very carefully before using yodel as your delivery source as it could have a damaging effect on customers future_purchases with you .
negative	rant_over !
negative	can i also add this is not the first issue with yodel and i '_m_sure it wont_be the last unless they start listening to what their customers want ........
negative	disappointed and would like my money refunded !
negative	!
negative	as the servic we received from you from the delivery to nailsworth was excellent .
negative	i would appreciate feedback and a response asap as am totallyl disappointed and don_'_t see why i should loose £_00 . 00 from your negligence as only a small_hamlet with not many houses .
negative	asked neighbours to know avail ????
negative	?
negative	check - in slow , staff unhelpful we got trapped between some lorries and staff did nothing to help .
negative	onboard - ferry was tired and smelt of diesel .
negative	self - service restaurant was very expensive and the food and coffee terrible .
negative	no problem with the product s ordered just what i wanted great on price , saying that the delivery time for a bread_bin and three cannister s took four_weeks if the products was not in stock when the order was placed this should have been made aware of .
negative	i brought a dualit food_processor several months_ago .
negative	just a few_weeks after purchase i tried to grate chocolate , but the motor made a loud noise , the bowl cracked and the lid flew off , i returned the item together with a detailed_explanation of what had happened and asked for a refund as i did not think that the quality was sturdy enough to perform the tasks i had purchased it for .
negative	the after sales returned it back to the manufacturer who offered to repair it for a charge !
negative	i insisted on a refund or replacement with another model and yet none of my subsequent_emails have been acknowledged let_alone answered .
negative	i am now out of pocket and have no machine !
negative	could have got it £_00 . 00 cheaper at jewsons
negative	grest waiting
negative	i would never shop_here again .
negative	i ordered flowers for next_day for my gran '_s 00th only to be emailed the following_day in the afternoon that they couldn_'_t do it .
negative	if i had known in the morning there would have been a chance to go to another company and get them delivered the same day .
negative	could be bought cheaper in argos and other stores so no not very happy
negative	found the link to their website through trivago listed at £_00 .
negative	the link let_me click " book " and enter all my details .
negative	then_proceeded to tell me the room was gone ( twin was showing as 0 available and double had " green " availability ) and when i ran another search the room was available again , this time at £_000 .
negative	look on their facebook_page and many have had trouble with hotels not having the reservation or them taking money twice from their account .
negative	stay away !
negative	i received a y - sus board for a samsung 00 " and the majority of the components on the board were faulty as informed by a professional tv technician .
negative	very bad considering all their items are ' supposed ' to be fully working and tested !
negative	have since had to repair to the y - sus board and the upper buffer as the board from flattvparts blew the buffer .
negative	my mobile contract is with talktalk have had limited service or none for 0_days .
negative	customer service do not have any idea when normal service will be resumed they told me i would just have to be patient !!!!!
negative	perhaps they will have to be patient for their payment !
negative	i was told yesterday that it '_s vodafone '_s fault as they share a network .
negative	when i asked how long before it would be back to normal i was told i had to contact vodafone to find out .
negative	i am so angry surely my contract is with talktalk and they should find out when it will be sorted when i said this i was told they could not contact vodafone it was up to me !!
negative	we have had similar problems with our broadband ( very slow speeds ) which was also with them .
negative	we cancelled and went to bt and have a much_better service .
negative	my advice would be steer_clear !!!
negative	!
negative	i had so much hassle with my first purchase i would never use again .
negative	my sister had the exact_same hassle .
negative	ended_up raising a claim through paypal for refund .
negative	app deleted .
negative	lesson_learnt .
negative	bought 0 doors on 00st_october which were delivered on 0th_november - 0 of which were fine .
negative	however , one door was damaged in transit on one corner and the same door was faulty on another corner with part of the door not glued up properly .
negative	door - deals are refusing to repair the damage or replace the door !!
negative	!
negative	so this is the complaint i have just sent them .
negative	i will post again re the rest of the story ... let '_s see if anyone will actually contact me and if the parcel will ever be collected
negative	dear_sir or madam ,
negative	i would like to complain_about the service i have received and am continuing to receive from your company re the above order .
negative	when i booked the delivery last thursday online it was booked for collection on friday .
negative	i organised someone to wait in all day on friday but no one came .
negative	over the weekend no one came either .
negative	on monday i found out how to contact your instant messanger help and was assured it was to be collected that day .
negative	you have guessed it no one came .
negative	on tuesday it had been deleted from your system and when i finally got through on the instant help i was told it would definitely be collected today .
negative	we have been waiting in all day and contacting your service only to find a card put through the door about 0pm - two of us were in the house and the bell did not ring .
negative	the name on the card is patricia and the number given is 00000000000 however the only facility is to send a text which has not been answered .
negative	all your online people keep doing is saying it will be rebooked for the next_day with no sense that this cannot go on forever and at some point complaints have to be escalated .
negative	i have finally_managed to get them to agree that a manager chloe will call me tomorrow but i need to get this parcel collected by someone_who is capable of ringing a doorbell .
negative	excuse me if i sound angry it is because i am .
negative	i hope that someone can contact me urgently on my mobile tomorrow to reassure_me that someone is aware of this problem and something is being done .
negative	i ordered flowers , paid_extra for same day delivery and they mysteriously seem to have disappeared .
negative	i '_ve been in touch via the " contact us " section on the website , but to no_avail .
negative	i '_ll not be wasting any more money / time on this company and will be informing my family and friends to avoid it like the plague .
negative	thanks , eflorist for taking my money and in return , delivering nothing .
negative	bought a pair of glasses including date and time of ordering transaction date : 0000 - 00 - 00 00 : 00 : 00 , i was contacted twice for sending my id documentation , when i did after i recieved only 0 email_saying i should recieve my item within 00 to 00 days but now its months gone and havent_recieved anything .... stay away from these fraudesters and rippers , never recommended simply if they dont get back within 00_hrs than i will be contacting my bank and send chargeback ..
negative	when in ny , for four months tried to top up and every time calling 000 freenumber , got the same message " have not enough founds to connect my call ", for four months calling the company to resolve this issue and nothing was ever done .
negative	the roaming rates are outrageous .
negative	i am_currently searching for another company to join .
negative	the worst experience of the service and money value !
negative	march 00th i have placed an order , same day delivery for march 00th , my mom '_s birthday , so i have chosen deluxe flower_arrangement , item called " gorgeous ", paid 00 £ at checkout .
negative	delivered bouquet was not at any closer look , then the one they advertise .
negative	it was a bunch of green with occasional tiny heads of a complete different flowers .
negative	also , the roses were not fresh and today all came off already .
negative	i did write to their company support email , because is the only florist company which does not provide a phone line , so if something_goes_wrong , like in my situation , the only you can relay on is their email , they don_'_t even care to check , as this morning the only answer to my emails of complain i got was this survey , asking for satisfactory review and five_star rate .
negative	this company is not to trust .
negative	by the way , i managed to buy some extra flowers at the wild heart , at liberty '_s and coated me 00 £ - gorgeous huge flower_arrangement !
negative	!
negative	disgusted with bt , over the passed 00 years we have had times when bt had to supply our telephone line and they have made our lives hell every since !
negative	00 years_ago i moved in with my partner who decided that we needed a telephone and internet access , we had everything plumbed in so to speak and off the line went no_issues until we got a bill for over_£_000 , it included a line fitting which we shouldn_'_t have paid and telephone_calls to numbers that we had never_heard of ... bt would not back down that the numbers were nothing to do with us and we had to pay the bill which took over 0 years !!!
negative	to sort_out , we then left bt ...... 0 years later we moved_into our current property , there was a telephone line here that bt stated was not in use , they came in and re - connected it ...
negative	it didn_'_t work , they then said that there was not a line to the property and connected a new one giving us a new area code ( which we told them was not in our area ), this line did not work it was the wrong area code !!!
negative	omg suprise_suprise !
negative	they then came in a did loads of checks and told us that we had changed something in the house that had corrupted the line !!! what !!
negative	!, they proceeded to fix it and gave_us another telephone_number , guess_what wrong area code !
negative	we had all the lines dissconnected as none of them were actually fed to our house ... ( my dad happens to be an ex bt manager and came round to look into what the hell was going on ) we went 0_months without a phone line but this wasn_'_t the issue ...
negative	i will_continue ....
negative	finally we managed to get them to connect to our local sub station giving us the correct area code , yay we had a phone line !
negative	after a month of using it the phone started to crackle and pop while we were on it , the internet was intermittent and to be honest it wasnt worth us having it , then we started getting bills for the dissconnected numbers and charges for call outs and dissconnection charges ... of course i went up the wall at them and everytime i phoned i got the line ' we are sorry for inconvenience_caused ' you guessed it foreign call_centres !
negative	they didnt have a clue why i was complaining , they couldn_'_t sort_out the bills and worse of all couldn_'_t sort_out the line issues as there wasn_'_t one apparantly this went on for a whole year until our contract finally expired and we were able to change supplier .
negative	as soon as we changed we got another bill telling us we had cancelled our contract early and owed a total of over_£_000 to bt for usage and dissconnection ..... we still have the original working number and all the paperwork to prove against the bills we were being sent ... its now been 0 0 / 0 years and our phone line and internet are great with our current_supplier ( not bt ) but bt are still trying to take us to court for money that they say is owed to them ...
negative	review closure .....
negative	complete incompetent staff from the call_centre to the engineers , they have no clue what they are doing and pass the buck on to their customers !!!
negative	!
negative	never again will i use them for anything !
negative	as if it takes this long .
negative	and my customer has no evidence that i '_ve even tried to send it .
negative	i '_ve been in tears trying to explain that it '_s not my fault .
negative	except it is .
negative	i chose my hermes .
negative	i suck
negative	seriously poor service .
negative	p0g knew this was important and they charged over_£_00 for next_day service .
negative	on tuesday .
negative	wasn_'_t collected until thursday and now on monday , it '_s still not their .
negative	their customer service staff have no clue .
negative	they are worse_than useless - the entire company !
negative	i ordered a samsung_galaxy_s0 on the 0th_dec expecting it to be here for my daughters xmas_present , after a number of calls and emails i still_havent had a answer to where it is , i feel i have been_scammed
negative	i was warned off vodafone from a friend for this exact reason ( that they always add additional_costs to your monthly_contract that you haven_'_t actually used !)
negative	i ignored it and thought they must have used them somehow because how can they just ' make up extra_charges ' but apparently they can .
negative	i just took out a monthly_contract for £_00 per_month for unlimited_calls and unlimited_texts but then got a bill for £_00 . 00 !
negative	this is not even possible as i have only used the phone for a total of 00mins and sent 0 texts , i haven_'_t used 0g at all or sent multi - media messages etc so it is literally impossible .
negative	vodafone are criminals
negative	i have contacted you twice_now and still_haven_'_t had a response .
negative	i have ordered 0 x 00g whole allspice more than a week_ago , still_haven_'_t received it .
negative	i had to order from somewhere_else .
negative	will not use you again .
negative	i am sorry but the first time i ordered from this company i had no_problems , but since then my additional order has not been received nor has the replacement .
negative	i feel that i '_ve contacted the company on several_occasions and i am being totally fobbed_off .
negative	as a result i have not cancelled the order and asked for a fully reimbursement .
negative	i ordered flowers for my mother '_s birthday to be delivered on her_birthday , 00 january .
negative	i received an_email notification stating that the flowers had been delivered .
negative	when i phoned my mother to wish her a happy birthday that evening i was absolutely disappointed ( to say the least !)
negative	to learn that my mother had not received the flowers !
negative	her address on your delivery notification email is correct ie 0 tan y bryn , nant peris , caernarfon , ll000uh , but ( even up to today ) she has not received her flowers ( plus birthday_cake which i also ordered and paid for ).
negative	in addition i was furious to learn that my mother had stayed in her house all day on her_birthday so that she could receive the flowers .
negative	so your failure to deliver the flowers had also ruined her special day !!
negative	in the past i have used next and interflora to deliver flowers and have never had any_problems with them .
negative	i request that you give me a full_refund .
negative	i am very disappointed , angry and embarrassed due to your incompetence .
negative	i shall be providing negative_feedback on your feedback form very soon and i will also warn my friends and family about your company and any ' flower delivery forums '.
negative	im very embarrassed about the whole situation and disappointed in your company .
negative	i feel i should have used next or interflora and not your company now .
negative	headphones never came after more than a month .
negative	emailed them 0 times in that month and recieved automated_replies telling_me to wait longer .
negative	finally , after 0_weeks_later , they said they '_ll send me a returns / refund form for my missing order within 00_hours .
negative	a week_later and i still_haven_'_t recieved this form !
negative	0_weeks in total wasted waiting and no headphones .
negative	the rest of the orders i '_ve made have taken longer_than a week or two to arrive .
negative	terrible service !
negative	use amazon !
negative	the quality of the materials they use is rather ... questionable .
negative	on one of the boots i bought , one of the hooks fell_off after one day .
negative	the buttons on the jacket i bought also falls off easily , and i '_ve had to sow them back into place !
negative	despite this , i '_m not too disappointed , because indeed , ' quality costs more ' and boohoo . com is one of the many who reinforce this creed .
negative	i '_d hope they would have prove me wrong though .
negative	i purchased these glasses on the 00th_feb and guess_what ....
negative	still_haven_'_t received them so i though i would send them an e_- mail to find out where my glasses were .
negative	they said that payment has never been sent and to re - sent the £_000 again !!!
negative	shocked !!
negative	lucky_enough i paid through paypal and have now opened a dispute .
negative	payment was sent and completed the day i placed the order .
negative	be very aware !!!
negative	scam !!!
negative	!
negative	.. despite email_confirmation !
negative	customer service dreadful - just automated_response .
negative	apart_from our frustration & expense , just feel sorry for mum for the disappointment .
negative	hoping iflorist will at_least respond , & then explain & resolve the issue .
negative	needless to say , will go direct to an_independent florist in future .
negative	i sent this company a parcel containing a combination of books and books with cd '_s all have been read / used once by myself .
negative	i accepted the trade - in price and they emailed to say that half of the order was missing content .
negative	so untrue , there response was rude and suggested i have made the mistake .
negative	i am_disgusted with this company and would recommend that you use a more established company .
negative	i have just bought a siemens washing_machine which went wrong on the third wash three_days after delivery .
negative	rang the gas_superstore who said they could not help or exchange the machine and i would have to go through siemens .
negative	i rang siemens who arranged for an engineer to come out with a three week wait time .
negative	the engineer came out today and found that the sensor valve was smashed and the radiator lose at the bottom of the drum which had not been fixed in properly .
negative	they are going to replace the machine and i should receive it in 00 to 00 days .
negative	i feel this amount of time to get such an essential household item repaired ( 0 to 0_weeks ) when it was brand_new is very poor service and that the gas_superstore should have replaced it straight_away .
negative	will not be buying from this company again or recommending it to others .
negative	i ordered one item on 0th_december which was in stock .
negative	it '_s now 00th_december ( 0_days_later ) and i still have not received my order or received any update or apologies from chemist_direct .
negative	i will not be using this company again .
negative	i could not get a hold of the person_who was assisting me .
negative	had to chase .
negative	didn_'_t get timely response .
negative	ended_up getting stuck with one item that i purchased without grounds for it .
negative	i was told that i cannot get my deposit back so i stuck to it but i really am not happy with all experience .
negative	i would not recommend this company .
negative	was sent a " rose & lily hand_tied ".
negative	looked nothing like the picture on the website .
negative	after two_days 0 out of 0 roses were dead .
negative	when i complained the company made an excuse that the flowers had been damage in transit and also stated that there was only minimal signs of any damage .
negative	think you need to get some new glasses .
negative	the company is now refusing to respond .
negative	don_'_t normally do reviews but this is shocking .
negative	save your money and buy somewhere_else .
negative	tried to use item but the volume is extremely low .
negative	i have to find points on my feet so it is not an acceptable level .
negative	having now showed my physiotherapist she thinks i should return the item as she could not hear where the tone changed to know where the correct position was to action acupuncture .
negative	still_waiting for ' yodel ' to deliver , so i am less_than happy with their service .
negative	usually your delivery is excellent but on this occasion it has not been , so i will have to consider getting my supplies from someone_who employs a better courier service .
negative	ordered a gerbera bouquet on 0th_feb for delivery on 0th_feb .
negative	bouquet was for a dear_friend '_s 00st_birthday .
negative	the flowers were not delivered on the 0th .
negative	i communicated via online " chat " on 0th towards the end of day , was informed they would be delivered by 0pm .
negative	they were not .
negative	i then communicated via chat again on the 0th asking where they were .
negative	was informed there had been a problem with the delivery van , but that they would be delivered today , and was given a £ 0 voucher_code as an_apology .
negative	my friend has just called to say the flowers have been delivered ... and they are dead , leaves all dropped_off and whole_thing squashed .
negative	how horrible , embarrassing and sad .
negative	she is taking a photo of them for me so i can take it up with iflorist .
negative	this was the first time i have used them ( usually use interflora ), and very definitely the last .
negative	do not use this company if you want a reliable service .
negative	i am so disappointed .
negative	site claims same day or next_day delivery .
negative	ordered thursday_evening told delivery would be saturday .
negative	now sunday can '_t get through to speak to anyone on the phone and still no flowers !!!!
negative	as delivery was for mother in law in hospital complete_waste of time as she was back home saturday_night !
negative	i had a very bad_experience with this company .
negative	no one was there to greet me when i arrived and their telephone_lines were busy .
negative	i called over and over to find out when they were arriving for me and could get no answer .
negative	in the end i had to leave or miss my flight .
negative	had to leave my car in short_stay car_park which i then had to pay for on return .
negative	the company are now refusing to refund me what i paid them despite not giving me any service .
negative	maybe if it goes_smoothly they are great but what makes a good company is how they treat you when there is a problem .
negative	i am very cross about the service .
negative	terrible people .
negative	never buy from them again .
negative	would not reccomend to anyone shopping with them .
negative	paid for the tyres in_advance , when they came to fit them they said they couldn_'_t do then & left
negative	the goods are thrown around the vans - signed for or not they just leave goods on the door_step .
negative	£_000 worth of bike equipment - left on my door_step for 0 hours without a signature .
negative	the worst in the uk - 00 orders placed .
negative	not 0 was 000_% correct .
negative	the last lot drove_off with my wine .... that was after arriving 0 hours late .
negative	i would avoid at all costs .
negative	you can complain and get a £ 0 . 00 voucher off the next order ... which will be wrong anyway ,,.,,
negative	utter cr * p
negative	the flowers were not what i expected the picture shows a completely_different view of the flowers .
negative	i have returned the costume as it did not fit .
negative	i would not have kept it even if it did .
negative	the price does not reflect the quality at all , the hat was so squashed it didnt resemble a hat , the belt and corset were so cheap looking as were the leggings .
negative	the blouse and jacket were ok , although the jacket was badly_creased .
negative	very disappointed as in the picture the costume looks amazing , obviously too good to be true !
negative	i do not have a problem with service but the one star reflects the quality and value for money .
negative	item ordered , money taken , item not received .
negative	no communication
negative	i bought a ring and wet look leggings online last_week .
negative	i received them in the post and immediately noticed a two holes in the leggings when i tired them on .
negative	the ring was fine but i wore it out and it broke at the end of the night !
negative	very very bad quality .
negative	disappointing i didn_'_t even get to wear the leggings due to the holes .
negative	very disappointed !
negative	flowers were left at an empty house in the garden and neither myself or the recipient were notified .
negative	i received an_email_saying the flowers had been delivered which was clearly not the case .
negative	she was away on a small holiday and i didn_'_t know .
negative	she returned and the flowers had withered away .
negative	they completely went to waste and i wasted a lot of money .
negative	i have tried to get a refund but have been told it could be about 00 days which is outrageous .
negative	" enormously disappointing .
negative	i placed a considerable order with digitalrev , paying through paypal .
negative	the next_day i received an_email " confirming ' that my order had " successfully " been cancelled .
negative	no explanation was given so i checked the website and saw again that it had simply been cancelled .
negative	i thought i must have cancelled it in error by clicking the wrong link so placed the order again , again paying through paypal .
negative	the order was confirmed but then half an_hour later i received a second email_telling_me that my order had been cancelled .
negative	again there was no explanation .
negative	this time i found a contact number and called customer_services who told me it had been cancelled because they had been unable to link me to my address .
negative	they needed me to send them various forms of id etc and then if i passed their checks i would be able to place another order .
negative	now , i don_'_t mind them conducting security_checks at all ; i think that '_s a good thing and in everybody '_s interest but i do mind very much their cavalier attitude_towards my custom as well as my time and energy .
negative	if they need more information , is it too much to expect that they would contact me and ask for it instead of just cancelling my order with no explanation ?
negative	i order a huge number of products online both from the uk and overseas and have never encountered this before .
negative	i was paying through paypal and both billing and shipping addresses are paypal verified and have been used on numerous_occasions .
negative	as i say , it is not the security_checks that bother me , it is their extraordinarily dismissive attitude_towards someone_who is simply trying to buy their products ."
negative	only 0 out of ghe 0 items ordered have arrived .
negative	annoyed as why let customers order them if they are not available ?
negative	even more annoyed as these are rant to be for my dad '_s birthday and one of the items still_hasn_'_t arrived .
negative	rubbish customer service as i don_'_t want emails saying still no stock , either refund or let the customer chose an_alternative !
negative	total_rip_off
negative	they charged me £_00 to book two cheap ryan_air flights
negative	they came up first on google
negative	do not use this company
negative	i could have done it myself on the ryan_air website
negative	i was unimpressed with the quality of the curtains i bought .
negative	they were stiff & didnt hang correctly , nothing short of washing them in comfort every day for a week would have helped .
negative	( but they are dry clean only )
negative	the material was inferior , cheap & nasty .
negative	there is an unpleasant odour to the curtains !!!
negative	!
negative	tried febreeze , but the odour must have been ingrained in the material .
negative	very unhappy with my purchase .
negative	your glow in the dark_pink lenses were not glow in the dark and my red cat eyes split as soon as i put them in : ( made me and my sister annoyed as this was the main part of our outfit !
negative	will not be recommending you im_afraid .
negative	my flowers and my mom flowers was dryed up and then won_'_t even way i saw the picture my mom was died before out the box and send new set i wasn_'_t happy on mother day bc my flowers was dry some died i will never order from this company again
negative	very disappointing .
negative	how disappointed and sad i was the brilliant colour flowers i ordered as an additional tribute for my mother '_s funeral did not arrive .
negative	to add_insult to injury serenata have just sent me an_email and text_message to tell me my mother '_s flowers have just been delivered to the funeral home .
negative	seranta did not even have the decency to reply to any emails i sent more than 0_weeks_ago .
negative	i certainly will not be using them again , and will not recommend to any friends or family .
negative	poor show serenata
negative	i ordered a bunch of flowers for my mother on mothering_sunday ...
negative	they were nothing like what i ordered and i paid_extra for a large bunch and to me it was a small bunch .
negative	i am fuming because i ordered from what i fort was a professional florist and i paid more for their services .
negative	to be honest i could of got better in my local_supermarket for cheaper !!
negative	!
negative	not a good company at all ....!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered item , given a predicted delivery date which came and went , waited an extra two_weeks and still nothing , requested a refund , received a reply_stating i would get a refund " soon ", waited again for two_weeks + and not received anything .
negative	complete_waste of time , will not use again ( only given one star as i had to !)
negative	i did not like this perfume and my husband suggested that igive it to a charity_shop .
negative	however , i offered it ti my much younger , hairdresser who was delighted .
negative	i will stick to my original perla .
negative	this company have absolutly no after sales support .... i purchased helium_balloons and a helium cylinder and it was the biggest mistake i made in years ........ after just half an_hour the balloons started to drop and within an_hour they were all on the floor ... i called partyrama and asked for help and advice to be told there was nothing they could do as they did not do a same day delivery and that i was to blame even if they could deliver i would have to pay for a new cylinder because i should of inflated the balloons at the party not at home hours before .... just as well i did do them at home can you imagin the embarrasment of helium_balloons on the floor at the party ..... i suggest you stay clear of this company ... i will never use them ever again ......
negative	i bought a personalised plate as a christening present and was very disappointed at the poor quality .
negative	the first thing i noticed was how inadequately it had been packaged .
negative	it was covered with a flimsy piece of tissue_paper , with a thin piece of bubble_wrap over .
negative	the plate measures 0 inches across and the piece of bubble_wrap measured 00 inches by 00 inches and barely covered the plate .
negative	the box it came in was also too deep and with so little packaging it '_s a wonder it arrived intact .
negative	the next thing i noticed was how dirty it was , it was covered with a thick layer of dust and i had to wash it .
negative	there are also indentations in the glazing on the reverse side of the plate .
negative	the writing underneath the main picture is also very faint and unless you are right next to it you would struggle to read it .
negative	if it was hung on a wall you certainly wouldn_'_t be able to read it from any distance .
negative	as it is a personalised item the company doesn_'_t accept returns .
negative	i will never be buying anything_else from this company again .
negative	i have tried to leave a review on getting personal '_s own website , but they have not published it , probably because it is such a poor review .
negative	so beware , they only seem to publish good reviews .
negative	ordered christmas_gifts from them , money taken from my account immediately , no goods have arrived .
negative	tried to email got a response stating the email could not be delivered , tried to phone got a message_stating the number was unavailable .
negative	will never order online again ..... i am gutted , have lost money i have worked hard for all year .........:(
negative	sorry but trip proved to be very costly . dfds offer cut price deals when booking eg . 0 for 0 then hike prices up onboard no good for me and my friends .
negative	unacceptable , substandard , inferior plants not worth the money .
negative	sole function of customer service is to refuse any responsibility and to refuse refunds and / or exchanges .
negative	my package is £ 0 . 0 / month , was also been charged_£ 0 . 0 account charges every_month for not using direct_debit , there is nowhere see i have to pay by direct_debit or have to pay this charges , this a cheating , also the speedy payment is a scam , received email bill at 0 :_00pm today , tried to pay 00 : 00 , it was to late for this speedy payment , what a wonderful service !!
negative	!
negative	i did not recieve my £_00 pound wellies as the courier left them with a " neighbour " who just happened to live 00 doors away from me . no card was put through my door to say parcel had been left at the house 00 doors away .. and that is no exaggeration . when called customer service they told me there was nothing they would do as had been left with neighbour .. although i did not permit them to do so .
negative	currently seeking_legal_advice to see if anything i can do .
negative	we ordered a simple car part online , selecting the ' collect at branch ' option , and my husband made two_separate trips to collect the part where each time he was belittled and informed that he must be confused , as the order would be delivered .
negative	online service = good , ability to collect part from depot = very , very poor ...
negative	... i will now have to make a third trip to collect the part , which i hope will resolve the ridiculous situation .
negative	i could have ordered from a competitor and had the situation resolved by now .
negative	gsf fail .
negative	i booked tickets back in september_0000 for pink in dublin on 00th_april_0000 .
negative	had a phone_call thursday 0th_april saying the 0 tickets i had purchased costing me a total of £_000 . 00 were now not availible as the seller did not have them to sell !
negative	offered alternative standing tickets with £_00 . 00 refund , obviously you would not pay this sort of money for standing tickets .
negative	as we are due to go next friday with flights and hotel booked and paid for , as well as time booked off work .
negative	you have no chance of getting tickets elsewhere , told viagogo we wanted a full_refund they seemed very reluctant to send confirmation of cancellation .
negative	very quick to take your money , not so quick to give it back disgusting .
negative	arranged for a dolls_house i had bought for my 0 year_old daughter for christmas to be delivered by parcel0go on 00th_november , here is a summary of the sequence of events
negative	it was collected on 00th_november
negative	i requested and was given a delivery date twice , and arranged to stay home from 0am to 0pm , but the the parcel did not show up
negative	i contacted the parcel0 go call_centre on friday 0rd_december expressing my concern that the parcel has not arrived .
negative	i then called and emailed on several_occasions and despite_being told my concern was being dealt_with i received a disappointing response to my concerns .
negative	on monday 0th_december i received conflicting emails from parcel0go , one asking me to submit a claim because the dolls_house may be lost / damaged ( didnt say which ) and one saying the dolls_house should be on its way !
negative	to be on the safe side i completed and returned the claims_form on monday 0th_december - in line with the deadlines , although i stated i did not know what had happened to the parcel , as noone had confirmed
negative	on thursday 0th_december i received an_email_confirming that the dolls_house was on its way
negative	on friday 00th_december , the delivery man arrived with the parcel .
negative	he confirmed he had refused to deliver this for over a week as it was damaged and advised me not to accept delivery .
negative	i took his advice and he took the parcel away .
negative	i then updated my claims_form and resubmitted , as i now had confirmation on what had happened to the dolls_house
negative	i then received an_email today from the claims_department stating my claim was outside the timescales and had been rejected .
negative	it completely_ignored the fact that :
negative	a ) the original claims_form was completed in line with the timescales
negative	b ) despite repeatedly contacting the company , i was not ever advised what had happened to the parcel , i only found out on friday 00th_december , over two_weeks from ordering
negative	c ) i only found out that the parcel was damaged on friday 00th - and at this point updated my claims_form
negative	i would assume that the deadline for submitting damaged claims , assumes that the person receives the parcel in line with the 0 - 0 day delivery commitment , this clearly did not happen in my case .
negative	i have found the whole_experience of using parcel0go very very stressful , upsetting , time_consuming and costly .
negative	i am a working mother with 0 small children and cannot commit all of this time to trying to resolve this .
negative	i have been trying to escalate my complaint within the company , and despite_emailing and calling on several_occasions i am just ignored .
negative	the whole_experience has_been very upsetting

negative	i traded an iphone0c with cex on saturday for a lumia 0000 which was faulty so i took it back on sunday as no other way to contact them , they offered me a replacement phone coming from s different shop , said it would be delivered tues / wed well post has_been and no phone also i dont have any receipts as the blackpool shop kept them i need someone to ring me or im contacting the police as im out of pocket to the tune of £_000 this is just stupid no way of getting intouch other than having to go into_town to the shop , getting the feeling i have been ripped_off big time i have given them until_0pm today to contact me or im going to have the iphone blocked
negative	spent 00_minutes in carphone_warehouse in blackpool bought the gemini tablet online before xmas for a gift less_than a month later packs up customer service say take it back to your local_store which i did today guess_what cos its out of 00 days cant get money back but if an item is faulty by law under the sale of goods_act im entitled to a refund ,, noooo not at carphone stand around and wait while staff yawn , text , mess with their phones , then told we have to send it away for repair , but wait ( another 00_mins ) we dont repair that tablet we replace it ,,, but i dont want a replacement as its crap and will break again , well thats our policy and thats all were offering , well i want to speak to manager cos under the sale of goods_act , remember that ::::::: all goods must be :
negative	as_described
negative	of satisfactory quality and
negative	fit for purpose
negative	if they ' re not , the retailer is in breach of contract and you have a claim under the sale of goods_act .
negative	well i wait a bit more to speak to the man in charge only to be told we can only offer a replacement ,, oh and now the same tablet is cheaper and to add_insult to injury you dont get the difference back in what you paid and what we now sell it at ,,,,, so i now have same tablet but for more money plus i know it will be going back cos its rubbish and will break again , so i came home made a complaint to their customer service department on the phone but she was reading from the same script ,,,, lesson to be learned , if your buying from them they cant do enough for you , in - between the yawns and the texting their mates , but if you want to take back a faulty item take a flask and a blanket cos you will be there a while , and dont expect them to adhere to the law cos its not there policy ,,,,,, the end ( well for now anyway )
negative	do not use the company - this is a freud .
negative	i ordered batteries which i did received but they didn_'_t work at all .
negative	i tried to contact the seller but he was taking long to reply and kept apologizing and asking what was wrong .
negative	i contacted paypal but they said the only way i would get my money back was to send the product back to the seller - which is in china .
negative	till trying to resolve it with paypal i had no clue that the batteries came from china as the website domain co . uk - suggests it '_s uk company .
negative	the seller said he would refund my money - but i never got it back .
negative	i kept contacting him for a month or more and each time he would say : sorry i will refund your money .
negative	but i never got it back .
negative	it '_s been 0 - 0_months now .
negative	do not use this company !
negative	i hope the website gets closed somehow !
negative	terrible experience !
negative	ordered a washing_machine 0_weeks_ago !
negative	it still has not arrived !
negative	i have been constantly_fobbed_off by the sales_staff !
negative	to top the whole ordeal off they tryed to deliver the washing_machine on thursday but forgot to put it on the delivery van !
negative	actually turned_up at the house without the washing_machine !
negative	i am now 00 weeks_pregnant and have been without a washing_machine for 0_weeks because of this company !
negative	i wish i had gone to john_lewis who all actually stock the same washing but £_00 cheaper !
negative	will i ever get this washer ?
negative	who_knows ?
negative	where do i begin in january this year me and my husband decided wed like a change from the car we had a chevrolet kalos which we also purchased from stoneacre and said we never would again after the problems we had with the kalos anyway we thought wed try them again what a mistake they couldnt do us a deal on what we wanted so the salesman phoned us up the following_day said hed found us a nice car that he could do us a deal on so off we went to look at it it was a renault_megane it was lovely so we bought it what a mistake the car went in about 0 times first time it was just little things like heater control and a few bulbs didnt work when the car was repaired we picked it up only to find that the mechanics had damaged the centre console so it went back to have a new one fitted got the car back again had it a few_days and the gearbox started having problems so the car went back to be repaired again this continued for the next 0 month in the end finance and stoneacre decided we could change the car to a fiat_panda low and behold this has_been a nightmare in and out of stoneacres for repairs only had the car 0_months and its been in for repair 0 times already to which there saying they cant find anything wrong with it but we get it back and the following_day the problem starts again we paid for a life time guarantee on the megane only to find out we had to pay another life time guarantee when we got the panda bearing in mind we only had the megane 0_months i just dont_think this is fair why couldnt they have transferred the guarantee from the megane onto the panda for goodwill but no they wont they have ended costing us more money because the panda was less money than the megane the situation now is were so fed_up because they now want us to take the car in and let the mechanic have it a few_days to see if the problem_occurs while in his hands or they will buy the car back for a reduced price of what we paid for it we are now looking elsewhere as the problem is still persisting all we want is a car we can_rely_on dont_think weve been treated fair at all
negative	the order didn_'_t arrive when it should have they said that a delivery had been attempted but no delivery note was left !
negative	delivery was then promised for today and once again the order has not arrived .
negative	i am pregnant and have ordered items to ease the pain i am feeling at the moment , so having expected said items on thursday the longer i wait the more uncomfortable i am getting .
negative	needless to say i am unhappy which upsets me as i do not like to leave bad_reviews .
negative	hopefully this can be sorted and i can the .
negative	revise my review .
negative	regards
negative	i '_ve_used interparcel this week for the first time for two parcel and i can say it will be the last !
negative	first parcel sent arrived damaged and difficult to deal with them to report they don_'_t speak just everything via_email and what they want as proof is ridiculous .
negative	the second parcel sent the following_day has_gone_missing it would appear , i gave there ref_number and they don_'_t know !
negative	again same story can '_t talk will email you !
negative	this is not good enough i '_ve paid for a service its there job to provide it !
negative	now i '_m left not knowing if parcel has arrived or not .
negative	don_'_t use
negative	hi
negative	i bought 0 for 0 inks for my kodak esp0000 & have just used a compatible from you & the picture is all red & white stripes down faces .
negative	it worked_fine with the kodaks .
negative	i also phoned you after i had sent in my order to say i didn_'_t realize that i had to put in a code for the 0 for 0 offer so i paid full price .
negative	the gent i talked to said it would come off my next order but i don_'_t have an account with you as i paid through amazon so can find nothing from you .
negative	order no .
negative	000 - 0000000 - 0000000 , this is the second time i have sent this as no answer from you by email
negative	i wear_contacts on a regular_basis and these contacts hurt my eyes .
negative	they were not the colour i expected
negative	please_avoid this company like the plague !!!
negative	ordered a acer tablet for my sons xmas_present , they sent a email setting out the dispatch time and delivery times , as this time ( 0_days ) passed i then emailed for find out what was happening , but just received an_automated_reply , i then read the reviews on the company and started to panic !!
negative	lots of people were or had been in my boat .
negative	eventually got through to their customer_services agents , what a joke that is !!
negative	cancelled the order and was promised a full_refund within 0_days , 0_days and numerous_emails later i am still_waiting !!!
negative	what a shame they can offer very competitive_prices but their customer_services badly lets them down .
negative	avoid !
negative	!
negative	because i can '_t even get a response from their so called customer service team .
negative	i placed an order for two items - syringes and melolin pads ( basic medical items ).
negative	got an_email the following_day saying part of the order was out of stock .
negative	tried to call cs - on hold for ages so thought i would email .
negative	the link in the email didn_'_t work and the email address it was sent from said it was an unmonitored one - but it was the same email address given to contact the sales / cs_team .
negative	i eventually got sent a link to a ticket that had been opened on 00 . 00 . 00 morning and i have asked three_times since then whether the order has_been cancelled as i requested .
negative	no response in 00_hours and their online_chat is a total_joke .
negative	after four minutes it logged out of the chat box and an_email template popped_up .
negative	how this company makes money is a wonder .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	if a medical company can '_t stock something as basic as a syringe , there '_s no hope .
negative	ordered a next working day delivery item for my holiday and specifically made arrangements to be in to receive it and then get an_email from evans telling_me that they have kindly refunded my delivery charge because this useless bunch of &^%^&$ can '_t even do their jobs - and not for the first time either .
negative	i '_ve told evans i won_'_t be shopping with them again and if i see a delivery service that offers hermes as the courier , then i won_'_t bother .
negative	i wish there was an offer of zero_stars as that '_s all this shambles of a company is worth .
negative	i notice the website for this company is ' under maintenance '.
negative	i hope this means it will no_longer be used to take orders and money for furniture which will never be delivered or refunded .
negative	i have been appalled to keep reading_reviews from others like me who are considerably out of pocket because of the unfair trading practices of the owner of this company .
negative	i placed an order on 00st november which i thought would be plenty of time for christmas .
negative	nothing turned_up after 0_weeks so i emailed them .
negative	they replied to my first email and said the order had been dispatched and was probably delayed .
negative	gave them the benefit of the doubt and left it another week .
negative	still nothing arrived so i emailed them again ( no contact number available and the live_chat doesn_'_t work ).
negative	after a few more days they hadn_'_t replied so i raised a dispute through paypal .
negative	they put a reply on the paypal_dispute pretty quickly but it was quite rude , no apology just the standard ' this has_been dispatched , we will investigate , we still give you the chance to cancel this dispute etc etc '.
negative	they contacted me again today through paypal saying ' please confirm you have received the goods ' - sorry , all i can confirm is that i '_ve paid £_00 for absolutely nothing !
negative	don_'_t order from these people !
negative	!
negative	the ordering process was very unclear since the website states they have stock and the managers in the company are unaware of stock_levels saying that they did not have it in stock at the time of purchase , but they had stock now so i would need to reorder again , he was unaware of how to cancel and order or even send anything out .
negative	i wasted time , money and energy with this site for a pair of boots that cost over_£_000 .
negative	i would rather go to another company or better still buy something_else .
negative	the service is completely unhelpful , rude and incompetent .
negative	would not shop_here again nor recommend to anyone .
negative	day 0 : 0 . 00am ordered flowers for same day delivery to office address ( 0 . 00am email_confirmation of order ).
negative	0pm delivery promised - £ 0 . 00 paid + £_00 for flowers .
negative	0pm - no flowers .
negative	email to customer service ......... nothing .
negative	0pm leaves office with no flowers , having to stop at some florist to get flowers !!
negative	another £_00 spend .
negative	next evening reply from customer service that flowers had been delivered to security who had promised to see i got the flowers the next_day , as flowers delivered at 0 . 00pm .
negative	wrote back and told customer service and demanding a full_refund as non - delivery is breech of contract .
negative	of course have not heard_anything back for 0_days ..........
negative	summary : don_'_t waste your time and money on same day delivery as it will become an expensive mistake as i ended_up paying nearly_£_00 for flowers in total .
negative	never in my life experienced_such bad service or poor attitude .
negative	buy anywhere_else and don_'_t trust the reviews - they are very selected and does not give a true picture .
negative	these flowers were ordered for my daughter ( her own daughter was getting_married in australia ).
negative	we did not find these flowers until 0 . 00 p . m .
negative	the courier had put in a distant garage but no note posted through letter_box informing of this .
negative	the flowers , although varieties were as shown in serenata picture , there were so few of them and the greenery was virtually non_existent .. as for the actual arrangement , nothing like the picture which is what i thought i would get - wrong .
negative	i have raised a complaint with serenata , awaiting reply .
negative	sorry but i cannot recommend this company , i feel very let_down , after recommendation , which was an important time in our family .
negative	they took my money and even_though i kept asking for the tickets they cancelled the day before .
negative	these were tickets i had bought for my son and husband as a present .
negative	they were extremely rude to me when i rang them and hung_up on me .
negative	had to fight to get my money back .
negative	only when my bank intervened did this happen .
negative	i was left_feeling stressed and angry and stupid for having let myself fall for such a scam .
negative	didn_'_t receive my item .
negative	then have now got to send a claim_form by post to france ( at my cost !! )
negative	to receive a refund , they also want a photo id which i don_'_t understand_why this will b needed !!
negative	!
negative	i order flowers for delivery all the time as we don_'_t live in the uk and this is the first time i am using prestige and it will be my last .
negative	i had ordered a bouquet of flowers for mother '_s day to be delivered on mother '_s day ( when else would i want flowers to be delivered on mother '_s day ) and i recall paying extra for delivery cost for the service given it is for delivery on mother '_s day and it was a sunday .
negative	the order was placed about 0_days before delivery .
negative	no flowers were delivered on mother '_s day .
negative	i wrote an_email to the company on sunday_night .
negative	i received a response on monday_morning ( today ), a day after mother '_s day , explaining how it is written in the terms and condition that they do not guarantee delivery on the day you want because they use third_party delivery service ( that is royal_mail ), reasons could be due to traffic , remote_location etc - they apologized but they is nothing they can do .
negative	they didn_'_t offer a refund nor a holding response that they would check with royal_mail .
negative	the flowers were delivered one day late , today noon .
negative	the mail delivery officer informed that they do not do deliveries on sundays so whether there was traffic or not the flowers would not be delivered on sunday in the first place !
negative	i wrote them another mail demanding a refund .
negative	they wrote back saying they do not do refund unless it is 0_days late again citing they do joy guarantee delivery on the day you pay for in their terms and conditions .
negative	terms and conditions are the fine print to cover their liabilities .
negative	this very one defeats the entire purpose of customers paying extra for flowers and extra for delivery cost on special_occasions such as mother '_s day when the flowers you order for your special ones do not get delivered till past that date .
negative	imagine ordering flowers for funeral which are delivered late !
negative	the flowers that eventually arrived look a lot smaller_than what was shown in the pictures and the flowers are so dry and are half_dead .
negative	my mother had to throw half away .
negative	never again will i order flowers from them again .
negative	i booked a flight 0_weeks_ago with bravofly , within 0 / 0 hour i realised i had made a mistake with the time so phoned and cancelled the booking .
negative	i was told ' no problem ' we will refund you asap but will be charged 00_euros for admin .
negative	ok i said , that was acceptable even_though i had already been charged_£_00 ( 0 % for using credit_card )
negative	i have phoned 0 times_now , ( calls are to switzerland ) each time i am told the refund is being_processed .
negative	i have phoned the airline ( united airlines ) who have told me the flight was never charged to bravofly .......
negative	so basically they have had my money for 0_weeks now , not had to pay for anything at all .
negative	i have now put a claim into my credit_card company to get a refund .
negative	i know it was my fault with the time mistake , but it does not take this long to rectify a problem .
negative	it '_s a front for collecting money .
negative	we also had a call where they volunteered to take the details from another website and gave_us a cheap offer .
negative	we never had an enquiry as a result and they then took a full subscription from my credit_card for the following year .
negative	if you do try and use the website to find a property the only search_criteria is by country !
negative	absolutely useless .
negative	who is goint to trawl pages of properties until the find the odd one or two that meet their criteria .
negative	doesn_'_t bode well if you are listed on page 00 !
negative	!
negative	stay away from these
negative	purchased 0 eyeshadow palettes from crown_brush , when i received the palettes the colors aren_'_t as vibrant as they were on the website so i decided to contact crown_brush to return this item .
negative	i paid for special delivery to return the palettes , one of the palette packaging has a slight tear ( half inch ).
negative	i was contact by abi who told me they couldn_'_t give me a refund but can offer me a partial_refund or return the palettes back to me .
negative	the eyeshadow were untouched , the issue was the tiny tear line on the packaging .
negative	they returned the palettes back without reaching a solution with me and i am very disgusted with the way they handled this matter .
negative	having spent £_00 . 00 , they offered a partial_refund for products that came back used ???
negative	i have never_experienced_such unprofessional service before .
negative	as a beauty writer i purchase items for review for a monthly publication and this is a big shame crown_brush !!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered some prot - col products on 00th_june it '_s now september and still no goods and no refund .
negative	i have read some of the other reviews and the so special sales_team appears to write the same standard emails to everyone as a way of a delaying tactic .
negative	i just do not know how the can continue to trade .
negative	if you ask for a refund they email back saying that my order was just about to be sent but they have stopped it in case i want a refund .
negative	so you say send the order in the slight hope that they will do the decent thing and actually send it , but no nothing and so it goes on .
negative	i have sent 00 emails and still nothing .
negative	so .
negative	so specials sales ( not ) just refund my £_00 . 00 .
negative	my order number is on this review so you have all my details .
negative	this is by far the worst company i have ever dealt_with .
negative	delivery time agreed with order not met , flowers still not delivered on the following_day .
negative	iflorist say flowers have been delivered when this is not the case , i can only_assume they have been delivered to wrong_address .
negative	vey poor customer service - no phone number only an online_chat service which is not always available .
negative	do not use this company they will let you down .
negative	bei buchen eines fluges inkl .
negative	hotel für amstersdam ist uns ein fehler beim erfassen des datums unterlaufen .
negative	nach 0 minuten haben wir dies per email an ebookers mitgeteilt und_die buchung storniert .
negative	wurde nicht akzeptiert und wir mussten die vollen hotelkosten übernehmen , gemäss agb .
negative	aber wer liest schon die ganzen agb '_s .
negative	ein unkostenbeitrag wäre akzeptabel aber nicht fr .
negative	000 .-- für ein hotel das wir nicht brauchten und auch nicht ändern konnten .
negative	fazit , wir werden keine buchungen mehr bei ebookers tätigen , sondern bei einem anderen anbieter , der die richtlinien nicht so straff hat und innerhalb 00 stunden eine umbuchung vorgenommen werden kann .
negative	dessen hat es viele im internet , das ist ein learning gewesen wenn auch ein teures .
negative	der flug konnte umgebucht werden das war nicht das problem nicht aber das hotel , wie oben erwähnt .. bei abklärungen mit dem hotel wurde uns mitgeteilt , dass das hotel keine entschädigung erhält sondern alles zu gunsten von ebookerst geht .
negative	kundenfreundlich , nein nicht wirklich , zeitgemäss nein auch nicht .
negative	very disappointed the flowers look nothing like the picture on the website .
negative	dont use a complete_waste of £_00 !
negative	embrassed that i sent these flowers as a present it made me look cheap !
negative	the picture had all different_types of flowers in the bouquet but all that arrived was cheap carnations .
negative	the flowers were sent by my sister and me in appreciation of the kindness to her of my late mother '_s neighbours .
negative	they were sent to the complex in which she lived to be on the table in the communal lounge .
negative	i called in today and was bitterly_disappointed in the quality , quantity and arrangement .
negative	i could have done better myself with flowers from tesco and paid less_than half the £_00 . 00 i paid eflorist for flowers and delivery .
negative	what i saw today bore_no_resemblance to the illustration on the website .
negative	never again .
negative	this company is absolutely atrocious , the customer service team are in desperate_need training , however i must_say the parts replacement team are in a different league they are professional it '_s a shame there apart of the whole company .
negative	i ordered the four door ibiza wardrobe which had several parts_missing , and two months to resolve .
negative	i literally had yodel and very on speed dial trying track where my order was .
negative	excuses i received , yodel delivered to the wrong warehouse , oh it has not been dispatched as yet .
negative	someone didn_'_t order the replacement items .
negative	never ending stories .
negative	then i had a knock at my door at 0am which was yodel , shockingly out of order as they are meant to call and arrange the appointment and 0am , really !!!
negative	my family were sleeping and they woke_up my neighbors too .
negative	i also ordered the five chester drawer too which looked nice but not secure at all .
negative	waste of money .
negative	there delivery team yodel which used to be home network delivery are the worst company to ever hit britain .
negative	i will be writing a firm letter to trading_standards as they are negligent of a million things absolutely incompetent the customer service team are the worst i really would not blame the drivers at all .
negative	everyone stick too next and marks and spencers they are more_expensive but have high_standards in both customer service and items .
negative	i received notification that i had a parcel to collect at the post_office because it hadn_'_t had its postage fully paid .
negative	i had to pay £ 0 postage to find out who the parcel was from .
negative	on opening the parcel i was disappointed with the quality of the product as i couldn [ t open quite a few of the drawers .
negative	i made an order and over a month later i still have not received it .
negative	the company are not prepared to do anything to investigate , refund or replace until 00 days after dispatch .
negative	very dissatisfied .
negative	not only did they lose my suitcase , but even with a luggage receipt they could not tell me where my suitcase was or when i was likely to get it back .
negative	i explained i was only in st_tropez for 0_days and that i had no clothing / toiletries with me .
negative	my suitcase arrived the next_day and i received a call saying i would have to pick it up from nice airport - st_tropez is 0 hrs from there .
negative	nearly all other_airlines will deliver your case to you if they lose it but not jet 0 .
negative	so it was up to me to make a return trip and lose a full day of my holiday .
negative	in addition i was not compensated for the cost of this trip .
negative	when i arrived at the airport i found my suitcase was damaged and is no_longer usable - it was brand_new .
negative	i wrote a letter of complaint when i got home asking to be reimbursed for the expense and the response was ' no chance '!
negative	i would never fly with them again and i would strongly_recommend avoiding this airline at all costs .
negative	went on booked delivery .
negative	paid via_paypal took my money but did not book my collection .
negative	had to call to rectify = 00p a minute on the phone 00_minutes !
negative	the flowers were not what we were expecting .
negative	so pleased we got to see them before giving them as gifts as they didnt look anything like the picture on the internet .
negative	the aftercare staff are no help what so ever , i booked a car with rentalcars . com was told everything was covered , when i got to my desination i was chanrged another 000_euros , i have tried to call customer service and was told i had to email them , i received an_email back to be told they would contact me again within 00 days , very poor service do not use them unless you want to be ripped_off
negative	terrible service , tried to cancel my contract because of the terrible service , and extorsionate bills .
negative	got landed with a big cancellation bill , wich i offered to pay at a monthly rate
negative	( emailed and rang ) but they totally_ignored me and have now sent balliffs round to collect !!
negative	unreal
negative	tired of ripped - off garages and tried at halford mot center , at hendon , i couldn . t not believe they are worse_than i so called ripped_off local_garages .
negative	please_avoid the halford mot nd service centers .
negative	appauling customer service
negative	you don_'_t do what you said
negative	absolutely awful service !
negative	i '_ve ordered 0 bunches of flowers through them and 0 just didn_'_t turn_up !
negative	when it happened the first time i thought it must have been a rare mistake and accepted the refund .
negative	i then ordered 0 separate bunches of flowers this week and again 0 bunch just hasn_'_t arrived .
negative	i '_ve just waited 00_minutes on their customer service line with no one answering .
negative	i then emailed their customer service email address , just to get an_email back saying my email would not be picked_up and to full out a form on their website instead !
negative	terrible customer experience !
negative	!
negative	i ordered items from this company on 00 / 0 /_0000 .
negative	i received an_email with a tracking_number which stated that the items would be delivered in 0 to 0 working_days ( before the 0nd_july ).
negative	i phoned the company on 00 / 0 /_0000 to get an update only to be told that the item was out of stock and had been when i ordered it .
negative	i told them that this was not the case as i had booked tradesmen in around the delivery date and that i most certainly would not have ordered out of stock items .
negative	i was then told that there had been problems with their website .
negative	i asked to speak to a manager but hey_ho that would take 00hrs .
negative	i asked why was this ?
negative	did their managers not come into work ?
negative	i was told they were always in a meeting .
negative	this company are taking people '_s money for goods they do not have in stock .
negative	i will be informing the trading_standards people about this .
negative	needless to say i have asked for a refund which i am told will take 0 week .
negative	meantime i will now have to go and buy my goods elsewhere , which i wish i had done in the first place .
negative	if you have to pay a booking_fee every time you book a room with hostelworld , additional to the 00_% deposit they charge in_advance , the minimum you can expect is that as they advertise , their bookings are 000_% guarantee .
negative	unfortunately , this is far from happening !!!
negative	earlier in may my family and i found ourselves without a place where to stay on our first night in tel aviv .
negative	i raised the claim through their website and that was all i knew about them .
negative	they have completely_ignored my claim and what is worst they haven_'_t even care to remove the property - yarden sea side apartments from the system , to avoid other people to get into the same situation i was in .
negative	it is clear that despite all the fees , that other_websites don_'_t charge , the guarantee of their bookings is a matter of luck !
negative	at the beginning of february i ordered an urgently_needed twin pushchair for my grandchildren and chose kiddisave because their web_site stated the item was in stock and they use express delivery .
negative	i waited a week and nothing arrived so sent them an_email asking for an_approximate delivery date .
negative	the email went_unanswered .
negative	i tried several_times to contact them by phone and on the one occasion they answered it i was immediately cut_off .
negative	i sent a further email with my phone number which also went_unanswered .
negative	after several more attempts on the phone i finally got to speak to customer_services who told me that the item was not in stock despite their web_site stating that it was and that the item would not be in stock until the end of february .
negative	adding on delivery time meant that i would not receive the goods until march .
negative	i told the assistant that i would have to cancel the order in that case as i needed to order it urgently from somewhere_else and she told me that i would not receive a refund for about 00 days despite the fact that they took the payment from my account the day after i ordered it .
negative	i find this absolutely_appalling as i can '_t order another one until i receive the refund .
negative	kiddisave need to get their act_together and be honest about what is in stock and what isn_'_t .
negative	don_'_t they realise that baby goods are very often urgently_needed ?
negative	they also need to improve their customer service by answering emails and at_least answering phone_calls .
negative	i would not recommend this store to anyone .
negative	whenever i buy anything online i dread it when i see the word yodel as the courier .
negative	in short , terrible network_coverage , terrible pushy rude and sometimes unintelligable customer service from call_centre and nearly_impossible to get unlock_code and pac codes from .
negative	thanks 0 - i have been without a mobile for a week !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a blue lagoon for my grandmothers_birthday and upgraded it to medium so it appeared exactly as on the website .
negative	sadly it looks nothing like it , theses are simply flowers i could '_ve bought from the supermarket , in fact the supermarket ones look better .
negative	no florist has ever been near the ' bouquet ' i bought , someone in a warehouse threw this together .
negative	customer service says ' it '_s the same as the one what you ordered '.. professional outfit this is not .
negative	also , do not trust all of the good reviews , things are not as they seem , go to moneysavingsupermarket for genuine feedback .
negative	go to a local_florist , they deliver beautiful genuine hand_tied bouquets for roughly the same price .
negative	avoid prestige_flowers !
negative	flowers took 0_months to arrive and they were for a special_occasion !
negative	!
negative	i recommend this company to a friend after buying our ottoman base from them .
negative	she ordered an ottoman base and mattress .
negative	both were confirmed for delivery but only the base arrived at 00 . 00 .
negative	my friend was advised to ring the company but they had shut at 0000 .
negative	my friend is 00 and spent the night in the chair .
negative	she rang the following_morning and was advised that 0 other mattresses had been mislaid but they would get back to her .
negative	she rang again at lunch_time and was advised the mattress had gone to another warehouse but would be delivered the following_tuesday due to the easter_weekend .
negative	needless to say she asked for her money back and we sourced a mattress locally .
negative	dispatched quickly arrived_safely .
negative	let_down by mobile tyre_fitting unit and the follow on customer service was totally_unacceptable .
negative	will not use this company for any of it '_s services in the future .
negative	purchased bulbs and within minutes of them being fitted in two different lamps , one exploded and one blew .
negative	tried for an age to ring you eventually gsve up and emailed only to be told , return pick_up would be £_00 . 00 .
negative	disgusting lack of customer_care .
negative	rickshaw_travel outsourced the ' mai chau hill tribes ' tour in vietnam from ' queen '_s travel '.
negative	let '_s just say our tour_guide was not what we '_d hoped for .
negative	we found him uninterested and lazy , often ignoring us to talk to other vietnamese tourguides or locals .
negative	the itinerary described by rickshaw was not identical to the one we actually recieved , and the itinerary wasn_'_t even met by our tour_guide !
negative	we were left_stranded for a whole afternoon while our tour_guide slept .
negative	there is also a show which you can pay extra for - myself and my partner were almost forced to pay an extortionate_amount for this show , which my partner and i refused to pay .
negative	and yet again , we were stranded by our tour_guide who stayed and watched the show for free .
negative	upon our dissappointment we expressed our great dissapointment in both queen '_s travel and to rickshaw_travel with no prevail .
negative	completely and utterly let_down .
negative	and we definately paid well over the odds for the experience we had .
negative	poor administration with prices quoted online different to those invoiced .
negative	they think this is ok but nice little_earner when you submiot diofferent accounts tothe vat man !
negative	products are good but customer service is terrible .
negative	i ordered a golf_bag for a 00th_birthday_present a week before the special day .
negative	i had to write to them on the day itslef to find they could not deliver before 0rd nov .
negative	since an initial good natured exchange of emails they have totally failed to respond to any enquiry by email or phone despite having taken the money for the gift over 0_weeks_ago .
negative	they don_'_t seem to know what the meaning of customer service or communication is
negative	the item bush freeview recorder itself turns on but the remote is not a bush one and does not work the unit , got in touch with the store via_email they said many appologies etc and would arrange_collection .
negative	over 00 days_later still have item and they do not respond to the three emails i have sent , now want my money back .
negative	emailed them again today asking if there is anyone there alive still and so far no response , so can only guess they all comatosed and unable to read emails .
negative	really horrid .....
negative	the texture has the density of a car tyre , and is as chewy as molten rubber , and the taste is a mixture of yoghurty , chocolatey ( but only slightly ), burnt egg white .
negative	i '_m willing to eat stuff that tastes and feels really nasty if the nutritional benefits are there , but this thing not only weighs half a tonne , it has more than 000_calories in it !
negative	it might have lots of protein and fibre , but surely i '_d be better off eating a banana ?
negative	in fact i '_d probably fair better eating a banana dipped in chocolate sauce to be honest !
negative	sorry , but this is a case of tear up the recipe and start again .
negative	staff were impolite at every level
negative	would never use again
negative	i found the site messy and not at all user_friendly .
negative	there was no final confirmation screen and i had to click around to check i had the correct times and flights .
negative	as soon as i confirmed the booking i realised i had used my married name whereas my maiden_name is still on my passport .
negative	i immediately phoned the customer service number - the girl i spoke to has such a strong_accent communication was difficult .
negative	she went off to check on this several_times and ratyher than putting me on hold i could hear her muttering away to herself .
negative	she made me feel as if the error was totally my fault and showed no empathy .
negative	i finished the conversation without a solution and feeling frustrated .
negative	after all the ads on tv and saying it was best supermarket blahblah thought_id try out aldi paisley ( fulbar road ) scotland for the family shop .
negative	going round the products are good , good range of choices for a cheaper supermaket , even a few brand_names .
negative	however , get to the checkout and lets say service with a smile isnt their thing .
negative	woman sat like a robot , didnt offer to help even_though struggling with a toddler .
negative	was sighing as things started to pile up at one side .
negative	i hadnt even finished paying and she was scanning the next persons products .
negative	she was on to the next after that before i had my bags up .
negative	and just so you know i wasnt going like a wee old lady , i was actually getting things together pretty fast .
negative	i will not be shopping here again , ever .
negative	if people worked like that in any other supermarket they '_d be sacked .
negative	horrible dire faced woman .
negative	now off to check sellby dates on stuff after_reading_reviews .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	00rd_jan_0000 :
negative	still no refund , in now ... 00 days :-(
negative	seller has now lied to paypal about the delivery of this item ( despite providing photographic and email evidence to the contrary to me )
negative	-----------------------------------------------
negative	this is now a police matter .
negative	------------------------------------------------
negative	please , for your_own sake , be very careful about dealing_with this company .
negative	they will take you money , not deliver the goods and then lie about it .
negative	luckily my paypal_account is backed_up with my mastercard , which means they have refunded my £_000 and will retrieve it from them via their protection procedures .
negative	you may not be so lucky if yours is linked to your bank or your debit_card !
negative	*************************************************************************************************
negative	0th_january_0000 : further update on my review :
negative	today is the 0th of january .
negative	i have still not had my refund ( held since 00th_december ) from fireplaces0life . co . uk .
negative	i am still out of pocket by £_000 and both mastercard and paypal are now involved .
negative	the seller is now claiming to have delivered the item , when you can see from his email below that that he had already accepted that was not the case !)
negative	please do not give this dishonest individual any more business as you cannot trust him to deliver the goods or refund your money .
negative	this detail will stay on trust_pilot and other review sites until i receive my refund for goods not delivered to us .
negative	00th_dec_0000 : update on my earlier review :
negative	although this may end up ultimately costing me the £_000 this unscrupulous seller has kept of my money , i feel strongly that people should be warned about the practices of this undividual and this company .
negative	below is the text of an_email received from [_name_removed_] of fireplaces0life today ( 00th_december ) a full 00 days after he was notified of the non - delivery of my order .
negative	i will leave it up to you to decide if this is someone you would want to do_business with ?!
negative	?
negative	' from : [_name_removed_]
negative	to : gillian coyle
negative	i can ensure a refund will be done however the trust_pilot review will need to changed to from a negative to a positive '.
negative	my original review :
negative	i have just spent a very unpleasant week and a half ( all over christmas ) chasing for my £_000 refund for a fire which the courier company , who not only didn_'_t tell us they were delivering ( as arranged in_advance ) they then left_outside our block of 00 flats while we were away overnight on business .
negative	despite the fact we were not to blame , i was made to feel_guilty about the fact the company ' could not claim the courier and would be out of pocket ' and to add_insult to injury , my emails were ignored when requesting my refund .
negative	i have had to raise a dispute with paypal and then escalate to a claim and still_haven_'_t had my money back ( 00 days_later ) which also means i have had to pay my full mastercard bill with this on it or face a full month '_s interest ( about £_00 ).
negative	not at all happy !
negative	buy at your_own_risk from mr [_name_removed ].
negative	he has not treated me fairly or honestly .
negative	i happen to see the flowers that were sent , the same day and was really not impressed .
negative	0 - 0 roses with some cheap filler , the recipient was not impressed either !
negative	i found them really disappointing .
negative	jag_är jättebesviken på buketten jag fick !
negative	jag valde lyx bukett på websidan , den dyraste men buketten jag fick var så liten jag undrar hur små de billigare buketterna var !!
negative	buketten såg dessutom ruffsig och " untidy ", den såg ut som den_var satt ihop av en amatör !
negative	inte vad jag väntat mig när_jag beställde " lyx "!
negative	i have had many items delivered from yodel and they are awful , its a shame the companies that use them don_'_t stop their contracts !!
negative	i have many an item just slung over my fence and in to the back garden even_though i have complained on several_occassions .
negative	i was very lucky that one of my purchases wasn_'_t broken as the packaging was extreamly damaged ......!
negative	!
negative	i completed the online forms no problem with that very easy to complete , then i waited in my house for the whole day sitting on front step as was a nice day ( sunny ) no sign of any city_link van at anytime through out the day , so tracked my parcel and they claimed that they called at 00 . 00 today !!
negative	which is a total lie .. not happy about this service ..
negative	now experienced 0nd attempted delivery from yodel .
negative	first was a few_weeks_ago with a product ordered from joules .
negative	terms for delivery was that i had to be there to sign for it - like most people if i '_m ordering online i '_m probably working and don_'_t have time to go to stores hence wasnt in when yodel tried to deliver .
negative	not a problem - i can collect from their depot .
negative	problem was no depot info on delivery card and no info either on website .
negative	called them and person i spoke to was very helpful ( and embarrassed about how far i '_d have to travel to collect from their depot ) but ok have to accept .
negative	now waiting for another parcel that so happens to be carried by yodel - forego how bad there website is - cant_remember the depot collection opening times !
negative	basic info !
negative	all i vaguely remember is that it wasn_'_t good for people who work " normal " office hours - if i didnt work office hours i '_d probably have been in to sign for my parcel .
negative	service just doesnt work !
negative	won_'_t order from any company if i know they will be using yodel to dispatch .
negative	good web_site and range of products ( not just pine furniture ) - shame no capability to ammend orders on website as customer serivce is terrible .
negative	still pursuing trying to change an order made on 0th_march , contacted same day 0 times to try and change .
negative	advised finally that it had been changed and that i would receive confirmation .
negative	contacted again few_days_later , still not acknowledged order change , sent email to confirm - no response .
negative	further call today , 0_days before delivery due , still reflecting original wrong order .
negative	finally they call me back and say it was changed on the 00th_march and i was emailed but sent to . co . uk rather_than . com - just checked and either domain works so now feel not only poor customer service but tells lies as well !!
negative	!
negative	very frustrating - terrible customer service , don_'_t call back , can '_t handle straightforward changes and appear to lie !!
negative	!
negative	i contacted customer service about a problem and the response was unsatisfactory .
negative	i emailed straight back but received no reply .
negative	i will not be ordering from them again .
negative	we have recently come_back from a weeks holiday in mallorca .
negative	we used holidayautos . co . uk as they seemed reasonable , especially as we were getting a bigger_than normal car .
negative	when we got there , firstly it was difficult to locate the transfer car that was taking us to the car_hire location .
negative	we had to call them in the end .
negative	when we got there the queue for the car_hire was horrendous .
negative	thankfully we had someone there to occupy our 0 young kids ( 0 & 0 ) otherwise it would have been a nightmare .
negative	we queued for an_hour and then got to the desk .
negative	the person we had to sort_out the car did not have good enough english ( admittedly would have liked to have spanish but i don_'_t ).
negative	he did not understand enough so we left there really disappointed as there was no discussion from anyone about because of the delay we will give you the next level car instead as customer service .
negative	all their costs are hidden and when we add them up they are not far from hertz / europcar etc and less hassle .
negative	we will never ever go with them again !
negative	when we arrived at our accommodation someone saw that we had an ok rent a car and they had a 0 hour wait so we did get off lightly but they will need to get their acts together as they won_'_t survive the summer rush .
negative	i am now on the phone to scottish_power again !!!
negative	!
negative	i have now waited over 00_mins so far and have not got through .
negative	they say are " currently dealing_with high call volumes and will be with me soon " if not they say they will ring you back if you leave your number but they do not .
negative	they do not even answer your emails .
negative	they used to be so good and i changed all my rental_properties over to them to only find now , that you can never get through to them !!
negative	i want to move the whole lot to a new company but which is the best for customer service ?
negative	i just want to be able to get through to someone and discuss any_issues , is that too much to ask ?
negative	scottish_power get your act_together or loose a whole load of customers !
negative	just edited review : it took me 00_mins to get through !
negative	having bought clarins from a clarins outlet previously , when i bought from allbeauty . com my suspicions were raised .
negative	i contacted clarins and they informed me that they do not supply this company and the only way i can buy the product i bought is in the clarins website .
negative	i ordered 0 separate_orders in the space of 0_days .
negative	the delivery timescales stated 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	one order arrived after 0_weeks .
negative	the other 0 orders worth £_00 have never arrived .
negative	i chased after 0 . 0_weeks of ordering to be told they would resend items and they would be with me in 0 working_days , 0 . 0_weeks_later still no delivery .
negative	i tried to call again , no answer on phones and was transferred to a squeaky fax_machine sound .
negative	i have spent £_00 and got nothing for it - really knocked my trust in this company .
negative	glad i didnt go_ahead and order all of my tiles which i was intending to do !
negative	i orderded fake_tan at the end of may .
negative	had not recieved it a week_later , i e_- mailed them to ask how long it would take , was told item out of stock , getting more in next week .
negative	so i decided to wait .
negative	nothing came , they said there had been some_confusion , they didnt think i wanted it any more ( they didnt think to refund me tho ).
negative	i told them i wanted it and they told me they would send it out straight_away .
negative	00th of june now !!!
negative	i e_- mailed , they said its out of stock again !!!
negative	do i want to wait_until the end of the week ?
negative	i said no , refund my money immediately .
negative	0st_july , do i still want the order ?
negative	i said no again , refund my money or i will inform trading_standards .
negative	they asked for me to give 00 days , ive waited another 00 days and still no refund !!!
negative	avoid this company at all costs !!!
negative	!
negative	i received an_email_saying my delivery had arrived .
negative	it never got to the address !!
negative	!
negative	i am most disappointed .
negative	hiya
negative	my fault not realising it was between 0 - 0 for delivery but needed it before half 0 felt like i was not being helped waited 0 n half hours for call back and that you '_s can '_t ring the van_driver to check isn_'_t very good .
negative	flowers very small and deceiving some had already died .
negative	on box a note says please knock hard i did not select that and overall was very disappointed and won_'_t be using again
negative	i ordered my halloween_outfit for my halloween / housewarming .
negative	my delivery date was before 00th .
negative	so come 00th when my delivery hasn_'_t been i called the customer service .
negative	was told my outfit had been delivered but as i wasn_'_t in it went to the royal_mail sorting_office .
negative	however when i went the sorting_office the customer service told me .
negative	no parcel .
negative	called back the customer service and was told they could send it out but i wouldn_'_t get it until 0 th .
negative	i had to demand a refund was soo not happy .
negative	on 00th_november_0000 i bough an acrylic knife_block ( 0 piece ) but it wasn_'_t suitable to my knifes .
negative	i contacted the company by email and victoria ( costumer service ) replied to me saying to return the item via a recorded delivery ( it was recommended in case the item got lost ) and also to forward a copy of the recorded tracking_number to them via_email .
negative	i sent everything as asked in the same week and according to the post_office website , procook received the item on 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	since this day , i have been chasing procook be refunded and nothing until now .
negative	i '_m not happy at all with the situation .
negative	0_months have already gone and nothing .
negative	i bought a wowcher for a full head of human_hair_extensions in march .
negative	i contacted the salon and arranged an_appointment for a consultation , which i attended .
negative	i arranged an_appointment for 0_weeks_later to have a full head of micro loop extensions fitted .
negative	on the day of the appointment i was 00_minutes late due to an accident on the motorway .
negative	thank god !!!
negative	i was told i couldn_'_t have my extensions fitted as i was so late and would have to rearrange .
negative	i was asked what sort of extensions i was having and when i said micro loops i was told they didn_'_t do these anymore and i '_d have to either have them glued or sewn in .
negative	i don_'_t want either of these methods due to the damage they do to your hair which is why i bought a deal for the micro loops .
negative	i contacted wowcher for a refund 0_weeks_ago and the only response i have received is a copy of the email they sent to the salon 0_days_later .
negative	i contacted them again last_week to ask for some indication of when they issue might be resolved and i '_ve heard_nothing .
negative	i '_ve emailed them this morning with ' trust ' as the subject , but as yet i have no reply .
negative	i am really disappointed with the level of customer service .
negative	i ordered a space heater and it came with half the insides broken , then sent this back for a replacement and it was the same one with still everything broken , now waiting for a refund and will not shop with them again !
negative	when i cancelled return part of ticket they calculated a mean refund .
negative	it should have been refunded within 00 days .
negative	it '_s almost 000 days and still have not been paid !
negative	have emailed and complained and still no response .
negative	won_'_t be using them again .
negative	my land line has_been off for 0 week now and still no sign of it being fixed despite a promise that it would be done yesterday at the latest .
negative	cant speak to anyone at bt as i have no phone !
negative	!
negative	would be nice to know what the problem is and when it will be sorted .
negative	sue nicholas
negative	when you arrive on time or within about ten_minutes ryanair play this awful fanfare ... talk about blowing your_own trumpet .
negative	i guess you get what you pay for !
negative	that '_s why i '_ve since flown with easyjet or monarch !
negative	despite allowing any resolution images to be loaded that look brilliant on the screen there is no quality control at goodprint so my business_cards came to me blurry on one side and fab on the other !
negative	i even had a comment from goodprint twitter saying my design was fab surely at that point someone could have said ' hey the resolution isn_'_t quite right are you sure you want to continue ?'
negative	when i contacted customer service i was fed a line and not offered any support or encouragement to use the service again !
negative	- thank_you for your response goodprint , i was not advised on this offer at the time of my phonecall , had i been i would have felt a lot less let_down by your company .
negative	i have since had my cards printed elsewhere but i do appreciate the response .
negative	tried to order from vet_medic and set_up an account .
negative	unfortunately i chose to pay by paypal which had an old email address associated with it , they took this to be my address which i think it a very flawed way to do_business .
negative	thus i did not receive emails when they queried my order , amongst the problems ( generated by them ) was the fact that the image of my vet prescription did not upload .
negative	i definitely uploaded this when i ordered and inotice other people have had the same problem .
negative	despite this , they took the money from my account and made no further effort to contact me , even_though they could have worked out the email address they used did not match the email and account details i provided .
negative	i complained and when we go to the bottom of the misunderstanding i asked them for an_apology - told on the phone they had nothing to apologise for .
negative	i also found they were rude and defensive , everything was my fault rather_than theirs !
negative	i asked for a refund which they promptly processed .
negative	i will never order from vet -_medic again , best avoided if you appreciate good customer service and politeness when things go_wrong !
negative	the tyres were due to be delivered and put on at my house , the first delivery was cancelled , then the second day ( agreed by myself ) noone phoned to confirm they were coming , and no tyres showed up .
negative	i love this shop and buy a lot in - store however , the last three_times i have tried to order online , i have had confirmation of my order and then nothing - no email , no delivery !
negative	when chased , they have replied to say they will not be fulfilling my order and , under their t & c , they are not obliged to say why .
negative	i have tried to pursue this and find out what the problem is but they just ignore my emails .... no idea why the online store doesn_'_t want my business but i think it '_s a poor way to treat a good customer .
negative	will take my business elsewhere !
negative	just recieved information from the hotel i booked with budgetplaces . com that they had been booked up for over a month !!!
negative	i now have to find another hotel , and battle to get my deposit back !
negative	!
negative	had to reschedule delivery as missed it the first time .
negative	tried to speak to someone to get a time window for delivery but gave up on the queue .
negative	delivery came when i was out . fortunately driver read my message and called me . arranged for him to leave my package at our village post_office .
negative	i ordered two dog gates and dpd was the company set to deliver .
negative	i had to go out and left my daughter to sign for the delivery .
negative	just 0 mile from home on a narrow lane i waved down the dpd driver and told him that we lived down a narrow dirt_track and he would be wise to reverse down and stop as the track starts to go down_hill as many van '_s have got stuck before .
negative	the driver totally_ignored my advice and drove down .
negative	he then spent 0 hours waiting for someone to get him out of the hole he made with his constant trying to drive out .
negative	cost to us was the repair of the track .
negative	i wrote to dpd but was totally_ignored .
negative	my only saving_grace was that he won_'_t do it again .
negative	fool !
negative	if you care anything about the environment then don_'_t order with this company .
negative	i ordered just 0 drontil worming_tablets for my dogs , the 0 small tablet that could have been sent in a small jiffy_bag was instead sent in a cardboard_box 00cm x_00cm and packed out with paper - totally irresponsible and when i email with my concerns all they returned with was they charge £ 0 . 00 for all orders under_£_00 .
negative	i '_m ashamed that i played a part in this environmental nightmare .
negative	very uncaring company and bad mannered .
negative	no_problems with booking , dropping_off and picking_up the car , a great service , make travel easy with 0 small children .
negative	then we drove out of the airport and realised the petrol tank was empty , it had been a quarter full at drop_off and dried coffee all over the dashboard from a spillage .
negative	stressful journey to nearest petrol_station .
negative	made a complaint , got a response asking for further information , then heard no more .
negative	disgusting unhelpful service .
negative	no flowers received despite the fact they claim it was delivered .
negative	thanks for making my moms mothers_day .
negative	not .
negative	really disappointed
negative	i ordered a pack of0000 ( 0x00 ") poly_bags to put on my avon brochures as part of my business .
negative	when i recieved my package the box was very battered , looked like it had been thown around the warehouse for 00 years but i thought it wouldnt matter because it would just be the outer_packaging and my 0000 bags would be in another box / dispenser but how wrong i was - upon_opening the battered box the bags were just loose inside and most of them were creased and folded in places as if someone and just got a bunch of bags and just chucked them in - there didnt even look as if there were a 0000 there .
negative	as my avon brochure is my shop window i dont want to put creased bags on my brochures as it creates a bad impression .
negative	i felt i had to keep this substandand product as the item is very heavy and to send it back would of cost at_least £_00 without packaging costs so would have been out of pocket for a lot of money . so i am forced to keep a useless product but i will never order from these people again and would encouage all of you to stear clear of rajapack if you dont want a useless product that you cant use !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	just had shopping delivered and yes part of it has not arrived again .
negative	this time i made the poor delivery guy check what was missing ie 0 items not a happy_bunny what is it with asda they can '_t get any delivery right .
negative	so i ’_m waiting for a call back as if that ’_s all i have to do is wait around .
negative	the last delivery was the same and it took two_weeks to get the goods i had ordered plus numerous_calls .
negative	no apology from the store , no gratitude gift for the length of time it took but at_least they had taken my money .
negative	then we go to the subs none hay_fever tabs none sent but they stated they has subbed it where .
negative	richmond thick sausages they sent richmond ’_s skinless thin .
negative	lwenbru beer sent tubor crap beer .
negative	i ’_m defo not a happy shopper maybe time to change provider i ’_m sick of no apologises and the fact the mess up so often .
negative	once or twice in a year is poor but nearly every shop is total unacceptable now i know what it means by cheap is not always the best .
negative	sorry this is so long but to highlight the comedy of errors i have to endure and to ensure you know how bad the company is i have added what all happened me and what i did .

negative	good evening ,
negative	rather_than phone you yet again about the order i have just received , i have e_- mailed you .
negative	i received my order ( num removed ).
negative	as usual we have had substitutes and yet again they have not been amended as ordered this is getting a regular_occurrence .
negative	this time we ordered 0x 00cl x 00 lowenbru original lager total bottles 00
negative	we received 0 x 0x00cl lowenbru original lager and 00 0x00cl pernoi lager total bottles 00 ( please_note i had put lowenbru original beer on the original e_- mail and had not changed the substitute as pernoi ).
negative	price was the same but quantity less by 0 boxes of 0 .
negative	so i have paid the same for less this meaning i have ended_up paying the same for a lesser_amount this is not what your substitute service offer states .
negative	i have only just started to check the amount spent to quantity since i had lenor delivered and realise later the amount i paid i was a nearly a litre down on quantity .
negative	also where is the 0x0lt bacardi that i ordered is clearly on your delivery notice but hasn ’_t been delivered , i have received the glava and bushmills but no bacaardi ?
negative	we purchased these items when there on special and in this case to put away for xmas .
negative	so by giving me the money back it in three or four days this is not suitable as your offer may have expired .
negative	how can so many errors be made every time ?
negative	do i have to check the whole delivery on arrival before the driver leaves this is ridiculous i am not happy as you can_imagine .
negative	i ’_m_sure you have a list of various other errors i have phoned about before that is why i have chosen to write so as to keep a log of errors .
negative	as i have no_intention of sitting on the phone for ages to clear this matter up again , costing me more money and time please either contact me on my home line ( tel num removed ) or by return e_- mail .
negative	my preference in this matter would be for you to deliver the items as i did pay for them and for a full delivery service anyway .
negative	thank_you
negative	called customer service team on wednesday 00 : 00 was told they had called the store and they would be in touch with me .
negative	i accepted this as except the call within the next 00_hours .
negative	called the customer service team on friday 00 : 00 was told they had rung the store on thursday and spoke to ( name_removed ) who was to ring me .
negative	i have not had any call back from tony or the customer service team to tell me what was happening .
negative	i asked to speak with the supervisor as was not happy regarding the period of time it has taken to sort this bearing in mind we have paid for the said goods .
negative	( name_removed ) stated after a few_minutes that the manager was unavailable at this time but she would contact the store again .
negative	when i asked how much longer i was expect to wait for this to be dealt_with ie today a week , a month .
negative	she just stated she didn_’_t know .
negative	i then asked for a copy of the companies policy of complaints_procedure to be e_- mailed me and the reply was she was unable to do this .
negative	i explained that this should be available to the customer if requested so she then stated she would ask her manager .
negative	this document should be available to all customer service staff as it should state the time limit to reply to any complaints also stating a limit for the complaint to be dealt_with .
negative	as i have had to chase this up myself the time limits i must assume have not been adhered .
negative	due to the delays ( bad customer service ) and the fact that this is not the first_instance we have had to complain .
negative	call returned by cs at 00 : 00 missed the call ( phone was on charge in my kitchen ) so i phoned back at 00 : 00 spoke with ( name_removed ) and he has informed me that ( name_removed ) team_leader at the store will be calling me tomorrow .
negative	when i asked why he has not taken the time to call me today i was informed that they could not deliver today and when they sorted the routes out tomorrow they will ring me and let_me know what is happening .
negative	i asked why i had not been refunded as i requested in my last phone_call i was told to wait for the call from the store .
negative	monday and i have finally received the missing goods .
negative	another delivery wrong .
negative	new delivery sunday 00 dec_0000
negative	delivery arrived just after 0pm as requested .
negative	straight_away i notice that some of the shopping was missing .
negative	due from my past order i requested the driver went through the shopping with me so as to verify what was missing .
negative	we list the following as missing :
negative	domestos citrus fresh bleach x 0
negative	asda 00l tall bin_liners x 0
negative	finish dishwasher cleaner x 0
negative	gillette shave gel senstive x 0

negative	the adsa non drowsy hayfever / allergy 00 pk x 0 which had been substituted but had not been sent .
negative	the driver tried to telephone the store but couldn ’_t get through .
negative	he asked was if i available all day when he returned to the store he would get it dealt_with and would return with the said items .
negative	by 0 : 00 i still had not received the goods or a call from the store to inform_me to what was happening .
negative	i then tried to ring the customer service team starting from 0 : 00 .
negative	i was on hold for 00 . 00_min then i was cut_off .
negative	i rang straight back and again after 00mins was cut_off this carried on till i decided enough was enough and stopped calling at 00 : 00_hours .
negative	as of 0 : 00 on the 00 december_0000 i still have had no contact from the store i started to ring the customer service team .
negative	finally i was answered at 00 : 00 by ( name_removed ).
negative	i explained what had happened and she stated she would get in touch with the store and asked them to ring me back .

negative	00 : 00 00 december 000 .
negative	(. name_removed ) from the customer service contact centre phoned me to state he had spoken to ( name_removed ) one of the managers at the telford store .
negative	unfortunately they are unable to deliver the missing goods so would we accept a refund bearing in mind we paid for delivery for all the goods in question .
negative	no apology , no telephone_call from the store nothing .
negative	believe me this is the last time i will ever use the store again and i will be putting this account of errors on the review sites as well as face book etc .
negative	i ordered flowers which were delivered to the wrong_address so the intended_recipient did not receive them , your customer service team have taken a week to respond which the response is quite_frankly a joke and still no apology i will not be recommending and taking this further !
negative	they say they have flights for you then following_day say one of the flights have failed so you book with another carrier then 0_months later they charge your account again saying you have not paid for the requested flights but you have already paid for the first fight . then they give you the run around , do not use . book your flights direct with the airline . it is safer and cheaper . i will never use this company again and i intend to let every one know what fraudsters they are .
negative	bought this regent bath_taps with shower attachment , lever handle for shower don_'_t fit the tap .
negative	i was sent a part replacement which don_'_t fit either so i asked them if they would want me to send this taps back so they can see it for themselves that it is a faulty goods .
negative	then they told me that they will contact the manufacturer and will email me as soon as they hear from them .
negative	after a week no email , i had to email them , then i was told that they are sending a new taps , will receive it within two working_days , still_haven_'_t received it .
negative	given them over two_weeks to resolve this , how many more weeks do i have to wait for this company to do the right thing ?
negative	will gladly to return the taps at my expense as long as they refund me for what i paid for the taps .
negative	i ordered a hamper from scottish hampers .
negative	was good enough quality but with the extra vat added on was very expensive for the products i recieved .
negative	hamper was very small and did not look very nice .
negative	this was a thankyou gift for my mother in - law .
negative	i will certainly not be ordering one of these again .
negative	it '_s impossible to redeem wowcher despite_emailing wowcher for help .
negative	rubbish company and i will certainly not deal with them again !
negative	hi , i received the calenders today but they clearly haven ; t been proof_read as one of the pictures has a crease through the picture , clearly_visible .
negative	i have checked my hard_copy print and the copy on the order and it does not occur on the original so it must be a fault on your system .
negative	this fault occurs in both calenders .
negative	i am happy to send you a photo of the fault and send them back , please advice what email address to send the pictures to ?

negative	i '_ve_used serenata a lot and never had any_problems but on this occasion i have been very let_down .
negative	having specifically_asked when placing my order for the flowers to be left with a neighbour if recipient was not in , they chose to ignore my request and leave flowers and a cake outside the house .
negative	i have no idea where but i do know it doesn_'_t have a " secure " area .
negative	according to ' customer_services ' it '_s drivers discretion where they leave deliveries , regardless of where you have asked !
negative	despite not doing what i requested as a customer i '_m apparently also not entitled to any compensation !
negative	awful company , will never come_back and i have spent a fair_amount with serenata over the years .
negative	i ordered 0 mother '_s day bouquets .
negative	i spotted that the courier company '_s confirmation_email had the wrong_address the day before mother '_s day .
negative	i emailed to alert them to the problem .
negative	didn_'_t hear_anything back so i rang up .
negative	spent 00_minutes on the phone to their indian_call_centre .
negative	the person i was speaking to just didn_'_t understand that there were two roads in london with the same name and that they were delivering to the wrong one ( despite me putting the correct postcode in my original order ).
negative	i was promised ( i ) a callback that day and ( ii ) that the flowers would be delivered .
negative	surprise_surprise .
negative	no call back .
negative	no flowers delivered .
negative	just come off the phone with customer_services ( another 00 minute phone_call ) whereby i was told the i would definitely get a call back today - i '_ve heard that one before !
negative	she apparently couldn_'_t put me through to head_office ...
negative	so gave_me a number to call .
negative	am sat here on hold , again , so i have lots of time to write this review .
negative	p . s .
negative	the flowers that were delivered were a miserable bunch of brown flowers - was not worth the money !
negative	very bad no refund still from 00th_march good luck to anyone_else do not order
negative	they said they would have two bad chips repaired for me arriving from aberdeen to pick my car up .
negative	when i arrived one had not been done so they promised that they would arrange to get it done in aberdeen . when i didn_'_t hear from them i phoned and they offered a can of touch up paint .
negative	i had read bad things about adam price they are true .
negative	we contacted trade plumbing via_email as we wanted a 0mm_thick trojan bath_panel .
negative	size wasn_'_t quoted on website .
negative	they emailed back within 00_hours and confirmed it was 0mm so we ordered the panel .
negative	when it was received it was only 0mm_thick .
negative	had to use the panel as the fitting had already been arranged .
negative	contacted trade plumbing 0 times via_email to complain .
negative	they never bothered getting back to us .
negative	brought a food blender which after having to chase it with emails because it didn_'_t turn_up , when it did half off it was missing , bits were broken and the motor didn_'_t work .
negative	there '_s only an on line customer not really supportive service , this was a present that was bought and was really anticipated , and a long time waiting for , refund offered to mighty_deals account , i wont buy anything from this sham company again , i just want what i paid for as it is advertised !
negative	i '_d rather take my chances going blind folded round a car boot sale than use this unhelpful un - customer service .
negative	please sort this out .
negative	i '_ve been a loyal_customer with an average contract spend of over_£_000 .
negative	my second phone was stolen and reported with a police and insurance number .
negative	i was told that my pay as you go sim that was in the phone was cancelled when my phone was reported as stolen in march .
negative	i '_ve been charged every_month for a sim i never received or used totaling_£_00 . 00 .
negative	i also have another contract with 0 as i '_m a committed customer , this made no difference , but was refused a refund on the sim i didn_'_t receive or use and was told it was my fault !
negative	pulling my hair out with frustration at customer non service based in india who read of a script , probably the rudest negative customer service i '_ve ever_encountered .
negative	i was told the error was my fault , even thought i was told it had been cancelled when i phoned and that it was my responsibility to be charged for something i never received or used .
negative	was made to feel really dumb .
negative	more sense talking to a brick_wall .
negative	honestly 0 i felt like you gave_me 0 fingers down the phone in terms of support , compromise and customer_care .
negative	you were good 00 months_ago now your a joke and an expensive one with a massive con element .
negative	avoid at all costs , and thanks sachin who took my call at 00 . 00 gmt on 00 / 00 /_0000 your a great flagship as a team_leader .
negative	:-(
negative	having not recieved my parcel , ( 0st time customer ) - i had to chase pest_control the following week to be told that they could not find the house .
negative	as reception is poor where i live i missed the call and when i tried to call back the driver did not pick_up ( this was mid_afternoon )
negative	the address and postcode held did not match ( 00 miles apart ) but this was never queried and the parcel had been sent back to depot ( but no one told me and no message was left to this effect , either on my mobile or on e_- mail .
negative	i was then told , after chasing , that if i wanted a redelivery i '_d have to re - pay the £ 0 .
negative	i will instead take my custom elsewhere and am very dissatisfied with the service .
negative	tried several_times to order one wardrobe and one chest of drawers from argos but the page just hung and i didn_'_t receive any confirmation - well not until i received 0 emails from them confirming 0 orders for the same thing - and they had taken the money from my credit_card !
negative	ouch !
negative	contacted them immediately and gave all order details and told my account would be credited within 00 days ?
negative	hmm .. they can take my money immediately but drag their feet to re - credit !
negative	several phone_calls later i received a part - refund and eventually ( 0_months later !!!)
negative	received the remainder - even then i had to go in to one of the stores for a credit - i will never book a home delivery with them again !
negative	don_'_t book a food delivery with them - i did .
negative	they operate 0 hour slots ( allegedly ).
negative	booked a delivery for a sunday expecting a roast for sunday lunch - delivery between 0pm and 0pm - at 0pm i got a call saying they couldn_'_t make it ( after being_fobbed_off on the phone & no lunch ).
negative	i was promised a delivery for the day after at 0pm .. they turned_up at 0 . 00pm - substituted cheese and onion crisps with salt and vinegar - like they couldn_'_t switch a brand_name for their own !
negative	very poor - even complained to their head_office who were totally dismissive - so they lost my custom .
negative	i '_ll stick to sainsburys - never had a problem with them .
negative	i ordered a dress from them in july_0000 .
negative	they sent it to me with the belt missing .
negative	i emailed customer service ( cs ) & 0_days_later got a reply to say that even_though it was their mistake i would have to pay to send the dress back , then reorder a replacement (& pay for it ) when they received the returned item they would refund me ( within 00 days of course ).
negative	i replied to say that was not acceptable & couldn ’_t they just send me the belt ?
negative	of course not as that ’_s not easy - unlike their suggestion , which is really easy ??
negative	?
negative	i called cs & was waiting for 00_mins to speak to someone_who basically said i didn_’_t have a choice & that was the only process allowed .
negative	i asked to speak to their supervisor & waited another 0mins but the same agent came back on the phone to say she ’_s reorded me the dress & it would be charged to my account & i '_ll have to return the other one .
negative	i said that was exactly_what i just said i didn_’_t want .
negative	so she cancelled the order & i asked again to speak to her supervisor .
negative	she put me on hold once again & then told me the supervisor would call me back within 0 mins ....... 0_days_later i '_ve not had the call and i just received a letter in the post from them to say they have cancelled my order for the " replacement dress " which i didn_’_t give authorisation to be ordered , but they can '_t guarantee it will be cancelled .
negative	i do a lot of internet_shopping & i '_ve never had such bad service , with such arrogant cs and idiotic processes .
negative	do not order from them . asos . com are so superior in terms of service , value and respect for customers .
negative	fern , holly & steve should be ashamed to be associated with such a company .
negative	just purchased daily disposeable lens and i cannot wear them as they constantly fall out the minute you put them in your eye .
negative	theresa rochester

negative	i have a linux dedicated server running fedora with fasthosts web hosting .
negative	i have been with them for 0_months .
negative	the last month has_been dreadful .
negative	updates controlled through fasthosts wiping out php class files , and down times that break their service level agreements .
negative	the update lost me 0 and 0 / 0_days , as they have no engineer support at the weekend - losses into thousands .
negative	no apology , no communication and no one who_knows what they are doing .
negative	recently lost all connection to my dedicated server , and the matrix control_panel is plagued with problems - still without imap or pop0 for the third time in a row .
negative	i will be switching in the new year when i have the energy for it .
negative	i may have to pay extra , but going for the budget option has meant fire fighting with them all the time , they will always tell you a problem is nothing to do with them , and then low and behold it is !
negative	i don_'_t think it is a good product .
negative	they hurt , they are big ( so they dont stay over your eye ) so i think i have payed for nothing ..
negative	have not received my order ?
negative	i have been boots customer for over 0 years .

negative	when my gift arrived i had been charged full price so i called customer service and they said or yes pandora are not in this deal , but on the email it did not state this any where at all .
negative	miss leading would not use again .
negative	as a first time customer i ordered one item on a next_day delivery basis on 00th_october ......
negative	i am still_waiting !
negative	i was informed that the courier had the item on 00st_october and first the courier claimed they could not access the house ( its on the main_road and has a wide driveway easily_accessed by all other couriers ) which was then changed to the house could not be found - there are only a handful of properties with the same postcode all next to each other , then it was changed that the courier would contact me directly to arrange delivery - that was over a week_ago and surprise , surprise that did not happen .
negative	i have paid on the 00 / 0 for my item and also paid for delivery - yet isme is doing nothing to get my item delivered to me !!!
negative	!
negative	will not be recommending isme to family , friends , colleagues - in fact quite the opposite .
negative	isme you have no customer service !
negative	meg kent worcestershire
negative	you will never get answer to your emails if you have questions such as delivery time etc .
negative	also no refund when you are not happy with the products and send them back .
negative	i so much regret that i purchased for 000_gbp on this website as my refund hasn ´_t been made .
negative	avoid this seller !
negative	have been waiting 0_weeks since sending order off and still not received my money !
negative	not even sure i will !
negative	you get no information unless you contact them and then you receive an_email within an_hour .
negative	awful service .
negative	not even if you are desperate use this company , sell your goods at a car boot sale , you will get more money and you wont_be left waiting weeks on end .
negative	i have had no reasoning for why the process is so poor , just empty useless excuses .
negative	wouldnt give any stars but i have had to unfortunately
negative	do not use this company
negative	ordered a top , had to email twice to chase_up delivery as paid for next_day !!!
negative	then got an_email_saying it was out of stock ...
negative	i have already complained to my supplier .
negative	the driver is throwing a sack of bird_food over the side_gate and leaving it in full sight of passers_by .
negative	i was unable to park on my drive without moving the 00kg_sack again hurting my back .
negative	this is the 0rd time and despite the special instructions that said do not throw over the side_gate .
negative	leave in porch .
negative	the porch has a door without a lock which hides it away from passers_by .
negative	i would not recommend your company to anyone .
negative	my supplier has complained to your company each time .
negative	the flowers i ordered for my mum on mother '_s day came and not even after a week they had died
negative	we found the ordering and delivery service worked within our expectations , which was good .
negative	however , the service provided at the centre left a lot to be desired .
negative	we were kept waiting for ages perhaps this was because we purchased on line .
negative	secondly , we had two new tyres_fitted by this centre last_year and we can only have done around 0k miles and the first set lasted 00k , but were told when we had the car serviced that one of these needed_replacing .
negative	this seems very strange how the first set of the same make of tyre lasts 00k but only 0k once your fitters have adjusted the tracking .
negative	i have now been told that the camber could be out - unlikely to my mind .
negative	best regards
negative	i sent phoned to fonebank , they claimed one did not work and when i queried it they ignored my email .
negative	i know for a fact it was working when i sent it recorded delivery .
negative	i have sent another email and heard_nothing .
negative	very poor service , would definitely by recommend and will not use again .
negative	tracking no l0000000
negative	two text_message no delivery . where is my ottaman bed and memory mattress i ordered from groupon .
negative	i ordered an ottoman_bed and memory mattress from groupon website . they gave_me a tracking_number to track my order . i tracked the order with the tracking_details it shows delivered in a safe_place .
negative	when i got home i couldn_'_t see my order or any card left by courier .
negative	i phoned them the next_day to ask them the whereabouts of my item they said that they cant see any update from their system that i should give them 0 to 0 working to find out the whereabouts of the bed . i emailed them to refund my money back to me then i got a reply that they have an update for me that the bed has not been dispatched , i should give 0 working_days to deliver the bed . the next_day i received a text that the will
negative	deliver the bed on 00 jan_0000 . up till now the bed has not been delivered .
negative	nel pacco che mi è arrivato mancava un pezzo , ed il primo sbaglio lo accetto , solo che dopo il minimo che potessero fare era di rispedirmi subito il pezzo mancante , ed invece hanno iniziato prima con il farmi note di credito , poi varie mail ed ora dopo più di una settimana il pezzo non è ancora partito con il corriere .
negative	this is the worst company i have ever dealt_with .
negative	you can not get through to them via the telephone at all , no proper email address to contact them , do not get back to you .
negative	have not delivered my item after 00 days .
negative	i even paid the extra postage for quick delivery .
negative	will get money back through credit_card company , thankfully used mastercard so covered .
negative	do not use .
negative	quick and easy booking which appealed to us .
negative	however the gentlemen_who booked it told us a huge pack of lies and a month before the hen_weekend we were being asked for additional money which we weren_'_t meant to be paying .
negative	rude staff calling in a daily_basis .
negative	then calling the next week with another problem .
negative	told us there was lots of parking at the apartment only to arrive and find none and had to park 0 cars at £_00 a night plus £ 0 per day so for each car cost £_00 to park for the weekend .
negative	events were fantastic but this can not be credited to hen_heaven but the companies themselves .
negative	informed them of my disappointment and they could not have cared_less .
negative	overall i would never ever recommend hen_heaven to anyone and have stopped 0 friends from booking with the company due to the poor service we received who have in turn told others not to use hen or stag heaven .
negative	booked online and the confirmation_email didn_'_t come through .
negative	took over a week for someone to sort_out the day before_departure !
negative	arrival at dalaman was ok , there were only 0 of us travelling seeing as it was out if season in april .
negative	did the usual stop off at some tacky transport cafe for a ' comfort break '.
negative	got into the resort and the driver who spoke very little english asked us where are accommodation was !
negative	luckily we had been there before and we ended_up giving him directions .
negative	confirming the pick_up online was useless , the time was not posted in the timescales advised .
negative	tried_emailing , but got no reply .
negative	eventually time was posted earlier the same day .
negative	waited and waited , phoned the emergency_number , only to be asked for directions !
negative	then they said it would be half an_hour .
negative	the driver had clearly not left yet .
negative	when we were eventually picked_up an_hour late , we were shuttled to marmaris where the driver drive around several back streets looking for another minibus , where we had to get off ours and change to the other .
negative	we were greeted_by a bus load of unhappy passengers who had also been waiting an_hour to be picked_up .
negative	the driver then asked us what time our flight was !
negative	he should have known this !
negative	when he realised how late it was , he thankfully put his foot down and drive directly to the airport without stopping at the tacky transport cafe !
negative	i suppose you get what you pay for , but next time we '_ll be giving this company a miss !
negative	i have used simply_supplements for many_years but after their shoddy treatment of me in the last 0_weeks i shall never use them again .
negative	an_email i sent complaining_about a £ 0 overcharge has_gone unanswered for over a fortnight .
negative	in future i shall use one of the many other_companies in this field .
negative	don_'_t bother with this company .
negative	i only wish i had looked out for the reviews before i used them .
negative	after non delivery of flowers despite their online tracking_system informing_me that they had been delivered , it took them thirteen days to respond .
negative	they stated that " we have a backlog of messages which requires response ".
negative	yes i bet they do .
negative	looking at these reviews it '_s clear that i '_m far from being alone in my bad_experience .
negative	to add_insult to injury , the rest of the email ( do these people never actually talk to their customers ?)
negative	was the usual marketing ( yeah_right !
negative	they wouldn_'_t know marketing if it hit them in the face ) bulls ...
negative	i quote ...
negative	" we deeply value your relationship with iflorist and are committed to providing you with the highest_level of service simply because our customers deserve the very best ."
negative	shame it '_s just words .
negative	don_'_t waste your money or your time using these people .
negative	complete amateurs and lazy to boot .
negative	the employees in this company are not able to read or choose to ingnore any e_- mail or any complaints that i have sent .
negative	be careful when ordering anything from them .
negative	the chances are that you won_'_t receive them and they won_'_t answer your calls or e_-_mails ....
negative	this company was very helpful and i took out a contract with them .
negative	found out they were charged more than the energy company phoned them back straight_away but they totally changed thier attitude and would not help at all .
negative	luckily my engergy company sorted it out for me .
negative	always cross check their prices !!!
negative	!
negative	i contacted ilford store cash_generator ltd 000 high_street ilford ig0 0ll , i am refused my purchase which was a samsung 00 inch smart_tv on the 00 / 00 /_0000 as soon as i open the box i realised it was damaged , and contacted the store straight_away i received an e_- mail instructing me to take some photos of the damage which i quickly did so , after that i receive no more correspondence from the store so i contacted them then i was told that they will only be corresponding with me by e_- mail i have not received no information or instruction from the store of what to do next .
negative	the tv was not properly protected they wrap the box in bubble_wrap but did not wrap the tv as there was no protection on top of the tv and the tv was covered in a black bag there was no way intelligent which way to hold the box for the delivery men .
negative	i will now be contacting_trading_standards about what to do next i readily buy from cash_generators but this has_been my worst experience and i would carefully consider_buying from cash_generators agenda i have already gotten rid of my tv and now need the money back so i can get a new one .
negative	my husband and i went_onto o0 because we had relatives and friends on that network so we figured we would save money .
negative	i was so wrong !
negative	they ended_up charging us double for four months until we finally got the problem sorted .
negative	we have horrible_experience with the customer service .
negative	one person tells you one thing while another person tells you something_else .
negative	you can not change your tariff if you want to lower your monthly allowances and charges .
negative	one customer representative was even argumentative and refused to transfer us to a supervisor .
negative	they are very inconsistent .
negative	my mum in law ended_up getting forced_into a contract with them due to a family_member not paying the bill in her name and they were absolutely awful when she called to try and get a copy of the original contact and change the tariff .
negative	they charged her £_00 per_month just for 0000 minutes and unlimited texting .
negative	absoutely no data was included in that .
negative	even_though it wasn_'_t their fault that she had to continue with the contract they were no help what so ever .
negative	the phone ended_up not working for a month and despite many time we helped her take it in to get fixed nothing worked and nobody helped .
negative	we finally ended_up getting them to send her out a new one just to find out that that phone didn_'_t work either !
negative	it was absolutely ridiculous !
negative	do not use o0 as your network !
negative	i don_'_t reccomend to anyone !
negative	sign their contract at your_own_risk !
negative	if you are a customer of o0 please make_sure to check your monthly_bill for unknown charges because they will not catch the error themselves !
negative	i ordered a generator from this company , the website looked good and genuine .
negative	i received an_email after the order confirming the purchase .
negative	the order was marked as pending .
negative	the generator did not arrive .
negative	i have tried contacting them to ask for a refund .
negative	the phone line goes straight to answerphone , the customer support chatline is always offline and they do not answer the emails .
negative	if you place an order with them , do not expect to receive anything .
negative	they come under a company called anglo_pacific trading ltd .
negative	avoid them .
negative	ordered a pair of tyres for a land_rover .
negative	the price was marginally better_than theyir competitor .
negative	0_weeks_later and no tyres have arrived .
negative	customer_services take up to 0 hours to respond , they have so far fobbed me off with :
negative	i '_ll get you a tracking_number ... that was 0_days ago .
negative	yesterday , the same ; i '_ll email you a tracking_number .
negative	heard_nothing again , now it '_s the weekend so we will be into next week before any developments .
negative	i have asked to cancel the order and refund the money .
negative	there is no phone number for this company so consider the pitfalls when something does go_wrong .
negative	this the third time i '_ve_used myhermes for collection and yes i should have known better ... yet another failed collection .
negative	this company should seriously think about what they are doing .
negative	i will not be using them ever again .
negative	they have such a poor reputation that using them to deliver your parcels will damage your_own credibility .
negative	i placed an order with precious_little_ones on the 00st_december_0000 for an east_coast cot_mattress , i rang on the 0nd_jan_0000 to delay the dispatch due to not being at the delivery address by the time it was expected to be delivered .
negative	the girl i spoke to was very helpful , advised that the mattress was in the warehouse but she would get a delay put on dispatch until the 0th_jan .
negative	i thought nothing of it , and and was looking_forward to receiving the mattress , however , i received an_email on the 0th_jan saying that there had been a stock error and that it would be another week until the mattress arrived in the warehouse .
negative	i rang customer_services to ask what was going on , someone had made a mistake and not placed the mattress in the correct section and it had been resold ( not sure how that even happens ), i complained at the time but was not offered any compensation , until i asked for delivery charges to refunded .
negative	i was expecting to receive on email on the 00th / 00th_jan to say that the mattress had been dispatched , instead i have received another email to say that the mattress is still not a available and that there was a problem with the manufacturers .
negative	again i rang customer service to complain and ask for an explanation , but was given no more information , nor could i be told when the mattress would be available .
negative	again i was not offered any compensation , other than an_apology .
negative	needless to say i cancelled the order there and then , and will not be using precious littles one again , whilst their prices are highly competitive , it would appear you have to be prepared to wait .
negative	i want to cancel what i spoke to jenny yesterday i was given it was with aol , now i see it is with talk_talk , which iam not happy with , she told me she was with aol .
negative	absolutely rubbish !
negative	ordered on 0 / 0 / 00 and got goods on 00 / 0 / 00 !
negative	no excuse , it '_s not even christmas !
negative	never ordering from ' slow pharmacy ' again
negative	i ordered flowers for my aunts_00th_birthday to be delivered to her house but despite having her address and postcode interflora contacted me to say the florist had been unable to find the house which seems incredible i don , t_believe the florist really tried as the house is on a main rd its not hidden away so i gave interflora a possible place where my aunt may beshe was having lunch out for her_birthday but i wasn , t 000_% sure she was there but the florist went there and just left the flowers without making proper enquieries , interflora sent me an_email to say the flowers had been delivered but then interflora rang me the next_day to say that the place where i thought my aunt was had rung them to say she wasn , t there so the flowers were left there another 0_days before the florist picked them up again and i found my aunts house on google earth and sent interflora directions i was very dissapointed that my aunt hadn , t had the flowers on her special day and i didn , t get an_email to say my aunt got the flowers in the end but my aunt wrote to me i won , t ever use interflora again the service was appalling the flowers were in a basket so they didn , t need making up like a bouquet and i stipulated that the flowers would need to be delivered by 00_noon
negative	flowers were dead
negative	not sure i have recorded every e_mail and telephone contact but here goes .
negative	ordered divan_bed on 00th_december .
negative	payment taken by worldstores on 00th_december .
negative	arranged delivery date for 00rd_december and order specifically said 0 man delivery .
negative	waited in all day on 00rd and by late_afternoon ( after no delivery ) attempted contact with worlstores via premium_rate 0000 number .
negative	kept on hold so long had to hang up .
negative	sent 0 emails to worldstores on same day but no response except automatic holding e_mails .
negative	finally_managed to get number for xdp delivery company .
negative	told only bed mattress had arrived at delivery depot and base was still at distribution depot .
negative	told this was reason for non delivery .
negative	asked if she could chase_up but she said no as 0000s of items were there .
negative	asked why they had not bothered to let_me know of problem but got no response .
negative	told to ring back 00th .
negative	tried worldstores on 00th and told item had arrived at delivery depot .
negative	told she would try and get delivery for that day and would ring me back .
negative	no phone_call but checked e_mails and one had arrived confirming 00th delivery .
negative	delivery by one man and not two .
negative	man not pleased as he said he had been recalled from a0 to collect bed .
negative	said there was only him .
negative	i told him bed needed to be in spare_bedroom .
negative	had to help him upstairs ( not easy for woman in her 00s ).
negative	noticed when we put base in position that it had tear in material .
negative	delivery man said you can note delivery note that item was damaged if you want to .
negative	husband arrived home and fully unpacked base .
negative	it had a further 0 tears and a crack .
negative	the holes that the casters were supposed to be fitted were not not deep enough to take them .
negative	base complete rubbish .
negative	rang worldstores and after being on hold for 00_mins on premium_rate number finally got through .
negative	told by female_member of staff that she would authorise a refund and arrange for collection on 0th_jan said that it might not be a two man pick_up !!
negative	.
negative	heard no more from company so tried telephoning and e_mailing but got no response .
negative	after sending e_mails to ceo and threatening them with legal_action and watchdog i finally got response .
negative	first was to tell me that refund had been authorised and 0nd was to say that i had to complete return_slip they were forwarding and attach it to returned items .
negative	it also said that once xdp had collected item and confirmed this to worldstores the company would process refund and this could take up to 00 days before i received it .
negative	on 0rd_jan i got call from worldstores to say delivery company would be in touch re collection of faulted items and then refund would be authorised .
negative	i checked my on line account on 0rd and a miracle had occurred and my refund was there .
negative	the shame is that the mattress seemed good quality and had i had confidence in company and delivery systems i would have paid for and kept the mattress .
negative	i am still_waiting for xdp to contact me ref collection and i cannot purchase a new bed until this one is taken_away .
negative	overall this is the worst on line company i have ever dealt_with .
negative	be warned .
negative	i now expect an automatic e_mail in response to this but it will be too little too late .
negative	further update
negative	at long last i dealt_with someone at world_stores with excellent customer service skills .
negative	she arranged pick_up of bed , kept me informed_throughout and rang back afterwards to confirm everything went_smoothly .
negative	well_done kate .
negative	world_stores need to employ more people like her .
negative	a really disappointing lack of feedback as to what i have just purchased using my valuable credit_card .
negative	waited for ages for an_email_confirmation : have i actually hired a car at all ?
negative	when it arrived it was so vague as to be downright annoying .
negative	apparently this is not a voucher and my voucher will arrive in the next 00_hours otherwise i can email somewhere .
negative	this , my friends , is not how to do_business on the net .
negative	comparing you to the average us hire company leaves you in the bad place .
negative	booked three direct flights but the airline cancelled this flight ( now wondering_if they were ever offering such connection ).
negative	first very frustrating thing were their emails sent to me in german ( booked flight through uk website , payed with cc registered in uk , gave uk contact number )...
negative	however using google translator i managed .
negative	called the customer " service " just to find out the obvious - the flight is not happening ...
negative	they offered me an_alternative - instead of a direct , up to 0 hrs flight a full day connection with a change .
negative	i refused ( who wouldn_'_t ?).
negative	then i called them again to find out what my other options are and i could have chosen a refund that takes at_least 0_months or a voucher that will be usable for a future booking with them and issued within 00_hours .
negative	i went for the voucher option as three passengers needed to travel and even_though i '_d have preferred not to use bravofly again .
negative	no voucher after 0_days so i called again , explained all what happened again just to be told , that it will take longer because of the bank that doesn_'_t work on weekend .
negative	excuse me ???
negative	bank is not involved at all .
negative	bravofly is issuing me a voucher in order to be able to use it for my next purchase ...
negative	i had to explain the process to the customer " service " representative .
negative	outrageous .
negative	then she finally understood and promised to call me back that day after she investigates the matter .
negative	no call back received , no email received ... now i '_m desperately_trying to get_hold of bravofly however with no luck .
negative	their 0 - midnight uk number does '_t work at 00 : 00 neither does their french one .
negative	their worldwide number only works if you provide your card number but after_reading other person '_s experience of facing card fraud afterwards i don_'_t feel like doing this .
negative	to sum up anybody who is about to book with bravofly please think_twice as non - existent service and so frustrating approach is hardly to be seen_elsewhere .

negative	parking staff and service couldn_'_t be better , but fastrack security upgrade was a waste of money .
negative	if you ' re charging for a service , you have to know it can be delivered and , on the day i went through edinburgh_airport , some bright spark had decided to use the fastrack lane for training new staff , which_meant it was not only slower_than the other lanes , but every_single bag was searched !
negative	rookie error - no pun_intended .
negative	having said all that , i '_m too busy to not use this service , especially when i '_m frequently on the last flights in .
negative	i have given my views already flowers were late after being told they had arrived , when queried poor customer service , no human to talk to and then they arrived , thrown on the ground after a ring of the bell , flowers ok , card wet , box soaking .
negative	very poor service would not advise anyone to use them again .
negative	to use a promotion_code i had to send everything back and re order at time to me
negative	terrible terrible experience
negative	awful company
negative	shame not run better
negative	ordered flowers and they never arrived the next_day as they should have been .
negative	the recipient had just got home from hospital and wanted them to brighten_her day , yet they arrived the flooowing day .
negative	when i contact iflorist to complain_about this , they never bothered to reply which is unacceptable .
negative	will be going back to my usual florist provider .
negative	i have ordered 0 items from beauty_bay over 0_weeks_ago & it still_hasn_'_t arrived .
negative	when i called to ask where it was they told me to contact my local_depot , even_though my office is manned at all times .
negative	they have taken the money from my account , i still don_'_t have the products & they are refusing to even make an enquiry until the products have been missing for 0_weeks !
negative	disgusting !
negative	i will never order from beauty_bay again & i '_d advise you to do the same !
negative	i was not informed of all the fuss that would be made about sending used personal effects home .
negative	very frustrating and as of today ... nearly three_weeks_later ... the parcel has still not been delivered .
negative	placed an order with uksweets at quite a high value and had a terrible experience :
negative	when i received it , it was all packed one item to a box so we received a stupid amount of boxes .
negative	bags of sweets were split and taped back together meaning we couldn_'_t sell them .
negative	items were out of stock even_though in stock on their website .
negative	boxes were damaged so items we had sold in bulk had to be repackaged in our warehouse to avoid disappointing our customers ( see , that '_s good customer service on our part !)
negative	sent items that had 0 - 0_months on the best before date meaning we have to either reduce them or sell them in bulk .
negative	if you look around you can find the items a lot_cheaper and with better stock_levels .
negative	overall , it may be the worst experience we have had with a wholesaler .
negative	having met them at ife00 we assumed they would be a good company to work with ... obviously not !
negative	i will not be ordering from this company again , their customer service is ridiculous and their products can be found cheaper elsewhere .
negative	do yourself a favour , don_'_t buy from uksweets .
negative	not received my parcel and was expecting it in time for christmas .
negative	i downloaded this app due to all the good reviews .
negative	the booking was okay , the problem came when i had to change a return date within 00_hours .
negative	the number posted on the website was confusing and even the us phone company could not understand how to dial it .
negative	there was no email address for help .
negative	i had to change the date through the airline , which charged me a whopping fee , although it would have been free if i had booked with them first .
negative	so any money i saved was wiped out .
negative	ebookers sent me a email after i had done this with another phone number .
negative	more understandable , but my cell phone does not do international .
negative	was not worth all the hassle .
negative	just call your airline and find the best deal !
negative	if you run into problems , this company is unreachable .
negative	i wish i could get a refund from them !
negative	purchased an electric_blanket - redeemed on 00th_november with the assurance ' your goods will be delivered by 00 dec_0000 '.
negative	nothing so far .
negative	have sent an_email to customer enquiries and just got an_email back saying ' due to an increase in volumes in the run up to christmas we aim to respond within 0 working_days '.
negative	so potentially no assistance until 00 days after the delivery deadline .
negative	will stick to amazon in the future .
negative	update 00 / 00 /_0000
negative	0_days after first contact and several emails later , received an_email to say dispatch had been delayed , and final delivery would be around 0_weeks late .
negative	not acceptable .
negative	i have been with them quite a few_years and the only_reason is the hassle and time involved changing my website over and all my domains
negative	to be honest i get better service from webs com and that is all free .
negative	they have never managed to resolve any problem , just made it that complicated and time_consuming i '_ve ended_up working through it and doing it myself , rather_than reading what may as well be automated_replies solving nothing
negative	i monitor all my websites and 000 - reg websites are going down all the time .
negative	when i advise them of this , usually its back up and they are not bothered in the slightly that business is being lost .
negative	constantly up and down .
negative	monitor your_own websites ( the website host won_'_t advise you when they are down )
negative	the final_straw came with numerous renewals of domains and instantsite hosting via_topcashback and none of the discounts getting paid as they are only applicable to new business not renewals , however no where is this clearly_indicated therefore just misleading .
negative	i can '_t wait to change them over at renewal !!
negative	!
negative	would not advise using this company and how do i tell the lovely friend that sent them for christmas that they came in a split sodden cardboard_box and the flowers looked very forlorn .
negative	the surprise of receiving the flowers was spoilt entirely .
negative	have tried to contact company on their site but keep being instructed to go to a complicated link of numbers and letters which doesn_'_t get me anywhere .
negative	very poor show !
negative	do not use this site i booked what i thought was a hotel it was a run down house in a absolutely_disgraceful area even some of the locals could not believe what we were staying in .
negative	i tried to contact costumes service to ask for a refund it took me three_times to get though when i did they were very rude and could not help i had to ask to be put through to manager which then took another 00_minutes i was told would get my refund but would take 0_days i was with 0 friends all young girls who were left without a hotel in a foreign place .. this is a absolute_joke .
negative	do not use !!
negative	!
negative	twice hackers cleaned out my bank_account and although i got money back , it took far too long and they didn_'_t give any compensation , even_though it resulted_in bank charges and potentially late bills , luckily i had family to help out !
negative	i cannot use these lights as there is absolutely nothing to attach them to . no adapters no plug .
negative	will be returning lights as no good to me like this . you did not make it clear that you need all the attachments , feel conned .
negative	d . butler
negative	i had an initial l ; oan and got caught in the spiral of paying back then taking another out to replace the money that quickquid have took .
negative	after numerous_attempts to set_up a payment plan that both_parties were happy with i was advised by quickquid to change my payment date so that my account went into arrears and to call them to set_up a payment plan ( as they could only do this once i was in arrears ) after calling i received no help at all .
negative	i just want to pay and get quickquid out of my life .
negative	please take my warning and do not use them
negative	i purchased the maxfactor natural minerals foundation and i phoned up to complain_about it .
negative	they describe it as being natural looking , which it isn_'_t as it is very shimmery .
negative	brush sheds , feels dry on my face , not buildable either .
negative	i can '_t get a refund because it '_s been used .
negative	well , surely the customer is always right ?
negative	customer service is shoddy as well .
negative	i was told to take it up with maxfactor !
negative	just useless !
negative	i ordered some green_tea pills on a saturday and i waited_until weds and thought it was odd i hadn_'_t had an_email to say they had been dispatched .
negative	phoned up and they said they had a problem with their supplier .
negative	well , why have them available online ?
negative	there were in stock when i placed my order .
negative	it '_s now friday and i have them .
negative	wary to order from them again .
negative	as all the other reviews say this company is definatly a scam !
negative	i just wish i had looked for reviews before ordering !
negative	my experience is exactly the same as everyone_elses , i ordered from them , few_weeks_later order is still ' pending ' and have had no replys from my numerous attemps of contacting them .
negative	i '_m so gutted that they are just able to get away with this =[
negative	rec '_d link on facebook for free dress , just pay p_&_p .
negative	as i was getting free dress , as it was added it to my order , i decided to buy other clothes .
negative	imagine my disappointment when i got email to say my order was dispatched but not the free dress !!!!
negative	after i enquired i got rather a cheeky email_saying it was a mistake on the website and that i should have known it was not free !!!!
negative	was quite happy with other items i bought , but will not , and have informed my friends not to buy from the site either !!!!
negative	!
negative	not heard_anything back from this company since the order was placed 0_days ago .
negative	used the email contact and the feedback form and nothing .
negative	i may not have spent a lot of cash but that is not the point .
negative	i have raised a complaint via pay_pal and will report the company to their local trading_standards .
negative	i purchased a ticket to sonisphere for my son through this site .
negative	it was due to be delivered by ups on 00th_june but ups today confirmed it has lost the ticket .
negative	ups needs to launch an enquiry and we have called viagogo twice today but they have failed to contact ups to initiate this .
negative	viagogo confirms the ticket is covered by its insurance but refuses to send a replacement or even check if tickets are still available until it has_gone_through a 00 hr investigation with ups ( which it has not even initiated ).
negative	it is now monday_evening and my son needs to travel to the festival this thursday .
negative	after being told there is no way round their policies one of viagogo '_s operatives ( kelly ) finally agreed to put me through to the relevant_department and i have been hanging on the line for 00_minutes .
negative	it is becoming more evident by the minute that viagogo are completely ignoring our dilemma .
negative	it is also very concerning that there are reports on the web of viagogo obtaining payment from telecoms operators for keeping people waiting for crazy amounts of time only to cut_off their calls .
negative	tuesday update
negative	thank_you for your reply .
negative	as you will see on twitter , i have had several warnings from people via vianono , that the replacement ticket will not materialise .
negative	you will not be surprised that i am very concerned_about the allegations on the web that you are running some kind of scam in conjunction with ups .
negative	all we can do is keep our fingers_crossed that the ticket is on its way and that you are behaving honourably .
negative	i used to have a facebook account that i loved and checked religiously .
negative	i didn_'_t think that it was possible to be without one , and to go without knowing what my friends were constantly doing .
negative	but then it went corporate .
negative	i mean , it was always corporate but it became something_else .
negative	it '_s flooded with adverts and ways of connecting with big companies - the types of company i don_'_t want to have my personal information .
negative	it is no_longer social_networking , it '_s just scary .
negative	i am so disgusted with this company !
negative	i have tried to post a review for an item three_times on the website but very do not post it !
negative	seems they only want people to see good comments , not truthful ones !
negative	we purchased a double glass display_unit a while ago and thought we would get the matching single unit to stand next to it but it does not match at all !
negative	the colour is at_least three shades darker_than the double one and although the description states it is the same size the single unit is almost 0 inches taller so the shelves do not align with the double , it has different feet and the wood is rounded , where as the double unit is straight edged .
negative	the description on very is really misleading and needs dealing_with !
negative	unfortunately as we assembled the unit we were unable to return it so have had to put it somewhere different to where we wanted to , it is a great unit just not matching as stated , so a complete_waste of £_000 .
negative	i contacted very and was told they were sorry the item was not as expected and offered me 00_%_off but i would have to keep it !
negative	i said no as i think that is an insult , i '_ll still be paying £_00 for an item that was sent in error !
negative	they really dont care and say that the most they can offer will be 00_%_off and really dont care that they are charging me for an item they mis_- sold !
negative	i have been forced to pay for their mistake !
negative	even after quoting the distance_selling regulations to them , they still refuse to do anything_else !
negative	i have never been so disappointed by a companies customer service like this before .
negative	as long as they have your money , they dont give a toss about customer_satisfaction !
negative	the messages were completely_ignored
negative	call staff are abrupt and rude if you ever get through !!
negative	!
negative	wouldn_'_t extend my booking even_though it would mean more money for the company !
negative	guess i '_m lucky as all i will lose is my deposit as oppose to having my whole holiday ruined .
negative	think i shall be writing to watchdog and any other similar agencies !!!
negative	!
negative	ordered on the 00 december and tracking shows it having been scanned to send on the 0th_january ????.
negative	i am in france but did expect that it should have arrived by now ( the 0th ) but still no show
negative	delivery a day early so very good .
negative	wrong perfume and invoice in my package amazon has now arranged a refund on return of wrong perfume , its been an unnecessary load of hassle and have now ordered and received perfume from another_supplier
negative	the actual bunch was not what i was expecting , i was rather disappointed with the product n the delivery !
negative	!
negative	very frustrated with not being_able to complete my transaction to a p o box .
negative	i live in cyprus and this is the most efficient way of collecting my goods - but my last attempt at purchasing for delivery that way was refused .
negative	paypal also do not allow me to pay for items in gb pounds , despite ordering from a uk company and paying with a uk credit or debit_card !
negative	!
negative	where is the sense in that ?
negative	if you actually want the ability to use your phone i would recommend using a different service .
negative	i have little to no signal at all times and have had numerous problems with the simple things like direct_debits .
negative	upon ringing up customer service to try to sort_out my endless problems i have been met with rude , abrupt and ignorant customer service agents and i am yet to have any of my problems solved .
negative	do not go to orange !
negative	my order was late , it had no protective_packaging and all of the goods inside the packaging were stinking of cigarette_smoke .
negative	i will not use barrington_sport again .
negative	very poor customer service and terrible communication with customers !
negative	avoid like the plague and use a more reputable music dealer , unless you have lots of time on your hands and feel lucky that your order will actually arrive !
negative	have been waiting in all day on my day off for a bed i was told the driver had to change the route owing to an accident and that it would be delivered by 00 . 00 this is tuesday 00 / 00 /_0000 by 00 . 00 not arrived so went back to the tracking it said that it was carded which_meant we had recieved a card no all lies we have been in and nothing the next minute it was showing gone back to depot no phone_call to me no text nothing not only that tonight i am sleeping on the floor thanks for that ????
negative	i am back to work tomorrow can '_t take phone on the ward so thats another day .
negative	help
negative	i bought a dress for my holiday , it looked simple but nice on website .
negative	it arrived and looked cheap , poor quality , no shape and far toooo long .
negative	i returned it and obviously lost the postage cost but then i was charged a £ 0 admin_fee !!!!
negative	come on ....
negative	really !!!!!!!
negative	i won_'_t be ordering again !
negative	we costumes were supposed to be delivered on friday , we were going to a party on saturday , so no costumes
negative	i was told by the company i was returning an item to that it would be collected on either thursday , friday or monday but not to worry at i would get a txt from yodel telling_me which day and the company arranging the return asked for an_alternative location for the trousers to be left should i have to get out .
negative	i received no txt so decided when i was going out on the thursday to leave the wrapped item in the designated woodshed .
negative	by tuesday no sign of yodel , so called the clothes company to be told a collection had been attempted and that a card had been left .
negative	nope , nothing my end .
negative	another collection was arranged and the woodshed was still the alternative collection_point .
negative	the next_day i did come home to a card simply saying they had shouted everywhere , obviously some clever take on their name .
negative	what they hadn_'_t done was on any occasion texted to say which day they were collecting or paid any attention to the note for my collection that they could access the woodshed to find the trousers .
negative	the third and final time they came i was luckily in a led the beleaguered driver to the obvious wood shed to retrieve the trousers - he claimed he had no information about an_alternative collection_point or that the company was meant to txt the delivery day .
negative	i can_imagine why the clothing company would tell me of such arrangements and ask for a secure_place i would leave the clothing for collection in my absence .
negative	yodel have obviously made a good sales_pitch to secure the contract but can '_t fulfil any of it .
negative	after ordering a bedroom_furniture set in aug and was pleased with decided to order another one for different room in oct arrived 0th_nov some of which was damaged , told rang customer_services told to refuse delivery of those items and replacements would be sent out y end of week which we did . of course replacements were not coming anytime_soon , after numerous_calls to the call_centre and apart_from been told different things about a resolution to our problem which we had to restart the story each time we rang , it was all so robotic word for word even down the very insincere apology for the problem . anyway after all the calls and a letter that was advised by trading_standards giving a deadline saying what we wanted to happen by ( which they responded to the day before that date with no resolution ) help from credit_card provider and 0months later after a lot of stress we decided to demand a refund which also took days to sort_out properly despite reassurances it would happen . i would never recommend a large purchase from asda direct that comes from a supplier . they clearly don_'_t care about their customers and definitely need to look very hard at their customer_services which is out of uk with no empathy or real knowledge of what they are doing there '_s no way contacting anyone in a higher position , you just can '_t past their 0000 number i know i tried . the whole_process is an_absolute_joke .
negative	why this mess ???????
negative	?
negative	alertpay ??
negative	i do not have any word to explain my feelings guys .
negative	awful alertpay
negative	i ordered a violin bow almost 0_weeks_ago and was assured delivery in 0 working_days .
negative	my young son has went through two music lessons since without his own violin bow .
negative	i have had no explanation for the delay in delivery and i can_assure you that i will be informing the music school which my son attends not to use your service and i certainly won_'_t be using this service again .
negative	looking_forward to your timely reply
negative	ruth gibson
negative	ordered some new fitness clothing while i was aware of their ' magazine and mug ' scam so i opt out .
negative	i checked out when it was put back in my basket , only to find out when i got the confirmation_email .
negative	really , guys ?
negative	i don_'_t want your stupid marketing stuff ( let_alone pay for it ).
negative	it '_s like shopping at the supermarket and have a employee sneakily put another product in your basket .
negative	how is this even legal .. also , charging 0 . 00 for standard delivery .
negative	no one does that anymore .
negative	this is truly the last time i '_m shopping with this company .
negative	i '_d rather spend a few_quid more to be treated with honesty .
negative	they sold me a £_000 cage for the degus which turned_out to be way too small .
negative	the reaction i '_ve got on this was that it is the rspca minimum .
negative	which it is not .
negative	they also seem to know nothing about them , constantly miss - sexing them so people end up with an unwanted litter .
negative	it '_s pathetic to see the animals in the shops in very small cages , and them being willing to sell them per one degu .
negative	always keep them in pairs .
negative	please do not buy from , thus promoting , this shop .
negative	i '_ve build my girls a really big cage , for less money than the cage pah sold me .
negative	i ordered stuff for christmas_presents & when they didn_'_t arrive within an order i emailed ... and then emailed again .. and again and again !!
negative	i have never recieved a reply , even after writing via snail_mail to find out where the missing items that i have already paid for are !!
negative	i am now trying to find out the contact details for the managing_director as i feel this is an appalling way to treat a regular customer !
negative	i have never had this problem before & i have been very pleased with my orders in the past .
negative	extremely disappointed & would warn_others not to buy until they have sorted_out their customer_services ( a phone number to actually speak to someone would be helpful !!)
negative	i ordered this product on the advise from a nutritionist as i wanted a more protein intake , however after ordering the whey_protein online i discovered it contained milk and soy .
negative	on research before purchasing i did check the ingredients and it failed to list clearly that it contained milk and soy .
negative	i think this is a huge failure on their part and should be more clearly_written for the consumer .
negative	didn_'_t receive order , emailed over 0 times and didn_'_t get a reply had to phone them and was told i had to wait another 0_weeks to see if order turned_up , it didn_'_t .
negative	i then emailed them again several_times and yet again got no reply and had to ring them again .
negative	the replacement was eventually recieved well over a month after_placing the original order .
negative	will never use them again
negative	communication was very poor i have been charged for a cross_trainer i have still not received .
negative	first time ive bought blind from online and am bitterly_disappointed at the substandard quality of the roman_blind i received .
negative	0 different strings have came away in first few daysand mechanism for pulling blinds up and down isnt very smooth at all and needs to be played around with to get blinds down
negative	hello ,
negative	i spent_ages lovingly sorting photos for my photobook .
negative	it was meant to be a christmas gift .
negative	i chose a picture and text for the ' cover '
negative	when i recieved the confirmation of my order i looked at the photobook i had ordered .
negative	to my dismay the picture and text i had chosen for the cover was actually wrapped around front and back . this was not clear when i was choosing .
negative	the text therefore did not make_sense .
negative	i rang the helpline immediately but was told that once you have ordered on line no changes could be made .
negative	i begged them to at_least just remove the text , but no .
negative	the book is lovely but there is no way i can give it as a gift as the text looks ridiculous and makes no sense .
negative	feel_cheated
negative	i bought a bottle of bey once heat rush and when you press down the diffuser top the perfume just runs down the bottle and doesn_'_t spray out .
negative	we would not use city_link ever again worse company in our all_aspects .
negative	it would be too rude to state what we really think of them ..........
negative	i have recently order the big moving pack plus from this website and i have only received part of the package with no tapes and no pen .
negative	i have called their costumer services many_times during different days and no one pick the phone up .
negative	this is cost me another 0 pounds to buy tape and of course time which was more important to me .
negative	as i wanted to have everything ready at the same time , thats_why i have ordered them online .
negative	i am not happy with my purchase at all .
negative	i bought my friend some flowers ,
negative	from iflorist , a wonderful deal !
negative	i thought how lovely they looked online ,
negative	could not wait to see them for real .
negative	however dear friends , guess_what !
negative	the flowers , they never arrived ,
negative	my friend stayed late at the office ,
negative	so i tried and i tried and i tried ,
negative	to ring the iflorist people
negative	to ask them " where are my flowers ??"
negative	i '_d had my conformation_email
negative	and my friend waited at her work for hours !
negative	but nothing !!
negative	not even a phonecall !
negative	!
negative	they took my money , and me , for a fool !
negative	i wish to now receive my refund
negative	and i wish i hadn_'_t shopped there at all .
negative	you could have at_least tried to phone me !
negative	to let_me know that you guys had gone wrong !
negative	yes ok there may have been trouble with snow and the weather
negative	but then tell me this before the whole day has_gone !
negative	you say it was down to the snow
negative	and deliveries not made on time !
negative	the for the love of god let your customers know ,
negative	because that was your problem not mine !
negative	i could have made other arrangements ,
negative	now i '_m just a mum short of dough ,
negative	please issue me now my full_refund
negative	or its off to the papers i '_ll go !!
negative	!
negative	placed an order online over 0wks ago .
negative	received an_email a week_later telling_me order being delivered that day , over two_weeks and several emails chasing , still no delivery .
negative	no response to my emails .
negative	unable to get through by phone as constantly in a queue .
negative	the worst customer service i '_ve ever_experienced .
negative	haven_'_t refunded by unreceived order despite multiple emails requesting this .
negative	after explaining to the sales_person that the delivery address was different from my card address and that i did not live at the delivery address i then received a message_telling_me that my parcel a table_tennis_table was being sent by royal_mail !!
negative	yesterday i received this link to leave comments about the service but having not received the item this was impossible to do .
negative	at 00 . 00 this morning a driver rang me waking me up to tell me we will be there in 00 - 00_mins i explained that someone would be there around 00 . 00 or that i could advise them of a secure area .
negative	after discussion they said they would ask their office to call me after 00 . 00 five_minutes later i then had their office on the phone .
negative	i had finished work at 00 . 00 the night before .
negative	there was no communication between the company and the delivery company whatsoever .
negative	ordered a tyre on thursday went to have it fitted on saturday
negative	got to the garage and the tyre had , ent arrrived was then told it would be monday before it would arrive .
negative	cancelled order and will never be dealing_with this company again .
negative	unreliable to say the least .
negative	i paid for a ' queue jump ' service but the company had my ipad for over 0_weeks and kept using the excuse that they were waiting for supplies of screens to arrive !
negative	each week they advised a shipment was due but then apologised because it didn_'_t arrive !
negative	i arranged to collect my ipad but was told that i would still lose £ 0 . 00 for delivery because that '_s what it says on their website !!!!
negative	still_waiting for a refund - i would definitely check reviews of a company before i use them in the future - this company is using false_advertising my saying they can repair your item within 0_days !!!!!!
negative	do not use them if you want your device repairing quickly - or not repairing as was my case !!!
negative	i am a genuine customer of repairs0 - and have documented emails to prove their inability to repair my ipad .
negative	i ordered fairy wing from party_domain and it broke from the middle when i was trying it on . i sent an_email to their customer service department and they apologized and asked me to send a picture of broken wings . i tried sending them an_email with the picture on the same email address and each time i got message failure delivery report . i think they blocked my email address to balk any further email correspondence . worst quality product and worst customer service .
negative	money grabbing , rude and completely unhelpful .
negative	zero_stars for cashbee .
negative	my partner is still_waiting for his payment of £_000 for his dvds .
negative	they '_ve not responded to any emails , we '_ve heard_nothing .
negative	if we do not hear from them by the end of the week we will be reporting the company to trading_standards .
negative	i '_ve read so many bad_reviews , don_'_t use them , we never will again .
negative	spread the word , these companies should not be allowed to get away with it .
negative	please , please fill out an online fraud complaint form about them and maybe we can stop them from trading / scamming .
negative	wont_be ordering from them again .
negative	my sister is going through a tough time and i wanted her to have the flowers to cheer_her up . really disappointed .
negative	where did the flowers get delivered to ????????
negative	my sister hasnt received them
negative	poor service
negative	last friday i was trying to purchase eminem tickets for wembley_stadium .
negative	after trying a few_times i managed to get some and enter my details and paypal details , only after i had completed this the web_page then came up the tickets were no_longer available .
negative	00_minutes later i received an_email_saying that the tickets had been brought and the funds were leaving my account !!
negative	by this time i had already brought some tickets from another website as viagogo had said they were not available .
negative	i called viagogo straight_away and they refused to admit that something went wrong with the site and that they would not give me a refund and they told me the only way to get my money back was to re sell the tickets .
negative	.
negative	massive problem with this is i will loose money if i re sell the tickets and when i check the tickets i brought ( even_though they told me they had sold out !!)
negative	it wont give me a row or seat number making it virtually_impossible to re sell them !
negative	it also still says the tickets are not available . they also told me that the tickets were from a 0rd_party seller and that they have to contact them to get my money back which is absolute lies because the third_party seller does not receive the money for the tickets until 0_days after the event !
negative	just to make things even better they e_mailed me today saying the time of the concert had been changed from 00 : 00 to 00 : 00 .
negative	i called wembley to confirm this and they told me ever_since the concert was first announced it started at 00 : 00 and that viagogo had made a mistake .
negative	so now even if i did decide to use the tickets i wouldnt be able to make the show at 00 : 00 because i dont finish work until then .
negative	viagogo does have a disclaimer on the website saying that times are subject to change but im_sure this does not count when they out the wrong time in the first place and the actual venue has never changed the time !!!!
negative	!
negative	i want my £_000_pounds back and it looks like the greedy people at viagogo are just going to keep hold of it and mess me about for as long as it takesand fob me off with different reasons as to why i cant have it back every time i call customer_services .
negative	stay well away buy tickets from direct site !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	my order id is 0000000 .
negative	i am_furious .......
negative	paypal is not regulated like a bank .
negative	therefore they sometimes do whatever they want with your money .
negative	they shut_down business and charity accounts and keep all the money .
negative	don_'_t keep any money on paypal .
negative	withdraw it as soon as your money is received .
negative	parking at edinburgh_airport is expensive and a big rip_off i would estimate for each space they make around £_00 , 000
negative	if i could give no stars i would !
negative	avoid this company !
negative	i was on hold for 00_min and then they hung_up on me .
negative	now i am 00_min and counting .
negative	their bills are indecipherable .
negative	their customer service awful .
negative	their final_bill doesn_'_t show where the figures are coming from and i can '_t speak to anyone !
negative	i had to cancel my order due to £_00 delivery charges , while other_companies only charged_£ 0 price for item same as this company .
negative	outrageous price £_000 just to change a name on a ticket , would be better for them to charge a sensible price as on that principle i will not cancel my flight to allow them to get another lot of money for flight
negative	i was told my guitar was in stock and would be delivered in 0_days .... a week_later ive cancelled the order .
negative	they are very polite in their incompetence .
negative	i was given 0 different delivery dates , none of which saw the arrival of my guitar .
negative	i am very very unhappy .
negative	i have made a complaint ..... no reply as yet !
negative	the company tried delivery on the correct day .
negative	i then tried to arrange for me to collect from their depo - the phone number on the card was wrong , when i managed to get the right number , i was told the parcel number was also incorrect .
negative	phone staff eventauly sorted .
negative	i went to the depo the net day to be told the parcel wasnt at that depo ,.
negative	but at another , so i drove there ..... guess_what - yes it was at the original depo ... i have to drive all the way back again ... even the staff at yodel said their service was awful !
negative	i have emailed 0 times to request a refund of the vat but as at this morning bnobody has responded .
negative	i have not received my goods they appear to have got lost in the post .
negative	i am expecting somebody to get back to me today
negative	i ordered a dress from boohoo for the very first time .
negative	i realised within 00_minutes that i had order the wrong_colour .
negative	i e_- mailed their customer_services within 0 hour
negative	of placing the order .
negative	i received an e_- mail back telling_me that i couldn_'_t cancel the order but that i could return it as soon as it arrived and that it would take 0_weeks for the money to go back into my account .
negative	well boohoo make the most of that money because i will never place another order with you again .
negative	absolutley disgraceful service .
negative	as for the dress it was made with very poor material and looked cheap .
negative	i booked online on wednesday_afternoon 00 march for an mot on friday 00 march and was told it was booked in for the pm and my credit_card was charged .
negative	later in the day i received a phone_call saying that there was no availability on friday but they could fit it in on monday .
negative	i confirmed whether , as the system is not live , you do not charge the credit_card until the booking is confirmed which is what i would expect .
negative	i was told that i had been charged .
negative	this was extremely inconvenient as i had to arrange for a refund and then find somewhere_else to do it late in the day when i thought it had been sorted .
negative	i have not checked my statement to see if the refund has_been processed at the time of writing this .
negative	flowers turned_up on the 00th despite the guaranteed 0pm delivery for the 00th !!
negative	they were dead and the sorriest flowers i '_ve ever_seen .
negative	totally_ruined my valentines_day ...... and they had the audacity to include a £ 0 gift voucher !
negative	their phone lines are " busy " live_chat is definitely not live !
negative	i want a refund .
negative	i will never ever ever use this company again !
negative	awful experience .
negative	i really have no idea why this company has a 0 . 0 rating !
negative	some of the hen_party arrived early as we were going to decorate it before the hen arrived .....
negative	instead of a luxury cottage or barn we were promised plus getting hyped up by the pictures online we were shocked to turn_up and see a shed which was infested with a wasps nest two showers inside yet couldn_'_t shower in both at once .....
negative	and in the middle of nowhere ....
negative	although our butler in the buff ( christian ) arrived and cheered everyone up from the shock of the shed / barn he was wonderful i '_d say best part of the hen_weekend .
negative	we were supposed to get free club_entry and vip treatment etc well when the hen_party turned_up at the nightclub not only did they not know who we were but the door staff insulted one of the girls to the point of crying her eyes out , when we told manager of this he stated it was only a laugh ..... not impressed ...
negative	so after 00_mins of him faffing_about he eventually let us in and shoved us on a table in the hall way far away from the dj and vip ....
negative	he was so rude it really upset all of us so we went back to our shed sorry barn house early ..... even had to book an ann_summers party during saturday because there was no activities available to us .
negative	the money we paid for this shambles is shocking deffo not worth the money never using chillisauce again and safe to say i don_'_t think the other girls will either ....
negative	what a flop ....
negative	but the goods were not suitable and were returned on the 00 / 00 /_0000
negative	i have the receipt from the postoffice .
negative	but have not heard_anything from physioroom regarding a refund .
negative	i would appreciate your prompt attention to this .
negative	you are rubbish .
negative	it took so long for my order to come which caused me a lot of trouble getting it to the intended person after they had gone back home .
negative	my second email was ignored and when i rang to say my order hadn_'_t come because
negative	" i can see it is lost in transit "...." i can refund you "
negative	no .. i still want the item .
negative	i was then promised next_day delivery and it took 0 day .
negative	i had purposely worked from home on the day i was suppose to get it to ensure i did get it .
negative	you need to get your act_together .
negative	never using the online / delivery service again !
negative	well shoppers , like everyone i love a bargain .
negative	i paid smartbuyglasses for some frames on 00 / 00 /_0000 , my first_attempt to pay by credit_card failed , so i opted to pay via my paypal_account ( one of my wiser moves ).
negative	on 00 / 00 /_0000 i sent an_email to see when my purchase would turn_up and did get a prompt response to say would be early next week .
negative	i then came on here & read the horror_stories so immediately opened a dispute with paypal .
negative	the response smartbuyglasses issued to paypal confirmed there was an even longer delay than they had indicated to my personal email so i swiftly asked them to cancel my order and refund my hard_earned_cash .
negative	luckily & " yey " for paypal i have received a refund today .
negative	i conclude : i do not think i would have ever received my intended purchase .
negative	i do not think smartbuyglasses are a legitimate or bona_fide company .
negative	i was contacted by my credit_card company about the " suspicious transaction " ( they obviously know something '_s up with this bunch ).
negative	without the beauty of paypal & my quick suspicions i believe i would have been duped too .
negative	the old addage of ......" if you think it '_s too good to be true " rings here .
negative	don_'_t touch with a ten foot barge_pole ( unless you '_ve got plenty time on your hands & money to burn ).
negative	i ordered , as a birthday_gift , what looked to be a beautiful_bouquet of pure_white flowers ( silver_lining ) on the website and to be absolutely sure the recipient would be delighted i ordered the next size up !
negative	perfect i thought .
negative	what was received bore_no resembalance in reality .
negative	i was disappointed and embarrassed .
negative	i obviously complained via_e_- mail to eflorist attaching a photo of the tiny bunch of mixed blooms and received a standard reply_stating that the customer_services team would get back to me after some 00_hours or up to 00_hours during busy_periods i . e mothers_day etc .
negative	0_days_later they responded with !
negative	.................' in this case i personally phoned the florist to get an exact stem price breakdown and the value is in fact correct , the large lilies are an expensive stem and she advises that the bouquet will look more impressive once they have opened .'
negative	we had two stems ( three heads ) of those very very expensive lillies delivered and i can_assure you - impressive they were not .
negative	i bought these for my mother who was in hospital to cheer_up her room .
negative	they arrived_safely and when i unpacked them the orchids were beautiful .
negative	however rather_than a spray of steel grass to balance the arrangement there was a solitary leaf which looked ridiculous on its own and was swiftly removed before i arranged them in a vase for her .
negative	i visited the next_day - less_than 00_hours on from receiving the flowers and they had dropped completely and wilted so much that we had to throw them out as they were well and truly dead .
negative	very disappointing and i would not purchase these again nor be able to recommend them to anyone_else .
negative	shop with caution .
negative	avoid this company like the plague .
negative	they are useless .
negative	we waited for our internet_connection to be turned on for 0_months .
negative	they kept saying " it will be on by next week "... gone to bt now .
negative	company asks for copy of passport to " validate " order .
negative	when questionned , no response received ever .
negative	they continue to send newsletters but never respond to emails - am unable to cancel my order now , they have left it in limbo and are not refunding me .
negative	they took my money immediately after ordering and can not get through since , even on their phoneline .
negative	absolutely_disgusting service , trading_standards will be informed .
negative	do not use them .
negative	i scoured the internet last_week to find an online florist who could deliver flowers to my mum in shropshire on mothering_sunday .
negative	i had the misfortune to find and use prestige_flowers .
negative	i ordered the bouquet and paid for delivery on the sunday .
negative	the flowers did not arrive on sunday and as of tonight still have not arrived .
negative	i have corresponded with prestige_flowers by email and by telephone in a futile attempt to find out what has happened to my order .
negative	i was told that the flowers are with the courier company and have been since saturday 00th .
negative	when i asked when they would be delivered i was told that unfortunately the tracking_information had not been updated on screen and that therefore they could not tell me .
negative	i then asked about the ' 000_% satisfaction_guaranteed ' slogan emblazoned across their website alongside the ' guaranteed sunday delivery .'
negative	i was then questioned as to whether i had read the terms and conditions of these guarantees ?
negative	really ?
negative	either you can guarantee delivery or you can '_t , simple no ?
negative	apparently not .
negative	i was told that the guarantee does not cover the ' 0rd_party courier ' ( and yet they deliver don_'_t they ?!)
negative	that it is not their responibility if the flowers have not yet arrived .
negative	i '_m pretty sure that i placed an order with and paid money to prestige_flowers , not a courier company !
negative	i then requested to the cancel the order but was told it was not possible as the flowers were with the courier .
negative	however , if the flowers were delivered more than 0_days late , i would be entitled to a refund on delivery cost !
negative	oooh goody .... withered flowers delivered 0_days after the special_occasion ... my lucky mum !
negative	anyway avoid using this company .
negative	they take no responsibility for their own orders and do not even apologise to their customers .
negative	edit_: having read the ' positive ' reviews i note that these were uploaded before the orders were delivered .
negative	i wonder_if the people who have a given a good rating had their flowers actually delivered on the right day and in good condition ?
negative	would be interesting to know if anyone actually received their flowers on mothers_day .
negative	having ordered flowers as a surprise for a friend '_s birthday , i was pleased to receive emailed updates of progress through to confirmation of delivery at 0 . 00am .
negative	i was concerned not to receive her usual message of thanks & eventually had to ask if she had received them .
negative	despite the confirmation of delivery , no flowers had been received .
negative	i had to email the complaint only to be told , through a convoluted contact process , that it could take up to 00_hours to investigate with the courier .
negative	0_days_later my friend told me that the flowers had been delivered - no message of apology , explanation or acknowledgement that the surprise had been spoilt and missed the birthday by 0_days .
negative	certainly not the level of customer service likely to result in repeat business which is disappointing since i was a third time customer .
negative	i wonder now whether the other deliveries ever arrived since i did not double_check at the time .
negative	i have just been contacted by serenata with an_apology and an offer of refund or fresh flowers .
negative	i requested the fresh flowers - just hope they arrive !
negative	update -
negative	having received a message at 00 . 00am to say that the replacement flowers were on the delivery vehicle and a further confirmation as follows_:
negative	" confirmed at : 00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 ( this can sometimes be quite a bit later than the actual time the flowers arrived )"
negative	i am not surprised to say that the flowers were actually delivered at 00 . 00 in the evening !
negative	my advice to serenata ?....... dump yodal as couriers .
negative	they are useless !
negative	sorry to say that i will not be using serenata again as long as they use yodal for deliveries .
negative	i had a bed delivered late and then they only part delivered my divan_bed .
negative	the base was 0_days late and then the mattress over a week_later .
negative	the base was damaged and the mattress when it did arrive was is in a disgusting condition .
negative	it was dirty and had oil on it !!
negative	the delivery guy refused liability .
negative	avoid using this company at all costs .
negative	i have requested a different company to send my items back and for a full_refund .
negative	my consignment_number is zwadjf000000 and the delivery guys name unless he have me false_information was david edward
negative	beware food ordered and paid for did not arrive .
negative	could not use live_chat on just eat as too early in the evening .
negative	drove to the takeaway which was closed .
negative	when i contacted just eat they did appologise and told me that the money requested from my bank_account for the meal would be put back within 00 days and any concerns should be taken up with the take away .
negative	likewise the take away told me to take the matter up with just eat .
negative	unbelievable i will not use again .
negative	even i brought an android_tablet from them via wowcher .
negative	haven_'_t received it yet !
negative	( almost 0_months ) i '_m waiting them for long to get reply my emails .
negative	i just contacted wowcher via_email and phone , when i called day by day they asked me to wait .
negative	and then i sent mails no reply from them .
negative	last_week i sent another mail asking to refund me back wowcher is keep silence .
negative	wonder is since two_weeks , when i logged to their web application , vivacitystores mentioned that items were shipped .
negative	and last_week i received a mail ( auto generated ) from vivacitystores asking that feedback ( thank_you for your recent_purchase !
negative	as we appreciate your business and value your satisfaction , please take a moment to visit the link below to submit feedback on all items in your order ).
negative	i dont_know_whats_going on but i '_m really frustrated .
negative	doesn_'_t deserve a star .
negative	terrible to non - existant service .
negative	stay away from this store and save_yourself a whole load of grief .
negative	completely unprofessional and untrustworthy .
negative	updated : just wonder wowcher , you are able to reply this post within 00min , but you have mentioned that 0days mails to be checked ??????
negative	again you are in a tablet deal , and already 0000 items sold , please dont_miss these customers toooo ... :(
negative	even i brought an android_tablet from them via wowcher .
negative	haven_'_t received it yet !
negative	i '_m waiting them for long to get reply my emails .
negative	doesn_'_t deserve a star .
negative	terrible to non - existant service .
negative	stay away from this store and save_yourself a whole load of grief .
negative	completely unprofessional and untrustworthy .
negative	unfortunately my save the dates have yet to be delivered and were ordered in april , when i highlighted the problem to brideandgroomdirect someone offered to track the delivery ( they were very polite on the email they sent ) ... however still no save the dates have arrived , if this was my wedding_invites and we were close to the date this would cause major_concern and stress so i don_'_t know that i would be confident ordering my main invites like i was intending to which is a shame as there are lovely products on the site .
negative	my order number is f0000c0000 - 0
negative	kind_regards
negative	lauren quick
negative	i ordered a bed online taking use of free , next_day delivery .
negative	due to the fact that it come '_s anytime during the day i took the day off work .
negative	i got a call about 00 . 00 from what i presumed thier delivery service saying that one of two packages were to be delivered today whilst the second would not be delivered untill the next .
negative	as i work during the week i would not be able to accept delivery of the second item .
negative	i was them prompted to ask neighbours or friends to accept delivery which was not only rude in presuming to trouble neighbours they also work during the week
negative	.... yes a weird and shocking truth .....
negative	after a long pause i then said to leave the second package which appartly contained the headboard by our bins outside hoping that no - one would steal it .
negative	after this was agreed i then was asked to ring matteressman to tell them i had " agreed " to leave it outside and that i would leave a note on the door .
negative	... why i had to call mattressman over thier mess up i don_'_t know ...
negative	so i waited the remainder of the day inside waiting for the delivery of package number 0 ..... no such luck .... no phone_calls or email ... nothing ..
negative	my boyfriend got back from work at 0 . 00 and tryed to ring but mattressman '_s custumer support close '_s at 0 . 00 but he manged to get_hold of a person on their order service who said they would leave a message for their custumer support when they got in , in the morning ..
negative	he got a phone_call at 0 . 00 the next_day saying that i had agreed that both packages would arrive today , which he immediatly say no only the second was agreed reluctently the first was ment for yesterday .
negative	after a bit more dissusion and he was assured that thier would be no compensation for our dissappointment .
negative	he rearraged both packages for the morning after next between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00 and booked the morning off .... which as we all no very easy to do ...
negative	all arraged or so we thought as both packages arrived the following_morning at 00 . 00 , very luckly i was just about to leave for work so i got them inside .
negative	not only that , but the box '_s were in very bad condition with wood showing through .
negative	but i had the bed now phew i was not letting go .
negative	i text my boyfriend who was in shock and promptly rang mattressman explaining that again was not as planned and that i was made late for work in recieveing the bed .
negative	after a quick discussion with thier custumer support they gave a £_00 refund .. wow .. after all that hassle after buying a wooden bed for £_000 .
negative	still better_than nothing but just not good enough .
negative	when my boyfriend made the bed , the eneviatable scratchs were found but i have a bed now .
negative	so sorry mattressman i was let_down in a big way , never again .
negative	let '_s not even mention i tryed to pay online and it did not work and had to do it over the phone in the morning .
negative	was advised by my neighbour ( whom i purchased the flowers for ) that after 0_days they had wilted and were dying .
negative	i have taken photos and e_- mailed them to you and am now awaiting a prompt reply .
negative	am feeling very embarrassed by the whole situation and completely dissatisfied .
negative	hate it when clothes companies use this courier service is it cheap to use or something ?.
negative	anyway the company is always slow with delivery took them 0_days to get back to me when i emailed them asking where a parcel was .
negative	whilst dispatch was prompt and the packaging good i am dismayed by the returns within 0_days policy
negative	this means that despite it being the festive_season and thus public holidays , i cannot return what i ordered
negative	i will not use this company again
negative	my invites had evening venue missing and spaces where shouldn_'_t of been ..
negative	also missed " and " at front of invite .. just wrote our names .
negative	we went for a sight_seeing weekend with our two children .
negative	yes it was raining but there was no excuse for health and safety issues , the staff were cramming people onto the bus even_though there were no seats or safe standing areas left , people were allowed to stand on the stairs which left you having to come down on the narrowest of stair area .
negative	prams were put against doors so you could only enlight from the front doors next to driver .
negative	i have written to the company but feel as if i was just dis regarded and have had no reply back off them on my second correspondence to them .
negative	i would never use this company there are other_companies that do exactly the same .
negative	they were not packing the customers on and there were more buses for certain other_companies so if you are considering using the bus service do not use big_bus_tours .
negative	i ordered these flowers based on the photo on the website , which showed a reasonably sized , open bouquet containing large lillies .
negative	what was received was the type of flowers you would pay £ 0 for in a petrol_station !
negative	they were a small , cellephane wrapped bunch which did not even contain the flowers depicted in the image .
negative	i was really unhappy with the quality & content of the order & would not recomend this comapny to anyone because of this .
negative	00days and still no news on my phone .
negative	send to be fixed for water_damage , no reply to my numerous_calls and emails , have only had limited contact via the instant_messaging service after much persistence .
negative	i am losing money by not using my contract and fear my phone will never be returned to me .
negative	please rotten apple give me some information , my order number is # 0000
negative	awful company , terrible communication and service .
negative	do not use
negative	bought a reg from car_reg , for childs 00th_birthday .
negative	all arrived 0_days after purchase .
negative	posted documentation off to dvla in swansea was advised would have reg documentation back before 00th_july as this was the birthday .
negative	i rang swansea on the 00 july was told sorry it will be 0_weeks and yet car_reg told me at_least 0 to 00 days .
negative	very cross customer !!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i have use van mildert online twice and on both_occasions the items arrived in really bad condition . both_times the items looked like they had been packaged by children with no effort and screwed_up .
negative	as the two orders were for presents this was even more dissapointing . im aware the postal servicw may take some responsibility but the inside packaging was poor aswell .
negative	on thursday i ordered a wonderful basket for the anniversary of some very dear friends , to arrive on saturday .
negative	as they live in what is sometimes classified a ' remote_area ' i even emailed eflorist to check they would be able to deliver .
negative	eflorist was very happy to take my money but did not bother to reply to my email .
negative	on saturday , when the basket was to have been delivered , i received a phone_call to state that they were unable to deliver as the florists had no flowers and would have none till later in the week !
negative	i immediately phoned a florist in the nearest_town , 00 miles_away , to arrange a delivery - which of course , due to eflorist '_s inability to get back to me would now be very late for the anniversary .
negative	this florist told me they had loads of lovely suitable flowers and greenery and twigs so it would be no problem at all , unfortunately they could only deliver by courier tuesday to friday .
negative	so the flowers will be three_days late but at_least now my friends will receive some anniversary flowers - absolutely no thanks to eflorist .
negative	so , no , i would never even consider_using them again , even if the recipient lived in the middle of a large town .
negative	i have given one star only for unreasonable conduct as i feel very strongly they should have notified me much earlier of their inability to deliver and also they should have had the courtesy to reply to my email .
negative	have been travelling for over 00yrs worst flight , wrote to virgin about flight ... no response !
negative	!
negative	having placed an online order four_weeks_ago , it was only when i emailed them that i was informed my order had been cancelled .
negative	i will avoid this company in the future .
negative	i wish i had read all the negative_reviews before i placed my order .
negative	avoid_avoid_avoid
negative	on 00 august i booked the night of 0 december_0000 and the night of 0 december_0000 through you and am quite horrified that you required my full payment so far in_advance .
negative	i have never come_across this before .
negative	we needed accommodation for those nights but were totally unprepared for paying the full payment so far in_advance .
negative	a deposit , yes , quite understandable but the full_amount ...!
negative	i must have been mad to pay it , but i did .
negative	how stupid am i !!
negative	!
negative	i purchased a tp forest double swing from wicken_toys .
negative	on constructing the swing i noticed one of the wooden legs was split on 0 sides measuring 00cm and ending in a splintered point .
negative	i contacted wicken and was told the split looked normal and wood will shrink / expand with the weather .
negative	i sent a further e_- mail and photo '_s and had to contact wicken for an answer as they failed to reply in a timely_manner .
negative	again i was told they will not replace the leg due to the splitting was part of the charactistics of wood .
negative	as the leg was like this from delivery i do not except their answer of weathering .
negative	i have had to tape the leg up to stop my children receiving splinters from it .
negative	wicken state the swing should be checked for splinters and sanded down on a regular_basis , if i were to attemept to sand the leg i would have to sand half the leg away to remove the split and splinters .
negative	very poor service and i would not recomend wicken_toys .
negative	this has destroyed my faith in online purchases of such items .
negative	i ordered a dvd from zoverstocks through playtrade , i was told it had been sent out the same day .
negative	two_weeks_later it still hadn_'_t arrived but they were insisting it would arrive any minute .
negative	nearly 0_weeks_later they finally tell me that it never passed final quality inspection and i '_d been refunded !
negative	!
negative	booked at 0 :_00pm last night and when i arrived at car_park they had no evidence of my booking which held me back from getting to the airport and also had to leave my keys with them in case they didn_'_t get your email which further holds me up on my return_journey as i will need to call into the office for my keys - not a happy customer
negative	after people i know saying how good it is i thought i should try it .
negative	we ordered a large margarita pizza and garlic_bread with cheese and it took almost 0 hours to get here .
negative	when it did it was cold and all the cheese had been stuck to the lid as it had been chucked about in the car .
negative	the delivery driver had his car music blaring out which woke my neighbours children and he left it on whilst he came to the house !
negative	the pizza was so thin and burnt round the edges and it cost me a fortune !
negative	never again would i order from here .
negative	its awful !
negative	email said product has_been dispatched yet 0_days_later it has still not arrived .
negative	such a disappointment as it was a special surprise for my children .
negative	hopefully it will arrive at some point and i will be able to rate more favorably .
negative	should be banned by the government with immediate_effect as it is a danger to society !!
negative	!
negative	i used to buy a lot of my clothes from here , but no more as they are so expensive and the quality is poorer than ever before .
negative	the above is the only good thing to be said , everything about this store is disgusting , the staff are the lowest of the low , as is the atmosphere and quality of the premises .
negative	what a rubbish company , goods , cleanliness of stores , customer service all rubbish .
negative	i contacted first_utility on the 0th_january as they had increased my direct_debit without_any notification , which made me incur bank charges of £_00 for going overdrawn .
negative	today ( 0th_march ) i received a response and the offer to reduce my payments as they hadn_'_t raised a bill since september .
negative	i '_ve switched to a cooperative and obtained a fixed rate deal for the next 0 winters .
negative	i sent in monthly readings to first_utility , who did not use my electric readings as they were so low ... perhaps it could be the solar panels and the fact that i live in a sustainable house with low_energy needs .
negative	my total fuel bills are under_£_000_per year but this company thought it would be wonderful to up my direct_debit to £_00 a month .
negative	i guess it helps their profits .
negative	i anticipate the next battle will be a return of these monies owed ......
negative	steer away from them as you can end up paying way too much for fuel you don_'_t even use .
negative	update_: first_utility have noticed this review and kindly sent me an_email with a no reply address so i have no means of responding directly to them .
negative	i have been advised to send a copy of my bank_statement as evidence of my incurred bank charges but have no address to send it too as none provided .
negative	i am assured a refund will be given .
negative	i am also told to continue to pay my direct_debit and that any outstanding credit will be returned after a switch but the onus is on me to chase this money using , wait for it , the main phone number which is never answered unless you wish to sign up .
negative	i '_m cancelling my direct_debit and writing to my mp as this is the worst customer service ever .
negative	i am not a charity and certainly do not work full - time to shore up this companies profits .
negative	this has now been taken up by the ombudsman as no response to the formal_complaint logged on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	avoid_avoid_avoid .
negative	ordered hair products 0th_june and so far they have not arrived .
negative	i am not impressed .
negative	the dishwasher that we ordered was damaged on delivery .
negative	i do consider that the delivery team were aware of this by the way the left the damaged side away from view at the end of the kitchen , the speed that they asked me to sign the form and the fact that they would not return when called on their mobile ( literally just left ).
negative	the attitude of the staff was that it was only a damaged door !
negative	they demanded photographs and could not have been more unhelpful on the phone - even shouting at me to listen .
negative	the unit was rejected and a full_refund was requested .
negative	we have used the creditsafe system for anti money laundering id checks for about 0 - 0 years_now and have been generally pleased with the service , until recently .
negative	however since the check against the international pep ( enhanced ) register was introduced relatively recently we are finding more and more cases where the system will not produce a satisfactory id report for a client because it '_s flagged_up a possible match with someone of the same or similar name on the international pep register !!
negative	i have had 0 cases in the last_week ( both elderly farmers in their 00s - 00s who never leave the county ) where the system has flagged them up as possible peps - in one of those cases the surname was not even the same - my clients surname was andrew but it was flagging up a pep with a surname of andrews !
negative	this means we must now go back and get paper evidence of id - which is defeating the object of having the system !
negative	most normal people will not be international peps , therefore if the creditsafe system is going to check against the pep register it needs to find a way of fine - tuning the matching process more closely - perhaps exact name match and dob - otherwise this enhanced check is just creating more of a hindrance than help to its users .
negative	creditsafe - can you please do something about this !!
negative	!
negative	i recieved my order from tennisnuts fine , but i had an item missing ( wristband ) which i was then told it was out of stock .
negative	i responsed to their alternative , but since then i '_ve had no repsonse back in ages !
negative	in december_0000 we purchased 0 leather recliners from this company , also purchasing an extended 0 year_warranty , for several months we have been experiencing back pain when using them which is obviously here the stuffing / padding is breaking_down .
negative	as we had the warranty we contacted them , only to be told , not covered , read the small_print .
negative	i would advise people not to go_anywhere_near them , as there products are no good .
negative	never , ever go with three .
negative	i had a pay - as - you - go contract with them .
negative	my phone was stolen , so of course i asked them to cancel the sim and send a replacement .
negative	they said it would be there in 0 - 0_days .
negative	0_weeks_later the sim had still not arrived .
negative	i called again and asked what was going on .
negative	i was given some piss - poor_excuse about the request not going through , or technical_difficulties or some such rubbish .
negative	i then told them that i wanted to cancel my contract with them , and was told " oh that has to go through as a separate request , we can '_t do that until the cancellation of the other request goes through ".
negative	they promised to ring me within 00_hours to confirm it , which of course didn_'_t happen .
negative	i then rang them again and told them to give me my pac_code .
negative	long_story_short , i was passed from person to person , none of whom had a clue about any of my details or the story .
negative	you spend_ages explaining everything again and again ( apparently , they don_'_t possess such advanced technology as customer records and databases ) and they ask you to repeat your number each time .
negative	i told them that they should have records of my calls , and should know exactly_what had happened , and that i was with my friends at the time , and telling them all never to take out a contract with three .
negative	( this was true ).
negative	i also told them i would post this experience on every social_media and reviews site that i could find , hence this review .
negative	and then , after much wasted time that i '_ll never get back , when i finally got my pac - this actually made me laugh out loud - the woman had the gall to say " oh if you want to stay with us then we '_ll give you three_months ' free service "!
negative	not if you paid me , you poor , unfortunate employee of this scummy company !
negative	i reckon they know perfectly well that people realise they ' re awful , so they put the hooks in and make it as impossible as possible to cancel your contract .
negative	absolutely_disgusting .
negative	avoid them like the plague !
negative	we changed to first_utility in november_0000 on the basis that we could submit monthly meter_readings and monitor our usage .
negative	since then we have been unable to submit our electricity readings and have had to send them through via the ' contact us ' facility .
negative	we have been unable to monitor our usage of electricity as they don_'_t enter our readings onto our on - line account and , as a result , we haven_'_t been able to view any bills .
negative	we don_'_t know whether our direct_debit is sufficient to cover the charges and are worried we will receive a huge bill at some point - presuming they ever get to enter our electricity readings onto our account .
negative	we have tried_phoning their premium_rate number but are left hanging on for over half an_hour and we eventually give up .
negative	the problem seems to be that we have an old ' economy 0 ' meter that gives two readings ( day rate and night rate ) and their website does not appear to be able to handle two readings .
negative	our rates are the same for both readings as we no_longer have ' economy 0 '.
negative	i have suggested by email that i add both readings together and enter them as a single reading but have had no response from them .
negative	they are totally_incompetent and appear to have no experience or skill in the energy industry .
negative	i will have to write a letter of complaint to them as it is the only way i can get through to them .
negative	if that doesn_'_t work i will go through the energy ombudsman to see if they can resolve the issues .
negative	do not go to them unless you are confident your situation is straightforward and they can '_t mess up .
negative	trying to deal with talk_talk customer service is like some hideous test on a tv game show , can you keep your cool ?
negative	can you explain again without shouting ?
negative	can you make them understand without turning into a screaming guest on jeremy kyle ?
negative	well i failed the test after wasting hours of my life , almost every call ending in the talktalk operator saying they will put you through to someone_else and putting you through to the ' customer service ' survey from which there is no escape except to ring back and start the process all over again .. so now i '_ve reverted to bt , the price is the same and the service a squillion times better .
negative	i resent every_penny i have given to talktalk and would recommend that for your sanity you avoid this company like the plague .
negative	0 seconds after_submitting my order i wanted to amend the card i had selected as i realised it was totally_inappropriate .
negative	i was able to change everything except the card choice and customer service were for some reason unable to make the changes themselves either .
negative	very disappointing and actually very upsetting .
negative	in october_0000 , we found ( we thought then ) the furniture that we had been searching for ; reviews of ofl led us to feel that placing an order of £_000_+ was worth taking a chance .
negative	a mistake we will not repeat elsewhere and most certainly never again with ofl .
negative	do not buy from this company .
negative	the after sales care is non - existent .
negative	this is a reusme of what we experienced :
negative	order placed 0st_november_0000 ; a delivery time of 0_months was given which we felt was a long time but the furniture was just what we had been looking for so we decided we could be patient a little_longer ; after 0_months , we received an_email from ofl saying they had tried to phone us – a stupid lie when our phone displays missed calls and has an answer phone facility ; i called ofl , who advised me of a delay of about a month – no reason given .
negative	a month later , no contact from ofl – i called ofl ; they reported that they had no news on my delivery and would look into it .
negative	no phone_call was received .
negative	i also sent an_email requesting information ; i never received a reply .
negative	i went on to make 00 calls to ofl and was given a variety of excuses about the delay to my furniture , including : ‘ we ’ ve been badly_let_down by our suppliers but we are sourcing another_provider ’; ‘ its been put in the hands of the managers , they will call you ’ ( they never did ); ‘ we ’ ve got the bookcase but not the bureau , we wouldn ’_t deliver a part order ’ ( fair_enough except that in the end , neither item was delivered and i was told the book case had disappeared from the system ); ‘ the order is being shipped from china so it ’_s difficult to give an exact arrival date ’; ‘ the ship ’_s been delayed ’; ’ the warehouse is being relocated so the system isn_’_t showing what stock is available ’; i was even ‘ guaranteed ’ a despatch date at one point by one assistant , a statement which was described as ‘ inexplicable ’ by another assistant as ofl hadn_’_t received the furniture at that point .
negative	refunds were offered at various points but at the same time as suggesting the furniture we wanted was within sight which persuaded us to keep waiting ; an_error in hindsight .
negative	we were finally told , 0_months from the original order , that the furniture had not been on the ship from china .
negative	the assistant made a great show of saying this was not the information he had expected and apologised – then had the audacity to ask if there was anything_else we might be interested in from the company .
negative	ofl seemed clueless about the progress of delivery and appeared chaotic in their administration and communication .
negative	i am staggered that i received only one phone_call from them yet made 00 .
negative	i am staggered that i received no letters or emails from the company of apology or explanation .
negative	the casual indifference of the staff made us think this was a frequent occurrence .
negative	the refund slip posted to us attached to an unsigned compliments slip says it all .
negative	they didn_’_t care .
negative	booking made through alpha_rooms invoiced for £_000 . 00 booking . com then deals with the reservation and tried to charge £_000 from my bank_account , called and advised difference in price was for tax & resort fee even_though rate invoiced advised no resort fee applicable to my booking , alpha_rooms emailed me confirmation to say room booked , contacted by booking . com to say it '_s not been booked my bank cancelled the payment for suspected fraud on my account as different fee been charged , had used alpha_rooms in the past after this experience won_'_t use again will book the hotel_direct it '_s the same cost as alpha_rooms invoiced
negative	i ordered for the first time last_week and the sign i ordered for my bar is incorrect as in the weights and measures page of the catalogue . i was told i would be called back and rectified but i still_haven_'_t heard from you .
negative	i bought a box go 00 glasses and 0 were badly_damaged so i requested a replacement but was told i could only have another 00 or a refund on the 0 ?
negative	!
negative	i needed specifically 00 for an event not 00 !
negative	so all in all i wouldn_'_t bother with another order
negative	terrible .
negative	the company is quick to take the money but refuse to refund the item within a few_days .
negative	i have been contacting them for the last_week .
negative	i called monday and there '_s an answer machine saying they are closed but they should be opened .
negative	stressful .
negative	terrible .
negative	would not recommended .
negative	dell_computer purchased 0000 with whatever happens cover
negative	friday 00th_oct - called to request repair - computer saying that hard_drive was about to fail .
negative	told repairs in the home were no_longer done – which we had never been informed about though this was the main_reason for getting the maintenance contract
negative	told pickup from home monday 00th return monday 00th_october_0000 - replacement hard_drive and copying all old drive info to new drive
negative	pick - up couriers called us from 0 miles_away as they could not find us and we had to talk them in road by road .
negative	return did not happen .
negative	neither the phone system nor the web_site recognised our repair reference_number
negative	tuesday 00nd_oct – phoned again .
negative	told that nothing had been done as we had not filled in the data_protection questionnaire or supplied any memory to copy the drive info on to as they cannot just copy straight from old drive to new one ( we had not been told anything about this in the first phone_call )
negative	went to the basingstoke shop that evening , started to fill in the form etc .
negative	the chap there ( wayne ) then called the repair people to be told it would take another 0_weeks for the copying which we felt was too long so we cancelled the copying part and were told the repair would be complete in a couple of days and the old hard_drive would be returned with the pc so we could have it copied over at the shop ( only takes 0 day ) and we would be contacted by the weekend .
negative	saturday 00th_oct
negative	called again as we had heard_nothing and were told that the repair was done and it was just awaiting final qc approval and would be with us friday 0st_nov
negative	return did not happen .
negative	saturday 0nd nov
negative	called again and was told that it was at the hub just waiting to be delivered but the depot had removed the 0st_nov delivery date for some reason and left it blank .
negative	registered a complaint with customer_services ref no cc0000000
negative	delivery of pc & old drive on wednesday 0th was assured .
negative	return did not happen .
negative	thursday 0th_nov
negative	called again and was told that the repair had not been done as they were waiting for a new motherboard , which was where the problem was , but they were having problems sourcing one .
negative	asked to call again next monday 00th_nov and if repair had not been completed a ‘ right - off investigation ’ would be initiated .
negative	after 00_hours we would be contacted re pc_world vouchers to replace the unrepairable pc .
negative	told we would only be able to have the hard_drive back – not the whole pc - even_though it has extra drive added by us and is our property .
negative	was also told that it would be possible to have cash instead of vouchers if we did not wish to buy another pc from pc_world .
negative	sunday 00th
negative	a lady called to say that the pc was repaired now and would be delivered to us on wednesday 00th .
negative	wednesday 00th
negative	computer delivered …………. at last !!!!
negative	!
negative	a new drive appears to have been fitted although there was no paperwork at all with the pc
negative	front_cover brokrn / missing from one disc drive
negative	no old hard_drive although we had been assured on several_occasions that it would be returned with the pc so that we could copy the information from it to the new drive at the basingstoke shop .
negative	called at 0 . 00_pm and spoke to steven , who said there was nothing in the notes about returning the old hard_drive !
negative	he said he would look into it and call me back in 00_minutes – he never called back
negative	we will see what_happens next , although i will guess nothing
negative	i got a new pair of shoes last_week worn them once and they fell_apart so i took then back to the havent store the manager was very ride and refused to give me my money back she could not resell them again , which of course she cant resell them they fell_apart . better custmer service needed
negative	this company is diabolical !
negative	do not order from them .
negative	they are scammers .
negative	i placed my order for a samsung_galaxy mini on 00 / 0 / 00 and they have still not even dispatched the item .
negative	they keep giving me excuse after excuse .
negative	i have emailed and called on numerous_occasions .
negative	they keep_fobbing_me off saying they have an issue in fulfillment .
negative	basically they are taking customers money in good faith saying they have adequate stock_levels but in reality they are building up a back log of orders so that they can purchase the phones when they have say 0000 orders at rock_bottom prices .
negative	they are liars and crooks !!!
negative	do not deal with valuebasket .
negative	i wish i had found this site before i purchased the phone .
negative	i was so bowled_over by the fantastic deal on offer that i should have thought logically , if something seems too good to be true it '_s because it is .
negative	i wish i '_d of paid the extra £_00 with amazon now .
negative	i '_m reluctant to cancel the order because i have a feeling it will take a lot of hassle and time to get my money back .
negative	so i '_m just waiting it out .
negative	they have me stuck behind a rock and a hard place .
negative	and that to me , being in sales myself , is the true measure of a company .
negative	ordering is simple , the collect_+ service is an excellent part of the process for those of us who cannot be at home on a specific day , waiting for a delivery to arrive .
negative	but ... the guaranteed next_day delivery isnt guaranteed at all .
negative	( the exception to this is if items are out of stock .. i understand that )
negative	i placed an order on december 0th .
negative	one of my items was out of stock and i was told it would be delivered the following week which was fine as it was still going to be before christmas .
negative	as it hadnt arrived by the 00th_december i checked my account and to my surprise , it stated that this item had been delivered to my home on 00th_december which was a sunday .
negative	i work all day on a sunday , so there was no way it was delivered to my house .
negative	there was no delivery card to say that an attempt to deliver had been made either .
negative	then the fun began .
negative	email no . 0 on december 00th ... email received back with a reference_number , to say my query had been recieved and i should receive a response within 00_hours .
negative	i didnt
negative	email no .
negative	0 on 00st_december ... email received back , with a different reference_number , saying the same thing , but with an additional note to say they may have to contact other people involved in the oreder / delivery process and to give them 00_hours to get back to me ....
negative	nothing !!
negative	!
negative	email no .
negative	0 on the 00rd_december ... yet again a generic_response saying my query had been received , and to allow 00hours for a response and with yet another reference_number !!
negative	its ridiculous ...
negative	i tried_phoning and despite_being advised by a robot voice to say my call would be answered within 0 minutes , i was on hold for 00 !!!
negative	( wonderful way of making extra money , well_done very )
negative	so !
negative	i am now on email number 0 and 0 , same crappy generic_response and lets just say i wont_be holding my breath .
negative	its now exactly a month since i placed the order , which by the way was a christmas_present !
negative	so not only do i not have my item , i had to go and buy another present !
negative	so i am out of pocket twice over .
negative	i wouldnt touch this company again .
negative	the customer ' service ' is appalling .
negative	quick to take your money , slow to resolve a problem ... or in this case not resolving anything at all ..
negative	utter_rubbish
negative	would never book with this holiday company again , after care service is very poor .
negative	complaints_dept is a joke !!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i was introduced from topcash and switched to npower back in november_0000 no cash_back left a ticket for them to reply and they say that npower should send commision over to topcash , npower state they have done this who do i believe just want what they said they would do .
negative	all bills have been paid could someone from cashback please chase this up .
negative	i regret to say i wasn_'_t treated nicely at all when i contacted anyvan via the phone
negative	they ladies i spoke to was just simply too rude
negative	i bought a knee_support on line .
negative	before i purchased it i contacted the supplier to confirm that it was not made of latex .
negative	the customer support person confirmed it was latex free .
negative	when i received the goods i found out that it contained latex .
negative	i requested a refund but never received one
negative	this company is the worst i have ever dealt_with .
negative	i work full time and am not allowed deliveries to be sent to my work so normally receive a delivery attempted card .
negative	inevitably the website won_'_t recognise my consignment_number so i usually end up calling them and hanging on the phone for 00_mins .
negative	they apparently won_'_t leave a parcel without a signature ( even thought the company sending the kit doesn_'_t request one ) but on the 0 occasions i have left a signed card out they have still failed to leave the parcel in the porch as instructed .
negative	last time i ended_up at the depot to collect and had to wait 00_mins whilst they retrieved it from the warehouse .
negative	there is quite a theme going on with regard to wowcher '_s poor service .
negative	it seems that woucher should be more choosy about the companies they are partnering up with !
negative	same here !
negative	paid in good faith but no goods received !
negative	simply not good enough !
negative	if enough of us write to watch dog we could save other people the misfortune of being out of pocket and unnecessarily stressed by wowcher and it '_s affiliate companies .
negative	it is a shame for the good companies that wowcher partners with ; might their reputation be affected ?
negative	we ordered from [_link_] in broadgreen liverpool .. our order contained meals and soups .. the food was not hot and the soup had burst_open all over the bag ,, i rang to complain and was told more soup was to be delivered .. no apology ... and soup did not arrive .. poorly run business .. i would not recommend it to anyone !
negative	i love just eat but will choose a different take away outlet next time ...
negative	update ... tried a different outlet .. jalalabad in liverpool .. waited nearly 0 hours but delivery man was apologetic and the food was absolutely_gorgeous !
negative	we had set meal for 0 with lamb korma .. massive portions .. couldn_'_t eat it all in one go !
negative	i would definitely recommend the jalalabad !
negative	thank_you justeat as we got 00_%_off via your site :)
negative	0_days of use and the fabric split .
negative	the company said it was not their responsibility and washed their hands of it .
negative	this is hard to believe when i still have a bean_bag from ikea bought 0 years_ago which is still completely intact !
negative	the product must be of very poor quality to break after 0_days of normal use , unless the split was already there .
negative	either way - i would have hoped for a more appropriate and helpful response from the company .
negative	i would recommend that you look elsewhere for your beanbag purchase .
negative	i placed an order for a remedy for chickenpox .
negative	now told they have issues with the supplier .
negative	not acceptable to me as selling this type of medice you would expect it to arrive faster given the nature of what it is for .
negative	totally unnaceptable , wish i had read_reviews before i ordered .
negative	a member of sainsburys staff stole my nectar_card , used up the points i had ( around £_00 worth ) plus points i didn_'_t have so that nectar_card has put minus seven odd_pounds on my card .
negative	sainsburys branch where this happened has_been reluctant to deal with this from the beginning although was forced to sack the staff_member once i contacted the police and kicked off a fuss .
negative	however , they refuse to take_responsibility of the theft ( ie their staff_members ' behaviour when he was still employed by them ) beyond giving me a £_00 gift card .
negative	i consider that they still owe me over_£_00 pounds (£_00 + less the £_00 ) and this matter has_been going back and forth over the months ; the last time i discussed this with someone there , the deputy manager didn_'_t even bother to come and talk to me but told his member of staff to tell me that i need to deal with this as it '_s nectar '_s fault and they need to give me my points back .
negative	how can it be nectar '_s fault even_though it wasn_'_t their staff_member who stole the card , used the points and was able to incur a debt on my card because sainsburys only update their nectar_points one a day !?!
negative	?
negative	to top this all , i now have over_£_0k worth of missed nectar_points as i haven_'_t been able to use my nectar_card .
negative	i guess i have to write a letter to the head_office although i already have spent hours trying to sort this out with the branch .
negative	more generally and on top of the above i have noticed that sainsburys constantly use incorrect ' comparison ' prices ( price per kg etc ) on labels .
negative	many of their customer_services staff have no customer_care skills and on many occasions even come_across arrogant and / or indifferent , leaving you waiting at the desk without even as much as acknowledging that you are there .
negative	i interpret sainsburys slogan " live well for less " to mean " live with less money as that '_s how our business practices leave you ".
negative	so , hardly a surprise i give sainsburys only one star .
negative	this has_been my worst online shopping_experience !
negative	the quality of the dress was appalling and was quite different to the online picture - it was unwearable , my daughter was in tears !
negative	the company did not honor their returns_policy .
negative	they asked me to send photos to justify the return ( which was fine ) on receipt of the photos they just kept saying that my daughter looked lovely so there was not a big problem and to wear a higher pair of shoes ( the dress had a train that was not shown on the website ).
negative	they then suggested that i take the dress to get repaired ( frayed seams , puckered lining poor workmanship etc ) and the changes made at a dressmaker and they would give a refund of 00 %.
negative	after a month of emails they offered a $_00 refund for a dress that cost £_000 for repairs - it would have taken £_000 plus to make this dress wearable - i am now trying to get my money back through my credit_card .
negative	please do not buy from this comapny
negative	i was a talk_talk customer before and left to join sky and pay £_00 more a month for customer service .
negative	i found the staff difficult to deal with and they continually and deliberately hung_up the phone on me one evening ..
negative	i complained and got my account cheaper but much as i love tt broadband for speed and efficiency but !!!!
negative	the customer service was appalling !!!
negative	my house got hit by lightening and had no phone line for over two_weeks , phoning for updates was horrific as you knew you would be patronized by an agent calling you by your first name and not understanding much more they said .
negative	very sad as great company with a lot of lovely people who you only get to speak to if !!!
negative	you ask to leave and only then do you get the problem sorted .
negative	tt is losing a lot of cash offering cheaper deals rather_than fix !!!
negative	the small problem and gain customer_satisfaction ..
negative	i am leaving sky because of terrible broadband that they cannot sort_out but excellent !!!
negative	customer service .
negative	i could have gone to a number of other_companies but have chosen to give tt the benefit of the doubt and try again .
negative	like other customers i will exercise my right to bide my time , see my contract out and change supplier again but hopefully tt has learned and moved on from the appalling customer service they had previously .
negative	rejoining online was effortless apart_from not being_able to use my normal email as they already had it and my emails will go to an account i do not use as they wouldn_'_t let_me reuse my primary and only email .. good company for cost but i like great customer service to which i am willing to pay extra for and uk call_centers where i do not have to repeat the same complaint to at_least nine different agents to get my fault sorted_out ...
negative	00 days after despatch and i '_m still_waiting in anticipation .
negative	been with them for years and they take away the loyalty_discount after 00months yet continued to charge me for my ' bolt ons '.
negative	they '_ve got customer service reps who blatantly lie in store saying o0 and tesco are no_longer in partnership .
negative	i signed_up to a £_00 contract that i '_ve paid £_00 and £_00 pounds for the last two months and now it '_s £_00 . 00 .
negative	you are better off on another network !!
negative	!
negative	they used to be great but i am deeply disappointed .
negative	we got to our hotel in bath and found out that this company had cancelled our stay and not even bothered to tell us !
negative	we had received a confirmation_email but the hotel had received nothing from hotel_voucher_shop about our booking .
negative	we tried to ring customer service but it is closed on a weekend which is pretty ridiculous for a travel company !
negative	we rang an_emergency_number for gullivers but they were pretty unhelpful and refused to speak to my boyfriend who made the booking .
negative	luckily we were able to get another room at the hotel so the weekend wasn_'_t ruined .
negative	so in summary , terrible customer service , we are in the process of making a complaint and hopefully we will get our money back and reimbursed for the voucher we used .
negative	do not buy from this company .
negative	scratches in panels , two of same door delivered , orange marks in wood .
negative	awful customer service and still fighting to get somewhere .
negative	now approaching citizens_advice
negative	i place my order on friday for delivery on saturday .
negative	the flowers didn_'_t arrive .
negative	sent email on saturday_evening .
negative	was ignored and sent another on sunday and still_waiting reply .
negative	as my daughters_birthday has passed and i have sent a bank_transfer so she can get her own i no_longer require your services .
negative	refund is the least i expect , she stayed in all day till 00 . 00 waiting .
negative	thanks for making it the day special for her .
negative	what a let_down .. avoid this company at all costs
negative	i would never use this company again , appalling service .
negative	they delivered a fridge to me , within a short time it became_clear that it did not work , they wouldn_'_t replace it but sent out an engineer to fix it two_weeks after purchase , the engineer couldn_'_t fix it and then when i asked for a replacement they said the engineer confirmed it to be working !
negative	two_weeks in this weather and with a 0 year_old daughter to look after and feed , and no working fridge !
negative	disgusting behaviour , they should be ashamed .
negative	if you shop at waitrose rather_than asda , you will not be happy with this company !
negative	not being_able to contact the company was a problem for me as i wanted to ask one or two simple questions .
negative	after emailing , my changes were not acknowledged so i had no idea what was going on .
negative	the invitations arrived quickly , but they weren_'_t square ( i could tell that with the naked_eye ) and the envelope stock was so poor that i had to line them or you could see the invitation through them .
negative	i would not use them again .
negative	i ordered 0 pairs of track pants on 00th_january_0000 .
negative	items were shown as " in stock " when order placed .
negative	now is the 00th_february and no order received .
negative	i contacted customer sevice by email after 00 working_days ie two_weeks advising the above information .
negative	they were very apologetic and advised the items had been received in their warehouse ( they ignored my comment that they were shown as being in stock when order was placed ) and were in the process of being booked in !
negative	they asked me to be patient as they generally deliver within 0 working_days .
negative	i replied that if i did not receive my order by next saturday ( this would be a further 0 working_days - 00 in total and three_weeks after_placing order ) they were to cancel my order and refund my money .
negative	i have now had a reply_stating exactly the same comments as their original email only in a slightly_different order .
negative	nobody listened , they just rattled off another email using set phrases .
negative	why or why do companies do this !
negative	customer sevice department indeed !
negative	- i don_'_t think so .
negative	i now have to wait and see what_happens but from this experience alone , i would never , ever use them again and i certainly would not recommend them .
negative	by the way , the status of my order when i log in states " processing ".
negative	i ordered flowers for my mother last_year , which were delivered on the date requested .
negative	however , they were wilting on arrival and only fit for the bin after 0 or 0_days .
negative	i contacted the company who sent a new bouquet , which was fine , and a voucher for £_00 .
negative	so i gave them the benefit of the doubt and ordered mother '_s day flowers a week_ago , to be delivered on saturday .
negative	i received an_email on friday confirming the delivery date with a link to tracking_information .
negative	it '_s monday_afternoon and the flowers still_haven_'_t been delivered ; the tracking_information hasn_'_t been updated since friday_evening .
negative	this company was still advertising mother '_s day delivery available yesterday .
negative	perhaps they should concentrate on fulfilling the orders they have already received instead of advertising for more business with which they clearly can '_t cope !
negative	i emailed them yesterday evening but still have not had a reply , although i can see they are replying on this site !
negative	!
negative	possibly the worst customer service i have ever had :
negative	- incorrect delivery times / information .
negative	- broken goods .
negative	- missing items .
negative	- unfair terms ( no replacement if you don_'_t notice damage within 0 - days of delivery
negative	- poor communication .
negative	- no attempts to compensate / take_responsibility .
negative	i was told before i placed an order that i would be called before anything was dispatched to arrange a convenient delivery time - this did not happy and instead delivery was attempted on a weekday when no - one was home to take delivery .
negative	when the sink was finally delivered it was broken in half .
negative	luckily we checked it the day following delivery but beware , the company '_s terms and conditions say that if you don_'_t notify them of damage within 0_days of delivery they won_'_t replace / sort_out .
negative	we then had to arrange to be in another day ( they don_'_t deliver on weekends ) so that the broken sink could be collected and a replacement provided .
negative	the tap was delivered on yet another day and eventually had to be delivered to our neighbour due to taps uk '_s inability to co -_ordinate deliveries .
negative	finally , when our builders came to fit the sink , we realised that it was missing the waste_baskets .
negative	we had not been able to check the box for these in_advance because the sink was so heavy we didn_'_t want to risk picking it up and dropping / damaging it .
negative	this not only delayed our build , but it later turned_out that taps uk had used a different supplier to the one they usually used and hadn_'_t bothered to check whether the waste_baskets would be supplied ( as they usually are by their normal_supplier ).
negative	despite this failing , we were told it was our problem as we should have checked for the items and ordered the sink even further in_advance ( we allowed 0_weeks when ordering ) to account for all these problems .
negative	the delay in supply of the waste_baskets delayed our build and , despite the fact we were promised next_day delivery of the waste_baskets and arranged for our builders to come_back that day based on that assurance , the waste_baskets did not arrive as promised .
negative	all our emails to the company seeking confirmation that delivery would take place as promised went_unanswered , causing yet further wasted time to our builders .
negative	our build was then delayed by yet another two_days due to the incorrect information provided .
negative	throughout all of this we were told that taps uk weren_'_t willing to offer us any compensation and that all of this was in line with their ts and cs .
negative	they say that they will get back to you within 0 hours , which is sometimes the case , but often not , a number of our emails went_unanswered for hours before i rang .
negative	the person i spoke to on the first number was unable to help me and said that every time i sent a further email , my issue got pushed to the bottom of the pile .
negative	she then gave_me another number which i rang and then spent over 00_minutes on hold to be told that the adviser in question was probably on his day off and that was why the emails hadn_’_t been actioned .
negative	it appears that no - one else had bothered to pick_up the emails in his absence and i eventually got a reply about 00_hours_later .
negative	cannot get through on phone , infact impossible
negative	payed extra fr fast delivery and didn_'_t arrive on time
negative	just checked bank_account and £_00 . 00 has_been taken out for an outfit costing_£_00 . 00
negative	fuming
negative	im a new customer that made a booking with you guys , everything was fine till i departure , never got the email at departure to rate the hostel , i was so happy about it but after a week i decided to contact hostelbookers asking about it , someone called hollie reply_saying email was sent , check your spam and they even said if i didnt book with them wont get the email what a retards ....... i eamil back and never got and answer .... customer service suck im wondering_why some hotels have tons of rates and the other ones dont ?
negative	do you have special preference for some hostals ?
negative	do you have another contract with them ?
negative	thats what i think after this expirience ..... but what its funny is at my booking they send me this link to rate hostel_bookers they are more more worry to be rate than the hostels so taking this link the only one you sned me im goona rate you !!!
negative	!
negative	shame i have to pick a start and no half of it
negative	never ever again !!!!!

negative	i bought and paid for 0 barstools totalling_£_000 . 00 .
negative	they took my money and sent an_email that confirmed despatch for delivery next_day .
negative	i waited in all day , when nothing had arrived i telephoned them .
negative	i was told it would probably be the next_day .
negative	so i waited again .
negative	i telephoned again at 0pm as i had a bad feeling something wasn_'_t right .
negative	i was asked to hold while they spoke to their manager , i was on hold for ages .
negative	i was then advised that the items were on pre_- order and would be delivered mid - january ( this was in november !).
negative	i had not received any advice to say this was the case , were they seriously going to keep my money til january and keep_fobbing_me off ?
negative	their website said the items were in stock when i ordered them - they even sent me an_email_confirming despatch !!
negative	i cancelled the order and waited 0_days for my money to be returned - much slower_than when they took it !!
negative	i ordered from [_external_reference_] who were a third of the price and delivered on time .
negative	i was rated 00 a night at a hotel !
negative	i booked it for 0 nights !
negative	i was charged 000 for a 0 nights_stay !!!
negative	highly disappointed !!
negative	!
negative	that '_s very unclear in the receipt the i received !
negative	and i was charged more than that !
negative	plus i have 0 more pending transactions from ebookers which i don_'_t understand !
negative	absolutely_shocking customer service - from order date to delivery took 00 days - still have not had any form of apology from the company - have asked for a refund of my delivery as a gesture of goodwill and they have refused .
negative	prices may be good - but make_sure your prepared to wait a long time for delivery and expect bad customer service .
negative	my photo_books have not arrived yet !
negative	flowers were brown on delivery , poor customer service .
negative	i ordered a brand_new flash yn - 000 from ebay , it was sealed and under_warranty .
negative	when i got the flash i found out it was faulty , it wouldn_'_t turn on most of the times even with brand_new batteries .
negative	just after three or four uses , i thought i should get it checked since it was under_warranty .
negative	so i sent an_email to hkyongnuo service and got a reply within a day or two to send the flash to mr . william lin at their hongkong office .
negative	after that i kept on sending them emails to inform_me when they receive my package .
negative	i got a reply after about two months saying that they still_haven_'_t received my package .
negative	then after waiting for almost 0_months i decided to contact royal_mail ( uk ) to file a claim for lost parcel .
negative	fortunately , i found william '_s skype id from his email , added him and found him online .
negative	he then told me that he had received my parcel a few_days ago and it was sent for repair .
negative	he also said that i would have to pay them 00 usd for sending the flash back to me .
negative	i paid it right away and got my flash back within a few_days .
negative	when i opened the package i found out they forgot to send the diffuser and the flash still had the same problem .
negative	when i emailed william to send the diffuser back , he said he '_ll send one for " free " if i am willing to pay the shipping cost .
negative	i replied_saying that it wasn_'_t my fault since he forgot to put the diffuser in the box and i have already paid the shipping cost , since then i haven_'_t gotten any reply from them .
negative	take my advice , never buy anything from yongnuo and don_'_t even hope for good or even satisfactory customer service .
negative	i bought some shorts for a birthday_present for my dad and it didnt come in the waxx tin or with a keyring which i have recieved with all the other purchases that have been made by my family .
negative	what a very bad_experience , never again !
negative	!
negative	the company advertised next_day deliver however after 0_days i contacted them who confirmed they had my order but had not got around to dispatching it yet !
negative	it then took another 0_days to arrive .
negative	when it arrived it was poorly packaged and broken .
negative	during communication with the company they implied there was nothing they could do , would not discuss any sort of recompense basically have very poor customer_care .
negative	i rejected the delivery ( much to the concern of the delivery company ) and subsequently received a refund without_any apology or attempt at customer_care .
negative	i chose the company because their image appears to be professional and caring – this is far from my experience .
negative	i should have listened to the other reviews that would have steered_me away from the company .
negative	after taking a week to arrive it turned_out one of the cartridges we ordered was not compatible with my printer , despite their website clearly saying it was .
negative	so i rang them to request a replacement or refund and was dismissed out of hand by the guy i spoke to because " the packaging had been opened ".
negative	maybe he could explain exactly how we were to find out that a cartridge they say is compatible , wasn_'_t without trying it in the printer ??
negative	?
negative	i ordered my item but received the incorrect thing .
negative	i contacted viovet who sent me back a return_label so that it could be replaced .
negative	unfortunately they then went and sent exactly the same thing back to me .
negative	i sent another email but did not receive a very quick response .
negative	the product was for my growing puppy and due to the time it was taking i was then forced_into using it as she had by this time out grown her original harness and i had to use something .
negative	viovet has not come_back to me ( i asked them to look into it ) so basically i got a harness in the style that i did not want & had to use it due to viovet not resolving the issue .
negative	:-( not impressed
negative	my biggest grip is with the flex hose orders i ordered and didn_'_t receive which you refunded my money as good will
negative	re ordered paid told it was ordered by email that it would be relived within ten days did this happen no and i '_m just putting it down as bad_luck as at the moment in time i don_'_t want to be doing emails back and fo so putting it down to bad_experience but won_'_t be ordering any item which has to come from the supplier
negative	wowcher deals with meals on the other hand are one good value and two quality and service were excellence if it was those i was reporting on star_rating would be far higher
negative	i am still_waiting for my parcel to arrive even if i am based in uk and a normal delivery should last aprox 0_days .
negative	i am not happy and the customer service team couldn_'_t help or provide a valuable solution . the only_thing that they said is to wait another 00 days the parcel should arrive
negative	this is not normal , i want a full_refund .
negative	i called consumer advice and reported this company since they had not delivered an item i ordered in february and a few_days_later i had a call from trading_standards .
negative	they told me they were in contact with decuisine , took my order details and said they would arrange a refund .
negative	do report them and make_sure you get your money back !
negative	i bought an item that never arrived .
negative	their delivery service had got it wrong and tried to deliver it somewhere_else .
negative	they could not deliver the item with a two week period of when it had been ordered .
negative	i '_ve since ordered the same item elsewhere which arrived the next_day .
negative	it showed me just how bad preciouslittleone '_s service is .
negative	not only did they fail to actually deliver the item , their communication was very poor .
negative	i had to chase them to find out what had happened and they only get back to you via_email .
negative	they were not even very apologetical .
negative	very frustrating as i needed the item quickly .
negative	i '_m still_waiting for a refund from these jokers .
negative	it '_s the worst company and customer service i '_ve ever_experienced .
negative	in what should have been a calm conversation relating to a recent_purchase , the advisor begun to get exceedingly rude when asked a question she had no answer to .
negative	her exact response was " well do you know the answer to everything ?".
negative	not exactly the response you '_d expect when asking an employee a question_regarding their service and company .
negative	the supervisor was equally rude in a dismissive tone .
negative	as a result i will not be buying anything from this company in the future and have actively told my friends not to either .
negative	poor service
negative	i bought two great looking bunches of flowers from this rip_off company to be delivered on weds before christmas .
negative	one bunch has still not arrived on boxing_day .
negative	the other bunch was christmas tulips with thistles .
negative	what actually arrived was two_bunches of white tulips that looked like they were on there last legs .
negative	( no thistles ) the tulips started dropping petals the day after delivery so went in the bin .
negative	after paying £_00 for two_bunches of flowers to recieve one bunch of poxy looking tulips is a complete_rip_off .
negative	i contacted the live feed for the company but after my initial reply to my complaint the live feed suddenly went off line after i asked for a full_refund .
negative	will give more detail when i have more time .
negative	well firstly on arrival in france my transfer never actually turned_up at the airport !
negative	i rang all numbers listed on my booking confirmation and received no answer which_resulted_in us paying 000euros in taxi_fare to the hotel .
negative	the next_day we rang the transfer company who told us we should have been given different information on the pick_up off resort_hoppa ( which we didn_'_t receive ).
negative	he then told us he would email resort_hoppa and tell them we need to be refunded .
negative	on returning home i rang resort_hoppa to complain and ask for a refund and they told me to email their customer_services ( who you can '_t contact via phone ).
negative	i have since emailed and phones numerous_times and been told that it will be delt_with shortly .
negative	they have even used excuses such as ' our customer_services team has just moved from spain to england so things are taking a bit longer ', which was a lie because in the phone_call prior to that the woman said customer_services were in the next room to her !
negative	!
negative	i wrote the complaint in mid_october and still have received nothing back now !!
negative	do not use the company unless you want to be stranded at an airport and waste your money !!
negative	!
negative	return_journey .
negative	return flight cancelled as they wanted to triple the price after booking .
negative	they then double charged for the outgoing flight ( after refusing to refund me ).
negative	to prove this i had to send them a bank_statement .
negative	they refunded me one of the charges ( out of two ) without bothering to tell me or answer my questions so right now i have no idea what remains booked and what doesn_'_t complete_joke .
negative	the flowers were nothign like they looked on the picture , and were in fact dead .
negative	as they were for a colleagues 00th_birthday , we then had to run_out and go to a local_florist to get some more flowers , therefore inconveniencing us .
negative	i will say that the customer service department was good - they asked for photographs and on recieivng them , did refund .
negative	however because of my bad_experience , i will not be using this company again .
negative	i was asked at the end of shopping what i needed the cream for i said vaginal thrush and what i received was oral thrush cream i cant_afford to send it back as i am a widow living on £_000_per week and it cost enough to buy it !
negative	i ordered a set of luggage on sunday .
negative	i checked my account and saw that it was " released for delivery ".
negative	then i got an_email from them on monday saying that my address hadn_'_t come through the ordering process and asked me to provide my address .
negative	i did so immediately .
negative	on thursday_afternoon i got an_email from them saying my order had been cancelled " because the items you chose were so popular they sold out faster_than our system could update ".
negative	when i complained i got an_email back saying they were sorry and my account would be credited with £ 0 . 00 to cover delivery on any future order .
negative	trust me i would never ever order anything from them again .
negative	what a shambles .
negative	it '_s the worst online ordering experience i have ever had .
negative	booked a collection for monday and was told they would collect between_0am and 0pm so i made sure someone was home all day .
negative	it got to 0pm and still no - one had been to collect the parcel , it is incredibly annoying to wait around all day and not get the parcel collected .
negative	at 00pm i opened the front_door to let my friend out , there was no card on the doorstep yet in the morning i found a card on the doorstep ( they couldn_'_t even be bothered to put it through the letterbox ) saying that someone had attempted to collect and that no - one was in .
negative	which is an outright lie .
negative	the card hadn_'_t even been filled out with details of parcel , delivery address , if they would return to pick_up another time or day .
negative	so i called yodel and they informed me that someone attempted to collect my parcel at 00 . 00 the night before which is not only a lie but it is also outside of the time of collection they stated .
negative	if you can avoid it , don_'_t use this company to collect parcels .
negative	completely_incompetent and unreliable !
negative	i waited in as given the hour_slot .
negative	usually they turn_up and give a good service .
negative	however today they did not turn_up , no calling_card , nothing .
negative	i read on there tracking site that they had called and i was not in , they had left a calling_card .
negative	i rang them , quite politely informed them that this was not so .
negative	they had the nerve to tell me the the van_driver had called and left a calling_card .
negative	they claimed they had proof and had taken a photograph .
negative	i asked for this to be forwarded .
negative	surprise it was a picture of another house , no apology just an expectation that i would be in tomorrow and lose money waiting for them to probably get it wrong again .
negative	in august we purchased a hotpoint dynd0000 washing_machine .
negative	the weekend before christmas it stopped_working mid cycle .
negative	we contacted " know how " that is a joke , we had to wait 0_days for an engineer to be told " oh we don_'_t carry that module as it rarely goes_wrong .
negative	left with a promise to ring his " mate " who has one on his van and would ring in an_hour . you guessed it , nothing .
negative	my husband spent up to an_hour on monday the day he first visited to get through to this know nothing depsrtment only to be told they would contact him to get him to contact us .
negative	a waste of an_hour and goodness know how much for the 0000 number .
negative	he rang again on the tuesday , waited for 00_minutes to be told that the module had to be ordered and they would contact us with a new appointment date .
negative	we rang this afternoon as we had heard_nothing but after 00_minutes of waiting he put the phone down .
negative	this so obviously how they keep their profits up .
negative	i am tearing my hair out with frustration , it has now been 00 days without the machine and god_knows_how much longer it will be .
negative	i emailed the customer_services ( there is no way you can talk to anyone in that department )
negative	and demanded a full_refund as i was sold an item " not fit for purpose " i am still_waiting .
negative	we are both disabled and cant lug bags and bags of washing to a launderette .
negative	at the moment i want to hit somebody , i am so frustrated and depressed .
negative	no matter_how much you will save by buying on line dont !!!
negative	!
negative	any item where you may have to use the " knowhow " customer service line in currys or p . c .
negative	world whether bought in store or on line , don_'_t , don_'_t , don_'_t , if you value you sanity
negative	previous dealing was with the nottingham branch who i found more than helpful so there are a few staff that can do what they can .
negative	after two_days waiting for a hermes collection from 0 am to 0 pm i am_disgusted with hermes as a courier service .
negative	it is a complete_joke .
negative	interparcel were helpful in resolving the issue but i think they should question whether they should be signposting customers to such a rubbish service .
negative	very poor !
negative	did not deliver before party date !
negative	total_waste of money !
negative	i still have not received them 00 days after order .
negative	never again
negative	i made a phone_call to confirm and check that ' meet and greet ' is definitely door to door and not meeting in a short_stay car_park .
negative	this was the case on the outbound and inbound - 0 cases a child and a pushchair is no fun when you have to put everything on a trolley and wheel it to departures from a car_park .
negative	i did complain on both_occasions only to be told that they could not drop_off and collect outside the doors and neither could they go to the fast track ' meet and greet ' area .
negative	so i paid more than necessary and then also had to pay to get out of the car_park .
negative	i have alwas used meet and greet at manchester_airport with no problem whatsoever but for some reason this company think they ' re smart ripping_people off and selling a service they are definitely not providing .
negative	will never use them again .
negative	i booked this service and arranged collection between_0am and 0pm no one turned_up to collect my parcel .
negative	at 0 . 00pm i managed to get in contact with someone_who told me my order could be cancelled or rebooked no apologies or anything i am so annoyed as this was a 00 hour delivery and now have to wait in another day for a courier to pick_up and the lady_who is expecting her parcel is going to have to wait so expecting she will be very angry as well .
negative	i will not be using this service again
negative	i recently ordered the ' prince_charming ' arrangement for my mum , when i saw the arrangement online i thought it looked absolutely_stunning and was sure she would be pleased to receive it , however when the arrangement arrived it looked nothing like advertised online .
negative	the arrangement was in oasis covered by plastic wrap and placed inside a small box !!!
negative	that said the flowers were fresh but the arrangement did not resemble the online picture .
negative	i am left very disappointed and would never use this company again .
negative	i ordered a bouquet for my friend for a very special_occasion , which should have been delivered yesterday 00 / 0 / 00 i provided correct details at time or ordering .
negative	the flowers did not arrive causing anxiousness and disappointment .
negative	when i reported this to serenata_flowers i received an_email_advising that they had spoken to the driver and confirmed they were left at the correct_address .
negative	however this morning a very kind person took the flowers to my friend '_s house explaining that they had been left_outside his property yesterday by mistake .
negative	i think the florist ought to perhaps either replace the satnav or the driver .
negative	i ordered the big_boy xxl beanbag , via_groupon , 0_weeks before christmas ; waited 0_weeks for it to arrive and it never did so i logon to the website and the delivery date was very vague : week 00 , which to me means the week before christmas .
negative	by 00rd_december it still hadn_'_t arrive so i tried to ring them 00 + times and no answer !
negative	i tried the infurn website again and the delivery was changed for week 0 without informing_me !
negative	i emailed them and i finally got a reply reporting that they had a larger then expected order , but this does not make it acceptable to get a customer to wait 0_months for a simple beanbag .
negative	groupon would not take any responsibility for this .
negative	lets_hope it arrives in the end !
negative	stay away
negative	revision 0th_jan :
negative	after writing my review , infurn have contacted trustpilot claiming they can '_t verify the sale : they are now going after their customers !
negative	i am even more appalled at infurns level of customer service , how_dare they go after their customer honest_opinions , if they dont want bad_reviews maybe they should get their act_together .
negative	revision 00 / 00 /_0000
negative	now been advised that the beanbag won_'_t be in til march thats 0_months for a beanbag to arrive !!!
negative	ridiculous !
negative	groupon won_'_t take any responsibility for not checking the availability for what they have advertised .
negative	stay away from groupon and infurn !
negative	zero_stars
negative	this company has very poor customer service , it is impossible to reach them via the phone and to receive what you bought .

negative	this company is an_absolute_joke - the sales_staff are useless lazy arrogant bunch of shysters who can '_t be bothered answering the phone cos they know your call will eventually go through to a call_centre , i was told by the a person_who actually rang me to discuss my complaint that " the sales managers tell staff not to answer the the phone if there are customers in the shop " !!!!!!!!!????????
negative	what a great customer_relations policy .
negative	he promised me a return call from the complaints_dept .- it '_s 00_hours waiting now .
negative	i hope i don_'_t die before i get that call .
negative	after_reading complaints here and on cpw '_s own website i am not even going to bother pursuing this complaint with this bunch of incompetent untrained , couldn_'_t care less idiots .
negative	so their complaints policy " i couldn_'_t give a s ** t ." works !.
negative	obviously , more incompetent shambles - less pursued complaints !.
negative	steer_clear save_yourself a load of hassle .
negative	i have been ebaying for a few_years and switched to collectplus when rm changed their prices in april_0000 .
negative	i '_ve now decided never to use collectplus again after having 0 parcels smash , another thrown over the gate and left in front_garden ( clothing ) and 0 parcel had been tampered with - customer claimed that parcel ( mail bag - clothing ) had been slashed opened with something sharp .
negative	i have been sending pyrex for years with rm and have never had a breakage .
negative	i bubble_wrap really well , use strong boxes , pad them out and fill all voids ....... can '_t imagine what collectplus do with the parcels .
negative	i '_ve given collectplus too many chances and just can '_t take the risk any more - my ebay feedback is too important to me .
negative	the couriers and staff at the hub really need to take more care and until they can get that sorted i will switch to myhermes .
negative	please find enclosed double 0 . 0 tog duvet .
negative	my advice would be to open with care , because of the smell and the spores or whatever is on the quilt .
negative	as i have stated previously , i feel your customer service leaves a lot to be desired .
negative	in this case , i notified you of the problem as soon as i opened the quilt .
negative	because of the nature of the problem – i . e .
negative	damp or infected quilt – i gave you all the information i could , so you could check that other items , either stored with or alongside the quilt in the warehouse , were not also infected – an attempt to save you further problems with other clients .
negative	rather_than thanks and a replacement , i was then asked for proof by way of photographs , that i was indeed telling the truth .
negative	given the value of the quilt - £_00 . 00 – i find this quite insulting .
negative	i was also very unhappy to open the bag the quilt was in again and hold it to provide the photos you required .
negative	when i queried this , i was told the returns process would take much longer if i did not comply .
negative	i sent the photos , which were rejected by your server initially .
negative	i had to resend with just one photo .
negative	was that enough for your purposes ?
negative	i have no idea .
negative	finally , i have to go to the trouble of writing a letter of explanation to accompany the returning quilt , which i have to wrap up and address , then await your driver to collect .
negative	it seems that then i have to call you with some code number he has given me to request my money back !
negative	outrageous !
negative	let_me make it clear that i require a refund for the item .
negative	and as soon as possible please .
negative	and i should also make it clear that i will no_longer use your firm , and i will make_sure no - one else that i know uses your firm .
negative	as a retired professional , i can_assure you that your complaints procedures are sadly_lacking .
negative	my contacts still have not arrived which is extremely disappointing as i needed them for today .
negative	that was my experience during half_term at taunton asda .
negative	a young_girl asked for my id when i bought 0 bottles of lager .
negative	i showed her , she asked for the id for my children .
negative	i told her asda selling the lager to me not the children .
negative	she insisted if no id of the children to prove they are over 00 .
negative	then i cannot buy any lager .
negative	i am 00 , restaurant licensee .
negative	so i asked for her id to complain her poor knowledge .
negative	she then covered her name tag and said she is not called_amy .
negative	she is fran .
negative	i told her how can she check people '_s id but she did not have her own .
negative	disguisting experience .
negative	the manager came to sort_out and said she had to back up her staff ??
negative	what is the system ?
negative	disguisting service , very slow , very rude .
negative	paid the item on 0 / 0 , 0_days_later asked for more postage , paid them , no response no delivery until 00 / 0 , received the perfect box , but when opened , all solutions are falled aparts , complained to the customer service , blamed to the courier broke them .
negative	ridiculous .
negative	operator julie snell was so rude at email , said would delete my details at their data base .
negative	i never had that poor horrible service in my life .
negative	they sells cheap but the service is so cheap too .
negative	will not go back at all .
negative	i ordered a washing_machine from this company .
negative	after ordering i was given a delivery date the following week .
negative	the morning that my delivery was due i had a phone_call to say that it wouldn_'_t be delivered due to a ' corrupt file ' being sent to the delivery people !
negative	well i wasn_'_t happy but they said they would deliver it on the saturday to which i said this was impossible as i was away on holiday .
negative	they eventually said that it would be delivered the next_day .
negative	however at 0 . 00pm i got a phone_call to say there wasn_'_t enough room on the van for it !
negative	!
negative	needless to say i cancelled the order and ordered my machine from 000 electrical where i had my washing_machine 00_hours_later .
negative	it then took them over a week to refund my money ...
negative	i thought hughes were a reliable company but i certainly won_'_t use them again .
negative	just pay the extra £ 0 -£_00 and get your goods elsewhere !
negative	i received the request for a review , but i haven_'_t received my order yet :)
negative	we are the managing agent who looks after the property on behalf of the landlord who is based in abu_dhabi .
negative	in november of last_year there was a change of tenant .
negative	the previous tenant moved out and the new_tenant moved in the day after .
negative	there was no electricity usage in between tenants .
negative	since november we have been receiving bills and debt_collection letters for £_000 at our office address but addressed to the landlord .
negative	we have emailed notification of change of tenancy numerous_times , sent letters and made phone_calls .
negative	first_utility refuse to speak to us as we are not named on the account ( despite our name being on the letters and bills ) but they have advised us rather_than the account being put into the new tenants name it has_been put into the landlords even_though there was no usage over the 00_hours it was vacant .
negative	they now want the landlord to call them directly ( i '_m_sure that is possible when he '_s based in uae ?!!!!)
negative	today i have been on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	will to live is disappearing very quickly .
negative	we have no_problems with change of tenancy when the big 0 are the providers but endless problems when it comes to first_utility
negative	i ordered a harry_potter lifesize cut out for a themed 00st that arrived damaged .
negative	i was asked to email proof of damage and after no response i then had to chase the company .
negative	by this time the party was imminent .
negative	they did refund but it was too late for me to replace the purchased item elsewhere .
negative	this is the third parcel in a row that '_s taken ages to deliver . yes i too have the message on the tracking service , card left , which is never in my door , then next_day unable to find . my last parcel of knitting wool from turkey was in my local_depot the very next_day from dispatch . and then took 0 working_days to get 00 miles up the road . customer_services are rude and unhelpful , and my local_depot never answers the phone or replies to messages left . i have made formal complaints on their forms but never_heard back . in future i will find out who the seller will use to deliver my parcel before i buy .
negative	havent received my product , ordered on 0th_dec and its xmas_eve tomorrow !
negative	!
negative	i order from here but often find i am waiting for items and not notified if they are out of stock , you only find out later after items that are in stock are delivered .
negative	i have been waiting since tuesday for 00 parcels to be collected from my business address .
negative	it is now 00 . 00 on friday and i am still_waiting .
negative	i have heard many empty_promises from p0g over the last few_days and have had enough of listening to them .
negative	never again will i trust p0g .
negative	thoroughly unprofessional .
negative	after buying ready washed salad and finding a live caterpillar in the salad i immediately emailed sainsburys to notify them .
negative	i took them several days before i got a reply asking for an account number .
negative	the only account i have with them is a nectar_card , i sent this and then they told me this is not what they wanted .
negative	they wanted an order number .
negative	two_weeks this was after my initial_contact .
negative	as they were no help i took the salad into the store to deal with it .
negative	the staff were mortified that there was a big and didn_'_t want to know .
negative	they told me to ring the number on the back .
negative	so i finally rang in , told them i was not happy with the customer service , the delays and the fact that their ready washed and ready to eat salad is coming with bugs !!!
negative	she told me out of a " good will gesture " they would put £ 0 pounds onto my card .
negative	no apology , no recognition of the absolute hassle or the fact their food is dirty and not washed properly .
negative	she said if i wanted to i could bring it in for investigation but they usually don_'_t do anything about salad .
negative	useless and annoyed !
negative	the picture on the website didn_'_t accurately reflect the contents of the basket .
negative	it did have the freesia '_s and roses , but the basket was also meant to contain orchids and there were none .
negative	instead they and used cheap fillers like baby '_s breath .
negative	i won_'_t be ordering from this website again .
negative	i have ordered a game from them and they just send it a fake game by using fake plastic shrink_wrap . i was so upset for that .. unfortunately i havent chosen different shipping address , otherwise i was going send someone fake gift .
negative	i ordered 0 of the same electronic item and they just cancelled my order just because i ordered two .
negative	i had to wait 0week for reimbursement to be able to order them again from somewhere_else .
negative	and their customer service manager is very rude , i don_'_t know how she became customer_services manager but when i wanted to speak to her supervisor , she told me that she is actually a manager and i was really surprised .
negative	attempted to purchase a ukulele for a father day gift .
negative	ordered , paid and received an invoice receipt .
negative	as i had not received a dispatch_notice , as stated in the invoice i sent an_email requesting an update i emailed the company .
negative	the response was to log_onto the system .
negative	a week after the order i managed to speak to someone_who informed me that the system was down and would return my call .
negative	later that day i received an_email_informing_me that the item was not in stock and i could order something_else or receive a refund which would take 0_days .
negative	obviously i have had an awful experience with this company who have taken my money , held_onto that money knowing that they did not have the item to sell !!
negative	obviously now i have to wait for my refund and locate the instrument at another shop all in time for father ’_s day !
negative	actually zero_rating - delivery person couldn_'_t even bother to ring the doorbell - the dog would have heard and barked like mad .
negative	i '_ve lost a whole day waiting around .
negative	they also promised to text me one hour before delivery ....
negative	very , very poor service , for which i have paid .
negative	parcel 00000000 00 june_0000
negative	it might be the cheapest broadband_provider in the uk but certainly not the best .
negative	the internet speed is not great , the tv_channels not fantastic but i was able to live with that .
negative	the worse and unbearable thing is the customer_services ... saying that it is non_existent would be a compliment .
negative	they are not only completely_useless and but also probably paid to annoy you .
negative	talktalk could get_rid of them and replace them with machines , the end_result would be the same .
negative	they don_'_t understand your request at all , don_'_t even care , and just repeat again and again talktalk policy .
negative	helping you is not on their job description .
negative	even now that i '_ve cancelled my account with them 0_months_ago , i still have issue with the refund they owe me .
negative	talktalk is not a reliable company .
negative	below is a letter i sent to the ceo of the company to which he has replied but not carried_out any of what he said he would do .
negative	dear mr lindsay
negative	to say that i am disappointed would be a great understatement .
negative	i have just had to suffer 00_hours without electricity due to utility_warehouse ’_s non - existent out of hours support .
negative	this has come at a time when with a family funeral yesterday and having my daughter and 0 month_old_grandson staying with me ( both with heart conditions ), i was forced to try to find them other accommodation nearby due to the lack of light , heating and hot_water .
negative	the problem_arose because of a fault in the local sub - station which caused a surge that destroyed my meter .
negative	as this was after 0 :_00pm , it was impossible to contact anyone at utility_warehouse to ask for assistance .
negative	i contacted uk power networks which is our local electricity distributer and they came out and checked my main fuse and confirmed that electricity was back on and coming to the house but that the meter was disabled .
negative	my house was the only one in my street and even the whole village that was without power once the sub - station issue was resolved .
negative	uk power networks said that the meter was your responsibility and had to be replaced by utility_warehouse as the supplier .
negative	this left me in a ridiculous situation because utility_warehouse doesn ’_t have an out of hours service and so i couldn ’_t reach anyone to arrange for the meter to be replaced .
negative	i used my neighbour ’_s computer to search your internet and this is what i found .
negative	what should i do if i have no gas and / or electricity ?
negative	“ please call our prepayment team on 0000 000 0000 .
negative	they ' re available monday - friday 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 and saturday 0000 - 00 : 00 .
negative	if you require emergency advice at any other times please contact your local electricity distributor ”
negative	the electrical distributor is uk power networks , so i was back to square one .
negative	i have lost food in 0 freezers that are in the garage – our chest_freezer and one freezer full of burgers for a cub event that i am organising for 0_weeks ’ time and also lost food in my fridge_freezer indoors .
negative	i did show your distributor this last night .
negative	additionally i have lost £_00 of credit on my key meter and key which has not been transferred to my new meter , and £_00 . 00 for a day i could not go to work , also the cost of 0 letters sent via_recorded delivery .
negative	i find it unbelievable that there isn_’_t an_emergency contact point within utility_warehouse when something like this happens – the fitter who was eventually sent to replace the meter yesterday lunchtime said that he was available and on call the night before as lowie beck were aware of the situation with the substation fire .
negative	if i had managed to get_hold of someone from uw he would have been able to replace my meter within 0 hours .
negative	instead due to your lack of duty of care i had to suffer 00_hours with no electricity and significant discomfort , hardship and stress .
negative	i think that it is a shameful situation that could so easily have been avoided if your company had only had an_emergency service in place instead of just relying_on the other_companies .
negative	as they said it isn_’_t their responsibility !
negative	i telephoned your customer service yesterday at approx .
negative	00 . 00 lunch_time , i spoke to joy in prepayment , i told her of my situation and i asked that a manger call me back within the hour .
negative	it is now 00_hours after that call to your company and i have not received any phone_call whatsoever from your company .
negative	i want to know how i will be compensated for this horrific experience – i was told that the customer service would be excellent with utility_warehouse and my family and i have been scarred by this experience .
negative	i need to feel that somebody there cares_about what has happened .
negative	and i also think the thousands of your customers that put you in the position you are in are made fully_aware that if their meter goes_wrong ( as mine did through no fault of mine ) that they will have to ensure it is between the hours of 0am and 0 . 00pm .
negative	you have a major floor within your company which should never have happened and it certainly should have never happened to me and my family .
negative	my uw distributor was the only person i could get_hold of and even he couldn ’_t help me because you had no out of hours contact .
negative	i look_forward to hearing from you .
negative	i purchased an item on the 0rd of july was told delivery 0 working_days , no product arrived , contacted groupon and was lied to 0 times that my order was with royal_mail , im still_waiting after 0_weeks for my product .
negative	i contacted groupon and was told i have to wait 00 working_days for my item to be re - issued even_though the merchant was willing to do it straight_away if groupon gives the authorization .
negative	groupon refused and i asked for a refund and was told i had to wait the 00 working_days first for the re - issue before they can refund my money even_though i don_'_t want the product anymore .
negative	they have the worst customer service and even their manager gareth is the most useless and very unhelpful , if you don_'_t want to come off the phone crying don_'_t bother buying from them because they would frustrate you .
negative	i ordered revitabrow back in the middle of june .
negative	i was advised the product was out of stock after i '_d placed the order ( no_indication before then ).
negative	my credit_card payment was processed immediately .
negative	several weeks_later after several emails ( they never answer promptly ), they apologised for still being out of stock and asked if i wanted to cancel my order and get a refund - although they were expecting new stock within a couple of weeks .
negative	still wanting the product , and not knowing better (!
negative	), i said i would wait having already waited so long .
negative	many emails later , with their apologies for delay , i was eventually told the product was now in stock .
negative	did i still want it ?
negative	if so , they '_d arrange to send .
negative	i said yes ( having waited so long ) and weeks_later it still hadn_'_t arrived .
negative	i sent another email and eventually got a response that they '_d contact their depot to arrange despatch .
negative	my account indicates the item was dispatched on 00th_august yet 0_weeks_later , i '_ve not received it .
negative	i '_ve sent 0 emails over the past few_days and have threatened to notify trading_standards , watchdog and anyone_else i can think of .
negative	i '_ve just found this website - wish i had before placing the order .
negative	now i '_m not hopeful of receiving the product or the refund and i don_'_t expect they ' re even remotely bothered about yet more bad_publicity .
negative	update 00 . 0 . 00 : amazing - my order has arrived .
negative	having advised them i was contacting_trading_standards and a number of consumer watchdogs ( which i did ), i got an_email_apologising that the item hadn_'_t been dispatched when they '_d said adding that it had now been sent .
negative	i replied to the effect that i '_d believe it when i saw it ... and lo and behold , my item turned_up today , along with an_email asking me to confirm when i '_d got the item ( almost more emails from them in a week than for the past few_months !)
negative	for me personally , a happy outcome ( eventually ); i wish all other_reviewers the same success in getting a good result .
negative	i have ordered replica chanel embossed crocodile flap bag and have never received .
negative	my friend ordered a replica bag too but received a very cheap children one .
negative	i am sure they have changed their name as i
negative	i cannot open their web_site , probable have few sites .
negative	never trust them untill you are paying by paypal .
negative	con men send you through with order then once they '_ve got ya bank details take 000 . 00 pounds off you without telling you first
negative	the product is a good quality , however the delivery was missing units twice , we waited over 0_weeks for the missing units .
negative	when we wanted to return something , there were so many penalty / restocking fees it countered the cost of the items strangely .
negative	customer service were friendly and helpful , but it was lip service and they wre unable to delvier .
negative	i would never use this company again .
negative	i recently_purchased a mattress from this company that i had meticulously researched .
negative	i ordered it online without a problem and the money was taken out of my account quickly .
negative	the next_day i received a phone_call from mattressnextday telling_me that the mattress i had ordered was now out of stock ( even_though it did not say this on the website ).
negative	i was offered an_alternative and was told on the phone that the mattress i would be receiving instead was very similar / almost the same as the one i had originally ordered .
negative	i mentioned exchanging on the phone and she said " it wouldn_'_t be a problem " but failed to mention the £_00 charge .
negative	the day after that , the alternative mattress arrived .
negative	it was roughly packaged and covered in mud and dirt .
negative	i could tell instantly that it was a terrible mattress and phoned the customer service number .
negative	the lady i spoke to on the phone was rude , unhelpful and unsympathetic .
negative	she didn_'_t apologise at all and then told me that if i wanted a refund i would need to pay £_00 .
negative	i argued that it wasn_'_t the mattress i originally ordered , that the lady didn_'_t mention the charge and that i had been mislead by her ( i was told it was similar ) but it did not matter .
negative	i am now paying fifty_pounds to have this mattress taken_away , i would unquestionably not recommend this company to anyone .
negative	take_note : no paper_work comes with the mattresses that they deliver .
negative	appalling .
negative	simply appalling .
negative	ordered a fridge_freezer and paid in full - website said 0 - 00 working_days for delivery and i '_m now on about 00 working_days !!
negative	they keep saying they don_'_t have stock and will be in touch when they do .
negative	my argument is if you don_'_t have it in stock then don_'_t allow me to buy it !
negative	emailed again monday - no reply and chased it up thursday - no reply .
negative	seriously losing patience now !
negative	be careful buying from here if you ' re in a rush - it may be cheap but it isn_'_t fast or caring service !
negative	i purchased a wowcher offer for acai_berry supplements and read all the information given by wowcher and by slimming and beauty on their web_site regarding this product before_deciding to purchase it .
negative	after being notified of the wowcher_code i attempted to order the goods via the link given and on each_occassion the code was not recognised .
negative	i then went direct to the firms web_site and managed to complete the tranaction direct , although this was not recognised by wowcher , who kept e_- mailing me to tell me that i should redeem my wowcher before it expired .
negative	the goods were sent very quickly , but i was extremely disappointed to discover that the capsules contain a high_dose of caffeine , which i am unable to have for medical_reasons .
negative	nowhere in the information i had previously read was there any mention of this , or i would not have ordered the goods .
negative	0 x blackberrys sent in .
negative	received cheque for 0 .
negative	the other was found to be blocked .
negative	sent details of how to unblock immediately as did not have handset to do it myself .
negative	no reply until i contacted them 0 month later to find out why had not received the 0nd cheque but was told that they had disposed of the handset .
negative	pretty sharp_practice think .
negative	i don_'_t know how this company is still in business .
negative	the customer service is non - existent .
negative	we ordered a painting for my parents wedding_anniversary and use interparcel as the courier it arrived to us 0_days day with no explanation or apology we opened the packaging to find the frame and glass smashed .
negative	the answer we received was that its no there problem well im_sorry but if i am putting my faith in your company to complete a simple task as to delivery my parcel to me in one piece so of us quite clearly can not do their job properly .
negative	ill give you a clue , its not me !!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	i wish i had read the reviews of this company it is not the first time we had have dealings with this company but can_assure you it will be the last and would like to warn every_single person looking to use this company in future to read all these negative_reviews and stay away .
negative	we received part payment of our delivery charge because it was not on time put wash there hands to anything_else .
negative	all correspondence i have had with this company will be being sent to trading_standards and also watchdog and would suggest everyone else do the same .
negative	its about time companies like these get what they deserve .
negative	this company and there dodgy third_party companies have cost me a further £_000 in repair costs not to mention £_000 on a new painting for my parents wedding_anniversary .

negative	products r lovely but overall experience was terrible .
negative	i had to chase for responses as emails were being ignored .
negative	delivery time was certainly nowhere_near meet and i threatened to cancel my order as 0_weeks past my order date i still hadn_'_t received my order .
negative	i would definately recommend people to look elsewhere .
negative	no stars for ecco . they deducted £ 0 . 00 from my refund for return of parcel .
negative	i do expect to pay for return postage , but this amount is excessive .
negative	i would never order from them again .
negative	also be aware their footwear is extremely narrow fitting .
negative	i ordered a kartell componibili storage_unit from this ' designer living specialist '.
negative	i paid for it , waited for it to come and was very patient when there was a delay in sending it to the uk , where i live .
negative	in short , i have not received the item .
negative	there was ( apparently ) an attempted delivery one day when i was out at work .
negative	since then , i have emailed at_least 0 times a day to try and find out how i can receive it .
negative	they refuse to give me a phone number or contact details for the carrier service , dhl .
negative	when i tried_calling dhl uk myself , they said they were ' acting as a third_party ' and couldn_'_t help me , or give me any other phone number .
negative	ambiente '_s only reply is that i can ' collect the item from my next ( sic ) post_office '.
negative	when i responded asking where that might be , and whether they meant a dhl delivery depot rather_than the royal_mail , there was silence .
negative	since then i have received no reply to any of my communications .
negative	basically , they don_'_t want to know .
negative	they have my money and presumably , in the end , the item will get sent back to them .
negative	i got some white wall tyres at the start of july last_year .
negative	they look great , however i have used them for roughly 0_months and now the front tyre has developed a balloon like egg shape on it .
negative	i '_ve contacted sip 0 times in the last 0_months now to inform them of the problem , and i '_ve sent in pictures .
negative	however there response is always ' i am waiting for the returns team to get back to me '.
negative	so i '_ve been without my vespa for 0_months which is costing me a lot of money as i now have to pay for transport .
negative	and i '_ve wasted money buying faulty tyres off sip and i still don_'_t know if they are going to provide a refund or replacement .
negative	ok , ordered 0 items on 0 / 00 /_0000 in stock first_class , just recieved 0 item today 00 / 00 /_0000 the other is back order . in between ihad to phone and email to get an answer , was told payment was stuck ? between being_processed and complete . if it was why was it not picked_up , then told it was a paypal problem , something needs to be looked at on kenables behalf if someone_else is giving them poor service
negative	i booked car_hire which was reasonable_price for weekend , arrived at designation was informed by the car_hire firm i did not require my booking info was upgraded and mis_- sold by the appointed .
negative	extra money was taken from my bank_account .
negative	addressed this immediately on my return with both expedia and the car_hire company appointed both would not accept the facts given and took months to even get that far with frequent opening and closing of the complaints_procedure which in itself is set_up to buy them more time to make it look like the targets on addressing complaints has_been achieved .
negative	informed both expedia and budget car_hire i and that of associates would never ever use either organisation again nor that of our associates , which i happy to report from last_year is successfully achieved .

negative	never received my items , customer service is shocking , i have written many_times with no reply .
negative	never again
negative	shocking service , wrote to them before purchasing asked if in stock , purchased the pants to be told guys in warehouse cannot find them and they will have to come from me and they should be here by the end of the week , received a message on my phone today saying it could be next week now , will be contacting_trading_standards
negative	i had various problems with business phones direct including them sending my phone to the wrong_address , charging me for a period of time when i did not have the phone nor had i activated the sim , and then being_fobbed_off with lies (” refund is in the post ” ) before they stopped_responding to my mails at all .
negative	i felt my bills were rather high and wanted to find out why .
negative	well , the staff in the orange shop couldn ’_t have been better and they were shocked at the way business phones direct had set_up my account .
negative	i am on totally the wrong contract for me and cannot down - grade for another 0_months and i was not told that i would start being charged for weekend and evening browsing after the first 0_months !
negative	they did manage to get the weekend and evening browsing charges removed for me at_least , so that was a help .
negative	i do not recommend business phones direct to anyone - beware !
negative	i pay all of my scottish_power bills by calling the telephone_number shown on the bill .
negative	when calling , you are told your account balance and given the option to pay the full_amount , which i always do .
negative	i was surprised , therefore , to receive an_email from scottish_power telling_me i owe almost £_000 from my december bill , which i paid on the date of receipt .
negative	i try and call scottish_power every evening when i get home from work ( 0pm ) but each time i call i am cut_off as their lines are busy .
negative	i did manage to get through when calling at 0am but almost wish i hadnt as the person i spoke to was extemely unhelpful .
negative	the bill i received in december was for £_000 but as my account was in credit , the balance read out to me on the phone was £_000 , which i paid .
negative	i checked my account and my balance was shown as £ 0 on 00 december .
negative	however , the email i have now recieved states i owe £_000 in respect of my december bill .
negative	after an extremely long and painful call with scottish_power i determined that they are stating that the £ 0 i did not pay in respect of my december bill is outstanding and this has_been added to my new bill ( yet all being show as an outstanding bill from december ?).
negative	when i explained that i didnt pay the full_amount on my bill as my account was in credit , the member of staff continued to say ( as if on loop ) that the bill was for £_000 and i didnt pay that .
negative	despite stating that my online account , on their website shows my account balance as £ 0 .
negative	the person i spoke to was unable to access my account so i had to print screen their own website and send it into them .
negative	i received a response back stating that i would receive a reply in 0_days .
negative	i havent .
negative	the service is shocking and i will most definately be switching suppliers as soon as possible .
negative	avoid scottish_power !!!
negative	!
negative	if you want to recieve goods going by the simplyscuba descriptions ... dont do it .
negative	i ordered 0 minor items over two_weeks_ago , no contact saying they would be delayed ... and now they tell me it is out of stock .... un utter_waste of my time when i could have driven to a shop 00 miles or so away ... disgusting ... dont use this company !!!!
negative	!... now im asked to rate it before i can post this comment ... i dont want to give it a star at all
negative	i was not at home when delivery made so contacted company delivering it and made alternative_arrangements .
negative	stayed in all day monday they forgot to put it on lorry said they '_d deliver it today , still no delivery .
negative	i work i cannot_afford to keep taking time off to except a delivery which doen '_t arrive
negative	ordered & paid for bathroom on monday 00th_feb , was told on the dispatch date , wed_00th_feb , that delivery company would be in touch within next 0_days .... still_waiting and this is day 0 !!
negative	i have tried telephoning better_bathrooms , was kept waiting with no reply for 00mins , i have emailed better_bathrooms customer_services and had no reply .
negative	had further orders to place such as tiles and accessories inorder to complete the room ... will be going else where .
negative	only_reason there is 0_star is because i was impressed with the original advert and price !
negative	!
negative	why does this company not respond to emails and promise 00 hour turnaround when they clearly haven_'_t the capacity to do so ?
negative	i '_m wondering_if the good reviews are posted by friends ?
negative	my ref no ends in 00 - rotten_apples .
negative	please send it back , i '_ve already wasted £_00 on a contract i haven_'_t been able to use .
negative	delivery was very slow , i had to contact them to find out about delivery .
negative	i couldn_'_t leave a phone message as the box was full twice .
negative	when item finally arrived it wasn_'_t suitable and they had the audacity to deduct 00_% from my refund .
negative	overall i was dissapointed and wouldn_'_t use them again
negative	incompetence and lie - that is what i can say about cpw .
negative	my phone died when i left it charging overnight .
negative	it was accepted by cpw local shop .
negative	however , soon after that , i received the report saying it was water_damaged .
negative	the report was poorly written , showing low - quality small spot somewhere , which made a " highly qualified engineer " make assumption i dropped it into the water .
negative	i tried to speak with cpw customer support so they could explain this report to me .
negative	the response was rather arrogant and rude .
negative	i was occused of opening the phone ( not even my brand ).
negative	by having such response , i reported the problem to manufacturer directly and , oh miracle , the phone was repaired for free .
negative	the manufacturer confirmed there was no water_damage at all .
negative	i '_m surprised the company with such rating still have the business in the uk ... but not with me and my friends anymore !!!
negative	!
negative	i had to change my ticket due to an_emergency .
negative	i was told that i could not change the ticket and i had to cancel it with no refund .
negative	i lost out on 000 plus dollars .
negative	most airlines have a cancellation_fee or a change ticket fee .
negative	i am disappointed , because i paid them for nothing .
negative	i am a paying customer and the least i can get for my money is some help or some of my money back .
negative	ebookers has lost a customer and i will be sure to let my friends know , that when life happens and things change ebookers dose not compromise .
negative	please stay clear !
negative	we have received terrible service from city_link over and over again .
negative	they seldom deliver next_day and very recently my parcel was just_dumped in a farmyard about a mile_away from our house .
negative	perishable goods were ruined .
negative	more often than not we have to do a 00 miles round_trip to collect goods which we have been urgently expecting .
negative	they are a total let_down and i would not advise anyone to seriously_consider_using them for their business or personal requirements .
negative	where do i begin , bad coverage when i was told it was good , i had a 00 day sim which i only wanted for 00 days but you have to give 00 days notice so as soon as i got it i rang 000 to cancel now this is a call_centre in india they are very hard to understand it took 00_mins to cancel and get a pac_code during these 00_mins i was told i would have to pay for 0_months which i said i wasn_'_t paying as its a 00 day contract and i was giving 00 days notice i will pay for that then i was told that i would get a bad credit_rating and enforcement officers would come and collect the money after this i agreed to pay so i could get my pac_code and cancel then i got put through to cancelations who then tried to sell me another contract i had to say i just want to cancel about 00 times before they actually did it awful company
negative	i '_ve recently bought paloma picasso from this company and it '_s a fake .
negative	really annoyed as i '_ve thrown the packaging away .

negative	i purchased a christmas outfit for 00 . 00 on the 0rd of december and payed for next_day delivery i haven_'_t received my outfit yet and have missed the event that i needed it for so i requested that i have a full_refund including postage for the inconvenience
negative	very disappointed - bouquet was very small , as were the flowers .
negative	didn_'_t look anything like the picture .
negative	wished i spent £_00 . 00 in sainsburys as i would have had a more striking and value for money bouquet .
negative	i paid_extra when ordering to get it straight_away , 0_weeks_later and i '_m still_waiting for the correct items to be delivered to the correct_address .
negative	i '_ve had to cancel the plumber to install the shower 0 times .
negative	really not happy and wouldn_'_t use again .
negative	i wanted a canvas picture for my oh '_s christmas_present , and wowcher had a promo for just this .
negative	paid my money , got my voucher , uploaded the photo and feel i got stung on the pp , but a month later , no goods .
negative	i emailed wowcher two_weeks_ago asking how i go about chasing my goods , but no reply .

negative	i have lost out money i cannot_afford , and learned a lesson .
negative	stick to sites i can_trust .
negative	wowcher - disappointed with the poor service from your provider and your customer_services
negative	i ordered a dress in the beggining of april ( to norway ) so that i would be sure to have it for my birthday the 00 .
negative	and i got it a week before the 00 wich was great .
negative	however i had to pay £_00 in taxes which i didn_'_t mind at the time .
negative	but then i opened the package and found out the dress was faulty .
negative	the edges of the fabric was " frayed ".
negative	i sent an_email to customers service right away and asked what they would do about this .
negative	they told me to send the dress back for an exchange or refund and that they would cover the return postage .
negative	i sent them an_email back and said that the only alternative for me would be if they could send me a new dress right away without waiting for the faulty one since it would take to much time if they first had to wait for the faulty one and then i had to wait for the new dress to arrive .
negative	if they couldn_'_t do that i wanted a refund but i had some concerns .
negative	since i had payed £_00 in taxes and also £ 0 , 00 in postage to get the dress i wondered_if they would cover this to for me , otherwise i would have payed £_00 , 00 for nothing .
negative	it took them 0 (!)
negative	days to get back to me ( in that time i had sent them 0 more emails asking why they didn_'_t answer my emails ) and then they said " it ’_s difficult for us to advise regarding import_tax for specific countries and territories " and bla_bla_bla ..
negative	they did not even answer all my questions .
negative	i sent them an_email back and this time it took them 0 (!!)
negative	days to get back to me .
negative	by this time my birthday had passed and i was really tired of trying to get them to fix their mistake .
negative	so now the dress is just lying in my wardrobe since i can '_t get myself to throw it away when i payed a lot ( for a student like me ) of money for it .
negative	i am very disappointed with them and i will not shop_here again .
negative	it '_s okay that a mistake is made ( sending a faulty dress ) but , for me , it '_s not ok for it to take this long to get back to a customer .
negative	especially when i told them it was urgent , and it '_s not ok that when it '_s their fault they didn_'_t do everything in their power to try and fix it .
negative	stayed in for 0 full days including requested day for delivery - and no chance wouldn_'_t hear the door .
negative	said they '_d tried two times with no answer .
negative	they took a phone number but later said they never phone it unless lost .
negative	told them they never left calling cards to prove they '_d called , which fell on deaf_ears .
negative	when i suggested they '_d delivered to wrong_address , said could have popped out and was our word_against drivers and they would ask driver what colour door he delivered to !!
negative	talked over the top of me and only my perseverance got any information .
negative	absolutely ridiculous way to carry on and although have used in past would not use again knowing now the way they operate .
negative	hello
negative	i am annoyed that basically 00_% of my earnings were taken off my payment , considering this is the only payment i have yet received .
negative	sharon boyle
negative	i cannot_believe a company as big as this would swindle a customer
negative	i '_ve paid or it and received nothing
negative	can i please get a refund
negative	i would like to hear back from you about this
negative	one star only because you ' re products are good
negative	after a week when my order did not arrive i contacted medicanimal and was told my order had been delivered , eventually i was told it had been delivered to the wrong_address and it would be collected and redelivered .
negative	this never happened , my partner went to the address it was delivered to and was told it had been collected the same day , i was then told it had gone back to the warehouse as the bag was torn !
negative	i had to but food as i had not got my delivery , when i complained i was told to scan over the receipt which i did but still no sign of my refund .
negative	having spent over a hundred_pound i am very disappointed with the service .
negative	i doubt i will use this company again , mistakes_happen but to be told two different stories does not give one confidence in the company .
negative	i did eventually receive my goods .
negative	they send me the wrong_size shoes .
negative	i ordered a size 0 . 0 and got a size 00 . 0 .
negative	terrible experience all good on way out to holiday well on the way back wen eventually found car somebody had been using it the petrol had all been used and a bottle of water squashed i between car_seat and door there was quarter tank of petrol wen i left it and on return only 00miles of petrol just enough to get to petrol garage a bit_scary at night with young kids in car so no will not recommend .
negative	three emails sent regarding my order for mothers_day flowers which were supposed to be delivered today and were not .
negative	i have tried all day to access iflorists " live support " which untill half past nine tonight was set to " away ".
negative	when i was finally able to connect i was informed by " jack " that due to the mothers_day rush , iflorist were unable to find a florist to deliver on time .
negative	despite the order being placed on 00st_march , nobody could be bothered to get in touch and let_me know this in order that i could make alternative_arrangements .
negative	when i asked why no one had been in touch , i was then informed that due to the limited amount of florists in the area the delivery would not be dispatched untill tuesday .
negative	considering the money has already been taken from my account i think this is completely_unacceptable .
negative	i wish i had read all the terrible reviews this site has had before i placed my order but i honestly didn_'_t expect such shoddy service , i think it '_s absolutely_disgusting that they are taking people '_s money and basically causing undue disappointment and distress to people who rely_on services like this to deliver flowers on special occassions .
negative	i have been offered a discount_voucher for £_00 my next order , well i can tell you with absolute certainty that there will never be a next order from me or anyone i know .
negative	i wouldn_'_t use iflorist again if they were paying me !
negative	i have been told that " jack " will arrange a full_refund , which will be in my account within 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	i will be contacting my bank first thing in the morning to ensure that the money has_been refunded and i will be following this up and taking it further if need be .
negative	in the meantime , i will now have to explain to a rather disappointed mum what has happened and hope that a much more reliable and trustworthy interflora can deliver something which will make up for iflorists terrible service .
negative	in future i '_ll be reading_reviews before i purchase anything , but in the meantime i would urge_anyone to stick to trusted sites and avoid this mob like the plague !
negative	love my teeth !
negative	took 0_weeks to send me a cheque for £ 0 less_than quoted when i entered my items on the website .
negative	have emailed them about it but have not heard back as yet .
negative	no_doubt will get told what everyone else does and that is x number of items were damaged / faulty / torn / stained .
negative	no proof that this is indeed the case .
negative	your word_against theirs .
negative	btw , all the items i sent them were good resalable condition a pity they still operate and that nothing can be done except to warn_others not to make the same mistake us reviewers have .
negative	i decided to sign up to primus but then changed my mind .
negative	emailed my cancellation as per the instructions given by them & within the 00 day cooling_off period ( 0_days in fact ), but they seem to be ignoring me , sending me emails about opening a case for my query .
negative	there is only one query , why won_`_t they simply cancel the order ?
negative	it is very difficult to speak to anybody there , was on hold for what seemed to be forever & still_haven_`_t managed to converse with them .
negative	i have had to contact my bank to ensure they take no payments , fortunately there have been none but they have set_up the direct_debit already .
negative	my bank have put a block on this .
negative	please tell your family & friends to check reviews before signing_up with them .
negative	not only did the website of this company crash , for a full day , but i have now been informed by [_external link_removed_] that this company have cancelled the order and will no_longer fulfil it .
negative	regardless of the fact i paid less_than full price a company has a duty , surely , to fulfil their promises !
negative	also my messages via online_chat , which were initially being answered , are now being ignored !
negative	terrible company
negative	these people are so incredibly poor at their jobs that they apparently are incapable of fulfilling a simple order and would rather send out rudely - worded letters and cancel orders needlessly than deal with any of their many failings as a company .
negative	i ordered frontline for cats .
negative	i received a confirmation_email assuring_me my frontline for cats would arrive by second class postage after the 00th .
negative	on the 00th i received an_email instead of what i had ordered and paid for .
negative	it asked me if my frontline for cats was for a cat !
negative	nowhere in the confirmation process was it indicated that my order would be withheld and in fact cancelled by these utterly_useless people if i did not inform them ( though how i would do so is beyond me given that i was never asked even once while ordering or confirming ) that i wanted frontline for cats ... for a cat !
negative	having complained at such mediocrity being allowed to exist in the human race , let_alone in a company that hands out drugs , and asked them to actually bother to do their jobs , i received a very rudely worded letter informing_me that my order had been cancelled because i '_d apparently hurt the precious feelings of whoever had to read my complaint .
negative	if this is how they do_business then they do not deserve to be in business any more .
negative	i left an enquiry on the website and i am still_waiting on a reply .
negative	i think it is a disgrace to charge £_00 . 00 delivery to scotland for one tiny key and be free in england and wales .
negative	a first_class stamp would have got the key arriving to the destination .
negative	not a good way to do_business as they obviously do not want to have sales from scotland or ireland
negative	i made an order with myprotein just over a month_ago and paid for the two day delivery .
negative	after a week had passed my order still had not arrived so i contacted myprotein and was put on hold for 00_minutes before my call was even answered .
negative	the person i spoke to assured me that my items would be with me within the next 00_hours and that they were held up in the warehouse due to the snow we had that week .
negative	so i waited and waited and waited .
negative	' til this day , i have recieved emailed promises of a refund for the postage , but no refund and no goods .
negative	this is the worst experience i have ever had with an online company and i now google customer reviews for an online company before making an order .
negative	take my advice : do not touch myprotein with a barge_pole - opt for [_external_reference_removed_] instead .
negative	blind arrived , looked good , took old ones down , filled holes , put new one up , went up and down but didn `_t open and close . phoned company said blind is fautly would like a replacement . apparently this not classed_as a fault { the blind not working } and because it was made to measure they would not replace it { total b . s } and lies because the law says if an item is not fit for purpose it should be replaced , wether made to measure or not ! as i was not prepared to have a bare window while they collected and repaired it , they sent me a replacement part which luckily i am competent enough to fit . the quality is rubbish , it dosent hang straight , the slats are not straight but i can `_t be bothered dealing_with people who lie and obviously know their product is rubbish . taught me a lesson , spend more on quality and service !
negative	having been an existing customer of this company i decided to use them for a vet prescription purchase ( to avoid the 000_% mark up at the vets as its long_term medication ) i understand they cannot dispense meds without the hard_copy prescription so posted 0st_class on sunday expecting at the very latest tuesday receipt ?
negative	i paid for my order on the sunday and therefore expected my order to be prepared ready for the prescription receipt which was marked urgent complete with order number to avoid any delays in matching it with my already paid for order .
negative	i also emailed daily sometimes twice to ensure vetsuk got the message i needed the medication urgently for my sick pet .
negative	there is no phone contact listed !
negative	they responded to each email_saying they had not received my prescription through the post until thursday ( 0st_class mail ???)
negative	i wish i had got signed for at the post_office but didn_'_t think necessary at the time ?
negative	i received an_email friday to say that my order ( several other items have been ordered ) was due to be dispatched .
negative	i rang them after receipt of the invoice showing a telephone_number .
negative	i complained about the length of time it had taken to dispense and despatch my urgent order and asked them to upgrade to next_day which_meant saturday delivery ?
negative	they dont do weekend delivery using dpd !!
negative	i am still_waiting for the delivery and have had to sort interim pain_relief .
negative	never again will i use this company they could have helped_me by ensuring my order was dispatched quickly with all the contact i have made but they just didn_'_t care !!!
negative	!
negative	having shopped on the internet for years i got caught out buying from this supplier after checking their " excellent reviews "????
negative	ordered an ipad on 00 / 00 / 00 showing in stock , 0 / 00 days delivery , credit_card debited_immediately !
negative	suffice to say , no goods arrived after several emails of promises , can '_t get through to helpline , always in a queue .
negative	i have finally cancelled the order 00 / 00 /_0000 and would rather pay more and get the goods immediately from a reputable_company .
negative	i was offered a screen_protector and upgraded delivery ( laughable if not infuriating ).
negative	am awaiting a refund although i have already contacted my credit_card provider to put the sale in dispute ...
negative	i will also be looking to report to trading_standards .
negative	when ferrysavers made a mistake in the costing of my booking , they were completely without apology .
negative	obtuse and repetitive , bordering on the rude .
negative	escalating a problem through the system to supervisor level has no effect as they do not think in terms of customer service but rather in terms of protecting the team and not taking on any liability .
negative	beware !
negative	you might get a cheap ferry_crossing , but you won_'_t receive any real service .
negative	whilst the customer service is good in terms of communication the bouquet of flowers was dreadful .
negative	a complete_rip_off .
negative	the smallest ' bouquet ' i have ever_seen for the value of £_00 . 00 .
negative	i have used serenata a number of times but have never seen the product .
negative	today i actually saw the flowers that were sent to my mum and they are pathetic ...
negative	asked to cancel coconut chair after delivery was postponed same as everyone else on this site !
negative	someone called and said i couldn_'_t cancel until the 00 week delivery deadline .
negative	i asked then that someone give me a call back at 00 weeks .
negative	they did call me back and confirmed that yes i could now cancel the item and that i would get my refund within 00 days .
negative	i know , this is probably the same conversation that a lot of people have had with them and no refund is forthcoming .
negative	i am going to give them the benefit of the doubt and see what_happens in 00 days .
negative	will review again in 00 days !
negative	wanted to update my review to say that my money was never forthcoming in_spite of customer_services saying they would chase the finance_department .
negative	got in touch with barclaycard who have refunded me the money and will be pursuing infurn to get their money back .
negative	if you paid on credit_card do get in touch with them as they may be able to help .
negative	how does a company like this stay in business .
negative	they take your money and never deliver the goods .
negative	i placed an order on 0st_november .
negative	after a month started to wonder where the canvas was and what was the problem .
negative	called their_offices and was told it would be sent in the next few_days .
negative	next phone_call was told it had left their_offices and was on its way .
negative	never arrived .
negative	called again and was told will be sent out in few_days .
negative	asked for someone to call me back as i wanted a refund as i didn_'_t_believe a word of what they were saying .
negative	of course nobody called back and have had no refund .
negative	if you are considering using this company don_'_t .
negative	there are companies out there who are a pleasure to deal with and deliver what they say they will .
negative	this company is not one of them !
negative	booked top price tickets back in september , 0 month before event informed that my seats are no_longer available and i have been moved to alternative seating which are 0 block further away and also in a different price bracket .
negative	i phoned and emailed them regarding this but they insist the tickets are of the same value , even_though if you try to book on their website the block i have now been allocated is £_00 . 00 cheaper_than what i originally paid !
negative	now with one week to go they say that they are unable to help me further and if i am still not happy to contact the promoters , this is a complete_joke .
negative	i will now wait_until i attend the concert and see if i can sort anything out then , but i will never use this company again , complete_shambles .
negative	may i also point out that this has happened to my friend for a different concert , booked great seats and then moved to just ok ones , i am beginning to think they sell the best seats and then move you so they can sell the good seats again !!
negative	avoid if you want a hassle_free booking .
negative	i ordered on 00 jan_0000 , today is 00 feb_0000 and i still don_'_t have my order .
negative	this is the first time and the last i will ever use this site .
negative	i ordered 0 large bags of dog_food , a nylabon , box of dentastick and a kong ball .
negative	after 00 days of waiting i called up ( at 00am ) only to say that they had no idea why it had not been sent yet .
negative	he said that he would contact the warehouse and call me back .
negative	he did call me back to say that becuase the order was so large they had to send it out in 0 deliveries and had no idea what was the problem .
negative	( i had only ordered 0 bags becuase of the sale that they had , order 0 for 00 . 00 avant garde hard dog_food , if i had know it would have been such a problem i would not have ordered in the first place ).
negative	then when i did get a call back at 0pm he said that they will bump my service to next_day delivery and all should be well .
negative	on to the next problem , well they courier service they use is horrible .
negative	bad customer service , passing the buck , etc .
negative	i was transfered from one dept to another untill finally had enough , asked for the supervisor only to be hung_up on .
negative	when i called back i finally got some answers .
negative	well the website tracking said " no one home , left contact card " .
negative	we were home , we still are home , and have been home waiting for 0 day becuase of what we '_ve been told every day on the phone .
negative	i have now been told that my order has_been sent on a 00 hour delivery period and that they scan it " no one home , left contact card " becuase obviously they like to upset their customers .
negative	i wonder_if i will ever get the stuff i ordered , £_00 down the drain ??
negative	?
negative	my husband ordered an item from this company , via_amazon .
negative	having waited_patiently for delivery , but to no_avail , he checked his amazon account , which showed that the item had been despatched , although there was no tracking_facility .
negative	as it had been some time since the account stated the item had been despatched , he sent a message via_amazon , enquiring_about delivery .
negative	i am so glad that he kept the email trail as without_seeing it for myself , i would never have believed that a customer service team would respond in such a way , unless the person in question had just won euromillions and didn_'_t give a toss .
negative	he was asked to confirm his address .
negative	for security purposes , my husband did not want to do this by email and suggested that as they had the order , they should be able to see the address - they said they couldn_'_t access the information , but wanted to check in case he had input the address incorrectly .
negative	so my husband pointed_out that as it was the address that had been linked to his amazon account for the last 0 years , not only did he not have to manually enter the data , but we have had no_issues in receiving other amazon ordered products .
negative	they eventually responded to say that they had managed to find the address ( how , all of a sudden ?)
negative	- and that they could confirm that the parcel had been signed for at our property on 00rd_april .
negative	as both my husband and i were at work that day , unless a burglar broke in , signed for a delivery , then left without stealing anything ( except for the order ), then this was impossible .
negative	my husband asked them to clarify this , as we have had issues with couriers in the past who have left items outside our front_door , in full_view of the general_public , and have signed for it themselves , so that they haven_'_t had to bother trying to re - deliver .
negative	they responded to say that they didn_'_t need to check , as they had confirmation it had been signed for , and would be happy to pass the signature over to amazon ( still means nothing !!
negative	).
negative	my husband pointed_out that their customer service was terrible , to which he was told he was a snob ( in capital letters ), and that it wasn_'_t their problem because they had delivered it .
negative	surely , you should actually investigate the matter ?
negative	they have just washed their hands of the situation .
negative	and to top it all off , i wrote a post on their facebook_page last night to say that their customer service was poor - when i checked just now , it has_been removed , and i cannot seem to find the facility to enable me to write another post ............ funny that ............
negative	ordered a lamp on 00 january , and since then have received the same excuses for non - delivery as everyone else ( original item not passed quality control , then it was further delayed as the cargo container wasn_'_t full ) you '_ve all heard these same sentences .
negative	although i originally gave them the benefit of the doubt , even_though i '_d read bad_reviews on here , i eventually got fed_up with waiting and cancelled my order .
negative	i requested a call back in early august which was ignored , but i received an_email on 0 august to confirm cancellation and advising that the refund could take up to 00 days .
negative	apart_from their inability to provide the goods that are ordered from them , they obviously also can '_t count as it '_s now 00 september and yes , you '_ve guessed it , i '_ve still not got my money back .
negative	how do they sleep at night ?
negative	min datter købte iphone covers for i alt kr .
negative	000 fra miniinthebox - og_de kom , dog efter længere tid end forventet .
negative	men en uge senere , dumper en regning fra ups ind af postkassen på kr .
negative	000 for " modtager betaler " fragt - selvom der på miniinthebox '_s hjemmeside står gratis fragt .
negative	det_er under al kritik !
negative	stol ikke på disse over en dørtærskel .
negative	the site explains that a * reasonable * substitution is sometimes required .... however , i ordered a very bright and colorful arrangement and even paid_extra for it to be bigger ... my mum received a dull ugly arrangement that was very small .
negative	then they delivered it a day early when she wasn_'_t even checked in the hospital yet .
negative	when emailing headquarters of the issue they say they will get back to you in no more than 00_hours , i still_haven_'_t heard from them and it '_s three_days_later .
negative	not recommended at all .
negative	the wig that i ordered turned_up frizzy with a massive kink down the middle from how it had been packaged .
negative	postage was very expensive especially for size of package .
negative	was very disappointed with my purchase , waste of money and will not be purchasing again !
negative	i have been happy with this company and even recommended it to my friends and family but this has changed as now i have moved to aberdeen which apparently is not a city that feedem are willing to deliver to .
negative	they wanted £_00 to deliver something that should be £ 0 deliver .
negative	absolutely_appalling as we are 00_minutes from the city and having ordered dozens of parcels over the last few_months i have not come_across a single company that has added any sort of additional_charge .
negative	we are in a postcode with thousands of other properties however when i phoned to complain i was told that there was nothing to be done and that it was in their terms and conditions .
negative	nothing was offered in terms of an_apology or solution and after years of loyal custom i am basically told to sod_off .
negative	totally_unacceptable .
negative	reply to feedem :
negative	i '_m sorry but as a customer who has paid for a service and your company has failed to meet my expectations i have a right to complain and share my experiences with others .
negative	to remove this review would damage the integrity of trustpilot .
negative	this review is not one that i would wish removed and i am happy to escalate this further should you persist in this request .
negative	you have not queried or questioned that any part of my review is anything but factual and i do no think that your basis for a removal request can be seen as fair .
negative	i am a customer .
negative	i did order something and as such i have a right to review your service .
negative	car was 0 / 0 hour late collecting us from airport .
negative	on return we were 00_minutes late being collected from hotel .
negative	the taxi_driver then took the wrong road .
negative	as a result we were very tight in catching our flight home .
negative	we would not use this service again .
negative	great prompt service however the ' chaps ' on the cowboy_outfit have torn already and have had to stitch for my son to attend a party last saturday , so disappointed in the product quality .
negative	they said they could transfer our phone number to our new home .
negative	they gave_us a changeover date .
negative	we moved ( but still had access to our old home for a few_days ).
negative	the lline in our new home was dead .
negative	the old house had changed over from our old supplier to talk_talk ( had someone_else moved in they would have been able to use our phone !)
negative	we tried to point out the error .
negative	it took us 0_days , 0 emails , about 0 . 0hours on the phone to establish that they cannot transfer our old number .
negative	we have been cut_off on several_occasions - and each time we call back we have to re - tell the whole issue !
negative	we cancelled dd and are looking into other_suppliers .
negative	customer service is so poor it is virtually non - existant .
negative	avoid_avoid_avoid
negative	the bed may as well of been made of paper , the quality was shockingly poor .
negative	i have used serenata_flowers before and was happy .
negative	but use again this week for a 00th_birthday the flowers were so poor i told my aunt to bin them a hour after she got them not happy
negative	rude off hand , failed the m . o . t on the head light which needed a small adjustment to the beam on their machines reading , couldn_'_t do it then ( citreon are doing it for free but i have to pay again ) unhelpful wanted me to leave it for some more time with them they are based in the middle of an industrial_estate and i had my 00 year_old daughter with me , he just shrugged when i pointed this out .
negative	would not recommend !
negative	i ordered special food for our cat , the delivery man said he had tried to deliver it twice but i think it was just the once .
negative	i called the driver on saturday 0th_dec and he said he would be with me between 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 , we changed our plans and waited and waited .... no driver turned_up !!
negative	i tried to call him numerous_times and his phone keeps saying unavailable .
negative	i have tried again today and the phone is saying the same .
negative	very disappointing inthe service , i will have to go to the vets tomorrow to collect some more which is additional time and money that is not acceptable .
negative	after_reading one or two of the reviews below , i feel i had a lucky_escape !
negative	on thursday 0th_january i was booked to take my car to gatwick to be collected about 00 : 00 .
negative	despite over 00 calls , we were unable to raise any driver , and had no instructions as to how and where to leave our car .
negative	we drove around and found several companies who did meet and greet .
negative	they were very helpful and even tried to phone gold parking for me !
negative	we took the risk and used one of these , trusting our car would be there on our return .
negative	this company , brittania , was excellent and our car arrived back more promptly than through any other company i had ever used .
negative	on my return i have tried to contact the company to get our fee back ; as yet , the phone remains unanswered !
negative	in short .... look elsewhere !
negative	i ordered dog boots and dog blankets for over_£_00 .
negative	i received a message to say the boots were not in stock ; however , they were debited from my account and in_spite of a promise to refund , they were never refunded .
negative	i returned the dog blankets as the sizes were wrong .
negative	however , i have never received a refund for my returns , sent by royal_mail recorded delivery .
negative	the website does not give a phone number or email address for the company .
negative	it can only be contacted by its own contact form .
negative	in short , they make themselves rather unreachable .
negative	i agree with the other reviewer that the website looks very professional but the actual service does not back this up .
negative	i have contacted them again to ask for my money back .
negative	if i do not get a refund , i will contact trading_standards about this company .
negative	ordered my ghds from them and was happy with the service until yodel tried to deliver my product .
negative	as soon as i got the first card through the door i phoned the delivery person as instructed on the card and asked when they would be re - delivered .
negative	i said that i would be available saturday_morning ( the next_day ) before 00 as i was away for the weekend or after 0 in the week ( it also stated on the card that they deliver between 0 . 00 and 0pm ).
negative	i also said they could leave it with a neighbour .
negative	the next card i got through the door stated that they tried to deliver it at 00 and that they couldn_'_t leave it with a neighbour , then again at lunch times during the week .
negative	after the last card i contacted yodel to explain what had happened and they said i could pick it up from the local_depot .
negative	no where in the email or on their website did it give the address of the local_depot or a date to collect by .
negative	so i went down on a saturday_morning at my earliest convenience to collect package and was surprised to find they had sent it back to sender within a week .
negative	i then contacted body care 0000 to rearrange delivery and was again surprised to find they had refunded me less 00_% for costs for delivery .
negative	as it states on their website that you have two_weeks to collect ( if delivered by royal_mail ).
negative	i then inquired_about what had happened and why i was being charged when i didn_'_t feel i was at fault and i got some really patronising emails off someone called linda @ bodycare0000 .
negative	i then asked for a number and a manager to contact and they never got back to me .
negative	i am out of pocket and have no product .
negative	having bought rapid brow for the past year from boots , i am now beginning to see an amazing difference .
negative	having noticed rapid brow was quite alot_cheaper on your website i thought i would give it ago ...
negative	i have bought 0 from you , the first made my eyebrows sting and be a little sore , the second bottle burnt all the skin around my eyebrow the product had come into contact with .
negative	i do not believe the product you sent me is genuine rapidbrow , i have used to for over a year from boots with nothing but great results .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	this company is diabolical and i have never been involved with such scam_artists .
negative	yes there are some good reviews on this site for pyb , however they are from people who just say " cheap and quick to set_up " - they haven_'_t even tried claiming from pyb .
negative	my ipad was stolen and they are refusing to pay out .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	flowers were for 0 female members of my family , i ordered them at the same time but they received them on different days .
negative	the flowers were nearly dead and even after a day of water they have not recovered , i feel that my money was wasted and i wish i had gone somewhere_else
negative	i saw what looked to be a great deal when i was looking to service my mazda for full service and mot .
negative	a quick search on google_search_engine and up popped service stop winners of dragon '_s den !
negative	impressed ?
negative	car was picked_up as arranged would be returned between 0 and 0 pm .
negative	we will contact you if there are any_problems , so far so good .
negative	! 0 : 00_hours phone_call from service stop " we have sent you an_email with a pro_forma invoice ", " ok i will have a look ad get back to you ".
negative	to my horror i find that there are a few jobs needed to be done to get it through the mot 0 .
negative	cut in tyre at off side rear cost to repair £_00 . 00 +_vat £_000 .
negative	0 , the other 0 tyres have nails in them ?
negative	£_00 headlamps too low £_00 to re set them .
negative	brake_discs worn and pitted £_000 ...... windscreen_wiper not clearing windscreen properly the list_goes on ..... total_cost £_000 . 00 !!!!!!!!
negative	phoned them back and told them i will get the work done elsewhere and just pay for the service and mot greed £_000 as they wont release the car until you have paid !!
negative	i paid by credit_card and waited for it to be brought back at the agreed time .. 0 to 0pm it got to 00 : 00 no sign of car ring them .
negative	" stuck in traffic " 00 : 00 where is my car ?
negative	" round the corner ."
negative	with you soon .
negative	00 : 00 where are you with my car !
negative	i '_m going to ring police my car has_been stolen !!
negative	oh the drivers just leaving the garage now ' darling ',!
negative	now they are lying and patronising me !
negative	car finally arrives at 00 : 00 i '_m fuming .
negative	poor driver got the brunt of my anger ( he only collects and delivers )
negative	i went to get tyres checked .
negative	0 needed_replacing .
negative	lights were ok as were the brake_discs the wiper needed adjusting .
negative	but i got it replaced total_cost for all this ..... £_00 took it myself to the garage service stop had taken it to and it passed .
negative	i told them what i thought and as a gesture of goodwill they cleaned the car ( which should have been included anyway !)
negative	had i been less assertive i could have been conned_into getting un necessary work done at an extortionate cost i will definitely not be using them again i will however be contacting_trading_standards !!
negative	steer_clear
negative	see abovemy supposed e ticket is incomprehensible
negative	brought 00red roses for my fiancée for valentines_day they were the smallest roses and two of them were already dead .
negative	i wont_be ordering from you again .
negative	what a waste of money and embarrassment o felt after she received them .
negative	i ordered a made to measure_blind 00 days ago ; the money was taken promptly from my bank_account on the same date .
negative	having received nothing from blinds0uk regarding a delivery date , i contacted them yesterday ( 00 days since order ).
negative	after being promised phone_calls back which were never received , i ended_up having to make three_separate phone_calls over the space of 0 hours .
negative	the customer_services representative i spoke to each time was rude and unhelpful .
negative	she told me that there was no date for delivery and no further information_regarding this .
negative	when i told her i wanted a refund , she told me i was not entitled to one and basically ended_up putting the phone down on me .
negative	i rang back numerous_times , only for the staff to refuse to answer .
negative	eventually , the manager picked_up , who was initially aggressive and extremely defensive .
negative	she told me she frequently has disgruntled_customers on the phone as , in her_words , their delivery times are ' appalling '.
negative	she promised me faithfully that she would deal with my order personally and would be in touch today to give me a delivery date .
negative	at lunch_time , having heard_nothing once again , i telephoned blinds0uk and was connected to the same rude representative i had initially dealt_with , who barked at me " hold on " and placed me on hold .
negative	when she returned , i have once again been told that there is still no delivery information .
negative	no one knows when the item is going to be delivered to me and i am being refused a refund .
negative	this company are dishonest , unreliable and employ extremely rude , unpleasant and unhelpful staff who never return calls .
negative	i would never buy anything from them again and urge_anyone considering it to go somewhere_else .
negative	you have been warned !
negative	ordered two_pairs of shoes from boohoo totaling almost £_00 .
negative	i was charged for both and only received one .
negative	i have tried to contact boohoo using all methods ( inc twitter and facebook ) and had no response .
negative	their customer service is truly_awful .
negative	they have no contact number and despite responding to most_recent messages on twitter , they ignored mine from hours ago .
negative	very selective about who the help obviously .
negative	disgusting .
negative	if i could give no stars , i would have .
negative	i will never be using boohoo again .
negative	they do not care about their customers at all .
negative	avoid at all costs .. you can get the same items elsewhere and actually receive them !
negative	!
negative	haven_'_t received it yet .
negative	dog '_s meds ran_out yesterday .
negative	disappointed
negative	i have spent most of my morning telling any one who will listen what an efficient delivery service river_island are running .
negative	so , imagine my surprise when i then hear from my boyfriend who has taken time of work to await the arrival of my parcel that it has not been delivered .
negative	the first thing i did was check river_islands seemingly uber efficient tracking website which told me that my parcel had not been delivered as the driver could not find my address .
negative	the only options i was given to proceed via the tracking service was to choose another day or deliver my parcel to a neighbour .
negative	the nature of my problem meant that both of these options were invalid so i set about negotiating the labyrinth that is , fist dpd ( the couriers ), and then river_islands own customer service lines .
negative	both of which , surprise_surprise , are dreadful .
negative	dpds line ( the courier service used by river_island ) has 0 / 0 options which lead to an_automated_message before cutting the caller off .
negative	the remaining option " 0 " if anyone_else is having this problem finally got me through to a genuine human_being : mark , who , judging_by the sound of his voice , really could not be arsed giving any customer service via his customer service line .
negative	i was told by the lovely mark that dpd would be unable to change the address on my parcel and that i should contact river_islands own customer service line .
negative	i did this , not easily i might_add , and found myself , after another wonderfully frustrating automated_voice parade , on the phone to an employee named mike who sounded_like he cared_about as much as mark had before him .
negative	mike told me , in pure monotone , that river_island were unable to change the address on a package and nor could i cancel my purchase .
negative	the reason i was given for being unable to change the address was that the website triple checks the address with the customer thrice before purchase is completed on the website .
negative	i then asked the cheerful chap what river_island therefore suggested i do next and was told to call back dpd .
negative	now , let_me just stop there for a moment , at this point neither company will allow me to change my address or take_responsibility for my parcel nor am i allowed to return the goods and am unable to change the date or deliver to a neighbour because the courier cannot find the address which i cannot change .
negative	does any one else see how illogical this whole_thing is ?
negative	well , luckily for me matthew at dpd did who quickly went above and beyond to help me rectify my , admittedly , own mistake with the original address .
negative	however , even matthew could not save the day entirely as i will no_longer be shopping at river_island .
negative	i had spent over_£_000 on this purchase alone and no one i spoke with seemed the slightest bit inclined to help me until i explained the situation in full to matthew at dpd .
negative	moral of the story ?
negative	river_island bad , dpd ( their courier service ) bad , matthew of dpd ...
negative	the silver_lining .
negative	why are you still wrapping raw meat with food that will be eaten raw in home shopping ?
negative	i have complained to you , i have reported you to environmental health but still you do it .
negative	as well as the health risks , the food wastage is enormous .
negative	why are you the only company left on the planet that doesn_'_t accept electron for online shopping ?
negative	you must be able to afford to lose a lot of money .
negative	i am so angry and frustrated with floraqueen !
negative	ordered flowers for my parents 00th_wedding_anniversary for delivery on fri_00th_march .
negative	until today no flowers !
negative	what '_s more frustrating is that nobody from floraqueen has even bothered replying to my email or returning a phone_call as promised .
negative	do not use this company !!
negative	what a waste of money .
negative	my husband bought me roses for our first valentines_day together .
negative	he recieved an_email on wednesday 00th at 00 . 00pm to say they wouldnt be delivered until 00th !!!!!
negative	after waiting until_0pm today - still no sign so my husband called up and apparently they would be there before 0pm !
negative	they have just turned_up now and and they are a total state .
negative	every flower is pretty_much dead .
negative	really disappointed .
negative	paid an extra five_pound for a messed_up delivery and they didn_'_t care when i complained .
negative	awful company , terrible customer service , won_'_t be back .
negative	i ordered an office light on 0 november_0000 .
negative	when the light had not arrived by 00th_november , i emailed and received a response to say that it would be delivered to me the following working day .
negative	still no lamp .
negative	i emailed again on 00st to advise that it was still not here and the adviser told me that it would be with me by 00th_november .
negative	today i called to chase_up and the customer_services adviser was rude and sarcastic .
negative	i asked to cancel the order and she had the nerve to say that if the light had already been dispatched , i would have to pay delivery charges !!
negative	i was absolutely stunned .
negative	i have been told that i will have to wait for my refund minus the delivery charges no_doubt !
negative	i can '_t_believe that a company like this is still in operation in today '_s market !
negative	i was very upset to find out that i had paid so much for my tickets , i could have got them at half the price i paid through a different web_site .
negative	i had never_heard of via go go before .
negative	i will not use you again .
negative	on the plus_side the tickets arrived quite quickly after i had ordered them .
negative	myself and the 0 friends for whom i purchased the tickets are all pensioners and can ill_afford such prices .
negative	purchased an acre of moon off here from moon estates , waited 00 days for it to arrive , when it did the certificate had the wrong name on it .
negative	when i contacted moon estates they told me it was a £ 0 charge to change the name and that they had had a great number of calls as wowcher had made mistake with order details .
negative	i do not see why i should have to pay this amount to change the name .
negative	have emailed several_times over a week_ago and heard_nothing back at all .
negative	disgusted
negative	we ordered the signed one direction album on 00th_oct_0000 and are still_waiting !!
negative	( now 0th_jan !!)
negative	if the site didn_'_t have the product why did they take orders from teenage girls .
negative	communication with site tells_me they are awaiting stock , they should know if this stock is likely to be available .
negative	i think that it is very poor service from a company attached to sony !
negative	!
negative	have been a loyal_customer of orange for many_years , yet when i have a problem customer_services don_'_t want to know .
negative	i am very seriously_considering moving to another_provider , orange has_gone so far down in my estimation .
negative	from the very rude person in an orange shop to being told that my problem will be sorted_out , what they didn_'_t say was ' when they will be bothered to help resolve this problem '.
negative	very poor battery life , keypad so small you keep hitting the wrong letters on the samsung_galaxy mini , i can '_t even connect to my email address .
negative	bad customer_services , my score would be 0 / 00 .
negative	received bulk powder , order stated follow enclosed welcome leaflet .
negative	no leaflet_enclosed so do not know how to take this product , as it states on packaging do not exceed stated usage , how can i do this when i don_'_t know what it is .
negative	very disappointed with my 0st order , do not think i will be re - ordering .
negative	i placed my order on 00th_september_0000 and was advised 0 - 0_days delivery time .
negative	on 00th_october i emailed to request an update as my order had not been received and got the following response on 00th_october " due to a supplier error your order is due to be with you on thursday ."
negative	no apology , nothing !!
negative	so i waited_until thursday 00th_october and surprise_surprise no order has_been delivered , no card has_been left to say delivery has_been attempted .
negative	i sent a further email on 00th_october explaining that i had not received my order and requested an explanation as to why my order was further delayed - the response i received today is " as per the email that was sent to you on the 00th your order has already been shipped to you ", no apology no offer to chase this up to find out what the further delay is .
negative	i have paid £_000 . 00 for my order and i am_disgusted - a further complaint email has_been sent !
negative	do not use this site .
negative	the flowers were delivered to completely the wrong_address and area .
negative	my mum received them 0_days_later when delivered by a member of the public .
negative	all the flowers were crushed and dead as had been left not watered for 0_days .
negative	i have not been given a refund and my mum never got her mothers_day present .
negative	i am really unhappy with the service !
negative	have had countless orders from this company however my last 0 orders have been terrible .
negative	items arriving damaged , no tags , heel broken on a pair of boots and a strap on a bag snapped .
negative	sizes changed order a 00 it '_s like an 00 order a 00 it '_s like a 0 .
negative	complained to head_office as ordered a cardigan size 00 .
negative	when it came was stuffed in a bag , hole in shoulder , no tags to say was new .
negative	looked inside had a george asda tag size 0 .
negative	contacted company took photo of item they denied sending it said they didn_'_t sell asda clothing even_though cardigan was identical to the one on the site which i screen_shot and sent with the picture of the cardigan .
negative	they refused to let_me return it .
negative	person_who emailed me was very rude .
negative	i have been waiting for my order to be processes for 00 days now and it still has not been done .
negative	when i link on to website my order is saying in progress .. it never gets any further .
negative	i have emailed loads of times and just get fobbed_off with " i will look into why the delay ".. but no one ever does .
negative	their website says 00_% of orders despatched within 0_days ..
negative	this is one big joke !
negative	i am still_waiting for my order to even get to the quality control dept .. never mind being shipped .
negative	buyer_beware ...
negative	this company is rubbish .
negative	they take your money and order ..
negative	the leave you waiting .
negative	don_'_t waste your money .. buy elsewhere

negative	my experience was awful and i will not trust hotel info again !

negative	there was no transparency on who i was renting the car from .
negative	when i arrived at the rental_car depot , there was over 00 companies .
negative	i tried_phoning and we were on hold forever 00_mins then got cut_off .
negative	tried an_email and no immediate_response .
negative	soi had no choice but to go to each_individual desk and finally found the car .
negative	an_email didn_'_t arrive until the next_day .
negative	the service from the rental_car company was fine .
negative	the service from rentalcars . com was terrible .
negative	i do hope you choose to fix your processes and email your clients at_least a day prior to the car_rental date so they may pick their car up in a quick and timely_fashion .

negative	i used floraqueen to send my mum flowers to palma for mother '_s day and never again will i use this company .
negative	firstly i paid for a premium delivery for saturday and my bouquet did not turn_up until the sunday after waiting all saturday for it .
negative	the status on my account showed ' delivered ' however this was mot the case .
negative	secondly i had upgraded my order to a 000g box of lindt chocolates and freixenet cava .
negative	what was actually received was a 00g box of nestle chocolate and some other brand of cava which is € 0 . 00 in the local_supermarket .
negative	and the bouquet looked nothing like the picture .
negative	granted you allow for some difference but not to the extent of what was received !
negative	my response from floraqueen when i raised my complaint was to only offer a 00_%_discount on my next purchase which is fine if my experience was good but after this experience i will certainly never use this company again and i hope other would be customers will think_twice before using them too .
negative	i will be taking this to trading_standards
negative	my husband ordered me flowers for valentine '_s day , and it was agreed upon ordering them that they would be delivered before 0pm as we were leaving for a week long trip at 0pm ( the plan was to take the flowers with us so that i could enjoy them whilst i was away ).
negative	between 0 and 0pm my husband was getting more and more concerned that the flowers hadn_'_t showed up , so he kept ringing eflorist but could never get through on the phone ( he was on hold the entire time ).
negative	we waited_until 0 . 00pm but couldn_'_t hold on any longer as we had a 0 hour car journey ahead of us and a 00 month_old who needed to be put to sleep in the car .
negative	eventually our flowers must have turned_up as they were delivered to our neighbours .
negative	after failing to get through to eflorist on the phone , my husband sent an_email complaint to them but no one ever replied .
negative	the next_day he continually rang eflorist but could never get through when selecting the option that he was calling about an " existing order ".
negative	eventually he got through when he selected the option to " place a new order ", and was told he was not eligible for a refund despite explaining our circumstances in detail .
negative	we never even got to see the flowers as we were away for a week , and they had died by the time we got home .
negative	we both wrongly assumed that eflorist would be apologetic and give us a full_refund but as they refused we intend to spread the word to our friends , family and beyond that they shouldn_'_t use eflorist .
negative	following on from reviewing a company trustpilot contacted me saying my negative_review of said company was in breach of their guidelines .
negative	i edited by review to bring it inline and it went live .
negative	it was taken down again immediately and i was asked to provide evidence to my purchase .
negative	i sent an invoice i had from the company and imagined i would see my review live again .
negative	this is not the case .
negative	i '_m now being questioned on what i purchased , as if that is relevant whether i bought a chair or a table !
negative	the important point is that i have complied with every_single guideline and my review is still not visable .
negative	i find this completely_unacceptable and certainly not unbiased as they should be .
negative	i made my order for an xmas jumper on a tuesday , paid £ 0 for standard delivery ( 0 - 0 working_days ) for week_later to have alarm_bells going off when i hadn_'_t received my order .
negative	i wrote to them and the assure me it would be on it '_s way , they '_ve just had a busy_period .
negative	the following_day i received an_email to say my item has out of stock despite ordering it a week previously and them taking money out of my account .
negative	i have left orange after 00 years as a customer .
negative	i had been without a signal at home for over three_weeks .
negative	i had to use my bt landline to contact them as i had no signal at home .
negative	this increased my bt phone bill by over_£_00 .
negative	i have eventually had an acknowledgement of two emails from ceo '_s office whom i contacted after two_weeks .
negative	i had so many promises broken by staff who were supposed to call me back , the signal was always ok at home until they joined with ee and t - mobile .
negative	the staff in india are an_absolute_joke and were rude , surly and hung_up on me .
negative	if i could have rated it lower_than 0_star i would have done .
negative	i am now with o0 with great customer service and a functioning phone beside me on my sofa , great signal .
negative	thanks o0 .
negative	orange should be struck off or something !
negative	!
negative	i bought this dress from jokers_masquerade and it lasted 0 hours .
negative	the material around the waist went into a massive hole becasue it was that thin and rubbish it went into the bin , i wasted £_00 on absolute garbage !
negative	we went to view our love films this evening , and noticed that we had to re - register with amazon . we were appalled to see that amazon , are now charging prime time fee on all of the films that you may want to watch . so what was free as part of your love_film membership , no_longer stands , and you have to pay to watch the films , in addition to your original membership_fee . appalling , my sons and i could not watch our films , so we watched netflix instead . really disappointed love films member .

negative	i had 0 seeds and all started to germinate but the female seeds grew a very small root and stopped as the seed was splitting open and now nothing for 0_weeks .
negative	the regular seed germinated and is growing fine .

negative	should of got 00 regular seeds and maybe i '_d have more than one plant that may or may not be a female .
negative	måtte købe en ting i butikken for at få lov at_bestille en lampe der kun kunne købes i butikken men som ikek var hjemme .
negative	den kunne i midlertid heller_ikke bestilles med levering , så_det måtte jeg selv klare med_en taxa , da_jeg_ikke har bil og ikke kan have en stor gulv lmpe på_en cykel .
negative	ekspedienten var meget hjælpsom og prøvede alt , men forklared mig , at jeg måtte købe en ting i butikken for at hun vill ekunne snyde systemet , hvilket så heller_ikke lykkedes .
negative	varen kunne herfor ikek leveres .
negative	herudover sendte faktureringssystemet en uheldig meddelelse ud til_alle kunder , at der ikke var dækning på ens kreditkort og at de_ikke kunne trække beløbet som iøvrigt også var forkert og ikke fratrukket den rabat der_var gældende den dag jeg_var i butikken for at købe min lampe .
negative	0 uger efter fik_jeg besked_om , at lampen var kommet hjem og_jeg måtte tage derop og_så bestille en taxa hjem for at få min vare med hjem , som_jeg til at at starte med havde bedt om at få lov at få levering på og_var helt klar_til at betale , da_jeg_ikke hr andre muligheder .

negative	prisen i ser er heller_ikke den i faar .

negative	i ordered flowers for my mums_00th_birthday on the 0 / 00 / 00 to be delivered on the 00 / 00 / 00 her_birthday , flowers were not delivered on the 00th so missed her_birthday and she leaves the country on the 00th so now a late delivery is pointless very upset as it looks like i forgot my mums_birthday have contacted eflorist by email as i am not in uk but have had no response as yet , not happy at all will not use service again will stick with interflora in future .
negative	used to be good , what '_s happened to this company ?
negative	recently have not replied to emails and now emails are bouncing back ?
negative	i have noticed that others are complaining on facebook about the same problem .
negative	0 times my order has_gone_missing .
negative	all separate_orders .
negative	my address is 0 / 0 and deliveries have got to number 00 and got knows where else .
negative	think you should change your courier .
negative	well i will not be using you again , in fact you have put me off ordering flowers on line completely !
negative	after several phone_calls and emails asking to change the address , the flowers ended_up arriving where i didnt want them to go .
negative	not only that but they look half the size and half as ' alive ' as the websites photo ... and they werent cheap either !
negative	i am utterly disapointed , they definitely don_'_t look the way they do in the picture , it was for my mums_birthday , thought it would be nice to get flowers delivered , i would have been better going to asda and picking_up a bunch for £ 0 & paying someone £_00 to deliver , would have looked far_superior , £_00 down the drain lesson definatley learned
negative	i don_'_t like that cheapsmells . com overcharge their customers with too much in postage .
negative	i '_m tired of being tricked_into order some " cheap " items , and when i '_m about to pay with my creditcard , suddenly find out how much cheapsmells . com wants from me in postage - costs .
negative	next time , if i find something that i really , really want , and the same items is cheaper in other netshops , i will order from those others .
negative	cheapsmells . com is no cheap any more !!!!!!

negative	we placed an order on the 00st november for an iphone_0c .
negative	despite many calls explaining we had to receive today for our daugter '_s birthday , december 00 !
negative	we have not received our order !!!
negative	i will be reporting to trading_standards as they are still advertising as dispatch within 0 - 0_days on their website !!!
negative	a big con !
negative	!
negative	a saving is not a saving unless you receive goods , so buy from reputable_companies - not this one !
negative	their website should be pulled off the internet by google .
negative	i have just recieved my valentines_day flowers which my boyfriend bought from them to be sent to me at work today ( valentines_day ) and i just needed to express how disgusted i am .
negative	the flowers were delivered in a damaged box and when i opened them i was so dissapointed .
negative	these flowers were dispatched on monday 00th_feb - are you suprised they are dead ?
negative	there were not in water and had come loose in the box so are not looking their best .
negative	the mojority of them are dry , black and curling !
negative	they are so squashed and look like a 0 year_old hand_tied them .
negative	i had to call my boyfriend and thank him , however he knew something was wrong and is equally as angry that he purchased from yourselves .
negative	i understand they are an internet company with lots of orders but there will be so many unhappy ladies today if their flowers were sent out monday and arrived in this state aswell !
negative	i am_furious !
negative	hope to be getting a refund !
negative	if you cant handle the busy day orders then dont take any more !
negative	dead flowers are no use to anyone !
negative	i wont even be able to enjoy them for one day .
negative	purchased a tablet from this company and had to return for repair , so far so good .
negative	it came back and within a week was faulty again .
negative	returned as per their instructions - april_0000 and no word from them since .
negative	no response to support ticket ( which is now dead ) or to numerous_emails .
negative	all negative_comments on facebook were taken off and there is now no means of commenting - a transparent company ?
negative	i think not !
negative	important to note : as of april_0000 jexaa limited was dissolved .
negative	now trading under tablet gear limited - same director , same address .
negative	interesting that i got a marketing email tonight from jexaa limited .
negative	i have gone to watchdog .
negative	the tablet was a christmas 0000 present for my autistic_son - shameful .
negative	do not touch this company !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	as with many of the people below i ordered a bean_bag via_groupon on 0th_november for a christmas_present and it '_s not arrived and i cannot get a response via_email or telephone - i '_ve tried several numbers .
negative	i '_ve now written to bbc_watchdog and copied them this thread as well as writing to groupon about it .
negative	will let you know what_happens .
negative	bought a coat and the wrong_size came .
negative	tried several_times to call but no one ever picked_up .
negative	sent numerous_emails and query forms to which i had a ' thank_you for your query ' reply but never received anything_else despite them saying they answer all emails within 0 working_days ???
negative	total_waste of time !!!

negative	lucky for me i paid on my credit_card so i am covered and they wont_be keeping my money !!

negative	i posted on here four days ago re : gig etickets that were unavailable to print ( and the expense of a trip_abroad for 0 people wasted on the back of this - review included here ).
negative	viagogo replied to me on this forum asking for my transaction ids , which i supplied via my account with them .
negative	this was the 0th time i contacted them for help using this method ( their own customer service dept !
negative	), with all such contact ignored .
negative	the first contact i made was on 00th_feb , the day of the gig , this was confirmed as having been received , with an assurance that events happening within 00_hours would be treated as urgent .
negative	i '_ve still not even received an acknowledgement from viagogo of the problem , and this is proving to be a nightmarish transaction .
negative	viagogo are you a business or a bunch of crooks ?
negative	i only purchased because of your ticket guarantee but do you actually honour this ?
negative	here , again are the transaction ids .
negative	although i '_d rather have sorted this in private via my account with you .
negative	but as you have not responded and only seem to respond to bad_reviews on this website , rather_than legitimate enquiries via your_own customer service facility , i feel i have no other option !

negative	my original review :
negative	ruined my brother in law '_s birthday
negative	bought 0 tickets for a gig on viagogo for my bro in laws_birthday , we all spent money getting out to amsterdam thinking the eticket downloads were legit .
negative	the sale went through on viagogo and money taken out from paypal so seemed fine , but when i went to download and print the tickets they were unavailable .
negative	contacted viagogo 0 times in the 00hrs leading up to the gig to try to rectify but didn_'_t hear a word back from them .
negative	all of the money was still deducted from my account .
negative	needless to say 0 people wasted their money on flights and hotels to amsterdam and couldn_'_t attend the gig we paid for .
negative	feel like a mug , my brother in law '_s birthday was ruined .
negative	am logging a complaint with paypal to see if they can rectify , will keep you all updated
negative	viagogo refs :( ref_:_00000000 ); ( ref_:_00000000 )
negative	viagogo response ( not followed up despite my providing the info requested ):
negative	dear catherine ,
negative	thank_you for getting in touch .
negative	we '_d like to look into what happened here but cannot trace your order from the email reference_numbers you have sent .
negative	please could you send your 0 - digit transaction number so that we can look into your order .

negative	i e_- mailed wowcher on their enquiries e_- mail address regarding a special_offer they advertised on september 0th , asking if the deal was suitable for a person in a wheelchair .
negative	to this day , i still_haven_'_t heard from them and the deal is long gone .
negative	looking at previous_reviews , it seems that the only way to get a response from wowcher is to leave poor feedback on a public_forum , so here goes .
negative	the lack of respect in answering potential customer '_s queries is , quite_frankly , disgusting and , as such , i won_'_t be using them in the future , however good the deals are .
negative	horrendous_experience !!
negative	ordered my brother '_s xmas_present in nov , which the website advised was out of stock , but would be available in jan ..( as he already knew what he was getting he said was happy to wait ).
negative	when checking my bank_statement in mid dec though i noticed a refund from very , rang them & they confirmed they had cancelled the order as they were not in fact getting the item in ( but didn_'_t have the courtesy to actually inform_me of this in the 0wks since ).. then it turned_out they hadn_'_t refunded the shipping ... so i spent probably the cost of this on phonecalls ( was cut_off twice while ' on hold ' after battling through the lengthy & inaccurate voice recognition menu system ).
negative	it took 0 attempts for what passes as ' customer service ' to find my account , then 00_minutes on hold while they talked to a supervisor , before saying they couldn_'_t refund my card , but would have to send out a cheque for £ 0 . 00 ... gaaaaaaaaaaaaah .
negative	shop with very at your_peril - only if you have the patience of a saint & don_'_t care about shocking service ....
negative	can '_t be trusted to renew your domains .
negative	they randomly don_'_t send reminders and having your domain on auto - renew is pointless because their systems don_'_t work properly .
negative	they fully acknowledge that their renewal systems don_'_t work .
negative	if you have any domain that is of any value to you ( i . e .
negative	any domain you register ), pretty_much anywhere is better_than 000 - reg .
negative	used to be very happy , now very disappointed , won_'_t use again , will transfer all my domains elsewhere .
negative	as i selected the button buy one get one free offer button i automatically assumed this was the offer i ordered .
negative	i will not be using this site again because i feel i cannot trust what i thought i ordered will be delivered if i have to read the small_print every time i place an order .
negative	i had told my friends i had found a great site !
negative	i will now tell them before they order to read the small_print .
negative	please remove my details from your mailing_list .
negative	this has obviously still not been done .
negative	please read the customer service rssponse
negative	i '_m very disappointed as i am still_awaiting payment
negative	again my story is the same as the previous 0 - i placed an order on 00nd may_0000 and 0_weeks_later have not received it .
negative	the owner has advised me on the many occasions that i have phoned her that it was posted a week_ago , however it has never been received .
negative	i have tried_calling again , but the phone is not being answered .
negative	my advice is avoid this web_site ( and the other one she runs from the same address !)
negative	like the plague .
negative	i ddon '_t even think that it is much_cheaper_than some of the more reputable ones !
negative	goods were paid for and never received .
negative	was notified by delivery company yodel that apparently the goods were signed for and delivered - even_though i was away when the goods were apparently signed for by " whoever ", i have now been asked to send a hand_written letter of complaint and photo id proving who i am !!!!
negative	who is in the wrong here ???
negative	?
negative	i was disappointed to book one car_parking firm and be greeted_by another , cheaper , company .
negative	looking 0 parking were uninterested in my feedback .
negative	i paid a 00_% premium and feel i received poor value for money .
negative	after receiving my order very promptly i may add i was very dissapointed in the quality of the material !
negative	so much so on trying it on it split at the seam quite badly and no it wasn_'_t because it was to small it was just very poor quality !
negative	so its back to the drawing_board for me as i need the costume for friday !
negative	an order placed on the 00st_december is still " processing " according to my account details .
negative	the company failed to respond to a request to swap the item in order to get something for christmas and have failed to respond to a request since christmas to cancel the order and refund .
negative	the web_site looks good but it accounts for nothing if the service is poor .
negative	i won_'_t be using them again or recommending them .
negative	i '_ve given then one star as it seems you cannot_rate them with zero_stars !
negative	ordered 00 personalised minature whiskeys for a christmas party .
negative	waited nearly a full week for the art_work to be sent despite calling the office daily .
negative	was continuously told that the email had been sent and that it was a problem with their computers .. rather conveniently though the email with the link for payment seemed to arrive in my inbox just fine ..!
negative	the product arrived a day after the event ..!
negative	won_'_t be using again !
negative	i had used mandmdirect a couple of times in the past but i happened to check my bank_account over christmas and they had taken money from my bank_account .
negative	i hadn_'_t ordered anything in months .
negative	i contacted them and they refunded it but said they couldn_'_t give an explanation - just not a good enough response for such a breech of trust !
negative	paid_extra for same day delivery , emailed back next_day ( sunday ) saying couldn_'_t deliver !
negative	00 th_birthday made us look bad
negative	very disappointed to have to return unwanted goods to denmark and pay for postage .
negative	will not be ordering again
negative	i received an order that i did not want but simple supp do not like giving refunds so i have to buy more goods to retreve my money not happy with this way of doing_business
negative	code was smudged so it took_ages to decipher it .
negative	my son has aspergers and so it caused real upset .
negative	when we bought these off you before the code was printed clearly , but this looked like a scratch card very badly_scratched making it really difficult .
negative	cant_believe that paypal have debited me twice & bcs could not give a dame , so im skint ......................................... merry_xmas as they say !
negative	!
negative	order cancelled and refunded without notice and £ 0 withheld from refund .
negative	not even an_email to say why .
negative	had to call and explain how difficult it is to type in a bfpo_address into a form which doesn_'_t allow for it .
negative	speak to you local post_office they will tell you the fields which are required .
negative	will not recommend you to any forces families who live_abroad .
negative	alpharooms passed only selected information_regarding my special request to my hotel ( i . e .
negative	not passed the part that i would like to order some baby_equipment only if it is free of charge ), so eventually i paid for holidays much more than was expecting ( as hotel provided it , and i was sure it is free of charge ).
negative	i wrote to alpharooms , but they do not take the responsibility and no compensation is possible .
negative	they stopped writing to me after saying the decision is full and final .
negative	not much to do about it now .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	it is easy to be cheapest , when you hide charges .
negative	send this free card and when it arrived at the other end , it just turned_out to be a blank red screen with happy xmas from aldi on it .
negative	you can '_t actually contact aldi in the uk by email ...
negative	i certainly wouldn_'_t want to pay for this service .
negative	i recently had to return a faulty jacket that i had purchased only 0_months prior and was very disappointed withe level of customer service i received .
negative	upon my first visit to the store to return the jacket i was told there was no one there to make a decision therefore someone would have to call me back to advise me if the jacket would be sent away for repair or i would get a credit_note / refund .
negative	i had to contact the store 0_days_later as no one had contacted me .
negative	i was told the jacket would need to be sent for repair ( even_though it appeared to be unrepairable ) and this would take about one week .
negative	after almost a week an a half i had heard_nothing so i contacted the store again and was told someone would call me back .
negative	no one did so i called again the following_day to be told the manufacturer had changed its outsourcing department therefore it was taking longer_than usual .
negative	after approx 0_weeks the jacket returned however the main fault to the inside lining had not been repaired .
negative	the assistant told me once again there was no one there to make a decision so i would have to wait_until the following_day to find out where to go from here .
negative	i called the next_day & the assistant spoke to the opperations manager who said the jacket looked unrepairable & would most_likely be elligible for a full_refund however it would once again need to be sent back to the manufacturer for them to confirm this before they could refund my money .
negative	they ensured me this would only take a few_days unlike the first ocassion that took 0_weeks .
negative	i continued to call the store ( as the stores communication was not the greatest .)
negative	i finally visited the store again a week and a half later ( after still not hearing_anything ) to express my disappointment with their lack of service & empathy with the situation .
negative	i explained to the opperations manager that my stautaory rights meant that my contract was with them the store not the manufacturer therefore it was down to them to make a decision on a refund .
negative	i was no_longer happy to accept a credit_note due to the level of bad customer service i had experienced & for all the inconvenience .
negative	the opperations manager was quite patronising and offered no more than a credit_note .
negative	after half an_hour debating my point and arguing my statutory_rights i was no further foward so walked_away quite dissatisfied .
negative	i was told i would receive an online credit_note and a discount_code to use on the order .
negative	i was not suprised that i had to contact the store twice as no discount_code was emailed to me .
negative	i find the standard of customer service provided by end clothing is unacceptable .
negative	i am a retail manager myself and find it disgraceful that a store does not provide the same level of service when returning items as when buying .
negative	i have friends who have had similar_experiences with end and as a result they have lost not only my custom but also that of friends .
negative	i urge them to seruiously reconsider their returns process and how they deal with these in future .
negative	i am taking this further .
negative	on 0 january_0000 , i placed an order by phone with getlenses . co . uk and was told that they would arrive on the following_monday 00 january .
negative	they didn_'_t arrive on that date and getlenses . co . uk did not contact me to explain the delay .
negative	i therefore contacted them in the week beginning 00 january , and was told that they would make enquiries and call back with an explanation .
negative	they did not do so , and so i called them in the following week .
negative	they could not explain the delay or provide an_alternative delivery date and so i cancelled the order .
negative	they were always perfectly pleasant , but they ' re in business to provide a service ; and if they are unable to provide that service , the very least they should do is contact their customers to explain the difficulty and apologise .
negative	they failed to do this .
negative	i am still_waiting for my parcel to arrive ........................
negative	they sent a text saying that my order was going to be delivered .
negative	the order number in the text didn_'_t match anything i had .
negative	i ordered a few things and i was waiting for 0 items to be delivered from different stores .
negative	subsequently i couldn_'_t figure_out what item was the one that was supposed to be delivered .
negative	the delivery day passed and i didn_'_t receive anything , i didn_'_t get any calls either .
negative	the next_morning , a lady called me asking me why the item wasn_’_t deliver .
negative	i was in shock because if they don_'_t know , how am i supposed to know ?
negative	i had to tell this lady how to do her job and asked her to call the delivery person and then call me back with an answer because she didn_’_t know what to do .
negative	she said that the driver knows the area i live in very well and that nobody was living there .
negative	we certainly live there so , i don_'_t know if the driver had a bad dream the night before and was still in it .
negative	anyway , the delivery was supposed to be on a thursday but because it didn_'_t happen they had to re schedule for next monday .
negative	they couldn_'_t on friday .
negative	i couldn_'_t work in my garden during the whole weekend because these people didn_'_t you their job properly .
negative	monday comes and the driver finally rings our bell .
negative	the box looks like if someone decided to use it as a boxing bag during the weekend .
negative	i didn_’_t want to accept my parcel because of its condition but the " friendly " driver said that i needed to accept it and then re schedule another delivery if i wanted to .
negative	i did so , opened my parcel and it was broken in two parts .
negative	now , i have to loose my time again with these people , writing them an e_- mail and hoping they did it right this time .
negative	i rented a sledge hammer to do the work and i am going to have to return it without using it because i don_'_t have what i ordered and paid for – i lost my time and money for nothing .
negative	it '_s the first and the last time i order with this company .
negative	dreadful service !
negative	they stole our money .
negative	we turned_up for our hen_do cocktail_making sessions at sway bar and were told release travel hadn_'_t paid for the session or dinner and that it would cost 000_pounds .
negative	we paid release months before .
negative	of course there was no one answering release travel " we '_ll be there should have any_problems " emergancy phone line .
negative	the hen was distraught .
negative	have since looked up their credit_history they have four ccjs out againest them , and even then they haven_'_t paid up .
negative	they lied to the hen all the previous week saying everything was all good and ready .
negative	getting the money back is like getting blood out of a stone .
negative	we got ours back by going down and visiting them in person , when they said the cheque would be ready .
negative	which they had said about 00 times before .
negative	wish i had read these reviews before i placed my order .
negative	hope this will help others avoid same hassle .
negative	ordered 0 cookers on a special price deal .
negative	website showed stock and order was placed , credit_card charged .
negative	delivery terms we '_ll call you within 0_days and delivery within 0_days .
negative	no call after 0_days , checked website could still order item for 0 day delivery , so i called them .
negative	sorry no stock can '_t tell you when we will have and someone will call you within 0_days - no joy beyond that .
negative	eventually told delivery would be mid november - 0_weeks after ordering .
negative	next_day item i had ordered was showing no stock on website , but noticed there was showing an identical item in another colour , colour not an issue with me so went into local_branch to try and change to other colour as i could get no where with phoning .
negative	branch rang where ever and were told definitely no delivery on original item until nov .
negative	branch then checked re other colour and identified would be 0 day delivery .
negative	tried to persuade us to just go for other colour but i insisted they call up and check actual stock - again no stock will be mid nov .
negative	manager of store then persuaded us to change to another brand - bush , these are owned by argos so we are never out of stock .
negative	it was an inferior product , but you don_'_t order 0 cookers because you want them them it is because you need them .
negative	so after being absolutely assured there was stock and we would receive them 0_days_later we placed a new order .
negative	should have had my call yesterday to confirm time_slot , didn_'_t happen so i called today and was told yes all in order delivery will be tomorrow 0 - 00 . 00 and will call you on route - great .... then within 00_mins get a call sorry have no stock can '_t make delivery tomorrow ..... someone will call you within 0_days to discuss when we might be able to deliver .
negative	insisted that wasn_'_t good enough but of course no way forward so now waiting for a call .
negative	how can they think a call back within 0_days relating to an item that should have been with me within 0_days is acceptable ??
negative	?
negative	other customers might like to know i was told by a member of staff argos operate like an airline they sell stock they don_'_t have and so then have to bump people - great - how often do they expect us to be bumped before we bump them ?
negative	re delivery --- this is the second time that i have been fobbed_off with the lame_excuse that items get lost / eventually turn_up so wait another 0_weeks .
negative	no other packets get lost nor take longer_than 0 week to arrive here ... i dont live in mongolia .... only southern_spain .
negative	we booked to stay in an apartment over 0 moths ago and the host has cancelled it a week before to rent it out for a better price .
negative	apartments are in high_demand due to their being a festival on .
negative	we have booked our transport tickets and now have nowhere to stay and are looking at paying over double what we could of payed at other_places , at the time of the booking .
negative	we were offered other apartments for double the price which we can '_t afford .
negative	we also now have to wait for the refund to come through .
negative	if you want a reliable service don_'_t use them .
negative	bad customer_services , useless don_'_t know what each other are doing !
negative	been sent goods that were obviously ' seconds '
negative	account often wrong and still now having problems with them trying to charge me money i don_'_t owe !!!
negative	all in all avoid very !
negative	awful tried to charge me over_£_00 for ' not paying on time ' when i had infact paid over a week early .
negative	awful customer service , rude and arrogant .
negative	goods terrible quality please_avoid .
negative	false_economy using studio !!
negative	!
negative	very bad service , this is our second order from greenland .
negative	unless you are 000_% confident any purchase will be hassle_free and you will not need follow - up or customer service , i would not use this company .
negative	we purchased an item which was faulty on receipt .
negative	ebuyer were notified immediately .
negative	we were asked to telephone as well as contact the manufacturer of the item ourselves !
negative	first off , we had no contract with the manufacturer - if a company supplies goods , they should be responsible when something_goes_wrong .
negative	they weren_'_t , instead preferring to pass the buck and employ delaying_tactics .
negative	we repeatedly requested a returns number - our requests were ignored .
negative	in any event , we returned the item pursuant to the distance_selling regulations ( something ebuyer need to read !)
negative	at our own_expense .
negative	ebuyer inspected the item and accepted this was faulty , however , they have chosen to give a refund for the cost of the item only , less postage & packaging charges we paid at purchase and with absolutely no mention of our return carriage which , as anyone knows , we are fully entitled to under distance_selling regulations when receiving a faulty item !
negative	this company thinks it can simply ignore legislation .
negative	i think trading_standards may not share their opinion .
negative	however , a buyer should not need to put themselves to this amount of time and effort .
negative	recommendation : avoid
negative	hi im very disappointed as a new customer i cannot redeem my voucher ive followed all instructions and gone into my voucher looke for the instruction to print its not there !
negative	went and clicked on link if im having trouble it wont work my voucher runs_out tomorrow what_happens to my money as i have no goods , this is not right i will now have to call the company who keep office hours only , ive ordered a book from amazon on the same day and its arrived already they are the best i will never ever use this site again i just want my flipping goods and then put this site in the junk_mail where it belongs amazon and ebay all the way .
negative	will be on the phone tomorrow .
negative	a very unhappy ex customer !!!!!!!!!!!

negative	the flowers never arrived although i was emailed to say that they had been left in a safe_place at the front of the building ( my friend did not go out the day they should have arrived ).
negative	i have not been able to find a telephone_number on the website to complain directly .
negative	i cannot recommend you to anyone for such lousy service .
negative	i was sent a text to say the delivery of flowers had been ' left ' in a secure_location ' even_though i had asked for them to be delivered personally .
negative	the lack of a helpline phone number was indescribably stressful , i had many texts and emails but not being_able to contact somebody for help was very difficult .
negative	the flowers have now arrived and the recipient is pleased , but i would never shop with this company again because of the lack of customer_care .
negative	ordered goods at the beginning of december .
negative	still not received by 00th_dec so cancelled order .
negative	they then said order ready to send .
negative	i told them i had cancelled it , they confirmed this in email on 00th_december and said refund would be in 0 to 00 days .
negative	00 february - still_waiting for refund .
negative	rang and emailed numerous_times - no reply to phone messages and emails keep saying refund is coming but it never does .
negative	all the lillies were in bud so no flowers .
negative	as these were for a funeral they should have been in bloom .
negative	looked like a small bunch of flowers of instead of the wreath pictured on website .
negative	hardly_any roses .
negative	very dissapointed and will not order again .
negative	bought 0 nations tickets as a gift when the tickets came they had someone_else '_s name and were half the value i paid !
negative	i phoned customer service number and just got a recorded_message_saying people can charge whatever price the want when selling tickets .
negative	i thought i was buying first hand tickets if i wanted to b ripped of i '_d have gone to ebay !
negative	where do i begin ?
negative	always check your receipts !
negative	on one of these shops , 0 / 0 of the products i ordered were unavailable , on other shops huge_amounts were unavailable .
negative	regular promotion mistakes - always in tesco '_s favour , never customers .
negative	overcharged something , 00_% of the time , i '_d say .
negative	deliveries made outside of a 0 hour time_slot 0 out of 0 times .
negative	one of these being over an_hour later than the end time of the slot with no call or notification .
negative	cheated on promotional points
negative	0 / 0 shops was short changed on points
negative	promotion invalidated because tesco couldn_'_t deliver goods advertised ( 0_weeks in a row )
negative	check your reciepts with care !!
negative	!
negative	i recently bought 0 season of friends and 0 season of lost on dvd from here - never again .
negative	in each boxset , there was one disc which was for a different season of the same show .
negative	one of my series 0 friends discs was actually for season 0 .
negative	0 times is not a coincidence - it makes me think that it is done on purpose .
negative	i would rather pay an extra few_pounds from a different shop , because at_least the discs will be correct .
negative	the dresses on their website are cheap imitations .
negative	the fabric is cheap and nasty .
negative	very dissappointed .
negative	don_'_t waste your money .
negative	when i had not received my parcel as expected i tracked it through parcel_force , it was described as holding at post_office as delivery had been attempted , as i hadn_'_t received a card from parcel_force i was rather confused as at the attempted delivery i had been at home .
negative	the parcel had been incorrectly addressed .
negative	dear_sir / madam ,
negative	my order had been confirmed and money taken out of my account in full . i was due my order between 0 - 0 pm on the 0th_may .
negative	by 0 . 00 i phoned customer_services to be told she would ring the driver ( whils i was on hold ) to which there was no answer from driver .
negative	she informed me she would keep trying the driver and get back too me ( which i heard_nothing back .!
negative	) as it got to 0pm i was worried , our shopping was not going to arrive . we are on benefits , and therfore have no spare money what so ever .
negative	i had no food it except bread and so had to sent my daughters 0 and 00 too bed with 0 slices of toast , in which i felt awful ( that was there tea ) . this was so upsetting , not having food which you have rightly paid for .
negative	its now 0pm so i ring back . com , to be told the driver had now gone home ( i was told it was stange as there was no accident or breakdown recorded ) which would have been easier to accept then just not bothering . he then apparently arrived back in store a little later with our shopping .
negative	i then asked to speak to a manager at which i was told he would give £_00 worth of e_- vouchers to take off this order we were due , as he had put the order through once again of his system between 0 - 00am the following_morning .
negative	i was told to go back through my orders on . com and to apply my e_- vouchers so the balance outstanding would therefore be £_00 . 00 .
negative	this i then did to no_avail as my bank_account was now empty as tesco . com had taken the money allready so thefore could not confirm order to reduce balance . as i stated i had no spare money !. i then phoned . com back ( which is also costing me .)
negative	to be told that because my account was now empty this wouldnt be possible .
negative	so now i am back too square0 .
negative	as i will never shop with . com again after this disaster , i did not want the e_- vouchers taking off my next shop , i wanted the money off the shop that was due !
negative	i was told the driver had said he knocked at our door and there was no answer , which is a lie as we firstly have a camera too prove he never came to the door and so do our neighbours .
negative	( which is 000_% proof this member off staff is a liar ) my daughter husband and mother was in the house all day with myself .
negative	we aggreed with sarah ( manager ) to go into store in blackpool as this is where our shopping is , to collect , and speak too mike norbury ( manager ). so i had too put my mother out to take us all the way down ther too sort it ( also costing in petrol !)
negative	we arrived at the store at 00pm , after taking daughter too doctors .
negative	we asked for mike norbury too which he came too see us .
negative	i had too explain the whole situation once again to mr mike norbury . he kept telling us to just take our shopping and use the e_- vouchers off our next shop as there was nothing else he could do .
negative	i had already told him we will never shop with them again so to refund me the money into bank , too which he said he couldnt do from store ?
negative	i said as a good will gesture we should be given the shopping for nothing as all the hassle k , kids going without tea , petrol money , phone_call and the sheer stress off the stress and frustration in which he smirked !!
negative	he said he made a phone_call too head_office and has refunded the shopping too our bank accound this he did by store after telling us this was not something he could do .
negative	this i was told will take 0 - 0_days too show in bank .
negative	( i just hope it arrives )...
negative	this was then fine i said and made my way to husband where he and a member off teso staff were putting in the back of my mums car .
negative	my husband then went too find my mum instore as she had got bored off sitting in car , as it was all taking ages ..
negative	he came_across mr mike norbury talking with another member off staff clearly slagging us off for having our shopping for nothing .
negative	he was going too approach mr mike norbury in store , but i adviced too come away and complain to head_office .
negative	i then got home to unpack my shopping to be disapointed once again these are the reasons_why ?.
negative	0 . coleslaw all over one of the bags ,
negative	0 .
negative	0 lettuces with yesterdays date on them , ( the date we orriginally ordered )
negative	0 . missing cheese ,
negative	0 . squashed bread ,
negative	0 . steak that had so much fat through it i feel it was only fit for my dog ,
negative	i am greatly disapointed and un neverd as to how this is possible from a massive store as yorselves .
negative	i want this sorting asap ...
negative	mr and mrs preston
negative	my review is for curries in yeovil , i ordered a product and paid for it on dec 00nd , there was no mention of the product not being sent to the store in time for xmas , after 0 attempts to collect it the last time on jan 0st and was told it still wasnt in i phoned the helpline , total_waste of time , all he kept saying was that it was in store waiting to be collected which it clearly wasnt , they wouldnt give me the store number so i had to keep going 00 miles just to see if it had arrived , i will never be using the store again and would highly_recomend using ao . com they were brilliant .....
negative	it took me ages to try to get the lense in my eye properly because it was so flimsy .
negative	it ended_up tearing rendering the lense useless .
negative	disgusted by the product .
negative	can '_t_believe_how customer_services are treating me , i was just told that the member of staff who startled me twice , offended and then humiliated publicly , is just like that and ( i '_m actually on hold to them now waiting for a manager ).
negative	i have made a serious complaint about a member of staff in the brixton store , 0 telephone_calls later ( strangely the line kept cutting off ) and 00_mins later ( and still counting ) i '_ve been told that jd_sports do not take complaints over the phone and that they have to be in writing for them to acknowledge it .
negative	i can '_t_believe jd_sports treat their customers like this .
negative	i '_m disgusted .
negative	i recently opened an account with next and was really disappointed .
negative	i ordered some cultery £_00 + ( inc delivery ) and they looked like i got the from poundland .
negative	the cheeeeeeapest plastic decor you could imagine on cheap plastic handles .
negative	i had to send them back asap and of course i had to pay for the return as well .
negative	now the only_thing that i '_ll order from them is flowers !!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered a camcorder and a freeview_box online , then had a littlewoods rep trying to convince me that i could pay next year for item .
negative	i explained that i hadn_'_t recieved the item yet and then the rep tells_me that not only did i get the camcorder 0_weeks_ago i signed for it !!!!
negative	as advised i checked the garden_shed whilst on the phone and found it soaking_wet ( was suppose to be signature needed and no card was left at my door ).
negative	i have since returned it as not confident that it would be working_properly in the near_future and i had missed the event it was ordered for .
negative	( when i asked the rep about the freeview_box she said it was out of stock ).
negative	i am far from happy with littlewoods way of handling this fraudulet event .
negative	i have complained twice and i recieved an_email_telling_me that the complaint has_been sent to the courier company but still i '_ve heard_nothing .
negative	how am i suppose to be confident purchasing items from littlewoods when they show such little care for the fraud committed and the faith of their loyal_customers .
negative	shocking !!!!!
negative	!
negative	flowers notthing like what i ordered , the colour very different ( dark ) looked like they should have been for a funeral and not a birthday .
negative	then to add more embarrassment the roses were past the fully opened stage .
negative	i '_ve never been so publicly embarrassed in all my life .
negative	also no telephone service so you can not call them , i sent a complaint via_email and received template email with a promise to contact me asap .
negative	but i '_ve heard_nothing .
negative	don_'_t use this company they have no care nor respect for their customers .
negative	**_update **
negative	0th_february_0000
negative	so iflorist said they would send my sister some flowers and guess_what ?
negative	it didn_'_t happen !!!
negative	this company is ridiculously unprofessional .
negative	i emailed iflorist reminding them that the flowers had to be delivered by 0 . 00pm .
negative	the reply stated that the driver would be contacted and then i '_d be emailed back .
negative	this did not happen either .
negative	the service is shockingly disgusting .
negative	i just want my money back and i have insisted on this from iflorist .
negative	let '_s see how long it is to take for this refund .
negative	once again in case you have forgotten my advice in the first complaint : do not use this company !!
negative	!
negative	this was a promotional offer via_amazon .
negative	when i opened the box the bouquet came in i knew something was wrong .
negative	the flowers sat far down in the box well below the top of the box .
negative	when i took the flowers out and put them in a vase they toppled out as the stems had been cut too short .
negative	i had to disassemble the bouquet to get the flowers into a vase and i found lots of substandard green_foliage that was cut even shorter_than the flowers so this would not have reached the water in a vase .
negative	i was very glad i had not sent these as a gift as i would have been embarrassed .
negative	i asked for a refund .
negative	i would not recommend this company .
negative	i placed an order with bulk_powders 0_weeks_ago to day ( 00 / 0 ) and despite chasing , i have still not received it .
negative	when i did send an_email , i was given the chance to cancel my order which i didin '_t want to do but in hindsight , probably that would have been best .
negative	very disappointed and still do not know when i can expect delivery .
negative	i ordered an i phone for my daughter on saturday_morning all went through .
negative	saturday_evening logged_onto the website to be told the order had been canceled ( strange ) so took my daughter into_town on sunday to buy her an iphone .
negative	received an_email monday_morning saying my order had been dispatched ( how when they had cancelled it ?!)
negative	called was told it was too late to stop delivery & to return the phone when i received it which i duly did on thursday .
negative	thursday received a call saying not to worry_about having to cancel the contract as the phone had not been delivered & was with royal_mail !
negative	am still_waiting for £ 000refund of the cost of the phone !
negative	we live_overseas and my mother in law has cancer - it is her_birthday today , 00th and in such a situation rather_than a gift i thought flowers would cheer_her !
negative	i put in the order well over a week_ago for flowers to be delivered today - we just called her to wish her a happy birthday and i asked her if she liked the flowers and she has not received them !
negative	!
negative	this is the first time i have used eflorist and will probably be the last !
negative	i ordered some flowers for my daughters graduation .
negative	they arrived during the early_afternoon .
negative	whilst we were at the ceromony .
negative	the delivery driver left them in the back garden on full sun .
negative	when we got back and we opened the box at first we were shocked by the small_amount and mainly made up cheap flowers .
negative	then we saw that they were very wilted and unattractive .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	bought our sofa the memphis online as i am disabled and don_'_t go out so went on all the dimensions online .
negative	the sofa was delivered 0_months later after we paid in full , and we rang the very next_day to say the recliner_chair on the left wobbles and sinks and is uncomfortable , they took 0 and a half weeks to send one upholsterer out then another 0_weeks for the next upholsterer who both say it was normal for this chair to be wobbly and sinking as it '_s due to the pins ??
negative	so all in all they refused to give me my money back despite me complaining well within the 00 days and made me out to be some sort of liar , and wont do anything further about this horrid uncomfortable sofa !
negative	what happened to the customer being king ???
negative	?
negative	on the website there was a delivery address and a billing_address , we changed the delivery address from our friends who we had sent a present to months_ago when they had a baby !
negative	however we do not intend to keep sending them presents for no reason , every few_months so i changed the delivery address to ours !
negative	... but guess_what - even after changing the delivery address and sending you an_email_saying that we still have not received the blanket , we have had no response or blanket yet !
negative	i have at last had a response to my emails , but still no blanket !
negative	i was told by the staff that they have done nothing wrong so they refuse to refund the delivery cost of £ 0 and i now have to travel a 00 mile_round_trip to pick_up the blanket from my friends house !!
negative	i should have just demanded my money back and forgot about the whole ordeal , but i did not want to inconvenience my friends !
negative	this is the second time i have used this company and i did not come_across any_issues on the first_instance , but there is obviously an issue on their website that does not allow repeat_customers to change the delivery address correctly !
negative	i will not be dealing_with these people again !
negative	ordered the ' purple blaze ' bouquet as a thank_you present .
negative	the flowers arrived and i was absolutely horrified at the state of them .
negative	the ' fresh ' flowers were already dying , there wasn_'_t one purple flower in sight , some of the flowers were still buds that hadn_'_t come out and there was a total of about 00 flowers in the bouquet .
negative	it was mortifying .
negative	do not order from this company .
negative	further to this , they then posted my phone number publically on twitter in an attempt to contact me .
negative	they offered me an upgraded bouquet ot be delivered the next_day but i just counldn '_t trust what would end up being delivered .
negative	i ordered my bath 0_weeks_ago , 0 bath was delivered into the local_store and they found it was faulty , the 0nd bath was delivered to my house 0_weeks_later and was damaged .
negative	my tub have been good at communicating but not with offering any confirmation as to when the new bath will be delivered .
negative	instead i was asked what i expected from buying such a cheap bath !
negative	i eventually rang the director steve marshall and he was very rude .
negative	he said it was common_practice to have these problems in his industry and that he could not guarantee a delivery time because the drive might have a heartache or crash so he would never give a gaurantee .
negative	i would strongly_suggest you ignore the cheap prices and pay £_00 more fomr a reputable_company .
negative	update_: to clarify following laurie '_s comments i have not yet had a refund as he stated .
negative	however they have not collected the goods yet ... not sure why he would say they have refunded me yet ...
negative	my iphone was coming with yodel .
negative	i stayed in all day waiting and when tracked online that night they stated they had been to deliver at 0pm and nobody answered so they left a card .
negative	i had no card and also have cctv on our apartments .... yet no one except for the postman that morning had attempted delivery .
negative	rang customer service and they rearranged delivery for the saturday_morning ... still no delivery .
negative	upon_calling customer_services couldn_'_t get through .
negative	finally got through monday_morning and kept getting passed through departments and drivers .
negative	got home from work on tuesday and the package had been dropped that morning with a neighbour - hardly safe for an iphone when they don_'_t know if we get on with our neighbours ...
negative	worst delivery experience i '_ve ever had !!
negative	!
negative	tracking_number was wrong on email so i have not been able to track my order so waited in on the day it worked out it should be delivered and surprise_surprise no order was delivered so the 0 / 0days for delivery was wrong too .
negative	not a happy girly , won_'_t use again and wouldn_'_t recommend to anyone .
negative	not only where the flowers delivered a day late they where also eventually delivered to the wrong_address , very disappointing service all_round and would have to consider very carefully before placing another order .
negative	i ordered a basket of flowers for my mother who went to donegal for the weekend at short_notice .
negative	i ordered around noon on friday and asked for delivery by saturday_afternoon .
negative	i have ordered flowers before for donegal from a different website with no_problems , and didn_'_t expect an issue .
negative	i was horrified to discover at approximately 0 . 00_pm on saturday_night that at 0 . 00_pm i was sent an_email to say they couldn_'_t deliver the mother '_s day basket until tuesday .
negative	what kind of service is that ?
negative	i had to telephone my mother and tell her that the florist had let_me down and she would not get her mother '_s day present until tuesday when she arrived home again .
negative	will not be using this website ever again .
negative	returned a £_000_+ shower_cubicle in january and am still_awaiting my refund to my credit_card .
negative	totally_unacceptable !
negative	they have now cost me an additional £_00 in credit_card fees as i believed that the balance would have disappeared with the refund !
negative	telephone_calls not returned when promised either .
negative	clearly a company with no regard for its reputation or its customers ?
negative	on 00th_november i placed an order with this company , then received an e_- mail the following_day , to say the items were out of stock , and asking if i wanted to wait_until they were in stock .
negative	as i needed the bulbs in a hurry , i replied that i would prefer to cancel the order and receive a refund .
negative	come 00th_november , i still had no refund , so used the website '_s live_chat option to query the situation ( i still have the transcript for this ), and was assured that the refund would be made immediately .
negative	yesterday , 00th_november , i still had no refund , so phoned the company to query the situation , and was again assured that an_immediate_refund would be made .
negative	as of today , 00th_november , i still have no refund .
negative	this is the worst service i have * ever * received from any online company in 00 years of internet ordering .
negative	the only_reason i have given one star is that there is no option for no stars .
negative	when you order something online you expect the picture you see to be what you get the bunch that was received looks nothing like it hardly_any flowers all scrunched_up
negative	i '_ve_used them twice , both_times tempted_by the good prices ... never again .
negative	both_times it took over ten days to get here , the second time it took two_weeks !
negative	the pathetic offer of free delivery really isn_'_t going to tempt me back .
negative	they '_ve got even less incentive to get my goods to me if i haven_'_t paid them to do it !
negative	you ' re sending this to " support "!
negative	do they exist ?
negative	i ordered a rattan maze set on 00st_march_0000 , together with a pod chair , on website delivery is 0 / 00 days .
negative	first i get a call to say it is delayed about 0 / 0 week .
negative	next when i email a few_weeks_later get one in return saying end of may .
negative	i then phone and told i will have it before the early may bank_holiday and they would call to confirm date .
negative	did they , of course not !.
negative	several more calls and promises of return calls ( but they don_'_t happen do they ) and i am given 00th_may_0000 as the day .
negative	the delivery arrives but no pod chair ( or cover for the other set ).
negative	i ring them , they will come_back straight_away , 0 hours_later , no call , ring again , will come_back , still_waiting .
negative	their strap - line " outstanding service " my recommendations , don_’_t bother with this firm or any of the other names they also trade under on the internet .
negative	ordered a sofa and dining_table online on may the 00th .
negative	selected a delivery date for 0nd of june ( just in time for the jubilee_celebrations ).
negative	my old furniture was removed on the 00th of may ready for the room to be decorated .
negative	my children were more than happy to sit on cushions for a week , i was not to sure .
negative	thursday the 00th of may i receive a call from argos saying my items were not in stock , and could not be delivered until sat .
negative	the 00th of june ( just in time for fathers_day ).
negative	friday the 00th of june i came home to half an_automated_message left on my answer phone from argos , i phoned the to find out what the message was all about .
negative	i was told my order will not be arriving the next_day , and they were not sure why .
negative	after_spending hours on the phone and countless pounds added to my phone bill , i finally spoke to a manager who one minute said that i had not revived my order this time due to a system error , then it was a stock error , than a system error oh and yes you '_ve guessed it a stock error again .
negative	after my blood_pressure had risen through the roof i was happy to wait the 00_hours while the system updated itself so that i could finally get some answers .
negative	not 0 hours_later i receive a call from argos to say that my order is in there warehouse , but there has_been a system error .
negative	the whole order will have to be re ordered from today the 00th of june .
negative	i '_m now wondering how long i will have to wait as it '_s been 00 days already .
negative	* argos p * ss poor delivery service update *
negative	since my last update argos have phoned me to say my items got lost in the system but are in stock .
negative	it has now been put through as another order .
negative	this morning a over bubbly wench called lynn a customer service manager phoned to say mrs strong your order can now be delivered to you on july the 0th ( that will be a total of 00 days since i placed the order ).
negative	before i swore at her i told her i '_m taking this further it '_s not good enough and i hung_up .
negative	i now actually do not have a delivery date .
negative	but there is no way i '_m waiting for 0_weeks ...... i '_m getting very angry !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered variety of diy products as have mobility_problems on line .
negative	, using next_day delivery .
negative	however three_days_later only two of the products arrived .
negative	i had to make a phone_call asking just when my order will be arriving as my son has taken time off work to do the decorating .
negative	was offered a refund which doesnt really help
negative	flowers arrived late at night , just left on the door_step even_though the house was occupied at the time and i did request them to be left with a neighbour in case no was home .
negative	some of the flowers were clearly dead as they had gone brown .
negative	there was no card left with them so my niece had no idea who had sent them .
negative	she eventually found this out after repeated e_mails to the company for this information and several standard replies which clearly indicates that her e_mails were not even read properly .
negative	all in all a very disappointing service from_start to finish .
negative	will never use this company again , nor will my niece or her friends after this .
negative	had these issues been resolved in an efficient and customer_focused manner , then they could have gained several new customers , sadly this company lacks the vision and correct business approach to appreciate this .
negative	thanks for the privilege of having my nice bmw vandalised and not giving a shit when i reported it to your control office .
negative	secure parking with no cctv - what a f ** ng joke and utter rip_off .
negative	thanks for nothing
negative	ordered flowers to be delivered on saturday , even paid_extra .
negative	flowers not delivered until tuesday and then they were left on the doorstep .
negative	i contacted them on saturday to double_check they had been delivered and they told me they had .
negative	so not also are you paying for something which you do not revived but they also lie to you .
negative	complained and got a full_refund .
negative	therefore will not use this service again .
negative	from a dissatisfied customer
negative	in the past i have had nothing but praised for this company but after my last purchased my estimations have gone down rapidly .
negative	called 00 june to say part of instructions missing and hardware incorrect contradict each other and parts were missing - was advised new ones would be in posted .
negative	also advised that it item was advertised as ' minimal_assembly ' but it is in fact flat_pack !
negative	.... for £_000 for the wardrobe this was a joke !
negative	vancouver single wardrobe with shelf ....
negative	missing instructions received but the hardware provided and the instructions still didn_'_t match - called to tell them only to be told that they would get someone adept to diy to call me ... how condescending .. like i '_m incapable and it me that '_s at fault not the instructions .
negative	i explained that no one could put it together with the poor instructions and wrong hardware ( talk about having to repeat myself as they didn_'_t listen ).
negative	then i was told i '_d receive a call back ...... 00_hours_later i '_m chasing them up again as you guessed it ... no call back received .. this is now going on for 0_weeks
negative	have just called again to be told that they dispute it '_s flat_pack and that i need to supply photographic proof !!
negative	.. they say it '_s got 0 pieces and that not flat_pack ??
negative	i say if it has 0 pieces that have to be put_together that that is hardly minimal_assembly .. it '_s flat_pack !
negative	.... we ' re going around in circles at this point !
negative	them i '_m told i can have a credit_note and will be deducted the cost of collection .... well by this point in losing the plot and tell them that '_s unacceptable i want full_refund and collection of mis sold product for free and i want to speak to the manager
negative	i '_m told they will pass it onto the manager but cannot make them call me back .?
negative	wtf ?
negative	?
negative	think you need to teach your customer service reps how to serve customers with genuine issues caused by poor advertising and poor products
negative	finally i get a call back saying that ' they think the product is represented incorrectly on the site '.
negative	hold up ... i said that and was basically called a liar !!
negative	... funny how now they think it was there idea now ?
negative	!
negative	anyway , i '_m now getting a full_refund and collected for free .. finally .... funny how things changed when you get angry !
negative	morale of the story is " don_'_t take the rubbish they come up with when they are at fault .. they '_ll have you believe it '_s you that '_s in the wrong and try to fob you off with a credit_note so they don_'_t loss the money .."
negative	won_'_t be recommending them again
negative	i used to use them every time but not any more .... so very disappointed with the after sales service levels
negative	ordered glasses .
negative	got email_saying frames sold out .
negative	got email_saying sorry this email is late .
negative	ordered another set .
negative	got email_saying this set will probably sell out but wait and see .
negative	got email asking for more money as new frames more_expensive .
negative	none of the previous offers now apply .
negative	got email_saying expect frames in 00 days .
negative	frames come quicker .
negative	frames are horrible and uncomfortable .
negative	they have a fluorescent pink accent to them which is not pictured on the site , and is not mentioned at any point in the description .
negative	rang to explain .
negative	lady helpful but just keeps saying " we ' re sorry you didnt like your frames " overall this is truely one of the worst online retail experiences ever .
negative	returned for full_refund and will never be back .
negative	terrible .
negative	i used this courier to collect and deliver a venitian blind i bought .
negative	the item has arrived damaged and bent in the middle .
negative	i have contacted the claims_department only to be told it could take 0 - 0_weeks to resolve my claim - seriously not happy and would not recommend .
negative	i ordered my dog meds on 00 / 00 /_0000 and still have received no delivery , explanation or contact regarding the order .
negative	they were quick enough to take my money though .
negative	ordered a present from them for my little_girl last christmas and am still_waiting they promised me it would be with me for christmas then just ignored emails and are impossible to reach by phone .
negative	awful company and would agree they are con men , even if it '_s the cheapest or you can '_t get what yolu want anywhere_else i would avoid them like the plague or put your money in the fire it '_s the same thing .
negative	only gave them a star because i couldn_'_t post unless i did believe me they don_'_t rate at all .
negative	i ordered a few items on a friday , then saw my physio again and the knee_brace i had ordered was incorrect , so e_- mailed to cancel it on the monday but was told my order had been dispatched , so would have to send it back - i didn_'_t remember getting the dispatched e_- mail , so the next_day , after checking , sent them another e_- mail telling them as such , asking when they sent the e_- mail and when i could expect my delivery .
negative	no response .
negative	on wednesday , i got a call apologising for the delay with my order , but they didn_'_t have any of the knee_braces in stock and so couldn_'_t send my order out - the very same ones i was trying to cancel .
negative	so i told them to cancel the brace ( as requested ), asked why i was told it had already been dispatched and was merely told it would be dispatched on wednesday and as i had requested 00 hour delivery , they would still send it 00 hour delivery - no sooner , even as they had messed_up !
negative	the next_morning i received an e_- mail saying my goods had been dispatched including the brace , so i phoned them , but they assured me the brace wasn_'_t included - and when the parcel arrived , it wasn_'_t !
negative	so , it took a week to get to me and my knees are in agony - i had ordered various things to help with my rehab as i '_ve got lots of events i need to prepare for and i '_m very upset with the way they dealt_with this , let_alone the poor communication .
negative	if i hadn_'_t used them previously , i wouldn_'_t use them again , but i know this isn_'_t their usual standard - just hope it doesn_'_t become their normal !
negative	bought my battery on the 00rd_jan , when i rang on the 00st i was told by a very rude girl that they had trouble with their courier and my battery was not dispatched until 00th .
negative	very rude_unhelpful staff , because of their problems i have had to pay over_£_00 in public_transport costs .
negative	avoid at all costs
negative	i paid_extra for two day shipping and it has_been almost two_weeks and i have yet to recieve my package .
negative	there was absolutely no answer when i called to ask about my package .
negative	there was also no response to my email .
negative	when i went to the website to cancel my order after waiting a week i found that there is no way to cancel the order online .
negative	seeing as i could not contact anyone from the company , i contacted my credit_card company to file a dispute .
negative	do not use this site !
negative	!
negative	they dont even deserve one star !!
negative	this company are ripping_people off !
negative	they have done this to many people judging_by the reviews .
negative	sadly , i did not read these before i sent my perfectly good iphone .
negative	they quoted me £_00 and offered me £_00 !
negative	they then sent me an_email knowing i was displeased with this and so offered me £_00 .
negative	frustratingly , they have credited my bank_account with £_00 !!!!!
negative	i asked for the phone back many_times but they are charging me ten_pounds .
negative	i am_currently in a dispute with them and am seeking further advice as they are clearly a bad company out to commit daylight_robbery !
negative	avoid at all costs !!!!!
negative	!
negative	can '_t give a review yet haven_'_t had order yet .
negative	i would rate them 0_stars .
negative	i ordered a flame failure device for my cannon gas_cooker main oven .
negative	i checked beforehand that the model_number was correct .
negative	.
negative	the part they sent me did not state it was for the grill and top oven .
negative	after returning it and waiting for my refund .
negative	i had to ring on two occassions .
negative	the second time the woman_who answered had a very bad telephone_manner .
negative	very offhanded .
negative	i then was put through to a manager at my request to ask why i was charged two lots of postage .£ 0 . 00 for delivery and returning the item .
negative	when it wasn_'_t my fault .
negative	?
negative	they didn_'_t state it was for the top oven and not the main one .
negative	as the gas_fitter travelled some considerable distance to fit the part neither him or myself were very pleased .
negative	i do not recommend this firm at all .
negative	no star_rating !!
negative	!
negative	purchased the nan arrangment that when delivered they were not left with staff they were dumped in the cemetery so they were not there to be viewed by our family .
negative	not reccomended !
negative	!
negative	0st order placed
negative	despite paying for next_day delivery
negative	package failed to arrive
negative	contacted them to get a general reply_stating
negative	" hopefully it will turn_up "
negative	it never !
negative	despite chasing them several_times it eventually turned_up , then they promised to refund the premium i paid for next_day delivery
negative	well i am still_waiting on this refund ,
negative	the actual products are great high_quality but really terrible service
negative	is this how we deal with customers in 0000 ?
negative	i ordered a mixer from groupon earlier in the month which duly_arrived and was good .
negative	a week_later i received an_email to say the mixer was being delivered .
negative	i quickly emailed back to say this was a mistake .
negative	however it seems to take this company several days to reply to emails and a courier tried to deliver a second mixer which i refused to accept .
negative	i then found that two payments of £_000 had been taken by groupon from my account .
negative	after numerous_emails from them stating that i need to provide ' proof of postage ' i am no nearer gaining my refund on their mistake !
negative	i shall never deal with groupon again and i will make_sure i tell as many people as possible about the unreliability of this company to add_insult to injury i now find that the said mixer is available , at robert_dyas , for £_00 less anyway !
negative	having used this company a few_times last_year , i expected to have the same quality of service when i ordered flowers to be delivered last saturday for an elderly_relative .
negative	how wrong was i !
negative	not only did the flowers arrive without the card , the delivery man never rang the bell and just left the flowers on the door_step , one week_later i '_m still_waiting for customer_services to respond to my emails regarding this .
negative	so disappointed with the poor quality service .
negative	usually thrilled with my purchases from cheapsmells . com but this order was dispached on the 00th_nov & i haven_'_t received it yet .
negative	too late now for my mums_birthday_present .
negative	now 00st nov & still not received it !!
negative	!
negative	00nd nov still not arrived !
negative	!
negative	i see from the reviews that i am not the only one to have this complaint about festive_lights .
negative	i ordered lights for my christmas_tree in good time according to the website .
negative	despite_being told they had been dispatched , they turned_up 0_weeks_later .
negative	the parcel had a dispatch date on it that did not match the email from festive_lights .
negative	ordered headphones paid_extra for next_day delivery three_days on still_waiting .
negative	they now say they have took the money but wont despatch the item as there is a discrepancy with my address .
negative	what a load of rubbish .
negative	cant find a number to call them .
negative	so they have took my money but wont send goods .
negative	please dont order from this company
negative	i still_haven_'_t received my purchase ... 0_weeks after_spending the money .
negative	i highly doubt i '_ll be using this company again .
negative	what a truly ridiculous time to have to wait for a pittance .
negative	would so not recommend to anyone !
negative	placed order in sat and by cob tuesday still_haven_'_t had confirmation that order has_been despatched have attempted to call all day with constant engaged_tone ...
negative	ordered from another co yesterday recd at nine this am with numerous updates .
negative	my son still doesn_'_t have confidence that his costume will arrive on time despite paying for express delivery
negative	like many others i was drawn into switching my gas and electric following comparing_prices on a comparison website .
negative	i so wish i never started on that journey with this supplier .
negative	it is a story of two_halves ... electricity switch smooth as silk no_problems ... my gas switch .... i am still_waiting ... following 0 separate calls into first_utility all with a wait time of over an_hour before being answered .
negative	i don_'_t receive any updates on progress i have to chase continually , all the information they have requested i have provided in a timely_manner even_though they have asked me 0 times what my gas_meter number is .
negative	i am totally_disgusted and shocked that a company can operate in this manner .
negative	to add_insult to the whole_experience they have continued to take money from my account of the amount that it would be if i have dual supply .
negative	ombudsman please investigate this company and make them accountable for misery they are causing innocent_people .
negative	i ordered a camera 00 days before i needed it for my holiday as it was meant to be 00_hours delivery .
negative	i had an_email the next_day to say the camera had been dispatched and giving me a tracking_number .
negative	the next_day i tried to track my camera ( being delivered by dhl ).
negative	dhl told me that they had received the data for the package but no package and told me to talk to pixmania .
negative	this was a vicious circle , pixmania said they had sent it but dhl hadn_'_t received it .
negative	i asked pixmania to send me a replacement but they refused .
negative	i asked for a refund but they refused .
negative	i received the memory_card which i had ordered along with a vipix card which i did not order .
negative	this had been added to my invoice (£_00 . 00 ) and there was nowhere i could cancel it .
negative	i rang pixmania to ask them to cancel it but they said they couldn_'_t - the card would give me cheaper postage for the next year !
negative	!
negative	as i had paid by paypal , and 00 days had passed i logged a complaint with paypal .
negative	i eventually had all of my money refunded by paypal today , a month after my order .
negative	the camera never showed up and i did not receive any explanation from pixmania .
negative	i would never use them again and never recommend them to anyone !
negative	wrong product sent , no reply to emails .
negative	my accident was very recent .
negative	i felt they were more intrested in the money they could make .
negative	felt the man i spoke to just wanted to say his bit and get off the phone .
negative	did not feel i was listened to .
negative	very unhappy
negative	i ordered a necklace for my granddaughters bday .
negative	on the 0th_august and stil have not received it , this is the first and last time i shall be ordering from this company , as ive emailed them 0 times and all the say is they have no tracking , i feel totaly peeded off now waiting , i do beloive the necklaces comes from usa hence_why its either got lost or taking so long !
negative	but i they dont mention the fact its shipped from the usa !
negative	i have asked for refund but havent got that yet , so im very dissaponted with the service , they should be providing tracking for their items .
negative	not a good service i wont_be using again !
negative	glasses_direct might be cheaper_than specsavers ( its main_competitor ) but by the time you factor in having to send glasses to and fro because staff cannot read a prescription or whether glasses are for distance or reading it is probably cheaper to shop in specsavers where you have the advantage of being_able to try the specs on to see what they look like without having to do this by post .
negative	and how come glasses_direct advertises a review from someone_who received her glasses the day after ordering them , when most of us have to wait 0 to 00 days for theirs ?
negative	goods (£_00 . 00 total ) ordered 00 june 00 , confirmation received same day , chased 0 july with numerous attempted phone_calls in between and since .
negative	these people are cheats and worse , we are pensioners .
negative	this fraudulency needs lots of publicity to get these people out of business .
negative	deplorable .

negative	additionally , a friend told me justsearch verbally said over the phone that 00 - 00_% of their clients have been hit by google penguin update which is around 000 other_businesses / websites .
negative	we ordered some goods on the 00 th april a . m having established online that they were available .
negative	we received confirmation of our order later that day and therefore expected to take delivery within their 0 - 0_days standard timeline .
negative	on the 00 th we received an e_mail to day that they did not have enough stock . we cancelled .
negative	i rang the firm to request confirmation of cancellation by e_mail and asked how long it would take to refund ( t and c say take 00 days ) given the fact that the firm could not process our request and we had not taken delivery of any goods .
negative	i was told that someone would get back to me asap .
negative	i am still_waiting .
negative	have since gone with an_alternative provider which has_been excellent .
negative	if you want to buy a buggy that '_s not fit for purpose then be my guest my daughter is only 0_months and my buggy is currently back with them for the third time having collapsed with my daughter in it and i repeat for the third time !
negative	i love my quinny_buzz well actually i used to love it now all i risk is harming my child every time i put her in it no refund offered no brand_new replacement only told there is nothing wrong with it .
negative	why i would send my buggy off three_times for apparently nothing is beyond me !
negative	my advice to anyone who considers using this company is to look elsewhere .
negative	i orderd a bouquet as a wedding gift for a colleague .
negative	the vase was smashed on arrival .
negative	they did refund me for that .
negative	however , the bouquet on arrival looked tired , lack lustre and had flowers staring to wilt .
negative	they were actually going brown at the edges .
negative	i attempted to phone numerous_times .
negative	no luck .
negative	i left email after email .
negative	they insulting offered me a £ 0 . 00 refund stating that in their opinion the rest of the bouquet was to an acceptable standard .
negative	trust me it was not .
negative	i doubt very much whether they would have said the same had they spent their hard_earned_cash on a sub_standard product .
negative	i even asked if the persoan i finally spoke to would have accepted the bouquet herself .
negative	she paused for a legth of time and said yes , after taking out the damaged flower .
negative	do you believe that comment ?
negative	i don_'_t .
negative	i feel reluctant to give them 0_star but you have to click something .
negative	ignore their 000_% customer_satisfaction_guarantee .
negative	they will take your money and if you have any issue then they will not assist .
negative	i will not give up in my efforts to have my costs refunded , as any honourable company would surely do .
negative	the whole_experience has left me out of pocket , upset and with a very very low opinion of this selfish company .
negative	again my advice to anyone is to shop elsewhere .
negative	forget all you read on the website .
negative	if anyone orders a bouquet , they order a complete article and if any part of it is damged then the company should be culpable for it .
negative	be honest serenata and own up to your mistakes and make this right .
negative	didn_'_t arrive when they said they did many emails to customer_services who were helpful to a point but didn_'_t really care , the flowers were very small and turned_up in a smashed up box so half of the flowers were snapped will not be using this company again
negative	havent needed the insurance yet as i have only bought it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	cant star .
negative	see above .
negative	i ordered persil advance on 00th_april .
negative	expected delivery was by 00th_april .
negative	on 00th_april i received an_email_stating that my order status was ' awaiting fulfilment ' ( this basically means payment has_been accepted ), but no delivery .
negative	i tried to ring on friday 0rd may , when it still hadn_'_t arrived , but unfortunately phoned at 0 , not realising that this is closing time .
negative	not open again until after the bank_holiday , so i sent a ' where is my order ?'
negative	query .
negative	on 0th_may received a ' do not respond ' email , saying my order was delayed ( i had worked that out by now !!)
negative	on tuesday 0th_may i phoned at 0 . 00_pm ( not able to phone before , as i was working ).
negative	my call was answered probably within approx 0 mins , i spoke to a very polite man , who told me he was going to put me on hold whilst he investigated my order ....... at 0 . 00pm i finally got fed_up listening to the music and hung_up , by which time they had closed for the day , so i wasn_'_t able to call back .
negative	as soon as i am able to contact them , i will be cancelling my order , and definitely won_'_t be ordering from them again .
negative	the previous company i ordered this product through , used to state 0 - 0 day delivery slot , but it always arrived the very next_day .
negative	unfortunately , they are no_longer in business .
negative	update_: phoned wed 0 may to chase .
negative	was told order was marked ' item allocated ' ( on it '_s way ).
negative	i asked to cancel anyway , but this wasn_'_t possible .
negative	only option was to refuse delivery .
negative	as other reviews showed huge problems getting a refund , i decided to keep it , if / when it arrived .
negative	friday 00th_may - whey hey i finally have taken delivery of my order ( over 0_weeks after ordering !)
negative	on opening the box , i now have washing_powder all over my hallway floor , as the box wasn_'_t sealed_properly ..... was i surprised , of course not !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	great fabulous
negative	glasses received quickly but they are mis shapen and as i need them not really practical to return .
negative	its ended_up costing me more to get them fixed .
negative	having ordered items from the online website , i was informed that the items ( being ordered on the friday with extra_charge for on time delivery ) would be delivered on the tuesday .
negative	the items still had not been received by 0 . 00 tuesday , so to confirm the delivery was still going to be delivered on time i rang up customer_services , were i was informed that the delivery would still be delivered that day .
negative	it got to 00 : 00 and the items had still not been delivered i then rang up customer_services again were i was informed that the delivery would not be arriving that day as fedex had an issue with staff driving over their legal hours , having a next_day delivery would have been out of the question as i needed the items for wednesday .
negative	i had to then try and find the harlow fedex before they closed to try and get the items i ordered , luckily i managed to obtain the items , but once i opened the items to check their condition one of the frames were bent at the bottom .
negative	i '_ve never complained about an online order before but this level of customer service was not acceptable and caused much stress and wasted a lot of time .
negative	i '_m disappointed to say i would not recommend this company to anyone and i '_m reluctant to ever use it again .
negative	awful !
negative	i booked a courier and arranged to work from home on the arranged day ( s ) so i could be in .
negative	0st attempt - courier didn_'_t turn_up
negative	0nd attempt - courier came but outside the time window arranged so wasn_'_t able to make the pickup
negative	0rd_attempt - courier claimed to come , knock on the door and ring the doorbell .
negative	however i have a coded gate at the end of my street and was in all day and recieved no calling_card
negative	the communication_throughout , whilst prompt , was awful and i never recieved an_apology or an explanation .
negative	just an_automated_response requesting my order number and another time / date to rearrange the courier for .
negative	i requested , and got , a refund and booked with myhermes . com who were excellent and cheaper and came the day after to pick it up no problem .
negative	avoid interparcel at all costs !!
negative	!
negative	the website is impossible the phone line not much_better .
negative	my milk order has_been incorrect several_times and often no milk at all and then i '_ve been charged for it .
negative	this means another call and somtimes i just can '_t be bothered .
negative	am going to stop the service the next time they get it wrong .
negative	on checking my receipt after doing my weekly_shop at my local tesco store i discovered i had been charged for 00 bags of salad instead of 0 and had been overcharged £_00 pounds .
negative	a manager was called and went to speak to the checkout assistant and returned and apologised and said she would refund the amount and give me the bag of salad free . i asked about their double the difference policy when the store was at fault and was told that it was to high an amount and that she could offer me a £_00 goodwiil gift card if i would be happy with this .
negative	at this point another employee arrived and i said i wasn t really as they had an overpricing policy to which they became quite confrontational and said i could take it further if i wanted but it would be looked at as fraud and it would seems as if i was in collusions ( their exact wording ) with the checkout girl .
negative	as this was taking place at the busy cigarette kiosk on a thursday_night i was absolutely mortified at being accussed of being a criminal at a store i '_ve shopped in for the last 00 years and as they had made it clear that the young checkout operator would get the blame i got my refund and a £_00 goodwill card . after thinking_about it all weekend i phoned the main company number to inform them of my treatment .
negative	this was a complete_waste of time the young_man i spoke to did not even ask my name or clubcard number and said he would get in touch with the store about their customer service but then tried to hang up without taking the store name . i would like to add i was not angry about being overcharged as mistakes_happen and it was rectified , i am angry about the way i was spoken to by the 0 employees called to deal with the problem . needless to say after 00 years of loyalty to the store i will be buying my weekly_shop elsewhere in the future .
negative	i puchased a large flexi lead tape style after_searching extesively online and finding pet_supermarket the cheapest and with a free delivery offer . when the item arrived it was the cord style which was unsuitable .
negative	i went back on the website and checked the item which was definitely pictured as the tape type and described as tape / cord which i took to mean either or and as the tape was pictured thought this was what i was ordering .
negative	i phoned customer service and was informed that the pictures were for illusration purposes and were not of the actual item ( you have to ask why_bother then ?)
negative	and that i could return it but would have to pay postage as it was my mistake !
negative	i checked back on the website to see if they made any mention of illustations being inaccurate but could find none and also found that the description of the item had been changed to read tape and cord . i have now returned the lead which cost me £ 0 . 00 with nothing to show for it .
negative	needless to say i will not be shopping with pet_supermarket again when a simple apology and free_returns_label from customer service would have avoided any problem .
negative	deliverary of flowers good .
negative	but extremely disappointed as not many flowers for the cost .
negative	wouldn_'_t use company again .
negative	flowers were for a friend who '_s been amazing so feel let_down at lack of flowers .
negative	the support and system is really crap , they limit legal businesses as well and should avoid at all costs
negative	we are waiting for stereophonic tickets for the assembly rooms derby this monday_00rd .
negative	so far no tickets , can '_t get to talk to anyone via the ' contact us ' 0000 as all automated , sent a mail and had an auto response .

negative	i too placed an order in october and was given week 00 to expect delivery , unlike previous reviewers infurn have not been in touch with me , or answered any emails .
negative	i also just get the engaged_tone when trying to ring ... what do we do now ?
negative	judith
negative	blackpool
negative	i ordered a parcel and sighed when i got the email_saying it had been dispatched with yodel .... knowing full well how awful they are !
negative	this time i waiting in all day on the day the tracking_information said it was out for delivery - nothing .
negative	contacted the seller again this morning to complain ( as complaints to yodel are usually ignored / responded to with ' we don_'_t know ) and i was assured that the parcel was out for delivery again today and that i would get it today .
negative	around lunchtime i rechecked the tracking_information .
negative	the parcel was apparently delivered to me last night at 00pm ( even_though yodel only deliver until_0pm ) and i had apparently signed for it !
negative	even_though i was fast asleep in bed by this time .
negative	i can only_assume that yodel forged my signature ( so they ' re fraudulent as well as unreliable ) and stole the parcel for themselves ....... absolutely useless !
negative	i was given a hour hour delivery slot - great - i thought !
negative	half an_hour after that delivery slot ended i rechecked the tracking_information to find that they had apparently attempted delivery but no one was home !
negative	i had been home all day !
negative	after_trawling_through their awful automated menus on the customer service line , i finally found the local_depot number on a forum website ( it '_s not listed on dpd website ) and managed to speak to a human_being .
negative	the man at the depot contacted the driver who said he attempted delivery and was here for 00_minutes and left a calling_card - ( i have a locked mailbox and it wasnt there !)
negative	so i can only_assume they just couldn_'_t be bothered to deliver ..... i '_m wasting another day waiting in tomorrow for the ' redelivery ( i . e .
negative	first_attempt in my view ) so we shall see ....
negative	what did i order from ' my memory '??
negative	?
negative	do not purchase from this company .
negative	i bought an electric naile file up000 from this co .
negative	i paid a further £_00 customs and excise .
negative	the item did not have a british plug on it .
negative	i then had to pay for an_adapter plug which converted the electric for use in this country costing a further £_00 .
negative	item was faulty and cost £_00 to return .
negative	they eventually said they received it after telling_me i had posted it to the wrong_address until i emailed them the copy of the address they had told me to send it to .
negative	they then said it was faulty due to my mis use .. ie the hand piece was full of white powder .
negative	the item was faulty from the start and also its function is to file nail products .
negative	the company have not responded and have kept this item .
negative	stick to purchasing from the uk as it works out much_cheaper whilst i am out of pocket and having to look into getting my money back from these_cowboys .
negative	i have used apharooms twice once last_year in marrakech and this year in spain .
negative	i am disabled and require disabled access shower facilities .
negative	i
negative	i had booked hotels where alpharooms stated the hotels as having rooms with facilities for the disabled .
negative	in marrakech the hotel kenzi farah did not have rooms with bathroom facilities for the disabled .
negative	in spain the hotel sorra daurada gave_us a room with no disabled facilities but they changed us to a room with a shower only when i compl
negative	ained .
negative	why have a part on the booking form for requests when there is no chance of getting what you request .
negative	also i would like to say that in my opinion alpharoom clients are given the inferior accomodation that hotels would not offer to guests paying the full price .
negative	it was all straightforward until they emailed me and said they '_d found a fault with my phone .
negative	it worked_perfectly well and i only wanted to sell it as i '_d upgraded and need some extra_cash to put towards my holiday .
negative	i now don_'_t have the box as i didn_'_t need to send it with the phone .
negative	so i '_ll get less selling_privately .
negative	not at all happy .
negative	will be using mazuma next time ...
negative	also received an_email after i '_d sent the phone saying they hadn_'_t received it ( rude , give me a chance i work full time )
negative	not impressed !
negative	always use gjw_titmuss for ordering our dog_food , never been a problem on line swift easy to use .
negative	efficient delivery .
negative	this evening , tried and tried , after 00_minutes have given up - very disappointed customer ( maybe soon to be ex - customer )
negative	bought wowcher deal , money came out twice and didnt receive voucher , although i contacted them before deal expired by the time it was established my card payment was authourised the deal was finished so here i am , no voucher for uk break and £_000 out of my credit_card .
negative	this was the first dealings i had with the company and will_definately be my last .
negative	very unapologetic e_- mail saying that the money would be refunded !
negative	aboslut grausam , schlechter service von a - z .
negative	nie wieder werde ih mit dieser firma irgendetwas zu tun haben .
negative	hben abgebuht , ohne eine bestätigung zu shicken und mir dann erzählt , wenn ich storniere , werden noch gebühren aabgezogen zur stornierung .
negative	komplett schlecht .
negative	ich weiß eigentlich immernoch nicht was bei dem ganzen emaail ping_pong mit den komplett inkompetenten servicemitarbeitern raausgekommen ist .
negative	der mann konnte nicht mal in einem satz antworten !
negative	bitte niemals drauf reinfallen , egal wie günstig das angebot klingt .
negative	der stress ist es nicht wert .
negative	terrible service .
negative	they simply didn_'_t deliver the flowers and blamed their courier .
negative	i wish i had read the reviews before using them .
negative	disappointed as these are for a friend who has just lost her dad very suddenley we have sent the flowers from all her work_colleagues .
negative	again we tried to order an item from escapade and paid the extra postage .
negative	again this item did not arrive in time for the event ( date specified on order placement )
negative	i will never or from this company again and never recommend anyone i know to order either .
negative	as an adult to be let_down is had but try explaining that to a 00 year_old again .
negative	paid for an early morning delivery of an item .
negative	been sat in all day waiting and still no delivery at 0 . 00pm .
negative	i have been calling the company all day , and ran up a rather big mobile bill in the process as i was just left on hold , with no sign of anybody answering .
negative	i have emailed them several_times , and no response to the emails either .
negative	the website has a tracking_facility which at present is telling_me that my item hasn_'_t left the depot yet , but is also saying that my delivery was signed for at 0am this morning .
negative	the information supplied gives a surname of who signed for the parcel , but funnily_enough it is neither my surname , nor my partners , or actually any of my neighbours either .
negative	no card has_been left to say it was signed for by somebody_else .
negative	my delivery actually required me personally to sign for my delivery , and to show my photo id too , now since i have both my passport and driving_license , obviously whoever " signed " for my parcel couldn_'_t have showed my id .
negative	i am absolutely_disgusted by this company , and would seriously recommend that people steer_clear of them .
negative	if you order something online and know that this company will be the courier , i urge you do not place the order !
negative	!
negative	i am now out of pocket because of losing a days pay waiting around for them , i have run up a huge bill trying to get_hold of them , and i '_ve lost the item i should have received .
negative	extremely angry , and looking to further my complaint about them .
negative	i sent my iphone_0s to them yesterday .
negative	i went on to my account today to find they '_d knocke the price down by £_000 because the phone " tested faulty ".
negative	there is a tiny cosmetic mark on the front and when i rang customer_services i was told that this classes the phone as faulty .
negative	the advisor told me that they sell the phone on so they can '_t accept cosmetic damages !
negative	i '_m absolutely_disgusted that because of a tiny little mark they won_'_t pay the price that the phone is worth !
negative	the fact is , it costs £_00 to make the repair to fix the cosmetic_damage so they ' re expecting to make a huge profit out of taking_advantage of my " naivety ".
negative	well i '_m not giving them that satisfaction .
negative	i '_ve requested the phone back and i will sell it on myself for what the phone is actually worth .
negative	rip_off merchants , avoid at all costs !!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered a white_rose gift set as white_roses were my wedding bouquet and for the last twenty_years i have sent my hubby one very year however when i used this company they sent red i was gutted !!!
negative	i did receive a refund but only after i adamantly refused a replacement he would of received four days after valentines_day , would not recommend or use again !!
negative	!
negative	wish i didn_'_t come_across serenata_flowers & used interflora instead .
negative	ordered flowers and cake to be delivered on my uncle '_s 00th_birthday .
negative	nothing arrived as was promised by texts sent about being delivered ..
negative	it '_s now daytwo , and still no delivery has_been made after sending numerous_emails to their customer service .
negative	it has now become a waiting game .
negative	disgraceful .
negative	you double charged for the flowers then they where not delivered to the person on the day and customer service was no help
negative	serenata do great flowers in great arrangements .
negative	they use another company to deliver .
negative	my last two orders were delivered late , the second one being for my mother on mother '_s day .
negative	customer_services were again less_than helpful .
negative	they snootily pointed_out that the small_print says they can '_t guarantee delivery on the specified day .
negative	what '_s the point of sending special_occasion flowers if there '_s a 00 / 00 chance they won_'_t arrive .
negative	what '_s the point of using serenata ?
negative	none at all .
negative	the flowers arrived on time but that is the only good thing about serenata_flowers .
negative	the box they came in was damaged , the flowers arrived with some damage and they didn_'_t look like the ones chosen on the website , they looked like something you can get in a petrol_station , cheap and nasty !
negative	customer service are very unhelpful , you cant speak to a human and have to email them .
negative	you never get the same person twice and they just tell you to wait and see if the flowers look better with time and offer no help to rectify the problem .
negative	if you want to buy nice flowers spend your money else where , total_waste of time and very disappointed !
negative	i wish i could review the product but i am still_awaiting delivery after 00 days .
negative	i made allowances as it was near christmas , but really it should have arrived by now .
negative	the order was placed on 00th_december_0000 , and supposedely dispatched on 00th .
negative	payment was made through paypal .
negative	can i have my perfume please !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	they initially offered me £_00 for my ipod .
negative	as my item apparently arrived to bozowi after their ' 00 day quote guarantee period ' they sent me a ridiculous revised_offer of £ 0 .
negative	i sent them an_email asking for my device back and told them i did not accept this revised_offer of £ 0 .
negative	i got no reply and my device was sent for recycling and my account was credited with £ 0 .
negative	i sent a second email querying this and managed to get a reply_stating that they were acting in_accordance to their t &_cs to send me such a ridiculous revised_offer , at no point did they acknowledge the fact i asked for my device back .
negative	after a few more emails of me asking for my device back they finally told me it had been recycled and i cannot get it back .
negative	after writing them a letter of complaint they offered me a settlement of and extra £_00 to be credited to my account .
negative	this process took weeks and i was so fed_up with it i took the £_00 but was still very unhappy at their service .
negative	i would not use this service again simply for the fact that if your device arrives late they will send you a ridiculous revised quote .
negative	theres no beginning to their talents - just years of endless errors - even sold my data - was fine when it was abbey - have now moved to another bank - poorly_trained_staff , even they themselves finally admitted they had expanded too quickly have messed_up big time - and its in every possible ... they even get a rare red_flag - avoid !
negative	warning in which magazine - at_least its their corporate colour ...
negative	bought lava lamp - told at till v clearly - its ok to try it at home and no_probs to get a refund if i didnt like it - took it back 0_days_later after plugging it in just once - v rudely refused refund because " tried it " [ which_meant i had " used it " ] - omg !!!
negative	!
negative	wonderful on initial sign up of contract very helpful .
negative	absolutely_shocking service thereafter !
negative	regularly cut_off mid sentence after a massive amount of waiting time to speak to an operator who usually passes you through to several other depts so make_sure you '_ve got lots of free time to speak to anyone at talk_talk !
negative	don_'_t expect to speak to a manager or anyone in authority it won_'_t happen !
negative	definitely don_'_t forget to pay your bill on time or they will cut your service off for a full 00hrs after you '_ve paid it !
negative	english_speaking operators would be nice as its very hard to understand what '_s being said !
negative	i was with talk_talk for over 0yrs for broadband / homeline / mobile and never notified i was clearly on the wrong plan for usage consequently paying over the odds !
negative	have switched provider altogether and much happier with my wonderful services and plan .
negative	these are not worth the money .
negative	first of all my printer would not accept them as they were not genuine , then when i got them to work the black_ink is pale silver / grey
negative	they " ve sent me distance not readers , durgh
negative	i ordered flowers for my mothers_00th_birthday in australia .
negative	the picture looked lovely and i scaled up an extra £_00 for extra flowers rounding up to an arrangement for £_00 . 00 which included £ 0 . 00 delivery in australia .
negative	the flowers my mother received were definitely not worth the money i paid so i complained to iflorist who opened a ticket and advised they would check with the australian end for an explanation .
negative	a couple of weeks went by with no word back from iflorist so having got the phone number of the australian florist , i called them directly to find out their side of the story .
negative	they advised me they had not heard a word from iflorist and that the order they received was for $_00 aud which at the time and exchange_rate would have been £_00 ... meaning iflorist kept £_00 for themselves ... yes .. as good as half the amount i paid .
negative	i think this is disgusting and dishonest !!
negative	the australian florist advised out of the $_00 they received , they had to take out $_00 delivery , $ 0 for packaging , paper , ribbon etc and the 0 roses in the arrangement were $ 0 each plus a few carnations , 0 gerbras and a bit of greenery .
negative	the australian end are not at fault .
negative	it is greedy iflorist .
negative	they need to be exposed so that other consumers do not fall victim .
negative	i have sent iflorist a further 0 emails and tried_phoning but have had no response on any front .
negative	i am totally disappointed and will also report them to trading_standards as i feel its highway robbery !!
negative	buyers_beware !
negative	!
negative	rubbish , site keeps crashing , rubbish layout , hard to use .
negative	i quicker to get in your car spend 0 hours in the supermarket and come home than trying to order a weekly_shop on this site .
negative	i will not use again until the site is improved .
negative	bad layout , bad company , bad seller , bad products , i will never use ebay again as long as i live .
negative	when receiving my bath suite the courier was going to leave it in the middle of my drive but eventually pushed it into my garage after explaining i had cleared a space .
negative	i had ordered what the plumber had told me so left it for him to check when he was coming , when installing it we soon realised we had the wrong sink 0 holes instead of 0 , when i rang up they apologised and said they would send the correct one out but couldn_'_t send it out till the day after next as they '_d missed the courier however the plumber could not come_back then as they had another job so i '_m without a sink when i received the correct one the plastic bit that goes in the drainage hole was snapped and broken luckily i had another from the wrong sink to replace it , the following_day after_realising we had the wrong sink when the plumber was installing the shower_tray the waste was missing to save time he popped out to buy one but the cheapest was £_00 i rang customer service to tell them and by that time i was very frustrated i explained this was the second mistake and i was not happy they agreed to pass it on to the manager and the manager would ring me this was 0am in the morning it got to 0pm and still no phone_call so i rang them back and i was told i had been given a refund i asked how much and i was told £_00 !
negative	this was certainly not good enough for having the wrong sink and no waste_pipe and having to pay £_00 for another waste_pipe i was told that is how much they pay for there waste_pipe so they couldn_'_t give me anymore ... ok this is understandable but for all the messing_around and mistakes i would certainly expect more than £_00 i was told i had only paid £_00 . 00 for the shower_tray and was spoken to like i should be greatful for £_00 .
negative	i asked how i could make a complaint and basically was fobbed_off as that '_s the number i would ring to make a complaint or i can send an_email which is to them anyway so i did this i emailed and asked for a reply from the manager but i still didn_'_t get anywhere it took 0_days to get a reply from the manager and was told i should of checked my items and they had given me £_00 as a goodwill_gesture .
negative	disgusting customer_care and awful service i would not recommend buying from this company due to mistakes and bad service i am £_00 out of pocket and i am still without a sink i will never buy from them again as my custom was truly not appreciated and £_00 was a shocking goodwil gesture for mistakes and stress
negative	this item was delivered after two_days but delivery time had been stated as 0 / 0weeks , as i was moving home on july 0th i put my new address .
negative	therefore it was delivered when i didn_'_t actually own the house !
negative	it was left down the side of the house the package was open at one end and had cost £_000_+ i arranged for it to be recollected on july 0th but telephoned to change that to july 00th as i couldn_'_t access it in my garage .
negative	since then i '_ve had almost daily emails re collection an there have been 0 or0 ( i '_ve lost_count ) attempts to collect it from my house .
negative	the company i bought the item from have now given me a discount as good customer service .
negative	i won_'_t sadly order from them again as i wouldn_'_t want to ha a delivery or collection from your company .
negative	i '_ll go straight to the point .
negative	tesco is phenomenally dreadful when it comes to displaying goods on offer .
negative	the amount of times i '_ve had to go back to customer_services to return or exhange items because the notices are not displayed with the appropriate products .
negative	is this a strategy to catch out customers who do not check their receipts ?
negative	don_'_t expect customers to read little labels to determine whether a product is on a particular offer or not .
negative	shelves should be stocked appropriately and should not be mixed up with different offers .
negative	this is one reason_why sometimes i go off shopping at tesco for a long time .
negative	i never seem to have that problem in asda or sainsbury '_s .
negative	why can '_t tesco be a bit more organized .
negative	not very helpful indeed when the shop is busy .
negative	and don_'_t blame customers for putting other items on the shelves - perhaps they give up because they could not understand what is actually on an offer !
negative	and by the way , sometimes these offers are not really good deals - so it is quite misleading !
negative	purchased a yoga retreat back in october , booked to go in march .
negative	turned_up at the venue to find it locked up and closed .
negative	contacted groupon to be informed that the company had gone_bust the day before , mass email sent to all purchasers ( still to be received ) and telephone_call made to me ( an_absolute lie as no record of call being received or missed ).
negative	in fairness i did get the money credited back to my card however my friend and i wasted a day travelling to and from the venue ( so loss of earnings and petrol money ) and needed to find another activity to use with our holiday days .
negative	groupon could not help with this either so we had to find an_alternative which cost us lots more than our original trip .
negative	trying to get a response from customer service was impossible without having to shame them into it on facebook .
negative	would appear that if you post on their facebook_page you get shunted up the list of customers that need responding to .
negative	saying that , i sent a response to their e_- mail on 0 march and still not heard back .
negative	really can '_t see that i would buy from groupon again .
negative	i did buy something from wowcher recently and their customer service was excellent .
negative	problem_solved within 00_minutes of me raising it .
negative	groupon could do well to learn lessons from wowcher .
negative	disgusting service , unhelpful staff .
negative	not interested in resolving matters .
negative	this bunch of con men took my money and the parcel was not collected .
negative	no wonder they ask for a review as soon as you place your order .
negative	then on their faq '_s tell you that you can only claim your money back for non - collection if you pay for their interparcel premium service .
negative	i booked citylink '_s service as i trust them , not any more and i '_ll never use a courier service again .
negative	since sending my order number to this company i '_ve been offered a collection on monday , the day it was to be delivered for a surprise birthday_present containing a cake and home made chocolates .
negative	no_doubt this is their way of not refunding me as they have offered to collect it on the delivery day .
negative	that '_s why i booked it to be collected friday 00th and was promised a collection for then not monday the 00th .
negative	there is the time , planning and total_cost of this fiasco and i '_m entitled to a refund for a service that is not as advertised in other words a con .
negative	trustpilot may also want to get my name correct , it '_s julia .
negative	i wrote a negative_review on the ' service ' my family received from electricshop . com .
negative	it was effectively censored and removed from this site ( a brief summary : the incompetent electricshop delivery driver damaged one of our kitchen_units ; we reported this to electricshop but the company effectively accused us of lying and refused to take_responsibility - absolutely_shocking ' customer service ').
negative	not long after my review had been posted , i was contacted by a member of the trustpilot team who informed me that it was being removed due to lack of evidence .
negative	i had provided a genuine order number and even went to the trouble of sending trustpilot a photograph of the damage , but unsurprisingly , this seemingly deceptive site decided to side with their client electricshop , which , like many of the businesses that are featured here , pay a fee which gives them extra control over and approval on any reviews submitted .
negative	therefore negative_reviews are culled whilst any positive_feedback is naturally left alone ( chris hasby '_s review_below confirms this ).
negative	if you '_d like an idea as to how unethical , unreliable and untrustworthy this site is , a site which is ironically called trustpilot ( a classic example of orwellian doublespeak in practice ), simply compare the trustpilot ratings and reviews for electricshop with those on reputable , bona_fide independent_review sites like reviewcentre . com ; the former are whitewashed and glowing , the latter largely negative and scathing - which pretty_much reflects my personal experience .
negative	of course , it wouldn_'_t surprise me if the trustpilot team chooses to delete this review - as i have shown , this site doesn_'_t take too kindly to consumers upsetting its overseers .
negative	however , as a published journalist , i don_'_t take too kindly to being censored and am already contemplating a deeper investigation_into this company '_s seemingly dubious practices which could potentially be a complete pr disaster for the site .
negative	any further censorship of my valid views could in fact be a catalyst to my further delving .
negative	incidentally , i '_ve already discussed the matter with several journo contacts of mine , who are as equally concerned as i am about any accusations of bias and collusion .
negative	my advice : take every overall rating on this site with a pinch of salt .
negative	in fact , i really do suggest you look elsewhere and never navigate here again .
negative	and to the team at trustpilot , shame on you for working for a site that appears to mislead trusting members of the public in such a cynical , deceptive way .
negative	i '_ve_used 000 - reg for a decade now , have always been happy with them and always recommended them in the past .
negative	i '_ve seldom had any_problems with them and always felt i could trust them
negative	so why this 0_star_review of 000 - reg then ?
negative	i recently let a domain expire , no problem as i no_longer wanted it .
negative	out of curiosity i went to see if it was still renewable , saw it in my panel still , clicked link to see all my renewable domains ( including those recently expired ) but this one wasn_'_t there .
negative	i then had a look to see if it was available for registration to see 000 - reg were now listing it in their premium domain portfolio for over_£ 0 , 000 . 00
negative	all fair_enough , they effectively grabbed it and put it up for sale .
negative	the thing is though , this is a totally_useless domain which only the previous_owner could_possibly want .
negative	when your_own domain registrar which you have used for a decade starts squatting on their own clients domains it really is the pits .
negative	whoever it was at 000 - reg who came up with this policy needs to go on a course on how not to p *** off existing_customers .
negative	i wonder_if they make more money on squatting on domains like this as they lose from existing_customers moving elsewhere ?
negative	ordered some shoes for a special_occasion and paid_extra for next_day delivery .
negative	still have not received them 0weeks later yet told we ' re delivered .
negative	do not want them now as too late yet no refund offered as yet as looking into it !
negative	!
negative	waste of money - total let_down , ordered flowers , they weren_'_t delivered .
negative	never use this service .
negative	crapy service
negative	it was relatively easy to arrange flowers to be delivered in australia , but i was not very impressed with the flowers sent .
negative	these were arranged for my mothers_funeral , my family sent me pictures of them and i was very disappointed , only about 0 flowers in the bouquet and the lilies looked as if they would be dead by tomorrow .
negative	it cost me over_£_00 and was not value for money .
negative	i would not recommend eflorist .
negative	my husband and i have been appalled by the service we have received from usb_flash_drive .
negative	our usb_sticks were delivered to the wrong_address twice .
negative	despite me stressing to lucy spencer the correct delivery address repeatedly - and me receiving an invoice from her with the right delivery address on it , it still went to the wrong place .
negative	lucy was also impossible to get_hold of , rarely returned our calls - and i had to chase her in order to place an order !
negative	!
negative	the only_reason you have one star is that a lovely girl called rosie very kindly arranged to have our package redelivered in lucy '_s absence and was very friendly and helpful .
negative	unlike lucy who we do not wish to deal with again .
negative	* update to initial review *
negative	an update to the review i left last_week .
negative	after proving that the mistake was theirs and that they had taken money from my account , but also that they had tried to take the payment twice ( the 0nd one being flagged by my cc company as a fraudulent payment - which in effect it was ) they have finally ( after 0_days ) got back to me to tell me they have canceled the order twice ( even_though i only ordered once ) and that they have refunded my card for the full_amount ( therefore proving that payment was taken ).
negative	my balance hasn_'_t increased by the amount they took but until my new statement is printed i am unable to check exactly how much they repaid ( hopefully it is the full_amount or i will pass everything on to the relevant authorities ).
negative	they are still refusing to accept any responsibility for them trying to take more money from my account and as such i will never use or recommend to anyone .
negative	please be aware if you are considering making a purchase from this company .
negative	---------------
negative	where to start ?
negative	i '_m currently embroiled in a war of worlds with them over a mistake they have made .
negative	i placed an order totalling_£_000 . 00 ; the payment was authorised and i was sent an_email with the order number that stated payment had been recieved .
negative	this was at 00 . 00 on the morning of the 00st .
negative	later that evening i received another email from them to tell me that my payment had been declined , but this email had a totally different order number .
negative	a quick check of my credit_card balance showed that exactly £_000 . 00 had been issued and taken from my limit , so i contacted them asking for them to verify what had happened ( i know people are only human and mistakes are made ).
negative	0 emails later ( every time i telephoned i got cut_off ) i have just received a reply telling_me that my card was declined so they have cancelled my order .
negative	this then prompted me to telephone my card_issuer who told me they took payment ( that was authorised ) at 00 . 00 but that at 00 . 00 that same day they tried to take the same amount .
negative	believing this to be a fraud attempt ( due to it being the same amount ) my card_issuer did in fact decline this attempt ( and i am very glad they did or this company would now have 0 lots of money from me for the same order that they are saying i won_'_t receive because my card was declined ).
negative	i have now been back to this company ( again via_email so that i have everything in writing ) and have attached all their emails and my proof of payment from them back to them and am waiting to see where they will try to fob me off next as they are telling_me i spoke to one of their colleagues yesterday and everything was fine ( i have never spoken to anyone ) but that later in the day they informed the payment had failed .
negative	bikeinn cancelled my order - not at my request , tried to re - order using paypal was unable to , sent email explaining problems , still_awaiting reply a week_later !!!!!
negative	placing order with fashioneyewear . co . uk instead as they are much_better comunicators .
negative	i ordered a flight bag on 0st dec_0000 . paid for fast delivery .
negative	they took money immediately .
negative	i recieved a few emails apologising for delay .
negative	then nothing since end of dec .
negative	they have not replied to emails or phone_calls or answered my on - line chat attempts .
negative	interestingly though a friend got through on his pc ,, enquired_about said bag and online was assured of same week delivery .
negative	incredible .
negative	i called my bank , who are in the process of recovering my money , since proviation didnt refund .
negative	an appalling service .
negative	i will make a point of making_sure everyone_knows_how this fake company deals with honest customers .
negative	firstly , i have bought a few things from groupon which were all fine , until i had to call them about one of the merchants .
negative	i bought a voucher for some tickets to a murder_mystery event on a particular date .
negative	the instructions say you must confirm your booking with merchant a minimum of a week prior to the event , however it is impossible to reach the merchant as they never answer or return calls left on their machine and their email addresses don_'_t work .
negative	i reported this to groupon and they said it will take 00 working_days for them to investigate at which point i must call them back for the result as they will not call me .
negative	about a week_later i got an_email from groupon saying they need my email address and phone number to pass to the merchant which i provided ( obviously they already have this and could surely have asked for permission to share details when the complaint was raised ).
negative	i waited another 00 days or so and called their call_centre again and they said that it had been passed only 0 working_days ago to customer_care who would need another 00 working_days to investigate !
negative	i complained as this would take us beyond the date that the event was taking place , the agent i spoke to was unhelpful and a bit rude and said i either wait or have groupon_vouchers - i actually just wanted to go to the event so i said should i go or not as we don_'_t know if it is tracking place but the agent just said she could not advise and that the voucher did not expire for a few_months - how could this be when the event was in less_than 0_weeks ?
negative	i asked for a manager who was a lot more pleasant and said he understood and he would raise the issue again and explain that i need an answer in less_than 00 working_days as it is urgent , he also offered to credit me £_00 as a gesture .
negative	this entire conversation took over 00_minutes on the phone .
negative	the very next_day i received an_email from groupon saying as they haven_'_t heard from me they will be closing my enquiry !
negative	i could not believe it , i replied_saying i had spent over 00_minutes on the phone only yesterday and it was ridiculous as i was promised this would be dealt_with not closed , i requested someone call me to discuss it , but it has_been 0_days now and i have not heard_anything - even_though they advertise emails will be replied to within 00_hours .
negative	basically i '_ve been waiting almost a month and am no further forward , i don_'_t know if i should turn_up for the event or not .
negative	clearly groupon '_s processes are poorly organised and not customer friendly .
negative	it appears that if the merchant is good groupon is fine to buy from , but if you have a problem don_'_t expect groupon to help !
negative	the product looks good but itit took a long time to load the photos to make a calender - which i accept , but when i had made everything and went through to order it it got stuck on the ordering and the calender was lost so i had to start again .
negative	i went to the online_chat room and was helpfully told it would be lost .
negative	it would be helpful if there was a " save " mechanism so you don_'_t have to start from scratch .
negative	in all the experience took 0 hours .
negative	and now to top it off you have started free delivery to store again so i have needlessly spent on delivery .
negative	i wouldn_'_t have minded but you have also extended the half price calender offer to rub salt in the wound so i feel_cheated .
negative	cannot really judge this company yet as they cannot deliver until beginning of december , so i have to reserve judgement
negative	delivery booked for 0 . 00 to 0 . 00 yesterday .
negative	no delivery arrived and today we have an_email_saying we weren_'_t at home .
negative	funny that , because i could have sworn i worked from home all day just to receive the order .
negative	whose house did they go to , as it obviously isn_'_t mine , there '_s no card through the letterbox .
negative	top this all with a completely technology based customer_services so you can '_t speak to anyone .
negative	all_round rubbish experience .
negative	personal rating 0 / 00
negative	this time i received damaged goods and part missing , four_weeks_later still no parts received . not good
negative	i want my money back now
negative	i tried over 00_hours to delay my order as the recipient was away .
negative	none of the links worked that were supposed to change the order .
negative	when i finally got through to you i was told it was too late despite it being 0 hours_later when i got the message they had been sent .
negative	ween the recipient comes back in 0_days it will be to a bunch of dead flowers !!
negative	you need to consider providing better lines of communication !
negative	the new dentocare 000 brushes in the upright pack are not nearly as good as the ones which used to come in a flatter green pack .
negative	any chance of going back ?
negative	the new ones have a slightly_thicker end and bend much more easily .
negative	absolutely most useless delivery company i have ever come_across .
negative	should have delivered a parcel in january , claimed that they '_d turned_up on several_occasions according to their ' tracker ' but no one on site .
negative	absolute_rubbish as site is a business .
negative	parcel returned to supplier .
negative	supplier resent and paid next_day deliver .
negative	still no sign of it several weeks_later .
negative	today i receive an_email from a business located in half a mile_away from us , bearing no_resemblance to our business name , and different postcode to say our parcel was delivered to them in error 00 days ago !
negative	we were also expecting another parcel from a different supplier , which city_link again failed to deliver , although claim that their driver had delivered it and had it signed for .
negative	but lo and behold when we asked for a copy , they couldn_'_t provide as the driver had left their employment !
negative	what more can i add !
negative	i would not recommend serenta_flowers as i was disappointed with what arrived .
negative	i usually use inter_flora but tried this as there was a promotion but what arrived was very cheap looking and i don_'_t_believe it had a value of £_00 . 00 as i was lead to believe .
negative	i would be very happy if some compensation was offered to me .
negative	regards
negative	mrs nankeville
negative	ordered a lego set for my daughters_birthday , choose the next delivery date offered , failed to arrive rang couple of days_later as still not arrived was told it was on the van out for delivery so waited in again , no delivery !
negative	rang next_day to be told the same , no delivery , a week past the original delivery date i rang to be told again it was on the van told them i had heard that many_times and still hadn_'_t received it i asked for my delivery fee back as the service i had had received was diabolical to say the ieast i was told it would be refunded back to my card shame i had to ask really as it should have been offered after they failed so many_times to deliver only_reason i got was they ran_out of time , not good enough !
negative	needless to say i won_'_t be trusting argos online again
negative	i spent £_00 on a medium bunch of autumn flowers for my boyfriend and i have to say when i saw them , i was so embarrassed by them as they looked like a £ 0 bouquet from aldi and i was furious that i had paid such a lot if money for poor flowers .
negative	the picture was a false representation of what you receive .
negative	some flowers that appeared in the picture were not in the bouquet .
negative	such a waste of a lot of money .
negative	never will i order from this company again as i emailed them my feedback and i have had no response .
negative	i ordered 0 items for christmas_presents ; sjp nyc x0 , halle berry gift set , oo0 spray with gift .
negative	very happy with the halle berry as it was a gift for a work_colleague .
negative	the nyc '_s , i had to just give to my mum and sis because they were so small .
negative	not a good price .
negative	i am extremely disappointed in the fact that the oo0 bought for my step dad arrived with an elastic_band holding the spray to the gift .
negative	surely , you could find a better way to package this so it doesn_'_t look like i '_ve bought it off a market_stall ?
negative	i have now had to purchase a box just to make this look half decent .
negative	purchased a jacket in december from this website , a day or two later they email me and tell me i will not be receiving it as it is out of stock .
negative	i went back on to the website and noticed the jacket was still there only they had added an extra £_00 to the price .
negative	when i asked about it i was ignored .
negative	been trying to get my refund ever_since and on monday they told me my refund had been processed into my account , it is now friday an there is still no sign of it !
negative	every time i email customer_services i am ignored .
negative	worst website i have ever shopped from in my life the customer service is just disgusting , i advise everyone to avoid this website .
negative	ordered a blind from 000 on the 00th of april when it was finall delivered it was left with a neighbour yet no card was left .
negative	when i prepped my room to hang the blinds they were a massive 0cm out .
negative	really disappointed .
negative	sent an_email and as yet have had nothing back .
negative	not happy used another blind company who were far_superior wish i used them thus time round .
negative	two beautiful lamps and shades packed carefully and marked_fragile all over the box , arrived broken to pieces .
negative	the box had obviously been thrown or dropped from a height .
negative	no helpful support when reported just brisk dismissal .
negative	i would never use again .
negative	i recieved some flowers today , from my daughter in canada they were not suppose to be sent until the 0th but came today on the 0th for mothers_day , i dread to think what they would be like then , i feel for my daughter who has paid to have these delivered to me for mothers_day , you could buy a better bunch at supermarket i am discusted to think they could send such a bunch and charge my daughter a lot of money .
negative	and have no phone number to contact them , please do not waste your money ordering from this firm until they can prove who they really are
negative	mrs worden
negative	i requested a transfer of my pay as you go monthly_contract with an option of keeping my phone number ( basic request ).
negative	instead of this i received a new phone number and spent in total 0 - 0 hours chatting with the customer service and until now the new unwanted number is still active and guess_what i am still on pay as you go and completely frustrated .
negative	it seems that the company hires cheap customer service in india , but does not invest enough in their education .
negative	really really bad , i have dealt_with 0 people so far ( in last 0_days ) and no solution so far , only promises that all will work out for me .
negative	btw i requested this transfer on mar 0rd and here i am still fighting with the low level of their customer service
negative	larnaca airport cyprus - weeks car_hire october_0000 .
negative	they rip you off at booking stage where you have to purchase an expensive insurance £_00 just to cover the £_000 excess charge .
negative	tried to cancel as it said free cancellation but they want a £_00 administration charge to cancel .
negative	you then have to purchase a full_tank of fuel £_00 on arrival at airport .
negative	car is so shabby - paint peeling_off , dents - no washer fluid - driving at night home from airport dangerous couldn_'_t see out of front windshield .
negative	total for one weeks hire over_£_000 !
negative	ridiculous .
negative	was through europcar that the hire took place on behalf of holiday_autos .
negative	i ordered set of furniture , and when the delivery did not arrive , i called and i was told it had not left the depot .
negative	i then emailed to find out when it would arrive , and when it did it was a nightmare .
negative	the delivery men left it outside my home and i had to carry it all single_handed , one of the boxes was 00kgs .
negative	the box was completely torn and so carrying it was impossible because everything started to fall out .
negative	after some serious amounts of celotape i found two men who were willing to help me carry it inside !
negative	after having a conversation with several people i finally got to speak to someone_who stated they were from customer_services , she had no idea what to say to me .
negative	i emailed pictures of the state of the boxes via my phone and she couldn_'_t offer me anything more than ' oh i '_m sorry '.
negative	and a few_days after i assembled everything it started_falling to pieces .
negative	will never shop with them again even if they were giving things away !
negative	very cheap !
negative	i wanted to give you some compliments about how great the staff at isleworth branch are .
negative	i went in there to exchange a pair of trainers , which were a size too small .
negative	this was quite a few_months_ago now .
negative	i wanted to say that there was clearly a staff shortage that day and although this was the case the gentleman_who was at the exchanges till was excellent .
negative	i think he would have been a manager or supervisor but i cannot be sure .
negative	he was curteous and patient , running back and forth until i had the exact shoes i wanted that fit_perfectly .
negative	i even had some spare change from the return and i ended_up spending more money on other items , which we joked about .
negative	i just wanted you to know that this was a really good experience , and i really valued his patience and good manner even_though i could see he was busy and stressed .
negative	it is a stark contrast to the experience i had at your hounslow branch .
negative	i had originally bought the trainers at hounslow branch on a whim , and had not tried them on because i was in flip_flops !
negative	so , i took them home and and tried them on there on a carpeted area .
negative	when i realised that they were a size too small i took them immediately back for a bigger_size knowing you do not do refunds which is disappointing .
negative	i went to the till , they did not have the size so i asked for a credit_note or if another branch had them .
negative	the manager arrived at this point , chris i believe his name was .
negative	he started looking at them saying they were dirty , they had cat hair all over them , and that there is ' no way in hell ' he would have sold these to me like this and that he would not exchange them at all .
negative	i was horrified , as i had actually bought them back within 0 hours of purchasing them , and the ' dirt ' he was referring too was the glue on the bottoms of the soles which were peeling slightly .
negative	he went on to say ' take them home and clean them , bring them back tomorrow and i might consider returning them '.
negative	i stayed in the shop , got some tissues out and started cleaning the glue off the shoes , almost in tears because of how he stood there in front of a very full shop saying quite loudly that the shoes were dirty , take them home .
negative	he went on to say to the sales_assistant that no - one should serve me but him .
negative	i stood humiliated by the tills cleaning glue off the bottom , and he later returned and said after all the glue had been removed , i am not exchanging those .
negative	i spent an_hour there .
negative	this is why i went the next_day to isleworth branch , where i was met with more professional staff .
negative	they too checked the bottom of the shoes , and found no problem , this may well have been as i had already done the job of a shoe maker !
negative	about a year_ago i signed_up with this company after my mother died and i became my baby sisters carer .
negative	i bought the phone for her , and from the start there were issues .
negative	the bill was supposed to be capped at £_00 and each day it reached this limit .
negative	i was furious as one day i had the phone and it was completely switched off with the sim removed so there was no way it was used .
negative	i complained and max from the preston office spoke with me .
negative	this was while i was in the local phone shop , max was rude to the saleman and to me , telling us that it was the phone and not the network .
negative	the problem was not just that he didn_'_t want to give me the money back for the error but also that he was so very rude .
negative	i explained that i needed the phone to work so i could be in contact with my sister ( i explained she was 00 and that our mother had died ), and his response was ' well if you care about your sister so much why don_'_t you pay the bill then it wont_be blocked '.
negative	i cannot type my response , but i can_assure you that after a month i finally spoke with a manager and had the 0 year contract cancelled .
negative	i never did get my deposit back .
negative	after such a traumatic event the last thing i needed was a saleman to tell me i didn_'_t love my only remaining family_member .
negative	ordered tickets in februaruy to see pink in hannover on the 0th_may .
negative	received an_email in german on friday 00th_april and couldn_'_t get to speak to anyone untill the monday when i was told that this email was telling_me that the seller couldn_'_t supply the tickets and that they were offering me tickets for the o0 - she asked me if this was acceptable at which point i made her aware that the o0 concerts had indeed already happened !
negative	i was then assured that they would try to get me replacement tickets for hannover , apologised for the email being sent in germand and assured me it would be resent in english and took my mobile number so that they could contact me as soon as they found replacement tickets to change delivery to the hotel in hannover as they would not get to the uk in time .
negative	come the end of wednesday 0nd may , i realised that these tickets were not happening and so i cancelled our travel from aberdeen , uk ( myself , my husband and our 00 year_old_son ).
negative	then what happened - i got an_email on the thursday to say my tickets had been dispatched !
negative	no call , no way to change delivery and all travel and hotel already cancelled .
negative	on top of this , the tickets arrived - i had paid eu000 each and the face value was eu00 . 00 - double the price - disgusting !
negative	and of course , we all lost out completely so i am eu000 out of pocket ( including viagogo '_s admin_fee ).
negative	i would never use viagogo again
negative	and you will note that 0_weeks on , they haven_'_t responded to explain themselves !
negative	it '_s now 00th_may and i posted this on the 0th .
negative	ref_:_0000000
negative	awful .
negative	rooms and communal areas all look very much worse for wear , chipped , battered , scuffed and barely clean .
negative	staff reflect their surroundings and dont care either .
negative	ordered breakfast which was a joke , one day no bacon , one day no sausage or eggs .
negative	pay more elsewher and enjoy the experience .
negative	rude and unhelpful staff
negative	ordered with next_day delivery but a week on not arrived .
negative	no reply to email so rang them .
negative	some items out of stock so the whole order delayed !
negative	and it '_s not their policy to let you know - how helpful eh !
negative	disgusted , will be going back to my regular reliable internet supplier whose prices are the same or cheaper .
negative	very shocked at paying a total of £_000 for two tickets to michael_buble with a face value of £_00 each .
negative	lesson_learnt about buying from viagogo - will never do it again .
negative	ordered some test tubes which never arrived despite payment having been actioned email i sent querying delivery never received a reply .
negative	very bad service
negative	i ordered 00 x 000g foil trays as in previous_orders over the past 00 / 00 months the last delivery they sent 00 x 000 tins for the same price leaving me with 00_% less cat_food .
negative	i will now be getting my cat_food from a different supplier
negative	i ordered flowers 0_days before i wanted them delivered , they were a suprise for my sisters_birthday . not only didnt they turn_up but when they did they were half_dead and ended_up in the bin the next_day . absolutely no remorse from company so will never use them again .
negative	i ordered some goggles from here that said " in stock " online .
negative	i then emailed a week_later after_hearing_nothing else , only to be told that they were waiting to receive them from the supplier in another 0 - 00 days ( very vague ).
negative	so another week went by , so i emailed again .
negative	the same thing was said , so i asked to cancel ( as i am shortly leaving the country and don_'_t have time to wait around .
negative	i was then kindly suggested some alternatives ( none even remotely similar and two at_least £_000 below my price range ).
negative	i picked the goggles as they were a certain spec that i desired and the alternatives were none of these .
negative	when i said the word " cancel " they responded within the hour .
negative	so why , before this did it take a day or so more ?
negative	they also didn_'_t confirm my refund until i emailed them twice .
negative	they may aswell have chucked my money back at me .
negative	overall , i am totally appalled .
negative	what a shocking service !
negative	this review replaces the one i left on november 00th 0000 .
negative	after_placing around 0 orders with this company in the last few_months and getting service good enough to prompt me to leave a glowing review on this site , i am very disappointed at the terrible service i have just received on what will be my last order with them .
negative	i ordered 00 silver chains on nov 00th because i needed , guess_what , a whole 00 chains .
negative	not 00 - but 00 .
negative	on nov 00th , i received an_email_telling_me my order had been dispatched .
negative	by the following_tuesday , dec 0rd , they still hadn_'_t arrived .
negative	i called the manchester bead_shop only to be told they had not been in stock before and were in fact being sent that day .
negative	when i asked why they had sent me an_email on nov 00th saying they had been dispatched , the girl hedged around it .
negative	the chains arrived the next_day , dec 0th .
negative	they were all thrown in a plastic_bag , in a ball and knotted together .
negative	i had to spend precious time carefully separating them .
negative	to add_insult to injury , there were only 00 chains - not the 00 i had paid for .
negative	i immediately called the shop only to find they close at 0pm .
negative	i sent an e_mail on that day explaining the issues .
negative	i marked it high priority as i needed all the chains by saturday .
negative	by the middle of the next_morning , having heard_nothing , i called the shop .
negative	the girl put me on hold to enquire_about the two missing chains .
negative	she then came back and told me they were out of stock and could refund me .
negative	no apology for sending me 00 instead of 00 in the first place .
negative	she also blamed their supplier for the shortfall in the number of chains , thus telling_me they do not check orders before they go out .
negative	i told her this was not a good way to do_business and she said they had longer chains in stock and i asked her to send me two of those immediately .
negative	when they arrived - too late to prevent me from letting someone down , they were in an envelope with no note , no apology and one of the chains was spilling out of a slit in it '_s plastic_bag and was tangled .
negative	to date i have had no reply to the e_mail and no apology for such shoddy service .
negative	this has left me with no choice but to conclude that the manchester bead_shop does not value their customers or want to keep them .
negative	i have now found another outlet for my chains .
negative	the £_000 i have spent in the last few_months with the bead_shop may not be a fortune but it certainly will not be repeated after this performance .
negative	i searched the internet and read some of the reviews and thought they are a good company to go with to sell my ipad they quoted me a good price , then i sent it via_royal_mail special delivery costing_£_00 i then received an_email_saying it had been requoted when i checked it was for half the amount of the original_quote !!
negative	when i emailed them to question why they said there were scratches to screen and casing !!
negative	i know for sure that is lies because it has_been in a leather case since the day i bought it .
negative	i told them to return it then they said it would be returned in over two_weeks !!!
negative	why ??
negative	i sent numerous_emails and tried_ringing but to no_avail this went on for a few_days eventually i got an answer from someone i told them i wanted my ipad back immediately he tried to say it wouldn_'_t be returned yet but i kicked off told him it was my property and wanted it back he then turned around and said i would have it back by two_days time ..
negative	i got it the next_day .
negative	it was missing the lead to charge it too so i rang about that and they said i couldn_'_t get my lead back but he would send a standard one mine was an extra long pink lead !!!
negative	all in all it was a bad_experience they are scammers , liars and thieves !!!
negative	do not use them !
negative	!
negative	i ordered a gift with iflorist before christmas and paid_extra to have it delivered on christmas_eve .
negative	it is now 0th_january and i still have not received my order ( although the money was debited from my account immediately ).
negative	i have emailed the company several_times and have received no reply .
negative	they are unreachable by telephone .
negative	this is the worst service i have ever_encountered .
negative	they have had my product for over a week i had to call them to arrange for my product to be delivered as i had not been contacted after an_hour and half was agreed it will be delivered in the afternoon 0_days_later .
negative	received a message_saying delivery would be tomorrow between_0am - 0pm so called the office i was told its tough , the sales_assistant sonia could not care less and had the attitude of i will speak to my manager and call back if i have the time .
negative	this is a bed i had ordered that should have arrived on 00th i now have no bed to sleep on i suffer from a back problem where the lower part of my back is fractured , this company does not care at all
negative	my order was cancelled and debit went through on my account .
negative	i believe there are ways to get authorisation from banks as_opposed to cancelling orders a day after it was placed .
negative	amazon will never do this .
negative	i would not recommended ordering from this site !
negative	i waited 0_days for my order to then be told the items were out of stock and the site had no idea when items would become available .
negative	this website needs to advise customers if items are out of stock before items are placed !
negative	absolutely_disgusting !
negative	we are having huge problems with sky , their call_center are rude and do not bother even read the emails and reply with something irrelevant .
negative	our broadband and land - line have not been activated now 0_days past activation date !
negative	has_been over 00hrs we were told to wait to get a call back .
negative	no - one has called .
negative	i am fed_up and just want to cancel so i can go somewhere_else where i can receive the services we are paying for .
negative	my recent delivery did not turn_up , no phone_call from asda , nothing !
negative	we called their customer_services several_times , to be either fobbed_off , or lied to .
negative	we were told we would be called back , but no one called back .
negative	we called the next_day to cancel , however because of this my money is still being held .
negative	luckily i have the money to place an order elsewhere .
negative	so far it '_s been five days_later , and my money is wrongfully being held .
negative	asda may say the fault here lays with the bank , however if asda had delivered the shopping that i had paid for , we wouldn_'_t be in the situation .
negative	we have written a letter of complaint but are still_waiting for a response .
negative	after a non delivery you would think they would contact us , but i guess that '_s why they ' re cheap !
negative	0_days after_placing the order and i haven_'_t received my item , but i did receive an invitation to review my buying experience !
negative	ridiculously_expensive i don_'_t know how they justify their prices .
negative	greed greed greed and ripping customers off left right and centre .... we need competitive companies to do away with the 0st_class stamp !
negative	i '_ve been a scottish_power customer for 0 years and finally i '_ve had enough !
negative	( 0 years previous address ( great service ) ... 0 years current address ) current home was intitially british_gas which i thought i '_d switch back to scottish_power
negative	this last_year alone i noticed everytime i topped_up on my pre_- pay card they were taking money at the same time .
negative	£_00 they would take £ 0 and leave me with £_00 credit .
negative	i phoned them up asked what they were playing at that i was a pay & go customer ... they put the blame down to switching from british_gas ... that british_gas owe me the money .
negative	phone british_gas .... i didn_'_t owe any money and was never in debt to british_gas it was nothing to do with them it was scottish_power .
negative	phoned scottish_power they give me a pin to wipe it off .
negative	.... few_weeks_later debt on it again .
negative	this time same reason ... only 0_weeks electricity was unaccoutnable for when i switched .
negative	i explained i '_ve already paid for my eletcricity ... i '_m not paying for it twice .
negative	same thing again gave_me a pin wiped it off .
negative	this time they were taking £ 0 ... this went on 0 - 0 times ..... were they wiped it clean .
negative	then the final time 0th or 0th time i flipped and had enough ...
negative	i topped_up £_00 ...£ 0 . 00 off ... i checked my meter ... it showed as 00 . 00 in debt .
negative	bear in mind i hadn_'_t noticed them taking the £ 0 . 00 a week because it was a much smaller amount .
negative	i contacted scottish_power who asked me for my meter_reading ... i gave it them and the woman on the phone said you are not £_00 .
negative	in debt your are now £_00 in debt .
negative	i asked how can i be in debt i do not get £_00 worth free of electricity .. i pay for what i use i pay as you go .
negative	this time scottish_power were not for wiping the debt off ....
negative	i '_d had enough i contacted consumer_rights ombudsman to put an official_complaint in about how badly we were being treated ... to investigate sp because surely this is fraud tapping into to pay as you go customers meters and adding debt on their meters without us knowing .
negative	this had happened to us 0 times .
negative	i got a knock on my door same week having problems with sp from a new energy_supplier economy energy not on comparison_sites because they are guaranteed 00_% cheaper_than all the big 0 rip_offs !
negative	so i switched only last_week because i can '_t take this with scottish_power anymore .... this morning had a phone_call from sp on a sunday morning from a witheld number .... bearing in mind scottsh power are not open on a sunday said he was clearing the £_00 debt and he can see there was always a problem with the meter_reading ... that i shouldn_'_t have been in debt because i '_m pay as you go ....
negative	so what about all the money i have paid weekly in debt ???
negative	... i '_ve never been given that back ... all as i '_ve been given is the meter wiped .
negative	not any of the money i have paid on this so called debt !
negative	.... sp only acting now because i have took it up with the ombudsman .
negative	i '_m just one customer they have tried to rip_off ....... how many vulnerable customers are out there who don_'_t actually notice debt being added on their meters ???
negative	my advice is put your key in and scroll_through the options it will tell you if there is any debt and how much they are taking a week !!!!!!!!
negative	.....& take up with consumer complaints ombudsman who will act for free on your behalf !!!!!!!!!
negative	because this is theft of an energy_supplier who already get enough of us customers !
negative	every time i make a purchase with this company there is a problem !!!!!
negative	!
negative	they '_ve sent my items with holes covered up with security tags .... items suppposed to be new with tags turn_up with no tags !
negative	there is always an item out of stock ....
negative	and when you are really looking_forward to receiving something like a rare opulence ballerina dress they send you a shoddy side train dress not what i ordered and contacting them by telephone is terrible !!!!!!!!!!
negative	not only that they don_'_t send you a returns sticker ..... i have to pay my own returns cost and wait 00 days for a refund !!!!
negative	avoid if you don_'_t want to be disappointed because i '_m disappointed in every transaction i make
negative	cannot register on - line .
negative	been passed on from one to another for the last 0_days , on chat line and telephone .
negative	very bad customer_services .
negative	would not advise them to anybody .
negative	ordered same day delivery flowers for saturday and was only informed at 0 . 00pm that eflorist was unable to deliver .
negative	unacceptable as these were for a bereavement and earlier warning should have been given so alternative_arrangements could be made .
negative	i was offered a £ 0 upgrade which bearing in mind i '_d paid_extra for same day delivery made little difference and flowers would have arrived 0_days late
negative	wanted a refund on xmas_present as didn_'_t fit .
negative	took it to most local_store and was informed they couldn_'_t help , it needed to be returned by post .
negative	find it unbelievable in this day and age that you can '_t return unwanted_items to a store .
negative	will not be using the shop again for this reason .
negative	trust_pilot has requested me to authenticate my review of house trip 0 times .
negative	each time i have furnished proof of purchase to trust_pilot and each time it has ignored the evidence i have supplied .
negative	trust_pilot is clearly not an_independent organisation and appears to be paid to only accept positive_reviews of house trip .
negative	our review of house trip was not positive and it appears that trust_pilot does not want to publish our review because it is negative
negative	unable to give promotional_code when i chose hotel as no option
negative	for this rang help line - customers service person did not have a promotional_code as these were only available to customers online .
negative	will not be booking with you again
negative	ordered these chocolates through wowcher .
negative	they were a gift and thought what a fab price .
negative	had to order directly from site instead of through wowcher .
negative	chocs arrived but unfortunately were not to my taste - however , everyone has different tastes .
negative	was quite happy to leave it at that .
negative	however , today when i logged_into my bank it had been debited by £_00 . 00 from cocoa boutique .
negative	when i phoned to query this i was told i had signed_up for a monthly delivery ( which is totally_untrue ).
negative	i am_currently_awaiting a manager phoning me back as they refuse to refund my money and refuse to take back the chocolates ( which i still_haven_'_t received !).
negative	totally_disgusted and would strongly_recommend avoiding this company at all costs .
negative	this company has sent me many letters , threatening to take me to court for non payment of an estimated final_bill !
negative	i actually left them because i could never get through on the phone and my emails were always unanswered .
negative	my new provider and i have contacted them on 0 occasions with final readings and scottish_power ignore us - pushing forward with a ' system ' that generates threatening_letters stating i '_d have my credit_rating wrecked etc .
negative	in my 00 years i have never ever ever dealt_with a company that is i m p o s s i b l e to communicate with - deal with them at your_peril .
negative	g0s even read my meters 0_days after transfer ( i have the meter readers name , time of visit and readings on the day ) and still they over exaggerated readings .
negative	i look_forward to seeing them in court .
negative	in this day how can it take 0_weeks for something to be delivered after it has_been dispatched ?
negative	still_waiting .
negative	i have been with orange on a business contract paying for 0 phones for over 0 years_now , i have never been with anyone_else .
negative	i also pay around £_00 a month for these phones - a fair_amount of money over 0 years .
negative	when asked to upgrade , i always have had really cheap , crud phones as i dont_know much about them .
negative	however , when my daughter told me that if i got an iphone , i can get my emails , i asked orange for my upgrade to be an iphone .
negative	they offered me the old_iphone , 00bg and wanted to charge me £_000 ... i think that this is outrageous to treat loyal_customers like this , when my daughter went and got the brand_new iphone on her very low contract for practically nothing !
negative	!
negative	my phone line was supposed to be fixed on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	then they were to fix it on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	then it would be either friday ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) or monday ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ).
negative	now it is scheduled for 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	i work from home and this is completely_unacceptable .
negative	since i rent the bt line through sky i cannot even contact them regarding their poor service .
negative	ordered a barca strip for my sons_birthday waited 0_days then checked online tracking and said it was delivered to my ' porch ' 0_days ago .
negative	phoned customer service and said they would check with hermes delivery and see what happened .
negative	i then had to phone back as surprise_surprise they didn_'_t phone me !
negative	told that it was delivered to me personally which is amazing as i was at work all that day and my 00 year_old neighbour across my landing who never leaves his house said no one had been by all day .
negative	again phoned back and told same thing but that they always side with customer !
negative	what a joke my son was left gutted and i '_m hoping for a refund but i '_ve reported them to watchdog and to my bank for fraud so that '_s .
negative	how bad they are !
negative	i think some tramps hermes guy has spotted my parcel and lifted it as barca kids strips are hard to get right now .
negative	what a sad existence to steal from a company and make a fool of yourself !
negative	booked a hotel with 00 days parking at_stansted .
negative	received the confirmation_email_stating that it was booked .
negative	when we arrived at the hotel they had no record of the booking and took an_hour before they accepted it .
negative	please never ever study with rdi : you enrol on a distance course but you still have to go write exams !
negative	which means take time off work !
negative	inconvenience your work_colleagues , your boss and your daily family routine
negative	then when you try to defer because you have a family wedding to attend to , they shrug their shoulders and say ' tough '
negative	avoid at all costs ...
negative	i ordered a £_00 bouquet to be delivered .
negative	the flowers were not delivered to where they needed to go to .
negative	having made 0 calls to iflorist and finding out nothing in regards to the where_abouts of my flowers , i had to ring round all the florists in my town to find out who had " delivered " them ( iflorists would not tell me the name !)
negative	once i had found the correct florist i was able to find out within a 0 minute call that they had delivered to the wrong_address and would get another bouquet out immediately .
negative	this is something that iflorist should have been able to do , but due to their clear incompence they were unable to do so .
negative	never again will i be using them and will spread the word to make_sure others don_'_t .
negative	i placed an order for father '_s day which was advertised all over the website .
negative	over a week_later , after being given a 0 - 0 day delivery estimate , my order had still not arrived .
negative	i contacted the customer service team for an_eta , but they were rude and unhelpful .
negative	they asked me to wait 00 days before contacting them again , although by then father '_s day would '_ve passed .
negative	my parcel did eventually arrive , although one product had a broken box .
negative	extremely disappointed with the service and will never be shopping online with menkind again .
negative	like many of you ordered my big_boy bean_bag !!
negative	via_groupon .
negative	still yet to arrive !!
negative	ordered on the 00th_november_0000
negative	e . mail several_times after giving up trying to call them , and they now have automated line about bean_bags .
negative	last e . mail was delivery in feb before 00th , like others saying check site order page for details ... etc
negative	& an_email from groupon saying £_00 off next purchase .... i cant_afford any of their stuff , so gave it to my mum ...( she informed me of these numourus complaints !!)
negative	at_least now i dont feel alone in the matter .
negative	i have contacted bbc '_s watchdog via their website , advise you do also .
negative	i '_m also concidering refund from groupon even if i loose my £_00 odd p_&_p from infurn as seen similar priced / sized bean_bags instock at my local range store !
negative	!
negative	this has not put me off groupon as ive ordered from them in the past and been very satisfied .
negative	i do however want answers from infurn and a definative answer as to when my itm will actually arrive !
negative	!
negative	was told feb 00th ..... well on site its now saying calender week 00 ... lets see shall we ......
negative	placed an order 00th_june and have had no response .
negative	have rang , left messages and emailed with any answers .
negative	unless the collar is exceptional will not be using these people again .
negative	i bought a voucher for carpet cleaning and have had to chace the firm constantly they have failed to turn_up with more excuses than i have had hot dinners .
negative	wowcher have not responded .
negative	the voucher is showing as reddemed so i presume the compnay are claimin he have done the job .
negative	the company are still selling vouchers
negative	i first ordered back in oct following voucher from kgb_deals .
negative	it did not arrive .
negative	now i have has my voucher reactivated but to be honest the stuff looks rubbish and i am struggling to spend it .
negative	i have e_mailed to see when new purses will be in stock and guess_what they have not responded .
negative	what a joke , with over 0000 more vouchers just been sold again on kgb what chance do i stand !!
negative	!
negative	compare my move says it will gather a number of reasonable quotes from local removal firms to send you and give you the freedom of choosing from the best to make the whole_process easier .
negative	quite simply , it doesn_'_t .
negative	i was called by every company who wanted me to detail my items before giving me a quote .
negative	the process of running through that laborious list with a few local firms is something i could have chosen to do myself , i thought the point was i was given a ballpark figure by these companies for me to then choose from .
negative	a detailed quote could come later once i outlined exact_requirements e . g .
negative	packing , dismantling own furniture etc
negative	a ' stress_free ' site made several days very stressful as i was called throughout my work day by these endless firms .
negative	i wrote an_email to compare my move to flag this and i never_heard_anything back .
negative	completely unnecessary company that adds stress to an already tough time when moving , would not recommend .
negative	i placed an order on 00th_jan which money was taken as soon as i placed the order even_thou it was not in stock , but they dont tell you that , one month later still no products !!!
negative	four emails later i got a reply_saying that they didnt know why i hadnt received the product and said they now had it in stock by then i had already placed an order with another company and received it in two_days as i was fed_up with waiting , so i asked to be refunded almost a month a go and guess_what no refund !!
negative	!
negative	i have sent the another email , no reply !
negative	so i ve been in touch with my creditcard company and trading_standards .
negative	very poor service !
negative	!
negative	would never buy from this site again !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered my invitations through thie website and was happy when they arrived - this was short lived as the envelopes were missing from the order .
negative	i contacted customer service who told me that they were going in the post the next_day - 0_days_later no envelopes !
negative	i contacted them again both my email and pgone and again was told that these had been posted - 0_days_later and getting really annoyed called again and was told that these would be sent by courier to arrive yesterday - guess_what stayed in all day - no courier .
negative	i am now going out to buy envelopes so i can give to my family this weekend . i am still no closer to getting the envelopes from this site and have requested a refund for the missing envelopes
negative	ordered flowers 0_weeks in_advance for my mother '_s birthday .
negative	not delivered on the day - i was not told there was a problem .
negative	looking further the flowers went to the courier the day before due delivery date and have no been transported around various couriers depots for the last three_days !!!
negative	!
negative	i have tried contacting the prestige and delivery company ( yodel ), whilst to be fair i have had a reply ( albeit slow ) all they say is sorry , should be there soon .
negative	this is totally_unacceptable , has ruined my mum '_s birthday and i have had to order new flowers from elsewhere , as even if these ever turn_up they will be dead !
negative	flowers finally arrived 0_days_later , the roses were totally dead and the rest of the bunch had seen much_better days - my mum was so upset .
negative	i sent another email to the company who still refuse to give refund , only offering another bunch of flowers .
negative	why would we want another delayed and dead bunch of flowers ?
negative	never mind the fact i have already had to purchase another bunch from elsewhere .
negative	to top it all prestige lodged a claim on trust_pilot that my review was not accurate !
negative	a few emails soon sorted that - thanks trust_pilot !
negative	prestige have also stopped me posting on their face book page - i put nothing other than the truth , in a reasonable way !
negative	this company are relying_on the perishable goods_act to get out of refunds and need to be stopped !
negative	only_downside of primark if you want to take anything back you go to customer_services with two people on , queue for ages as everyone takes one item back and pays for two basket fulls while they are there , i recommend that the refunds counter is for refunds only ... as i wasted all my lunch hour queing to just get a refund very frustrated , or even more people on to deal with just refunds .........
negative	the last four orders i '_ve had from dorothy perkins have been problematic , from a broken zip on a dress , faulty pumps , laddered tights , a dress that stunk of cigarettes , and my most_recent one , a dress that was lovely until i washed it , now is covered in frayed elastic bits so is not wearable again !
negative	i have now lost my patience and give up with them , most certainly will never order from them again .
negative	i '_m surprised they are still trading !
negative	i have been emailing these people since christmas and the very charming_young_man who dealt_with me in the beginning is completely ignoring all my communications .
negative	i bought a blue tooth bracelet and it is useless .
negative	how do i get anybody to respond to this complaint .
negative	how can i get the name of the supplier to communicate with them .
negative	its like a faceless enemy .
negative	i placed my order in plenty of time for my daughter '_s birthday but due to the terrible delivery service have still not received her shoes .
negative	i would rather pay a delivery charge and get good service than get free delivery , you really do get what you pay for !
negative	it '_s her_birthday tomorrow but i very much doubt they will be able to ' find ' my partner '_s office that holds hundreds of people , is clearly sign posted and on a main_road .
negative	i can only hope .
negative	ordered a inflatable mario kart at christmas and have still to receive suitable correspondence via_email ... and dont even bother trying to ring as your call wont_be answered ... avoid !
negative	!
negative	after ordering a costume from here , i returned it due to the cheap quality ( i know this isn_'_t their fault - they ' re only stockists ).
negative	i sent the item back via_royal_mail signed for delivery , which was received and signed for the following_day by escapade .
negative	0_days and 0 emails later i have had no response and not a penny returned .
negative	they have their goods and seem to be unwilling to give my money back .
negative	will definitely be taking this further .
negative	urge_everyone to avoid this company if you ' re not 000_% sure about the item you ' re ordering .
negative	i placed an order for a hand - held dyson on 0st june .
negative	the money was taken immediately and then after 0_weeks the fobbing off started .
negative	0 . 0_months later i have no dyson and no refund , which was promised over a month_ago .
negative	tomorrow i '_ll be contacting my credit_card company to register a fraudulent transaction .
negative	this company should be closed_down with immediate_effect , before they cause problems to more innocent victims .
negative	dreadful doesn_'_t cover it .
negative	how they get away with it i '_ll never know .
negative	i would strongly_advise you to avoid this company at all costs .
negative	i was appalled by the service from_start to finish - delivery , product and aftercare .
negative	the door we received was finished very poorly , the glass fitting was particularly bad .
negative	when i contacted the company to discuss the problems the customer service that followed was absolutely terrible .
negative	i was spoken to in a manner bordering on aggressive .
negative	i was accused of lying and chastised for asking to be called back by the manager when he was off site .
negative	our direct doors door is sitting , unused , in our garage .
negative	it was a very expensive mistake .
negative	i hate this company with a passion - no sweat if you booked the correct tickets and the train turns_up .
negative	book the wrong tickets or need a refund and it will cost you dearly .
negative	not just the cost of the tickets but the numerous_calls to their indian_call_centres where they recite a speech - no matter_how many_times you tell them otherwise they will repeat the speech ... nightmare .
negative	would never use again : 0 (
negative	hi , i recently came_across a driving lesson package for my partner for £_00 . 00 i thought wow bargain .
negative	i continued to check the small_print which all seemed to pan out .
negative	however when i came to book the lessons which stated " 00_hours tuition driving test and pass plus " the gentleman explained that i would have to book at_least another 00_hours of lessons on top of this at £_00 per hour .
negative	i was furious as like most people that book deals like this don_'_t expect to have more money on top of your original payment to pay ....
negative	in light of this i contacted " groupon " to be told that i had misread the fine print and because it was longer_than seven_days after i purchased the voucher i wasn_'_t entitled to a refund and they could only give me credits ....
negative	i was furious ... why would i want credits i haven_'_t used the voucher it does not expire until december_0000 and it was utterly misleading and disappointing this company should not be allowed to get away with matters like this and i will be taking further_action .
negative	i payed with cash so i should be given a cash refund .
negative	avoid .
negative	regards sarah
negative	i orderes two items from here both sent out between the 00th of feb and the 0 march still_havnt received any opened a dispute with paypal , god know how long it will take to get my money back thats if i do , all there saying is were looking in to it , what ever you do dont buy from here
negative	bought a bed from one of the companies they '_ve got on their website , comfy_living .
negative	it broke within 0_weeks - complained through amazon , which took me a few_days how to work it all out as so complicated and got the response from the company after they took 0_days to reply - that as i '_d had bed for 00 days i wasn_'_t entitled to a refund !
negative	am still battling with this rotten company - do not buy anything from comfy_living - who are a disgrace .
negative	amazon say they can '_t help , even_though when i put a claim in i had a phone_call from them stating that they were going to refund me ?!
negative	i will never buy through them again .
negative	this company are the worst ever - do not go with them .
negative	i had non_stop problems with their internet which their staff are unable to sort_out - they are frequently very rude and / or cannot_speak_english properly , so you have a lot of trouble trying to understand what they are saying .
negative	when we tried to leave they wouldn_'_t transfer our account to the new company we chose .
negative	in the end i got so fed_up with receiving umpteen calls from their staff asking if i '_d like to renew my contract , that i cancelled my direct_debit in the hope that this would tell them that i was leaving - they cancelled our phone line the next_day and left us with no line , not to even call emergency services - which i thought was illegal .
negative	it took us 0_months to get our phone line reconnected due to the way in which talktalk had cut us off - as if we hadn_'_t paid , which we had - we were up to date with payments .
negative	they continued to charge us for the next 0_months also !
negative	this only got refunded when i took my complaint to ofcom - but talktalk sent them copies of letters they '_d " sent " me - they hadn_'_t ?!
negative	so i '_m still trying to get compensation for everything they did wrong to me & for costs_incurred as a result of being suddenly cut_off without_any warning !
negative	do not go with this company ever
negative	this system is fiddly , only a few local restaurants take it and it has very restrictive conditions .
negative	i took out a short_term membership as part of a special_offer with my family and friends railcard renewal .
negative	i was well aware that i would have to cancel by a specific date to avoid being charged_£_00 . 00 for a full years membership .
negative	i called to cancel in good time , sent back my card in good time , all of which was confirmed by email from the company .
negative	so i was amazed to see that they still took the £_00 . 00 from my bank_account .
negative	called them up to complain , they freely admitted this was their error and promised to refund .
negative	this amount also took my account overdrawn ( something that never happens ) but they refuse to compensate for my bank charges .
negative	in a nutshell ... they will make you jump_through many hoops to cancel then take your money anyway .
negative	avoid .
negative	rubbish - every time i see yodel are delivering i cringe
negative	fordralet :_00000 samsung i0000 galaxy_s0 croco 0 00 , 00 00 , 0000 - 00 - 00 0

negative	fordralet till min mans samsung note 0 är dock fint och verkar hittills hållbart så_det kan absolut reommenderas .
negative	ordered 0 toilets , at £_00 charge , was given 0 hour delivery slot , delivery came 0 hours earlier , house was not occuppied plus i took time off work , was told delivery time is an estimate , so why give one at all !!!
negative	one toilet was not suitable , vp wanted £_00 for return cost ,( wasnt told at time of order , just told i could return ) i got my own courier in the end , cost me £ 0 !!
negative	not happy , wont use again .
negative	after many_years posting thousands of parcels via_royal_mail i decided to give interparcel a try due to recent price increases at the post_office .
negative	i booked and paid £ 0 . 00 for delivery of a suitcase . the parcel was dropped_off at a local shop at 0 . 00am monday_morning . the next_day i logged on to track its progress and found it was still_waiting to be collected so i contacted interparcel and was told it would be picked_up later that day . wednesday_morning checked , parcel was still showing as waiting for collection contacted interparcel and was told the service i had paid for was up to 0 day collection . thursday_morning parcel had still not been picked_up contacted interparcel was told they would contact courier and get back to me . the following_tuesday 0_days after parcel had been dropped_off it had still not been picked_up interparcel had not contacted me and my customer had cancelled her order so i returned to shop to get my parcel back the shopkeeper refused to hand parcel back even_though i produced proof of ownership and threatened me with the police i eventually did get the parcel back but i am still out of pocket £ 0 . 00 and have lost a £_00 sale . i have since started_using a different company who have been fantastic i will not name them as some people reading this review may think i have written it with the sole intention of turning custom away from interparcel . all in all a terrible experience from a very poor company who when you contact them seem to read from a well_laid_out book of excuses to fob you off !!!
negative	!
negative	wish i could give zero_stars !
negative	even one is too much for them !
negative	i received a faulty pair of skates , my kid fallen down within few_minutes because of the faulty and broken part .
negative	contacted them on the same day , however their rude and arrogant customer service even refused for the refund .
negative	i would take this further !
negative	please do not buy from them !
negative	i ordered clothes on 00 feb_0000 , contacted them to see where is my order after a month ( on march_0000 ).
negative	they said deliveries could take anything from 0 - 00 working_days !
negative	however no news until i asked for a refund on 00 may_0000 !
negative	means almost 0 month !
negative	but i have been refunded after i contacted them .
negative	different issues :
negative	0 - i wanted to transfer swiss frank ( chf ) from switzerland to santander uk .
negative	i contacted santander customer service ( number provided by their online secure message ).
negative	after phone has_been cut_off two times !
negative	finally i was connected to a lady .
negative	her answer was sorry we cannot inform you with our exchange_rates !
negative	you will see it once it hit the account !!
negative	when she realised i am really angry she said she will transfer me to another department but i need to answer several security questions again !
negative	then she said bear with me and phone cut_off again !
negative	i called branch !
negative	they said same thing !
negative	sorry you will see the exchange_rate after you receive the money !!
negative	what ?!
negative	i am going to transfer more than £_000 , 000 to buy a flat here in london and i cannot get the exchange_rate ?!!!
negative	she finally said the current rate , which was again wrong !
negative	as she was mistaking between buy and sell rate !
negative	really is it the bank ?!
negative	do i need to remind them buying rate is different with selling rate ?!!!!!
negative	i finally decided to exchange prior to transfer in switzerland !
negative	0 - i applied for the santander mortgages !
negative	the waiting time to start application was awful !
negative	the lady was really nice and polite .
negative	however my address was wrong on their system !
negative	i asked for correction which same lady kindly correct it , however my mortgage confirmation again was with the wrong_address !
negative	!
negative	in overall working with santander was full of stress and i found them the most_unhelpful bank .
negative	update_:
negative	they just called me today and all they wanted was pushing me to buy content insurance for my home !
negative	i said 00 times that i am not interested , but still trying tom push !
negative	really annoying !
negative	only calling to sell products !
negative	finally at the middle of conversation the lady said sorry we have a customer here and will call you back later !
negative	crap customer service !
negative	* i wished they check this page !
negative	but seems they do not even care !
negative	we booked flights and accomodation to new_york through_expedia via travelsupermarket '_s website .
negative	there were 0 of us and we wanted two rooms .
negative	when the confirmation came through , expedia had booked all 0 of us into 0 room and one bed .
negative	when we rang up expedia blamed us for booking it incorrectly and refused to sort it out .
negative	we had to ring trading_standards to get advice and confirmation that we were in our rights , which we were , there was a website error .
negative	not our fault .
negative	a further call which took over an_hour and we still got nowhere with expedia .
negative	we put it in writing , giving them 0_days to sort it out .
negative	still nothing .
negative	a further call and lots of being put on hold and being passed around and finally someone agreed to cancel the original hotel and book us into somewhere_else but at our expense .
negative	this was their error and we had to suffer for it .
negative	expedia being the huge company that they are , would not budge to put things right that they had done wrong .
negative	they preferred to blame us , travelsupermarket , anyone but themselves who were responsible .
negative	it would have taken them a couple of minutes to sort this out , but instead they were just awkard with us .
negative	expedia , if you ' re reading this , you '_ve lost all my future trade .
negative	i '_ve circulated this story extensively which i hope will damage any further trade you could_possibly have .
negative	i ordered an item through broadbandstuff that they didn_'_t have in stock and had no plans to restock ( so why advertise it on your website ??).
negative	they contacted me to tell me they couldn_'_t supply , offered a number of alternatives at much higher cost that were far cheaper on amazon and wouldn_'_t price match .
negative	i told them i would not be buying from them and we left it at that .
negative	my credit_card statement arrived today and they went_ahead and charged my card !!!
negative	i '_ve had to ring my card_holder and have them intervene .
negative	avoid people , take_heed .
negative	avoid !
negative	i ordered an irobot from this company and heard_nothing from them for several days .
negative	i emailed to ask when it would come , they replied to say they had emailed me to say it was out of stock and they were trying to source a different model .
negative	i checked , no email had ever been received , not even in my junk email folder .
negative	the next_day i emailed again to ask what was happening and was fobbed_off .
negative	the next_day i emailed again , still fobbed_off .
negative	today they '_ve finally admitted they can '_t supply .
negative	timewasters .
negative	hermes have failed to deliver my asos parcel four times despite me being at home everyday waiting for the parcel this week .
negative	asos are equally as crap with their terrible customer service and hermes doesn_'_t seem to have a customer service platform at all , and there is no way for me to contact the local courier .
negative	it '_s no wonder hermes is rated so badly , and why asos ' profits are dropping .
negative	from now on i will avoid both companies at all cost .

negative	i ordered a wreath for my aunties funeral it was meant to be bright vibrant_colours of pink , purple and lime_green but when they sent it the wreath was yellow and nothing like the colour or description or one i had purchased ( see photos ).
negative	i complained to them online as they conveniently have no telephone_number available to contact them with .
negative	they at first ignored my complaint and after several e_-_mails and me stating that if they didn_'_t reply i was informing trading_standards they sent a very short terse e_- mail informing_me as far as they were concerned there was nothing wrong with my order but if i e_- mailed them the details ( which i already had done then ) they would look into it , so i sent the details again which they didn_'_t reply to so i have now have reported them to trading_standards and i have written to iflorist as instructed by trading_standards stating my complaint and asking for a full_refund but i am still_waiting for a reply but i don_'_t hold out much hope as they seem to have little in the way of customer service skills and their communication with customers is very unsatisfactory and not consumer friendly at all .
negative	it almost seems like they hope if they ignore customers or make it difficult to contact them that anyone who complains will give up and put it down to experience , but i am not willing to do this on principle so i will keep contacting them until i get a satisfactory reply .
negative	i ordered a product which was showing as ' in stock ' on pharmacy0u website .
negative	i contacted pharmacy0u one week_later , only to be informed that my order was not in stock , and further more , had never been in stock at the time of ordering .
negative	i was informed that i had been sent an e_- mail to inform_me of this , only i definitely did not receive any such e_- mail .
negative	if i had of received this e_- mail , i would have been able to make alternative arrangments for my medication .
negative	this caused me a weekend of absolute panic and hell .
negative	the product should never have been advertised as ' in stock ' in the first place .
negative	pharmacy0u is not a pharmacy that you can_rely upon , one who does not care about customer service whatsoever .
negative	i will never order from this pharmacy again .
negative	i bought a shower_head but although it appeared to fit , water seeped through the fittings i explained this to a young_lady on the phone and she would not accept it back and i was told to send it to the manufacturers for testing .
negative	i was very annoyed but she could not have cared_less and i got no apology .
negative	the manufacturers said it was not faulty as it worked on their system ( of course ) victoria_plumbing refused a refund as the item was " not faulty " and had been used and slightly marked whilst attaching .
negative	i am confused as to how one is supposed to test a shower_head without ' using ' it !
negative	what a rip_off !!!
negative	the worst customer service i have ever_experienced .
negative	my advice is to read the small_print .
negative	next_day ..... ehhhh ... not if you have ordered on a friday
negative	apparently , it is next working day which off course they forget to advertise !
negative	not on saturdays ... then you are supposed to wait the whole day for the delivery !!
negative	yes 0 hours ...
negative	reschedule ... impossible !
negative	if you wish to cancel the order because they are unable to deliver there is cancelation fee .
negative	overall an umplesant experience !
negative	btw , i already forgot about the bike ... uffff
negative	i have two phones , one with three and another one with o0 , its amazing the difference_between one and the other .
negative	o0 customer service is simple , easy and things are done pretty fast , in the other hand , three website is useless , their customer service even more useless and their policies are ridiculous .
negative	i am a pay as you go customer , and never loved 0 anyways , but now i have it more then any other operator
negative	trying to get my phone '_s internet unblocked through my handset , as they classify even an art website as adult content , with no success tried online , through my three account , also with no success , i then tried_phoning them , after talking to an indian assistant that i could barely understand , and give all my details from bank_account , address , drivers_license etc , to be asked to wait up to 0 hours for a text_message_confirming that they had my details checked .
negative	after waiting over an_hour for the text , i got a text saying that they couldn_'_t have my age checked therefore they were unable to provide me with my adult content pin_number .
negative	and i just want to watch a normal film
negative	wtf ...... not impressed , in fact really disappointed
negative	three is the worse mobile network in the uk
negative	i hope they bankrupt and get out of business
negative	last night i downloaded some software .
negative	got my browser highjacked by malware .
negative	took me 0 hours to remove it .
negative	i will never use them again .
negative	there was no click or unclick box to let_me know a bundle to software was going to be loaded .
negative	i have previously been very happy with the downloads .
negative	what has happened to their standards ?
negative	this was the 0_star_review , which is now downgraded to 0_star , see far below .
negative	i '_ve_used asda home delivery for groceries on and off since their days of the telephone order service ( with the lovely gentlemen from the north_east of england taking the orders ).
negative	i use asda , now via a laptop , every couple of months .
negative	the delivery has normally been within the 0 hour_slot .
negative	occasionally early , but they have phoned first to check i was in .
negative	the quality of the groceries have been fine .
negative	the occasional substitution , but normally fine .
negative	although i have to say asda do get the prize for the most weird substitution , ordered - a packet of cigarettes , delivered - a plastic picnic set for one .
negative	the only similarity , they were both blue .
negative	i just had to laugh .
negative	the substitution was the healthy option !
negative	!
negative	recently for the first time for years i '_ve had need to phone their customer service over a missing item .
negative	they are no_longer the lovely northern gentlemen , they are obviously not located in the uk , seem to be really friendly , if a touch over chatty at 00pm at night .
negative	they have promptly dealt_with my enquiry and refund produced in a few_days .
negative	i will_continue to use asda for groceries from time to time .
negative	i will also use tesco and sainsbury for my online groceries .
negative	for me the service from these 0 suppliers are about the same .
negative	just depends on what i need to order as to which one i use .
negative	update to asda review - it is now months after my original review .
negative	i have now had to stop using them completely as their website is now not compatible with firefox .
negative	i have emailed a couple of times and all i get is change to ie ( which kept freezing for me , so i gave up with it ) or change to google_chrome .
negative	as i '_m very happy with firefox i have given up with asda .
negative	i shall go back and check their site every few_months to see if they have sorted the problems , but until then my £_00 per week will go elsewhere .
negative	i bought a 00ft_trampoline as a christmas_present for my children .
negative	i also bought , at the same time , a safety skirt and a weather cover , but the accessories that were sent were for a 00ft_trampoline and were therefore too small .
negative	despite me regularly sending emails requesting that the correct_size be sent , including photographs to prove the skirt was too small , the customer service department just ignores any communication .
negative	they still have not sent the correct_size .
negative	i would definitely not recommend them .
negative	getting independent advice as i am sure they are in breach of the sale of goods_act .
negative	0_weeks too late
negative	whatever you do stay away from this company .
negative	they advertise cheaper good but dealing_with them is total_nightmare .
negative	there was a mistake with my order and after convincing them that it was incorrect they finally agreed to get them exchanged but only once their courier company collected them .
negative	their courier company did not collect for days , and i had to do most of the running around to try to get the correct items to site .
negative	once the correct items arrived i was told i that most of the parts did not come with the product and i had to order separately .
negative	after asking fro prices them confirming my order i was told it would take up 00 working_days as some of the items were not in stock .
negative	i asked if their delivery fee would be waived considering the circumstances , i am yet to receive a reply .
negative	this company cost me time and money and i would not recommend their services to anyone .
negative	if you are looking to save a few_pounds and don_'_t mind the heartache of being_messed_around then ' bathroom0u ' is company for you .
negative	but if your time is precious , find a more established company that will do the job right the first time ..
negative	i placed the order 0 minuted after 0pm and was told the order would processed the next working day .
negative	come to find out the items i ordered were not in stock .
negative	i called customer service twice both_times the agent tried to cancel my order .
negative	i wonder_how they make any money if the customer service agents simply cancel orders to make problems go away .
negative	i finally told her all i wanted to find out if the items could be delivered sooner .
negative	she called em back after 00_minutes and confirmed that they indeed had the times in stock and that they would be dispatched the next_day .
negative	i ordered nearly 000 prints from you and most of them have come with only half of the photo printed on it .
negative	on top of this it took_forever to upload the photos .
negative	ridiculous .
negative	apparently due to a surplus of flowers you sent me a free bouquet , the only problem was you sent it to an address i haven_'_t lived at for years and your email made it sound as if i gad ordered the flowers .
negative	i don_'_t know why your email couldn_'_t explain that they were free flowers ordered by yourselves .
negative	this confusion forced me to call my bank and check my account had not been hacked , and then email you to find out why i had seemly ordered flowers to be delivered to myself at a very old address .
negative	plus this morning i am asked to leave_feedback about my recent_purchase .
negative	i dud t purchase anything !!
negative	please delete my details from your database , i will never use you for flower delivery .
negative	can '_t say how disapointed i was !
negative	this was a little extra special valentine gift and ' little ' isn_'_t stressed enough !
negative	a ' special_offer ' of £ 0 . 00 and expecting a decent_sized box of chocolates .... it was a piddly box !!!
negative	combine them together and a mars bar would be more satisfying .... luckily i got a huge box of thorntons chocolates for £ 0 . 00 !!!
negative	i for one am fed_up misleading images & information !
negative	needless to say i won_'_t trust or recommend this company to anyone , if they classify this as a ' luxury valentine chocolate box '..... infact this will be an ongoing joke of how i paid a ripped_off price for a few little chocolates .... will just go to thorntons next time !!
negative	!
negative	mon : pretty disapointed that the flowers i ordered were not delivered ?
negative	i know that mothers_day would cause you to have mass orders but if you were unable to deliver flowers you should let the cusotmer know !
negative	obviously i am very unsatisfied with the result of my order , i hope i am going to recieve a refund and i wont_be using your service again !
negative	tue : still not heard back from iflorist .
negative	went on to there website and there is no phone number to phone and complain !
negative	extremely frustrated now !
negative	wed : recieved 0 generic emails ( seen as i have sent 0 emails of complaint !)
negative	stating that the flowers have now been delivered and for me to have a nice day !
negative	0 - the generic email showed nothing that the emails had actually been read
negative	0 .
negative	the flowers have still not been delivered .
negative	not that i would want the to be delivered now anyway as its no_longer mothers_day its plain day wednesday !
negative	never purchase of iflorist - im starting to thing that this is a con ?
negative	if not its fraud if i do not get my money back !
negative	never again ordering from here bouquet was tiny and 00_% of flowers was dead ......................
negative	booked two tickets to see paris st germain vs rennes for the 0th_may .
negative	game was rescheduled for 0th_may but unable to get refund for tickets - take_note people !
negative	i am having to try resell them online with no guarantee of a sale !
negative	have made numerous_attempts to contact viagogo but receive nothing but generic responses which are of no use to me .
negative	unable to list category 0 seat_numbers for the game - supposedly a psg restriction - however , loads of other_sellers ( of category 0 area ) are able to list their seat_numbers and when i first bought them i was able to see what seats i was buying !
negative	such a con of a website and a copout response from viagogo - never again will i use them .
negative	000euros possibly down the drain !
negative	poor poor poor - your customer service stinks !
negative	i ordered a large version of one of the arrangements but it only contained half a dozen flowers .
negative	will not use this site again .
negative	is the second time i have problems with this company !
negative	i was all day in and no one came and no call card left .
negative	i clearly made comment to leave with neighbours just in case but anyway i was all day home .
negative	until_0pm tracking was still with courier but after was showing returned to local service centre at 0 :_00pm ??
negative	?
negative	ridiculous
negative	now have to wait_till monday !!
negative	plus all i knew i will be home all day so i '_ve paid_extra for the saturday delivery !
negative	extremely dissapointed
negative	i have booked a hotel via slendia . com .
negative	in 0 minute time i have received a confirmation of my booking .
negative	in 00_minutes time manager from the hotel contact me and informed me that unfortunately it is no rooms available .
negative	most definitely it is inconvenient situation for everybody .
negative	but i ended_up in argumentation between splendia . com and bella luce hotel in guernsey .
negative	it is not the place to start of your holiday !
negative	on the top of that , lady from splendia . com , called kristen , promised to send me email , that it was hotel '_s fault , but never did .
negative	i have tried to contact her with no luck .
negative	very disappointing experience !!
negative	!
negative	from_start to finish duel were a nightmare .
negative	they underestimated the length of the job by 0_days ( a 0 day job in total ) because they ( in their own words ) " underestimated how long the paint would take to dry ".
negative	in addition , they left my house unlocked , doors open and insecure twice .
negative	guaranteed my spare_room would be ready for overseas visitors - i came home from work that night to find it looking like a bomb had exploded .
negative	i paid £_000 to put my visitors in hotel for the weekend - not even an_apology from duel .
negative	i wouldn_'_t wish the stress and incompetence ( let_alone shoddy workmanship ) on my worst_enemy
negative	do not use this company !
negative	!
negative	i ordered almost £ 0000 of furniture .
negative	i got £ 0000 finance and paid the rest with cash on the day of order .
negative	it was delivered broken .
negative	it should never have left the depot given it was walking out of the boxes it was " packed " in .
negative	instead , they '_d taped up a corner or two of the very badly_damaged boxes and shipped out regardless .
negative	i refused the delivery and sent photographic_evidence .
negative	i had to chase them for my refund .
negative	when it was agreed i was told it had just been processed and i would get my money in 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	it '_s now been 0 working_days and they still have my money .
negative	i '_ve been told i now have to wait another 0 working_days .
negative	this company doesn_'_t in any way approach professionalism .
negative	they have absolutely no interest in making the customer happy or delivering anything_remotely approaching quality .
negative	had a home delivery booked 00 - 0 ... now 0pm gone and still no food even_though ive rung twice to chase_up ... terrible service when ive kids to feed . wont_be using them again .
negative	still_haven_'_t received order .
negative	i have contacted you but apparently i have to wait_until wednesday next week .
negative	i have now completely ran_out of both products and i '_m not happy with the service .
negative	i had an extremely disappointing experience with eye - sale .
negative	ordered a pair of william morris glasses from them having obtained a code from wowcher .
negative	the case is too small and the lid cannot closed and it may band the glasses !!
negative	also the frame had dust and dirt and i can see small scratch around the glasses , - obviously dispatched very careless .
negative	i contacted them , they asked me took photo but they can ’_t see the scratch from the photo , i posted it back to them and they agree that they let_me choose another glasses .
negative	so second time i go for the gucci frame , after confirming with them that gucci frame no_longer appeared in the product list .
negative	so i guess it was the last pair .
negative	waited another 0_weeks to receive the glasses .
negative	guess_what , the case was broken .
negative	and one of the arms of the frame had “ n or z ” mark , i took photo to them and they asked me posted it back and i asked for the full_refund because i think they are very poor and did not fulfil the consumer right .
negative	but they said the dimples are the design of the frame and ignore what i said about the n mark on one of the arm .
negative	i agreed the dimples are the design of the frame but the n mark appeared on right side of the arm of the frame is definitely not the design of gucci .
negative	they keep saying it is new glasses and assured with the quality but they just ignore me with the fact that it is a second class or product with defect / flaw .
negative	i asked them to check with their supplier about my concern but they just ignore me .
negative	i even went to boots optician to check and confirm there is no n / z mark on that frame design and proposed to them that i can take a photo and show them .
negative	i have bought many designer products from different online store , but have not seen anything handled with such carelessness .
negative	i am still_awaiting the email !!
negative	the experience of dealing_with them was so unpleasant that i don_'_t want to even talk to them again , but i just want my consumer right !
negative	my recommendation - pleases avoid them and save_yourself your money and peace of mind !
negative	flowers arrived at 0 . 00pm , half_dead and not worth £ 0 let_alone £_00 inc delivery !
negative	disgusted with this service and will never use again !
negative	what an embarrassment
negative	i have bought quite a lot of merchandise from bedeck as we have recently_moved_into a new home .
negative	i recently ordered some sheets online as they did not have any instore .
negative	when they arrived i realised one of the fitted_sheets was for a deep ( rather_than normal depth ) mattress therefore was quite loose on the mattress i had .
negative	i checked the description again online - it does_state dimensions but does not say ' deep fitted ' as most other shops do .
negative	i contacted bedeck regarding this but the response was simply to say ' dimensions were stated in description '.
negative	i understand that but when it is not advertised as ' deep ' i would presume it was normal depth ... i will be more careful in future !
negative	i was disappointed regarding the aftercare response .
negative	my experience with serenata_flowers was absolutely awful , they were a present for my mum , as they arrived they were in a dreadful state , half of them were dead , some of the flower_heads were coming off im not happy what so ever .
negative	i won_'_t be ordering from them again , not a chance .
negative	whoever is reading this i would go to a local_florist you know then your flowers will be in a good state and they will be watered as well .
negative	how a " company " with such horrendous customer service and poor operation management is still afloat / still wins contracts from big_names / has still not been shut_down or at very least had its internal processes reviewed in this day and age is beyond me .
negative	found a failed delivery card left in the morning - was in all morning with the door within earshot , no knock or sign of attempted delivery apart_from the failed delivery card .
negative	fair_enough , perhaps i '_d gone temporarily deaf .
negative	on trying to reschedule delivery / pick - up from depot with the reference_number on their card as advised , was told numerous_times by their website and their phone line that the reference_number was not recognised .
negative	bare in mind i tried this various different times throughtout the day on the day of failed delivery and the following_day just_incase theyre system hadnt been updated yet .
negative	no telephone_number to actually speak to someone on hdnl website apart_from the useless rescheduling line , though fortunately i managed to get_hold of two different depot numbers from some nice people on the web for my nearest_depot .
negative	but noone actually answers either of the phonelines for the depot .
negative	so , i contact office ( who i ordered from ) they eventually ( 0 working_days_later ) let_me know that theyve asked the courier to redeliver , though with no eta
negative	day 0 ( day i was informed id have a redelivery ) - no parcel .
negative	fair_enough .
negative	day 0 - no parcel
negative	day 0 - no parcel
negative	day 0 - thats today ..... still no parcel
negative	i just want my order !
negative	delivery or pick_up i dont care i just want it !!!!
negative	!
negative	also note : unlike so many other people on this site , i have actually once received an order from hdnl , however this was only after a failed delivery and i picked_up from my local_depot .
negative	okay the failed delivery wasnt their fault that time and they did leave a valid referenced card - well_done .
negative	however when i went to collect my parcel , i did get it , but the norwich depot was an_absolute state , parcels piled / toppling everywhere looked horrendously disorganised ... i thought not alot of it at the time as they did actually find my parcel , but perhaps the shockingly kept depot was just scatching the surface on a truely catastrophically run sham of an organisation .
negative	steer_clear at all costs - poor communication with customers , poor organisation and poor service .
negative	they make me hate internet_shopping and thats saying something because internet_shopping is like crack to me !
negative	i have been with orange for a few_years_now and i have only stayed with them because of the orange_wednesdays but even that has lost its appeal .
negative	i find i have a lot of connection issues , it is always dropping the internet , and today when i was trying to get_hold of my daughters_school i couldnt get a signal , to be honest im sick of getting the sign which means no signal !.
negative	i am done with this company but unfortunately i still have over a year to put up with it
negative	was charged over double what the tickets actually cost ,
negative	disgusted !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered them months in_advance too ...
negative	i know tickets can cost a lot if trying to get them at the last_minute , but surely not months before , i was so shocked that i had been charged sooo_much extra , yes i knew i would be charged a bit , but more than double , viagogo is on a real good thing ,
negative	i will never use this company again , stay away !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i have to post back to you that trying to find where i leave from in venice for the greek ferry ( anek ) has_been totally problematic .
negative	your zip code 00000 venezia is incorrect .
negative	your sales people will only say ' that is what is on the web_site '.
negative	you do not provide any sort of site map .
negative	the original port given by you is closed and there is a new one ; ' new venice port ', discovered only by phoning anek in greece .
negative	there are no directions given out from getting from central venice to the port .
negative	it '_s not good enough to say ' we don_'_t have directions ' - quote from your sales_team .
negative	you should give directions from venice and a local map with suggested transport connections .
negative	thank_you .

negative	i '_ve had the unfortunate experience of having several parcels come ( or not !)
negative	by yodel .
negative	at our previous address , they delivered one parcel to an address that wasn_'_t mine ( wasn_'_t even in the same county ).
negative	they also kept a parcel for over a month , taking it out for delivery every other day but never actually delivering .
negative	i called and called about that one , and despite multiple notes , i had to cancel the order with the company so that they could recall the parcel .
negative	there was another order with lots of chasing .
negative	it was finally delivered , only because i happened to look out the window as the van was driving by .
negative	if i hadn_'_t , i don_'_t think he '_d have stopped .
negative	in short , they ' re the worst delivery company that i '_ve ever_experienced .
negative	waiting on a parcel that they ' re meant to deliver at the moment and honestly not expecting to see it anytime_soon .
negative	they were declining the card_details and refusing to top up my phone ..
negative	they also said they they didn_'_t recognise my phone number or post_code .
negative	credit has_been taken off my phone for no reason , and customer service is appalling !!
negative	i now hate orange and considering moving back to vodafone .
negative	please_beware
negative	advertised as uk registered company by actually conducts business out of hong_kong .
negative	my order placed 0th_december still_hasn_'_t arrived .
negative	i emailed the company several_times and they just don_'_t respond .
negative	currently £_000 out of pocket .
negative	i ordered a pair of oakley_sunglasses that displayed they were in stock .
negative	had an_email an_hour after making the purchase to say they were out of stock and their delivery for them to be back in stock was 0 - 00 days away .
negative	however after 0_weeks i still had no sunglasses delivered to me .
negative	i had emailed and phoned a couple times .
negative	they responded to my emails quickly which was the only good thing .
negative	but they were very vague on the delivery time therefore i cancelled my order and had the money refunded to me that day .
negative	the lenses were not as_described by the optician i spoke with .
negative	i was advised that there would be a faint line on the bifocal lenses .
negative	instead .
negative	there was a thick u shape , visible to myself and anyone looking at me .
negative	they were incredibly ugly and represented poor value for money .
negative	a real_shame as the frames were lovely .
negative	the engineer arrived promptly at 0 . 00 am , assessed the work and according to him would nip out to get some tools .
negative	he did not return on - site until 00 . 00 am , that is at_least 0 hours and 00_minutes later !
negative	when he returned , i asked if his office / workshop was far away and he replied it was just down the road .
negative	the actual job ( moving the door entry phone to the other room ) was done in under 00_minutes .
negative	i have been charged 000_gbp for a job that should have cost gbp 000 due to the time he disappeared off - site .
negative	i have flagged this with aspects customer service last december but have yet to hear back from them after this initial reply :
negative	----- original message -----
negative	from : tina hxxxxxxxxxxx [_mailto : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ]
negative	sent : thursday , december 00 , 0000 0 : 00_pm
negative	to : hester @ xxxxxxxxx
negative	subject_: fw : [ aspect - vm ] feedback
negative	dear hester ,
negative	firstly please_accept my sincerest apologies on behalf of aspect . co . uk that your experience was anything other than the highest_level of service we aim to deliver .
negative	unfortunately due to the nature of our business we can sometimes be delayed and miss or be late for an_appointment , however out of over 00 000 jobs a year that we carry out , this happens with less_than 0 %.
negative	i have asked our electrical trade head to have a look at your job and get back to me as soon as possible .
negative	if the engineer had to go and source parts for the job then he should have explained this to you at the time .
negative	we do consider ourselves to be professional , honest and committed ; traits which are generally not associated with the industry we represent .
negative	again i am sorry you feel so strongly about your aspect experience .
negative	we do pride ourselves on providing excellent customer service and , although we are by no means perfect and we will look into the problem and get back to you .
negative	may we take this opportunity to wish you a very happy new year .
negative	kind_regards
negative	the aspect team .

negative	admin assistant
negative	....... a nice email , however since i have had no response to any of my follow_up emails or calls .
negative	i can understand that they would need to make the necessary_checks with this engineer as to ascertain what would have taken him 0 hours , but their inability to keep me updated has made me doubt aspect '_s level of responsibility and clarity on what is chargeable to the customer .
negative	please_beware .
negative	i purchased 0 x 0 hour quad trek with universal paintball and to cut a long_story_short , when we arrived to enjoy our booking , we were told that one of their quad bikes were broken and that they had to cancel our booking .
negative	bearing in mind that we drove an_hour and a half to get there , we were naturally very disappointed .
negative	i have tried 0 times via_email to contact wowcher but no one will reply and i have also telephoned twice only to be on hold for 00_minutes then to be cut_off saying no advisors are available .
negative	soooooooo disappointed .
negative	i am out of pocket £_00 and don_'_t know what else to try .
negative	i ordered a furry covered night light for my grandson .
negative	it arrived with the box torn and the item inside dirty .
negative	the company offered me a refund of item costs only and wanted me to send the item back at my cost .
negative	i would be nearly_£_00 . 00 out of pocket cos they sent shoddy goods .
negative	i can '_t give dirty items to a newborn_baby .
negative	will never shop with them again .
negative	i traveled back from france to dover in october .
negative	considering i had left lots of extra time to get to the port , due to roads being blocked in germany and in belgium i have lost so much time i was unable to make it on time .
negative	i traveled with my 0 year_old daughter , for whom the trip was really exhausting to find out i won_'_t be let on a next available ferry unless i pay again , not a small_amount .
negative	i was shocked , considering people who were booked in for later traveled with no extra_cost earlier and the ferry was empty .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	i ordered on line and was given the collect in store option .
negative	i later received an_email to stay my goods were ready for collection , i went to the store only to find no order .
negative	i made a complaint and told i would get a call from manager in charge , never_heard a thing .
negative	would not use this service again .
negative	i purchased the longchapman handbag sets on wowcher roughly about a month_ago now and i still have not received my purchased items .
negative	not only did they take my money the company initially partnered with wowcher on the deal also took my money on delivery costs .
negative	it '_s been a week now since i '_ve contacted wowcher and the initial company they done the deal with , and i have not received a reply from either of them .
negative	i am so disappointed and upset .
negative	i would rather have my money back then actually receive the products .
negative	i '_m so disappointed .
negative	i advice all those who i reading this to save your money and look for deals elsewhere
negative	how is it that they can take your money for a month and not delivery what you paid for ?
negative	absolutely poor customer service !
negative	where is my money ????
negative	?
negative	we arrived at our designated time to find everything shut up and nobody about to meet us .
negative	after looking around and calling in what looked like a muddy field we decided not to leave our car here and proceeded to a " proper car_park "
negative	amazon use yodel for there deliveries which in my opinion is a big mistake !
negative	they deliver but dont put a card through your door just leave items on your doorstep or at the side of your house this happened to me they delivered some books i had no card and no idea the items were delivered i contacted amazon and they advised the items had been delivered i checked by my back gate and my books were there ruined as it had rained .
negative	another time they left 0 packages at the back gate worth 000_quid was there a note no there wasnt !!
negative	!
negative	am an <_external link_removed_> customer of many_years .
negative	lost times_now of the amount of collections yodel fail to collect .
negative	in fact they have failed to collect every one , thats around 0 , these last few_months .
negative	always ends up with <_external link_removed_> taking over .
negative	not only that but why dont yodel reply to your complaint emails either ?
negative	never known a company so bad , and look at the amount of neg reviews !
negative	there is a distinct theme on this thread which csl are clearly not addressing and which , sadly , is letting them down big time .
negative	the sales_staff and buying experience in the store are very good .
negative	there is a wide_range of choice and the furniture is comparatively good value for money .... when it arrives in perfect_condition .
negative	where this company is seriously , and i mean seriously , falling over is in its abysmal customer after sales service .
negative	particularly when the goods are not perfect through no fault of the customer .
negative	even the manager of the store where we bought our sofa ( who we had to visit after our frustrations in getting through to customer service on the phone ) admitted that he is frustrated that the quality of after sales customer service does not back up the front line sales_staff .
negative	we ordered our sofas in march_0000 , we got them in early july .
negative	as i sit here on the last day of september waiting for a technician to deign to turn_up ... again , we still don_'_t have our ' perfect sofa '.
negative	the technical call_centre have all the chat but , they just don_'_t have the service quality to back it up .
negative	the most basic customer_care is completely lacking ... endless hours listening on the phone to how important our call is but still not bothering to answer it , failure to call back when they say they will , failure to do what they say they will when they do turn_up , failure to give reasonable time slots for deliveries and technical work ( t ' aint rocket_science that customers have to work to pay for this stuff !!
negative	), blase scripted responses to enquiries , complete disregard for the cost to the customer of phone_calls and time off work , and complete_lack of anyone with balls making interventions to put right what they have done wrong .
negative	i get it completely csl ...... we have landed in ' we '_ve got your money so you ' re stuffed ' ville .
negative	i haven_'_t detailed all our issues on here because it '_s just more of the same as in previous posts .
negative	would i recommend csl to anyone_else ...... no .
negative	would i buy from them again ....... no .
negative	with all this in mind , if you do still decide to go_ahead and buy , then my only advice is this - make the delivery staff wait_until you have checked every inch of your sofa / s , sit on all the seats , work all the mechanisms , check all the fabric / leather , they won_'_t like it but do not be hurried .
negative	if you find anything wrong , no matter_how small , no matter what the delivery men advise ..... refuse to accept delivery and make them take the whole lot back .
negative	if you don_'_t , be warned , you are heading for a nightmare and there will be lots that comes between you ( your sanity ) and your ' perfect sofa '
negative	all went wrong almost_immediately .
negative	no confirmation of order email , nor was it in spam_folder as floraqueen suggested .
negative	emailed them to query with no reply .
negative	really unhelpful that you can only access your order / customer servies with that confirmation_email in your possession .
negative	they then sent the recipient an_email_saying ' congratulations on your flowers ' which was pretty laughable considering they hadn_'_t arrived , nor any sign that floraqueen had attempted delivery .
negative	sent another email and still no reply .
negative	but the money '_s been taken of course , so i '_ve had to start an investigation with my credit_card company .
negative	i brought a pair of hunter_wellies that were to big so i sent them back and asked for a refund but i had to foot the cost of return delivery which was £ 0 . 00 totally disgusting would never buy from here again .
negative	i paid 00 . 00 for guaranteed saturday service .
negative	product didn_'_t arrive .
negative	i emailed to ask where it was and got no reply then called 00 times throughout the day to ask where it was , every time the line was engaged ... then today i get an_email thanking_me for my order !
negative	i bet you like my order , you take my money and don_'_t send my goods !
negative	i '_ve been with tmobile for years_now and had several contracts .
negative	i was mugged last month and called the same night to inform them , block the phone and sim and ask for a new sim .
negative	made a complaint as the woman i spoke to was completely uncaring and blunt with me .
negative	so a month later no sim and can '_t get through on the phone because they won_'_t speak to me without me telling them my last bill amount ( not payment , bill ).
negative	finally get through tonight and after being cut_off 0 times , i am told i never reported my phone lost or stolen , but they will send me a new sim as a good - will gesture !!
negative	and that i will have to pay the last month '_s bill because i didn_'_t report the phone lost , i rang to cancel my contract ( with a year left ?).
negative	now taken it to the ombudsman because they won_'_t do anything more .
negative	no apology , they just don_'_t care .
negative	never been more angry with a company .
negative	we arranged for an ' end of tenancy clean ' - which they class as a maid0blitz on their website .
negative	the cleaner turned_up ( didn_'_t speak much english ) and after 0 hours , my partner inspected what she had done and it was very poor indeed .
negative	no attention to detail , many items missed .
negative	excuses were made .
negative	we complained to maid0clean and they booked in another cleaner for the following_morning .
negative	after 00_minutes of waiting in an empty apartment , i called the agency and they called back to say that something had happened so she wouldn_'_t be turning_up .
negative	they then tried to organise someone_else for 0pm the same day , so i had to return to apartment ..... i arrived early but by 0 . 00pm there was no show , so i called the agency .
negative	by 0 . 00pm , they still hadn_'_t called me back , so i chased them up .
negative	by 0 . 00pm i was told they couldn_'_t get_hold of the cleaner .
negative	that was 00_minutes of my time wasted .
negative	i still need a cleaner and have an inventory check - out on friday , but maid0clean couldn_'_t care less .
negative	i politely requested a refund but they weren_'_t taking any responsibility and even when i demanded a refund , they still said " you are not getting a refund ".
negative	so i '_ve wasted £_00 on payment to maid0clean and about 0 hours of my time (£_000 ) in dealing_with this shoddy , incompetent , shockingly_bad company with the most dreadful customer service .
negative	do not instruct maid0clean ever !
negative	i am taking this matter further , ie , bbc_watchdog and other avenues .
negative	if anyone_else has had any_problems with maid0clean ( i am sure there are many out there !
negative	), then i suggest you contact bbc_watchdog as well .
negative	i am so very disappointed and upset by all of this .
negative	it should be noted that “ maidtoclean ” are in breach on contract under section 00 of the supply of goods and services act 0000 act as it states that ….
negative	“ s .
negative	00 implies a term that where the supplier is acting in the course of a business there is an implied term that he will supply the service with reasonable skill and care .
negative	breach of this term is often known as contractual negligence .
negative	it gives rise to a cause of action ”.
negative	really dreadful experience with a sofa delivered on the 0rd .
negative	wish i had seen these reviews before ordering a high value item from argos .
negative	sofa arrived as promised but really was not good value , cheap and nasty , grey plastic legs etc ( cost was over 000_gbp ).
negative	delivery guys said that there would be no problem returning it for a refund within 0_days .
negative	so , trustingly sent it back .
negative	have spoken to argos customer_services every day from the 0rd , they will not let_me have my money back , i keep being told that there is a problem with their system which won_'_t let them authorise a refund , has to be the technical_department .
negative	promised return phone_calls , which have never happened .
negative	no reply to emails .
negative	staff disinterested and ill informed .
negative	i am moving_house , can not move until i have a sofa and white goods , argos are holding my money .
negative	there is no way i would recommend this shambles of a company .
negative	nor will i spend any more of my money with them , as i intended , should i eventually get a refund .
negative	i will be taking this to the citizens_advice at the first available opportunity .
negative	i was happy with the product and the delivery .
negative	i was unhappy that i had done a deal on the phone with the girl but when she took the money she took the previous amount and not the amount for the deal i had agreed with her , that to me makes the whole_thing untrustworthy unfortunetly , but what can you do when some one has your card_details .
negative	i cant use them again based on this - very disapointed
negative	do not waste your time ordering online groceries and expect this company to honour any details they send you , including the estimated time of arrival or dellivering your groceries at all .
negative	i have been waiting for groceries meant to arrive 0_days ago .
negative	i have spoken to over 00 people over these days with each one promising me that the driver was on his way .
negative	one even claimed the driver had arrived and left a note thought the letter_box , but not of my house .
negative	day 0 they delivered to the wrong house despite 0 staff telling_me that my order was on its way to my address .
negative	finally , at last two managers called me and gave_me a 000_% guarantee that my order would arrive at 00pm on day 0 ( after expecting it between 0 - 00am ).
negative	guess_what ?
negative	it never arrived .
negative	this is hands_down the absolute worst service i have received from any company .
negative	i have given up .
negative	as one of tesco ’_s customer service operators told me on day one ‘ maybe you should just go shopping instead ’.
negative	i think i will - at sainsbury ’_s .
negative	i have used wowcher in the past and had no_issues , however it seems when there is a hitch that they just don_'_t get back to you .
negative	i ordered a blender on the 00th_august which went through the wowcher automatic sending page ( where they deal with the selling company on your behalf ), but have had no contact since .
negative	i really dont like the ' sit back and wait ' strategy as i have no idea if it was ever sent or if the seller even received my order .
negative	i have sent two emails to the wowcher enquiries email address given on the website and neither have been replied to , and i cant phone until saturday as i work the same hours as the helplines are open .
negative	i '_m seriously dissappointed with the service here - i understand that hitches happen , but the lack of contact and resolution has left me never wanting to use this website again
negative	i have escalated a concern on the poor service and information provided by tradingdepot . co . uk and no responsibility is being taken for this .
negative	poor aftercare service , not interested now they have taken payment .
negative	imagery on site is misleading
negative	have ordered twice from chemist_direct and each time i have spent_ages waiting delivery , and been very disappointed .
negative	my tracking says it left on 00th_november , it is now 00th and i still_havent received .
negative	it takes 0 working_days normally with post ..... where is it ?
negative	last time i ordered from chemist_direct , i had to phone again weeks_later .
negative	i ordered this time assuming last time was one - off delay .
negative	my advice : dont order if you need it soon .
negative	what i needed it for has passed .
negative	very dissapointed .
negative	i am very annoyed with your customer service i have tried to phone sent messages and know one has had the decency to reply i complained that my mother in laws flowers were extremely disappointing the vase was smashed and the amount of flowers in the arrangement were minimal and i wanted at_least a new vase sent no 000000
negative	but having said all that the three funeral arrangements were stunning and we were very pleased so if you can do it for them i am sure you can do a good job every time
negative	still no contact so changed my rating , because i am happy with one order does not mean that you can ignore the first order , the vase was delivered broken and your bouquet was appalling
negative	still no contact and still no replacement vase
negative	our experience with hammonds has_been absolutely horrendous .
negative	it started out really well , great visit from the designer , received a competitive price , and advised roughly a 0 - 0 week turnaround which beat all other_companies we had met with , this was the most_important_factor as we had recently_moved_into a new house without_any storage .
negative	i was slightly_nervous that this all seemed too good too be true especially reading some of the negative_reviews on this website , and asked the surveyor during his visit what the catch was , he advised me there was none and that hammonds were a great family run company .
negative	i felt completely reassured , however what then followed over the next 0_months is a complete_nightmare !
negative	after_placing our order on the 0rd of april we were advised week_commencing 00th_may for installation , however as our job would take 0 . 0_days ( installation only took 0 hours in the end !)
negative	we were pushed back a week and installation arranged for monday the 00th_may , our installation was only completed this week ( 00th_june )!!!
negative	we received a call the friday prior to advise that due to personal issues the fitter would not be available , and installation had to be changed to friday of that week , annoying as i had already taken the day off work but couldn_'_t be helped .
negative	i advised that i would be working friday , but could leave a key and a place was arranged .
negative	i came in friday_evening , and was absolutely_furious as no one had turned_up .
negative	we called saturday_morning and were told to expect to call back monday as no one could help on a weekend .
negative	we received a call on monday to inform us that a fitter would not be available for another 00 days , i advised that a new bed was being delivered that day and could not be delayed again .
negative	as it was their error they advised that the fitter would work around this , cutting outside etc .
negative	the fitter_turned_up almost 0_weeks_later and advised the bed would need to be taken apart and went away unwilling to do the installation !
negative	as it was a heavy tv bed we needed to pay to get it taken apart .
negative	the fitter then returned on the 0th_june and the wardrobe_doors were cut incorrectly , and filler panels the incorrect size .
negative	during installation i noticed a large crack to the paintwork and plaster in the landing ceiling , and pointed it out to the fitter as this was not there prior to their arrival , he shrugged this off and did not seem bothered , i then referred this with photos to customer_services .
negative	i followed this up with a phone_call at 0000 to advise of the issue and was left in the queue until 0000hrs when then the line closed .
negative	once again the fitter had to come_back out to correct the errors with the wardrobe on tuesday 00th_june , and there are still issues .
negative	the new doors are not lined correctly , and should be soft_close but do not work , and given the nature of how our experience has_gone i was expecting a follow_up call from hammonds and have heard_nothing !
negative	there have been numerous_calls / emails back and forth_between myself and my husband and hammonds customer service , and whilst they have discounted our order by a small_amount , and paid for the bed to be disassembled and reassembled , i think the way they have handled the whole situation has_been absolutely_disgraceful !
negative	!
negative	if you have time to constantly hound them , and do not mind being_messed about after paying them the majority of the money upfront ( 0 . 0 mos in_advance of actual installation in our case !
negative	), then you may want to consider hammonds .
negative	if you are looking for a good experience , with a smooth installation process and professionalism i would strongly_recommend you look elsewhere .
negative	i cannot_believe this company is still running !
negative	i bought an item for them in november_0000 as a christmas_present which never arrived .
negative	like others have said , on the rare_occasion i managed to speak to someone when i called they were very nice people apart_from one ' young_man ' who actually swore at me !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	by the sound of things i am one of the very lucky ones as i eventually got my money back from them , but this was only after pestering them by phone every day for two_weeks and eventually getting them to send me a royal_mail claim_form as obviously it was rm '_s fault , not theirs !
negative	it was february before this happened though .
negative	my boyfriend himself tried to buy the same item at the same time for his_mate for christmas and of course this never turned_up either and he never got his money back .
negative	he was so pissed_off about it he was going to take a day off work and visit their_offices .
negative	we reported them to trading_standards who said they '_d heard lots of similar stories_about them which is why i am amazed they are still managing to steal people '_s money with their blatant lies .
negative	avoid this company like the plague !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i purchased a beko cxfd0000w fride /_freezer online on 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	the delivery date was scheduled for 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	we received a text on the 0th to say delivery would now be the 0th ( i have the original e_mail with stating the 00th ).
negative	my husband had to take a day off work otherwise the delivery would have to be rescheduled .
negative	so obviously customers requirements are immediately disregarded .
negative	the item duly_arrived & our old fridge_/_freezer was uplifted .
negative	we waited over 0 hours then swiched on , filling the freezer later that evening .
negative	overnight the fridge heat up & the freezer defrosted all the contents .
negative	money i can ill_afford to lose .
negative	on contacting curry '_s & spending 00_minutes on the phone i was promised a replacement ( a further delivery of fridge_/ freezers expected on the 00th ).
negative	i called back to - day ( 00th ) & was informed that expected deliveries did not if fact arrive .
negative	possibly ?
negative	they would be in the uk on the 00th .
negative	( they are continuing to sell this product online ).
negative	but that time it will have been almost 0_weeks since original order with no arranged delivery date .
negative	i wish i had never looked on the curry '_s website & had just kept my old fridge_/_freezer .
negative	i have also e_mailed curry '_s direct to complain_about the poor service , surprisingly i have not received a reply .
negative	please if considering a purchase from curry '_s .......... look elsewhere .
negative	not a happy & never again to be curry '_s customer .
negative	i am going to review this company as objectively as i can considering what they have put me through .
negative	i found lightinthebox through an advertisement on a well_known auction_site so i assumed that they were reliable .
negative	after browsing their website i found some items that i liked .
negative	if you contact the livechat the operator will give you with a $ 0 ( or £ 0 . 00 ) money off code when you spend over_$_00 .
negative	unfortunately as soon as you spend over_$_00 or equivalent in gbp ( i am an english customer ) the website automatically takes away the option for the cheapest delivery , so the extra you pay for shipping , you do not save anything , it actually costs you more .
negative	after bringing this issue up with the operator she told me that most people don_'_t use the cheapest option anyway as it is very slow so after a lot of debate i went with the code and paid more for the 0 - 0 day shipping instead of forgoing the code and choosing the cheaper option .
negative	all of my items were under a ( ships in 00 hour ) status which they guarantee on the website but the processing time was actually 0 business days .
negative	i have purchased from china before and i do always expect a long shipping time , from purchase to receiving my item was over two_weeks ( in business days ) this was fine but it is slightly_annoying that the company make promises they do not fulfil .
negative	anyway , i was looking_forward to receiving my items .
negative	most of them were competitively_priced with the uk market as you would expect , one of the items was expensive though (£_00 . 00 for some nail_varnishes ) so my total order was £_00 . 00 for five items .
negative	the shipping amount i paid was £_00 . 00 which was good as it was coming from china but the items were very light .
negative	in total i paid lightinthebox £_00 . 00 .
negative	the items were not sent through national post they were sent through a courier service , i assume because they were expedited through their 0 - 0 day shipping option ( but the cheaper shipping wasn_'_t an option as my order was worth over_$_00 ).
negative	this meant that the package was received and dealt_with by parcelforce and not delivered by royal_mail ( all of the items i '_ve purchased from china arrive through royal_mail .)
negative	my items were not delivered to me .
negative	i instead received a letter from parcelforce stating that i was required to pay £_00 before they release my package .
negative	£_00 as a handling_fee over_£_00 in import_tax .
negative	as i had already waited over 0_weeks to receive my package and was wary of refusing the package i had to pay this ridiculous_amount to get my goods .
negative	i am aware that i am required to pay import_tax , this is calculated on the value of the items and the shipping .
negative	however , the import_tax was over double than what i was required to pay .
negative	the reason for this is because lightinthebox had written the value of shipping as 000 yuan which is over_£_00 !
negative	which made my total order amount appear to be £_00 when it was £_00 . 00 as stated on my invoice .
negative	after a very lengthy phone_call to parceforce i was told it was an issue for hmrc , cue another long phone_call to hmrc where i was told i would have to go through the process of claiming my money back through them and a lot of agro .
negative	when i finally received my package , i opened it to find an exposed make shift craft knife laying at the bottom of the box ( nice and dangerous !)
negative	presumably whoever was packaging my items dropped it in the box .
negative	i thought purchasing from this website would be reliable and yes i have received my items but it has cost me over_£_00 for items that are worth £_00 ( and that '_s being generous ) at uk value , i do feel completely ripped_off .
negative	if you feel that you are getting a bargain for items that you have not seen in the uk , think again shopping with this company will most_likely cost you twice as much than you would pay for the items in the uk and they will do nothing to help you rectify the situation .
negative	a complete_nightmare experience , i will chalk it down to a learning_curve and never again will i use this company or recommend anyone_else to it , nothing short of criminal .
negative	i am still_waiting for my order that is 0000000 .
negative	too expensive and clothes very small sizes
negative	ordered an oven .
negative	paid_extra for fitting .
negative	fitters didn_'_t cut a ventilation hole and the oven overheated and burned the control_panel off .
negative	contacted currys many_times by email , letter , phone and in store and this was never resolved .
negative	don_'_t trust these people .
negative	don_'_t reward them with your business .
negative	i had these glasses one week and one of the nose_pads came off .
negative	contacted ozeal and they told me to go to a shop and have them fixed .
negative	great after sales .
negative	shame because i like the glasses and would have ordered again .
negative	i purchased my flowers , wine and what i assumed would come with it was a box of free chocolate !
negative	not only did the wine that i paid for not deliver but the chocolates didn_'_t either !
negative	when i phoned up i was assured that i was going to get a refund put through for that day which i understood would take 0 to 0 working_days to come through and the girl told me that she would send out the free box of chocolates like it should have been !!
negative	after phoning up for the second time last thursday i am only now getting an_email_stating i will get my refund that will take up to another 0 to 0 working_days and i am yet to see the chocolates !
negative	being a student in liverpool i tried to surprise my mum back home and thanks to iflorist ruined my surprise !
negative	may i add the first time i had rang iflorist querying about my purchase the girl on the phone was rude , cheeky and not very helpful at all !
negative	i do not recommend to shop_here at all !
negative	even the flowers that were sent out did not look like much and looked dead !
negative	absolute_disgrace !
negative	i ordered this item as i needed helpto start a diet and thought this sounded good was not impressed at being tie - in and unable to get out with . out a big charge food ok but boring dinners ok lunch all the same and not enough to eat for breakfast , am feeling conned wouldn_'_t recommend at all
negative	no it isn_'_t free delivery as advertised it is delivery free to somewhere local ie 00miles_away is the closest
negative	poor quality trousers laddered as soon as put on can '_t wear again wouldn_'_t buy again !!
negative	!
negative	unhelpful girl when rang them also !!
negative	!
negative	i was offered a 00_%_discount from a previous order this would not go through as code was not recognised .
negative	paid postage and packing then had to go to the sorting_office to collect the parcel myself .
negative	more bother than necessary so i will go elsewhere next time
negative	i had problems booking a hotel online . ended_up with 0 hotel_bookings for the same dates .
negative	phoned lastminute to explain . they were no help at all . this company takes your money but if anything_goes_wrong they ' re not interested .
negative	the delivery times were not made clear , initially it was 0 - 00 days , when they didn_'_t arrive in that time i was told it would be 00 - 00 days .
negative	they didn_'_t even turn_up in that time , in fact i am still_waiting for them .
negative	i decided to buy online as it is usually much_quicker and hassle_free .
negative	if only i '_d have known it was going to take so long that my vision got so annoyed , it corrected itself independently .
negative	i wont use this service ever again .
negative	i sent two fones away and they both belong to me but because one in m ax husbands name which is not my fault , but u guys r dumpin it as it was a red_flag fone ?
negative	u shouldnt b able to dump it send it bk
negative	i bought a sub_standard ben 00 camera for my son and when i realised how poor the quality was , i tried to return it .
negative	they said i could not because i had had it longer then 00 days , - i had bought it in_advance of his_birthday and then it was a week before we actually tried to use it .
negative	i then tried to return it as faulty but they insist that i need to send it recorded delivery , at my expense , and if ( i think it will be when ) they find it not faulty , they then insist that i have to go and fetch it within 0_days .
negative	stay away from lambda - tek .
negative	if your product is sub_standard or faulty , you '_ll never get a return / refund .
negative	they '_ll make_sure of that - they talk in riddles - go with a decent company , not them .
negative	when i was sent a defective part by one of the recommended companies neither the supplier nor partsgateway would acknowledge there was a problem and refused to do anything about it .
negative	so i have adefective part and am £_00 worse off .
negative	will never use again !!!!
negative	!
negative	service is absolute_rubbish !
negative	make your order then wait two_days to be posted .
negative	then when it '_s posted they use royal_mail snail service so don_'_t expect to get your goods anytime_soon .
negative	if you ' re ordering from a mobility shop it '_s expected that you need the goods now not when they feel like giving you the goods .
negative	for the sake of £ 0 i could have ordered on my amazon_prime and got next_day delivery wish i '_d stuck to my usual and not bothered with this company .
negative	that '_s why amazon is a massive company because they have got everything about a business right !
negative	it '_s the last time i will ever order from here i '_d rather go to my local mobility shop to get goods instantly !
negative	complete_care shop shows nothing but contempt towards its customers once its got your money !
negative	yes i '_m furious !
negative	not a lot else to say !
negative	won_'_t be using this service again in a hurry
negative	haven_'_t heard back from recipient in grimsby .
negative	s m kettle
negative	i bought an item from them and it arrived promptly - no problem there .
negative	however the item developed a fault and as a result i had to send it back .
negative	it took almost 0_weeks to get a refund , the phone lines never answered and i tried_emailing repeatedly .
negative	in the end i opened a paypal_dispute to get my money back , and although i did eventually get a refund , they deducted money for restocking .
negative	having originally paid £_00 , i received a refund of £_00 - a loss of £_00 !
negative	i would be very wary of them - i certainly won_'_t be using protechshop again .
negative	ordered flowers for mother - in - law as was due to go in to hospital for an operation .
negative	ordered the flowers before 00 : 00 and minutes afterwards had the call to say the op had been cancelled .
negative	telephoned immediately and was told the order could easily be cancelled - which it was .
negative	the flowers never arrived !
negative	but sadly you never made the re - fund you promised - it '_s been over a month .
negative	i '_d love to speak to you further about this if you '_d be kind enough to telephone me - my order number was wa000000 - you have my telephone_number on this order .
negative	( and don_'_t say you don_'_t have my number because it was on the same part of the form as my email address and you ' re happy to bombard me with them !)
negative	disgraceful !
negative	i am used to buy on line and i never ever had any problem until i found smartbuyglasses uk .
negative	i bought a ray_ban aviator from their website because they were the only company with the model i wanted .
negative	wrong decision !!!
negative	they actually sold me something that they did not have available in their stock , then days after , they sent me an_email_saying that they had " ordered " it from their supplier and it should take maximum 0_weeks .
negative	never happened !
negative	their costumer service kept sending me emails saying that the order had been dispatched but actually they did not had a tracking_number .
negative	no one could locate where the sunglasses were .
negative	after a month of no decent update or answer i had enough and requested the cancellation of the order and my refund .
negative	it was about a week_ago and so far no sign of my money .
negative	i sent another email to the company '_s costumer service asking when the refund will be provided and again , the unclear , non precise answers started .
negative	now , they claim that their system is down and their accountant department cannot deal with the refund right now but they will , asap .
negative	there is no telephone_number you can call , only one email address and that is it .
negative	after_reading the other reviews i learned that this company is not a uk company .
negative	apparently they are based in hong_kong !!!!
negative	i am so disgusted and upset about this situation that i decided i will deal with master card directly and hopefully get my money back from them .
negative	the only_thing i have to say is avoid !!!!!
negative	the worst experience ever !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i placed an order and received an_email to say they would be delivered on the 00th which was the date i requested , they have still not been delivered and this is the 00th , when i called to find out why i was told maybe the recipient wasn_'_t in and they would redeliver , i asked if this could be verified , i was then told because it was inverness they could take up to two_days for delivery !!
negative	surely when i put in the postcode this should have been flagged_up as other_florists do .
negative	i am not very happy as i have now missed giving the flowers on my cousins_birthday ie the 00th .
negative	i will never use this company again
negative	i personally will never use this company transferred money into my account £_000 . 00 on day 0 day 0 they took out £_00 . 00 day 0 they tried to take another payment my bank stopped it .
negative	i then get an_email from them saying why was payment refused by my bank customer service cannot_fault but my god they knew when my payday was for goodness_sake i was too scared to use any of the loan because as soon as i used my debit_card the next_day they tried to take more money off me so in four days they almost had more money back than i had borrowed !!!
negative	so wont use again thank tou
negative	got home earlier this week to find sainsburys delivery van blocking my drive .
negative	there was no need to do this as the house nextdoor where delivery was being made had a empty driveway and plenty of space .
negative	i asked the driver politely to move his van from my drive .
negative	the driver refused , i had a sick child in the car and even when i told him this he said " i had to be patient and wait !, i threatened to report him if he did not move and he said " report me then ", so i did .
negative	after 0_days i had had no response from customer_services so i called them again .
negative	they could find no trace of my complaint so i had to go through the whole_thing again !!!.
negative	the same day i received a call from the store where the delivery originated from ( calcot ), an_apology for the apalling behaviour of their driver and an assurance that the driver would be dealt_with !
negative	!
negative	bought two tri sets and only recieved one on 00th_september , have tried to contact both wowcher and the company i bought the sets from and still have recived no contact back !
negative	out of pocket quite a bit of money now !
negative	huge_disappointment and will be avoiding wowcher now as no contact from them when something does go_wrong !
negative	tried to book through aviva extras but the holiday_autos site had a fault on it which made it impossible to book online .
negative	so i reported it via_e_- mail and 0_days_later it was still not fixed .
negative	so rather_than use their 00p a minute number , i used a uk number ( 00000_000000 ) supplied by their customer_services department .
negative	when i said about the aviva corporate discount , they said they did not have one and refused to honour the price via our aviva site ( the fault came after that ) and to add_insult to injury said if i found another company who could give that price they would match it .
negative	this is a fake site .
negative	i placed my order , they took my money and then nothing .
negative	they have no phone_call and emails responses are automated stating they don_'_t answer on may holidays .
negative	this is a scam .
negative	i have lost my money and am worried_about the security of the transaction .
negative	this is a company based in china .
negative	00ft by 0ft pvc goalpost .
negative	got this for son for christmas .
negative	first goalpost had faulty connectors and wrong number of parts .
negative	returned to shop who said that if wanted a replacement , would have to pay an extra £_00 as it had gone up in price .
negative	really annoyed , but as it was a present and son desperate for new goal went along with it .
negative	the salisbury store didn_'_t have it in stock , so had to go back again , when product eventually came in .
negative	have just tried to assemble this goalpost .
negative	such poor quality : cross ections would not go very far into the corner connectors , so kept fally apart .
negative	only two of the connectors were able to hold the pvc poles together without them spinning round .
negative	last_straw was fitting the net on ------- the pvc corner connectors fractured .
negative	do not buy this product .
negative	it is such poor quality .
negative	back to the shop we go .
negative	wonder what the customer service will be like .
negative	do not use this company to buy or rent a house , even if your life were to depend_on it ; if i could of put less_than 0_star , i would have .
negative	i '_ve had the worst experience with them , they charged me and my 0 friends £_000_pounds each to check our credit - we ' re only students , we don_'_t have any credit to check !
negative	and even had the cheek to write on the invoice ' vat for credit check £_00 '!
negative	they made us get our own keys_cut from the one set they had ( even_though they should of had 0 ) and even had the cheek to ask us for them back at the end of our tenancy .
negative	when it came to vacating we wanted our damage deposit back (£_000 ) to which we were told there was a back log and they '_d sort it out , we rung multiple_times to be told we '_d be rung back about it , surprise , surprise , they never did !
negative	they ignored emails and even tried to fob us off with excuses about the money such as the landlord might have it , until we persisted and finally got a straight answer that they '_d given the money to the landlord .
negative	the people that work there are completely_useless and don_'_t seem to know what they are doing ; they are also rude and unprofessional .
negative	all they care about is getting as much money off you as possible and not caring about anything_else - beware !
negative	i purchased a pair of ray_ban wayfarer on 00 / 00 /_0000 and was really pleased when i received an_email the next_day saying that my purchase had been shipped .
negative	the sunglasses arrived in around 0_days which was fantastic !
negative	however , even_though the website is a . co . uk website , these sunglasses have been shipped to me from hong_kong - which made me doubt my purchase straight_away .
negative	when i opened the package the sunglasses were in perfect_condition and came with authenticity etc but the lense size was smaller_than i had expected .
negative	at this point i wasn_'_t particularly bothered , and wanted to simply exchnage the sunglasses for the same style and colour , but just with the larger lens option .
negative	so i went abck on to the website to try and find a telephone_number to contact them on .
negative	no such luck .
negative	there is no contact number on the whole website !
negative	so i had to write an_email to thier customer service email address and hope for the best .
negative	i received an_automated_response email when i sent my first query to customerservice @ smartbuyglasses . co . uk which was nice , just notifying_me that they had received my email , and would be in touch shortly .
negative	now ..... 00 days after receiving this item and 00 emails later sent to customerservice @ smartbuyglasses . co . uk and servicemanager @ smartbuyglasses . co . uk i still do not have a returns merchandise number for my purchase ( en0000000000g ).
negative	i find this rude , disrespectful and outright unacceptable for an online company .
negative	i honestly wish i had just bought these sunglasses from a highstreet retailer , and at_least i would know where they had come from , and would have a point of call for any_queries i might have regarding the purchase - for the sake of saving £_00 !
negative	i have never received such appaulingly low levels of customer service , and i will not be purchasing from your website again , and certainly will not be recommending you to anybody .
negative	i don_'_t usually_write online reviews about these sort of things but your lack of communication has made me realise that you seem to respond to complaints on trustpilot . co . uk and not via your customer service email address .
negative	regards
negative	unhappy customer
negative	unfortunately , i could not post this review without giving them 0_star .
negative	seemed like they were offering a good deal .
negative	paid for my line rental up front .
negative	for some reason ( i '_ll probably never find out in this lifetime ), they could not port my existing number across so they cancelled the tv engineer '_s visit .
negative	all i got was a text saying the visit had been cancelled , no explanation .
negative	then i had to do the thing that i dreaded most , call their customer_services several_times , probably about 00 .
negative	their customer service advisors are amazingly rude .
negative	as far as i '_m concerned they have reached rock_bottom & have started to dig .
negative	they must set themselves very low standards & consistently fail to achieve them .
negative	the upshot of this round of them talk talking at me was that i would have to cancel the contract & set_up a new one .
negative	they sent out a welcome_pack that had the wrong price breakdown so guess_what ?
negative	i had to phone customer_services again .
negative	spoke to 0 people who hung_up on me .
negative	spoke to a third person ( in india , i '_m guessing ) & then got put through to her supervisor in the phillipines .
negative	someone in india asking you to hold for 0 minutes equates to 00 uk minutes .
negative	the last phone_call was over an_hour & i '_ve now been promised a refund for the line rental that i paid in_advance .
negative	to tell you the truth , the whole_experience has stressed me out beyond imagination , they literally have reduced me to tears .
negative	all i wanted to do was buy something off them , i was a potential customer & they have treated me insanely badly .
negative	who_knows what they treat their customers like , once you are lcked into a contract .
negative	stay away & go with a reputable provider who has uk_based call_centres .
negative	order over 0_weeks_ago .
negative	email to say dispatched 00 days ago .
negative	still not received .
negative	enquired to ask for update as to where my order was , automated_response , repeat of original dispatch date .
negative	will give it until tomorrow then may well cancel and hopefully get a refund .
negative	would never order from here again .
negative	my husband is a physio and quite_frankly this lot could give physios a bad name .
negative	i '_m sick of groupon .
negative	it seems they are now scraping the barrel to get companies to sign up to offer a deal .
negative	i have purchased several deals in the past .
negative	o spa never delivered , groupon didn_'_t want to know and refused to refund .
negative	other beauty deals reasonable but staff moan_about how badly groupon treats them so you end up feeling bad for them and giving a huge tip so no discount there then , restaurants - hit & miss , usually struggling businesses trying to drum up business and when you get your meal you know why .
negative	now it seems to be only indian restaurants offering deals .
negative	my biggest gripe is when a company fails to honour groupon don_'_t want to know .
negative	i find now that many of the deals and available cheaper on amazon , ebay or online .
negative	i '_ve also used kgb_deals , no_problems getting customer support or refunds with them .
negative	i '_m totally sick of repeatedly watching the same ads every time i want to skip on .
negative	i understand itv is reliant on advertisers but i get so infuriated it makes me never want to shop or buy from those suppliers .
negative	ok , play ads at the beginning of the show but then allow the user to skip them thereafter .
negative	hate hate hate it player , a complete_waste of time .
negative	we have just printed our tickets for brussels airlines and find that we are not going to get meals which ebookers said we will be having on their confirmation .
negative	just had a lengthy conversation with an ebooker customer service rep and after being put on hold for a while was then told i have to fill in a form on their website and attach the confirmation they sent us the form and it will be investigated .
negative	we are flying first thing in the morning !
negative	i know i for one will never use ebookers again and i haven_'_t even taken off yet !!
negative	!
negative	the first thing i thought a bit off , was when i first ordered on the website .
negative	their email stated they were confirming an offer to buy , and would let_me know if my order was accepted !
negative	there was no message_telling_me that the curtains i had ordered were out of stock .
negative	when i tried to track the order , it said " dispatched " but i didn_'_t receive them .
negative	when i started asking where they were i was told there was a delay .
negative	but not before i had asked several_times .
negative	i particularly_liked the pattern , so persevered , then found the next size was in stock so ordered them and asked for a refund on the other items .
negative	these have eventually arrived !
negative	several weeks from first order !
negative	i can '_t_believe these people , i ordered two game codes that stated available ..... at 0 am friday it '_s now 0 pm and they still_haven_'_t arrived despite_being told 0 - 0 hours .
negative	these are steam gift codes for my two sons , as it '_s easter_holidays here .
negative	i will have to hope paypal can get me a refund as i don_'_t think gamekeys0u . net care at all .
negative	they certainly are not helpful with messages , just told to check junk !
negative	as if .
negative	i wouldn_'_t do that already .
negative	beware when changing to this company haven_'_t had a bill for 0_months and they want to put my payments up think they bit off more than they can chew
negative	i rejected my order and yet u still have not returned my phone and sent me a cheque wish i have not cashed due to the fact i want my phone back that is why the order was rejected !!
negative	!
negative	very disappointed with the entire service provided by towelsrus .
negative	the embroidery on the back of the dressing_gown was thin and patchy and generally poor .
negative	apparently that '_s ' normal ' - can '_t_believe people would accept embroidery for that .
negative	had to fight for a refund - was initially offered a refund for the embroidery .
negative	eventually they agreed to refund the total .
negative	it then took 0_days from the day they got the goods back to process the refund .
negative	not so hot .
negative	went elsewhere and had exceptional service from_start to finish .. and there was definitely enough thread used in the embroidery to avoid patches .
negative	would never recommend
negative	website gives false_information on parts and the call_centre when questioned on the confusing information seemingly also have no clue .
negative	sent out a part that when opened we found a letter of complaint from a previous customer in the box .
negative	with all his order , name and contact details on .
negative	the part was also completly the wrong piece .
negative	very unprofessional .
negative	the product i ordered unfortunately didn_'_t arrive next_day deliver as i paid_extra 0_* i will be requiring a refund 0_*.
negative	the failure to deliver on time was due to computer problems , pity as i didn_'_t get the battery_charger i could not take my camera on holiday 0_* apart_from this technical glitch i found the product as_described , did the it was designed for & was a fraction of the price of other_suppliers products . 0_*
negative	i will be using buyspares . co . uk again 0_*
negative	i sent for x box with 0 games x box came minus the games very sad after my friend recommened it to me
negative	after_searching for several days on ebookers to find the right hotel for my three nights away with my husband i thought i '_d found the perfect one the rutland hotel in the isle of man seemed to fit our needs perfectly .
negative	the hotel had good activites which is what i look for .
negative	after booking i was showing the reviews on trip_adviser for my husband he comented ther wasn_'_t any pictures of indoor pool , health club , exercise gym and golf , and when i checked it hadn_'_t got any of them .
negative	i rang ebookers and spent about 00_minutes on my phone after_speaking to three diffrent people all the would say is " can i point out the clause at the bottom which says that if the services cant be used its not our fault ".
negative	i understand if there was a pool and somthing had happened that prevented us from using it ..
negative	but come on none of the above services existed at this hotel , completely falct advertising , would never use ebookers again and i wouldn_'_t advise anyone to use the service
negative	unfortunately after a first poor experience with silver_shuttle i returned again for another booking .
negative	i had hoped my experience may have been a one off with the original driver but unfortunately this was not to be the case .
negative	we had booked a pick_up from heathrow .
negative	the driver was extremely rude , was difficult to find the driver in the airport , with no sign posting the pick_up service .
negative	the flight was 00_minutes delayed and he so was irate by the time we managed to find him , he began being very aggressive and informed me that i was lying that the flight had been delayed .
negative	even_though clearly on the arrival screen it confirmed this .
negative	he went on to tell me that he now had to pay more for the parking .
negative	after this confrontation with the driver , i did not feel comfortable getting in the car with the driver .
negative	silver_shuttle did refund my booking , however , unfortunately with 0 extremely poor experiences with the company i can no_longer trust the drivers they employ .
negative	the customer service team have been fantastic , and its a shame this experience with the drivers is no replicated .
negative	a more robust hiring process and screening would be beneficial for the company .
negative	bad service don_'_t get any thing frm here
negative	sent my iphone 0 for new screen paid for special next - day delivery 00000 said it had been sent on friday 00 july but wasn_'_t delivered on 00th as it should have been .
negative	then they said it had been sent on 00 july but still no sign and now they don_'_t know when it was sent and can '_t give me a tracking order so what does that say .
negative	i need my phone it '_s vital
negative	despite the fact that delivery address is an_independent , off - campus house with its own street address , at all times accessible and occupied , serenata decided to take the flowers to the postroom of the college ( not the address i gave them ) as a result they arrived on monday three_days after my daughter '_s birthday and were dried up .
negative	despite a great deal of patient explanation from me serenata refuse to say that in future they will deliver them to the street address as given .
negative	ok , so i live in a rural house , up a hill along a mile long dirt_track .... however , it is drivable ... yet regularly have issues when anyone sends me items via yodel ... not impressed !
negative	i placed my order before 0pm and i paid for delivery within 0 to 0_days .
negative	unfortunately , the order was not actioned until the following_day .
negative	therefore , i did not receive my goods in time .
negative	i feel that i have been conned_into paying a high delivery charge .
negative	i won_'_t be using this site again .
negative	after trying to contact opodo on the phone many_times ( racking up a huge phone bill ) regarding my booking , emailing them several_times , tweeting them , i have had no response from them at all .
negative	i consequently wrote a letter of complaint , sent to the address on their website .
negative	this was sent back my royal_mail .
negative	does anyone know how to get through to them ?
negative	?
negative	ordered flowers to be delivered on 00th_feb to my wife '_s workplace , only to find out they have just been delivered today at about 0 . 00 - over 00_hours late !
negative	to make it worse , we left home yesterday for a long weekend so the flowers are sat at her work so she won_'_t see them alive !
negative	plus it was also her_birthday yesterday .
negative	how embarrassing , not so much for me ( i '_m just a little furious ) but certainly embarrassing for her .
negative	i feel really bad but its certainly not my fault .
negative	i ordered the flowers in plenty of time ( monday 00th ) and paid_extra for the before 0pm delivery .
negative	i followed iflorists ticket complaint procedure but as yet , no response .
negative	and cannot get through via phone .
negative	iflorist - please issue a full_refund so that something can be salvaged from all this .
negative	i did try to ask via your website but have been forced to ask on a public_forum as this seems the only way that encourages you to respond .
negative	thanks ( i hope ) in_advance for your response .
negative	habe blumen bestellt fuer meine oma , keine lieferung aber bezahlung gerne angenommen .
negative	habe kundenservice angeschrieben und online eine beschwerde gemeldet .
negative	kundenservice war prompt und sehr nett , hat sich entschuldigt , " waehrend der bestellung ist ein technischer fehler aufgetreten " und hat den blumenversand fuer den naechsten tag organisiert .
negative	florist hat adresse nicht gefunden und musste zweimal meine oma anrufen ( 00 jahre !)
negative	und checken wo sie wohnt .
negative	0 tage nach bestellung erhalte ich heute eine antwort von meiner online beschwerde ob ich meine bestellnummer haette .... gluecklicherweise waren die_blumen nicht fuer einen bestimmten anlass .
negative	i bought a canon_eos 0000d twin lens kit costing_£_000 . 00 , i was told it would take 0 - 0_days for it to be processed and then promised 0 - 0_days for delivery .
negative	after 0_days , it still hadn_'_t been processed .
negative	after_reading_reviews that 00_% of customers would never buy from them i was starting to understand_why .
negative	i needed the camera delivered within 00 days so i could have it for my holiday i was going on .
negative	and at that rate it didn_'_t look like that would happen , so i cancelled my order after finding the same kit at argos ( for £_00 more ) but i trusted them and they delivered it in 0_days so i had it for my holiday .
negative	but the getting the refund was a nightmare !
negative	i told simply_electronics i wanted to cancel my order , they emailed back saying they would update my delivery to express and give me a free 0 - in - 0 lens cleaner .
negative	so i emailed again say no , i want to cancel it , not get free stuff .
negative	so they said yes , it ’ ll be canceled in up to 00 days at the most .
negative	00 days_later , no refund .
negative	i emailed them again .
negative	it '_ll be sorted in 0 - 0_days .
negative	was it ?
negative	no .
negative	another email and they said it would be with me soon .
negative	in all my refund took 0_weeks to be transferred , i nearly ended_up paying the bill of £_000 . 00 because of how bad a service they had .
negative	so i '_ll never buy from them and i ’ ve told family and friends not to , so just splash_out the slight extra money and be happy with the knowledge that you will get your item !
negative	definitely recommend this company .
negative	speedy delivery and good customer service , very rare_these days .
negative	i think that booking with late rooms is ok but i found that the price they give you is not much of a saving i paid £_000 for bb but their price would have been £_000 so saving £_00 not much of a saving not worth going through you .
negative	also the guest_house was not very good not worth £_00 a room £_00 is nearer the mark i think the hotel inspector should visit the staff can hardly speak_english and you have to explain what you want for breakfast and they still get it wrong . not impressed
negative	first time using the online delivery service and maybe my last , estimated 00 pounds online shopping receipt was 000_pounds , 00_quid of it was for 00 tubs ( they didn_'_t deliver 00 tubs ) of ice_cream i didn_'_t even order , called customer_services and was told they '_d call tomorrow ?
negative	y tomorrow ??
negative	y not sort it now ?
negative	then ill have to wait 0_days for money to return to my account ... come on sainsburys not good !!
negative	!
negative	so after receiving an_email_saying my order had been cancelled because of my payment details , which were correct and my bank_account had plenty money in it .
negative	i contacted them via_twitter and facebook only to see a status posted which was basically rude saying that all messages to themselves should be dealt_with privately , i private messaged them and they ignored it for a day !
negative	but when i tweeted them again , they responded within ten_minutes ?
negative	lol .
negative	anyway , the man i spoke to said my refund was being_processed , and this was while i was out of the house .
negative	i came home that night to a delivery card saying hermes attempted delivery but would return the day after .
negative	when the day after my order arrived i was fuming .
negative	after dealing_with their awful customer service , i realised that them saying my refund was being_processed was a complete lie given my order was being delivered the same day i was supposedly getting my money back .
negative	i '_m beyond irritated by the way i was treated and will never use your site again , and will be telling friends and family to avoid also unless they wish to be treated with complete disrespect .
negative	and just to add , i didn_'_t get petty over a five_pound order , i spent over sixty pounds .
negative	even_though i have had confirmation via_e_mail and text that my flowers have been delivered they are no way to be seen .
negative	i have tried_calling but the number seems to be disconnected and i have tried to complete the online contact firm but it will not allow me to submit .
negative	the money has_been taken out of my account and i am so worried i have had to cancel my card .
negative	please do not use this company !
negative	we ordered from this company on the 00th_september with a 0 working day delivery .
negative	it is now the 0th_oct and no sign of our goods .
negative	trying to contact them is a nightmare , their web_site won_' let you send a message no phone number to contact and when i finally found one it a premium_rate number at !, 00 per_minute to use .
negative	i don_'_t know who writes 0_star reviews but it '_s the worst internet company i have ever dealt_with .
negative	do not use this company
negative	eon worked out my new direct_debit payment estimating that i will need to pay £_00 . 00 per_month to keep me covered .
negative	this was despite he fact that my most expensive winter_months usage this past year was no more than £_00 . 00 for december , january and february .
negative	robbery !
negative	!
negative	sold a i phone 0 to them on the 00nd of march_0000 then was knocked down by £_00 because they said it had a cracked_screen and was water_damaged asked them to look again as it was not sent like that they put the offer up by £_00 so i declined it , supposed to have sent it back today is now 00th_may and i still have no phone and no money they have told me they will make me a payment on the 00st_may this company is a disgrace dont use them
negative	once again my poor customer glasyn ices has received a battered box , i specifically checked that this carton left the warehouse in a good condition and by the time it arrived at the delivery depot it was battered and barely resembling a box and tins inside dented .
negative	there are export quality cartons that have been shipped all the way from india and i have not received problems before with any other customers .
negative	its really is not good enough !
negative	every delivery you do for this customer the same thing happens .
negative	phone me with what you intend to do and treat this as an official_complaint .

negative	i bought some products via_groupon_vouchers , as some other people did , rubbish quality for a £_00 luxury duvet , returned it immediately and its been over 0_months_ago and never got a refund .
negative	also added to my order few other things which i never got but i was charged !!
negative	!
negative	no customer service , never reply to emails , no phone number , rang groupon and even them didnt have a contact telephone no .
negative	unacceptable !
negative	dont_waste your money !
negative	i had a contract with them for 0 years and i would never ever go back to them again .
negative	i was supposed to get £_00 cashback after 0_months and went to the shop , as its just round the corner from where i live , i took the bill requested and they processed it for me .
negative	few_minutes later i received a text_message on my phone saying that they received the bill required for the cash_back and that i would get a cheque within 00 days .
negative	more than a month has passed and went back to the shop , showed the text_message to a member of staff and after checking they said they never received the bill and that it was too late to process it again as it had to be done exactly after 0_months .
negative	total_rip_off !!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	also same contract after paying 00 months insurance my phone was lost / stolen at a funfair , got the police report , rang them and they said the insurance wouldnt cover .
negative	paid about £_000 insurance , phone worth £_00 . also never got a copy of the phone insurance so didnt even know what i was paying for !
negative	my friend had bad_experience with them as well so i would never recommend them .
negative	i placed an order for £_00 end of aug and never got it .
negative	i tried to contact so many_times and never got a reply .
negative	total_scam !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	do not buy !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i will report them as everyone else did .
negative	i think everyone should .
negative	i cant_believe the website is still online after so many people reported they never received their orders .
negative	hopefully paypal will help .
negative	i had recently used nationals service before when needing a new tyre and had no_problems so thought it was a good idea to use again for my mot .
negative	the mot failed which is fair_enough as it stated on the mot sheet that i had a seized shock absorber .
negative	nation then told me that they could not fix this problem for me .
negative	so i took it to another garage and had the shock absorbers replaced this other garage informed me that i had a bent back axle ( which national had not found on their mot ) i then took it back to national to have the retest .
negative	i was then informed that it had failed again .
negative	the people at national said they were going to try and free the seized part ( as it was still not fixed ) they then began to hit my car with a sledge hammer and used a blow torch they then had 0 of their men bouncing up and down in the boot of my car .
negative	they could not get the part freed .
negative	the man then told me of another garage that may be able to help he wrote down on a piece of paper that it was the suspension arm that was seized ( although this was not what we was told on the first mot ).
negative	on leaving the test centre i was told that i should try driving my car up and down the curb to see if that frees the seized part .
negative	....
negative	i am very angry and disappointed in this as i would not have spent the money ( that i had to borrow if a family_member ) on replacing the shock absorbers if it was not going to fix the problem .
negative	also i have now had to registered my car off road and not use it as when the car was took home i could clearly see that my car had lowered at the back after the work the garage had done .
negative	no delivery , tracking a joke , 00mins wait on customer service , sales answer on second ring .
negative	no replies to mails .
negative	wish i had read_reviews before ordering , the web is full of dissatisfied_customers .
negative	do not order from them !
negative	i arrange to work from home for the day for our sofa delivery , which consisted of 0items .. 0sofas and a footstall .
negative	only 0 sofa turned_up ..
negative	no customer service number available to call ..
negative	cannot keep being at home so extremely fed_up with poor customer service
negative	after messing up my order 0 times , i decided to ask for a refund , they now do not respond to any correspondence .
negative	disappointed and wont_be using them again
negative	i placed the order on 00 / 00 and payment went through via_paypal .
negative	i waited all week for the order to arrive but after 0_days i decided to contact pharmacy0u and find out what was happening .
negative	i was then told , quite casually , that the products had been_discontinued and if i wanted to receive part of the order i would have to pay separately !
negative	why didn_'_t a member of staff email or call me to inform_me of this ?
negative	instead i was left waiting for items that were never going to arrive ( and that i really needed !)
negative	when i asked why no one had let_me know , i was not given an answer and the members of staff just said they were sorry for any inconvenience ( no explanation for the shocking service ).
negative	the funds were then stuck in paypal as pending and i have only just received them back in my account .
negative	really bad_experience and needless to say i will not be using pharmacy0u again and certainly won_'_t recommend them !
negative	first time ordering from zazzle and the last .
negative	i only ordered a card which from other_sites would take 0 - 0_days delivery but with zazzle it took 00 .
negative	the card itself is a let_down , bigger on the front than the back and the colours are wishy_washy , its not as nice as on the website .
negative	they don_'_t tell you the delivery timescale or cost until you get to checkout but after_spending a very long time selecting then personalising it you just feel you have to hope for the best .
negative	i thought they must just be covering themselves and it would arrive at_least within a week at most .
negative	i also ordered another personalised card from a different website on the same day 0nd and that arrived on 0th and its beautiful , vibrant_colours , just stunning exceeding my expectations .
negative	i have now ordered another personalised one from them this morning to replace the zazzle one which is unusable and i have just received the dispatched email from them on the same day ( very well_known high_street store begins with m but their personalised card section of the website )
negative	i should also add the small card from zazzle cost almost £ 0 to be delivered from uk , the other website cost £ 0 . 00 for a large card and fast delivery .
negative	why do people waste thier money on such shoddy service and over priced delivery charges
negative	i '_m never one to complain however for my poorly nan '_s birthday i payed more money than usual to get some flowers for her when they arrived they was nothing like the picture they where nothing like the flowers i ordered i payed for a large bunch and the flowers where very small and drab looking i tried_emailing the company and still have no reply i would never ever recommend this company the service was poor !
negative	sarah
negative	i ordered flowers on sunday for delivery on tuesday .
negative	it is now thursday and flowers have not been delivered .
negative	i have phoned and emailed multiple_times and have been fobbed_off .
negative	i usually use marks &_spencer who provide excellent customer service and have always delivered .
negative	on this one occasion i thought i would try prestige_flowers as their website looks impressive ... what a mistake !
negative	they only_thing they guarantee is taking your money .
negative	i wanted to speak to a manager but there is not one that i could speak to - they can only escalate my request and they " should " call me back !
negative	i dread to think if the flowers do get delivered that if they had been made on monday , what they look like !
negative	use a trusted florist or better still marks &_spencer .
negative	on arrival at malaga_airport and checking in at the viajes urbis desk we were directed to an underground car_park and an extremely packed and large coach .
negative	alarm_bells started to ring .
negative	the local supplier quick travel ( more about that later ) on first_impression appeared to have only one coach to cover the length of the costa_del sol .
negative	as we were staying in estepona this meant that we were on the coach for around 0 . 0 hours after finally leaving the airport .
negative	we spent forever touring around the large resorts at the airport end of the coast before finally heading further along to the smaller resorts .
negative	it should be said that before we even left the airport we sat on the bus for nearly an_hour with no air_conditioning in extremely high temperatures .
negative	i was genuinely_concerned for the large number of elderly people on the coach , who were clearly struggling .
negative	on arrival at numerous hotels there was no_indication of who should be getting off as hotel signage not visible at drop_off points .
negative	the driver wasn_'_t communicating any information and as a result meant a ridiculous number of people getting on and off the bus to check if it was their hotel or not .
negative	when we were eventually deposited in estepona we were left thoroughly unimpressed with the arrival transfer , however worse was yet to come .
negative	when we phoned to check our pick_up time the day before_departure we were informed that we would be picked_up 0 hours ( yes , that '_s right 0 hours ) prior to our flight time ( for a road journey of approx .
negative	00_minutes to the airport from estepona ).
negative	i subsequently spent the whole of the second last day unsuccessfully trying to contact emergency and assistance numbers to try to negotiate a more sensible pick_up time .
negative	when i did finally speak to someone he was spectacularly unhelpful , admitted that yes there was only one coach picking_up for the whole length of the costa_del sol and that we could realistically expect to be on the coach for between 0 - 0 hours .
negative	( again to clarify for a trip to an airport 00_mins_away ).
negative	after i had stopped laughing and told him that we would not be boarding the coach 0 hours before flight time and to expect us not to be at the pick_up point unless they were willing to be more sensible about the transfer , he hung_up on me .
negative	on the morning of the transfer home the bus did indeed turn_up and we then received a call from reception to say that the driver was waiting !!!
negative	we asked the reception staff to send him on his 0 hour journey without us .
negative	my mum and i decided to share the 000_euros cost of a taxi to the airport and got there in 00_mins flat , enjoying an extra few hours in the resort and not stuck on the coach from hell .
negative	the short_break was a chance for my mum to relax in the sun following a long period of ill_health and treatment , so to spend the last day on the phone and worrying_about the prospect of cutting our short_break even shorter to sit on a coach for 0 hours was galling to say the least .
negative	so the moral of this very long_story is that i will not be using resorthoppa again anytime_soon .
negative	the funniest part of it all was that the local agent used by resorthoppa is called ' quick travel '....
negative	i know !!!......
negative	shocking overall experience and left out of pocket into the bargain .
negative	very , very poor and would urge_anyone to look elsewhere for transfers .
negative	i rang to book for four people to new_york plus hotel wastold the price would be 0000 . then i was told if i booked two people 0st because they would deff sit togerther on the plane i said ok , then he came to book the other two people then the price went up by 000pounds i was not happy i was told i could cancel the booking for the 0st two the customer_sevices said i would have to wait 00days to get my money back , so i told them to book the other two which cost 000pounds more i was speaking to them today and they have offerd me 000 back which i am not happy about regards jeanette
negative	what a rip_off this company are .
negative	my son booked a holiday with them and rang me last night to say he was asked to leave the hotel as alpharooms had cancelled his hotel .
negative	i rang them and was informed they had changed the hotel a few_weeks back .
negative	checked his emails - nothing from alpha_rooms .
negative	eventually checked his junk_mail and there was one from a company called bookout informing him of a change to hotel as marco polo overbooked .
negative	son then went to new hotel which was not in the area he wanted , was a dump and to top it all there was nothing booked in his name !
negative	!
negative	went back to marco polo hotel and paid himself to stay there as they did have rooms !
negative	rang company asking for refund due to their cock up .
negative	have spent three hours on phone now and still not getting a refund .
negative	they are taking £_000 cancelation fee for the three nights he didn_'_t stop in a hotel that wasn_'_t booked in the first place .
negative	great idea for a business if you have no conscience and totally arrogant .
negative	customer service is diabolical , they just repeat themselves until they wear you down .
negative	i was told that if i did not accept this offer and let things drag on it would cost me more money ,.
negative	i will take this further as i don_'_t see why companies like this should be able to just rip people off and think the won_'_t do anything about it .
negative	bag arrived broken .
negative	stud missing off the bottom with tape stuck across it so the fault was known before it was sent .
negative	paint coming off the zip .
negative	mess bag and changing_bag also missing .
negative	i fail to see how anyone packing this product would think it was ok to send like this !
negative	they obviously do not care .
negative	i will not purchase anything from your store again .
negative	i had lasik intralase wavefront performed on both of my eyes in february_0000 and an enhancement , but lets call it a correction in october_0000 and have regretted that decision ever_since .
negative	whilst on paper the procedure was a ' success ', as my vision has_been improved , it has now been over 00 months and i am still suffering from severe dry_eye and struggle every day as a result of this .
negative	every_single day i have to deal with my eyes stinging and feeling achy and tired .
negative	eye_drops have become part of my everyday_life .
negative	i have also been left with eye floaters which are a daily frustration given that my work is 000_% computer_screen based , and that is when they are visible constantly .
negative	i am simply being told to ignore them , but to anyone who_understands what persistent eye floaters are , you will know that is simply not a option .
negative	nice bright summer days are no_longer enjoyable to me due to becoming light sensitive , i often find myself wearing sunglasses on a relatively dull day to help with the floaters and brightness sensitivity .
negative	my vision fluctuates constantly and although i am told i have 00 / 00 vision , this does not mean the same as perfect vision as i was led to believe pre_- lasik .
negative	often reading text comes in and out of focus , and i have lost clarity / sharpness of my vision .
negative	i truly believe that within 0 year i shall be back to wearing contact_lenses .
negative	i have also been left with start bursts / halos at night , which had made night time driving impossible .
negative	this procedure cost me a staggering_£_0k , i may as well of thrown that money in a bin .
negative	having this surgery truly has affected my life immensely as i now suffer from high anxiety and often get depressed about my situation .
negative	anyone considering this procedure should really do their research as the side_effects really can ruin your life .
negative	you only get one pair of eyes , appreciate them , they are precious , it '_s really not worth the risk !
negative	if only i could turn back time i would walk out of that surgery room with my eyes unharmed !
negative	i recently sent flowers to friends in south_africa .
negative	firtsly , i realised i had made a mistake on the message , e_- mailed interfflora within minutes of the purchase to ask if the message could be rectified ( there was an extra letter at the end of a name ) and was told this wasn_'_t possible even_though the flowers and message were to be delivered in a week '_s time .
negative	i was also asked if i wanted a text_message notification of delivery , to which i answered yes .
negative	i have yet to receive notification and had to ask my friends if they had received the flowers .
negative	i was not pleased with my order at all ... the stickers . where too small there for we are not able to use for . buisness ....
negative	i am very upset and very unsatisfied with my order ...
negative	booked a taxi to take me to the airport , pre_- paid online as thought would be easier .
negative	the taxi never showed up and when i called they had no record of this booking - they still took the £_00 from my account even through the taxi never arrived and have not replied to my emails since .
negative	this company is to be avoided in my opinion .
negative	i have used wowcher twice .
negative	both_times the deals were misleading , listing things that weren_'_t included in the price , and both experiences were disappointing .
negative	recently i contacted wowcher three_times about a problem , this was over the course of a month and they never replied .
negative	i have nothing good to say about wowcher , don_'_t use them .
negative	i like many people i see before me , are in a battle to get my money back .
negative	i returned an item that was too small 0_days after i bought it i sent it back re ; the courier company use .
negative	0_weeks_later still no refund i have contacted them several_times and all i can say is if you pay peanuts you get monkeys , because clearly their staff do not know what they are doing .
negative	i have given them all the information they have asked for but they seem to be incapable of imputing numbers into a computer correctly .
negative	as when the courier company got back to them the number was wrong no one bothered to contact me to let_me know .
negative	i have now rung them again and have given the info again i have also contacted my credit_card company and they are going to launch there own investigation now .
negative	so here we are , i '_m still out of pocket they are laughing as they have my money and the item and this seems to be a trend with them i think will contact watchdog about this company and their policies .
negative	we had worked with groupon on and off for 0 years and to start with even_though we were paying a lot for the advertising we got quite good expose so we just ignored the cost but as time has_gone on , the service they provide has got worst we have had to wait weeks to get paid and this after they have had the money from our clients weeks if not months before hand , no business provides a service and then should have to wait weeks to get paid and then only after threatening legal_action do we get paid .
negative	and to add_insult in injury there staff seem to think they can tell us what we should or shouldn_'_t do and expect us to work for free , why they reap the rewards .
negative	we own our business and paid them for advertising that is all .
negative	when we dared to argue about what service we should offer they will argue with us and push us to keep lowering the price groupon are only interested in them selves not the partners and not the customers and the service they provide is disgusting .
negative	they seem to forget that without the businesses working with them and the customers buying the goods and services there would be no groupon they should try remembering that .
negative	very dissapointing and stressful experience .
negative	now will be acostly endeavour to get my gig tickets in time tomorrow
negative	so i have just signed_up to talk_talk thinking they were the best .
negative	you get to the end of it all and the installation date .
negative	ok so i have to wait for the phone line and then find out that the broadband which you have to install yourself - that in itself is rubbish , with virgin they come along and are friendly and nice and install it all for you , anyway you cant watch the tv or use broadband until the phone line is installed .
negative	crap - not a good start
negative	was put off by the website , quite tricky to make a booking .
negative	unfortunately my order was not even placed with the carrier , and i am still_waiting for my refund !
negative	result - no collection , no refund , wasted my time here , wont_be using again .
negative	one call .... to someone_else , more like !
negative	all looked good , website looked nice , parcel booked in with ease , although waiting for a collection is another story .... no show , myhermes said they would rebook when i called them , again another no show , so decided to cancel .
negative	result - no collection , full_refund , wasted my time here , wont_be using again .
negative	i recently did a project on comparing on - line parcel companies and here are my findings ..
negative	the dodgy website should have been enough to scare me away , no parcel collection , no response to my emails , no telephone support , no support at all .
negative	result - no collection , no refund , wasted my money here , wont_be using again .
negative	absolutely discussing service .
negative	i was let_down less_than 00 before i flew , i had to try and arrange another luxury car for my business trip .
negative	they did not do anything to help or offer me and alternative .
negative	i had to ring them to confirm my booking at which point i was told it was not going to be possible , at what point were they going to let_me know ?!!!!
negative	never again !
negative	i can recommend carhire0000 , they went out of there way to help me .
negative	i bought an item with a delivery schedule of 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	after waiting 0 working_days i contacted buydirect0u via_email and got an_email back saying that there had been an issue with stock .
negative	nobody thought to email , ring or contact me at all to let_me know that there would be a delay but i was told that it was in my local_depot would be delivered today .
negative	so i waited in all day and guess_what ..... it didnt arrive .
negative	customer service is very poor it took 00_hrs for somebody to email me back , you cannot track your order on their site and when i rang up their telephone system apparently suffered a technical fault as i was explaining my issues and went down .
negative	i only got a tracking_number after emailing them .
negative	do yourself a massive favour do not use this company .
negative	i am awaiting a refund and will review back again shortly .
negative	update ... to be fair the refund was very quick .. a word of advice to buydirect .
negative	just talk to your customers , keep them informed this way people will know where they stand .
negative	i would not of minded the wait if i had been told ......
negative	still disappointed overall .
negative	never answer the phone - didn_'_t have the stock .
negative	poor .
negative	i hate it when i accidentally enter the tesco website via a search_engine ( because i didn_'_t read the address under the google ad ) it locks me in and i have to shut_down my internet_explorer and re open safari and start my internet_search again very frustrating !!
negative	i will not use tesco . com under any circumstances as it freezes my computer , yet i have never had a problem with any other site .
negative	emailed them and they don_'_t even reply - very rude .
negative	our only local_supermarket finally opened up as a tesco the fruit and veg is always poor so have to travel 00 miles to exeter for sainsburys but will use as a convenience store if desperate .
negative	i spent an_hour trying to book flights through this site ; every time i got to payment after entering full details for 0 passengers , the site would fail .
negative	you couldn_'_t even tell if you '_d paid or not , it was so frustrating .
negative	eventually i booked directly through the air line website , which was much simpler and a lot_cheaper .
negative	don_'_t use opodo , it '_s a waste of your time .
negative	per farla breve : telefonate effettuate per avere una valutazione post preventivo , all ' incirca dieci .
negative	tentativi di inviare i documenti necessari che puntualmente non vengono ricevuti perché l ' e ' mail o il fax non funzionano ; all ' incirca 0 .
negative	da questa mattina non sono ancora riuscita a far pervenire a questa compagnia i documenti .
negative	sono le 0 di sera .
negative	come possano lavorare in queste condizioni ?
negative	per me è inspiegabile .
negative	mi augurerei che qualcuno internamente si ponga quest ' annosa domanda .
negative	i will never ever use them again and i strongly advice people to do the same .
negative	i ordered flowers for my sisters anniversary from the family .
negative	i chose really bright fresh colours , having seen the bouquet that was delivered it looked nothing like i ordered and 0_days after the delivery the flowers ( if you can call them that ) are virtually dead .
negative	there is mostly greenery with a few flowers in between .
negative	i have ordered from the site before ( different town ) and not had this problem .
negative	i contacted eflorist who told me they would get back to me and yet i have not received a call .
negative	considering the flowers cost £_00 ( including delivery ) i am absolutely_gutted .
negative	i bought redken anti snap from this website , the product wasn_'_t genuine and did nothing for my hair in fact made made hair so frizzy as though i '_ve_used no leave in condition .
negative	i think the products on this website are fake as i '_ve always bought this product from my salon and its worked_wonders for me .
negative	twice i have paid_extra for a next_day delivery only to find out the companies used yodel - i hate them they have their own agenda .
negative	how can we , the customer , convince the selling companies to stop using them .
negative	i ordered items on the 0th_july and never got them delivered .
negative	contacted them by email twice , i had no response , i then contacted by phone i was told my item was returned damaged a similar story to another user and a replacement was on its way .
negative	i sent another email complaint at the poor service and i then got an_email to say that the item was actually out of stock and i will be getting a full_refund .
negative	bit of a contradiction .
negative	i will let you make you own mind up whether to order from this company at your_own_risk !
negative	!
negative	to start off with , we had a terrible time finding where you were located , to the point we missed the tour we had paid for .
negative	once we ( 0 of us ) found you after the tour had left , you were very accommodating to allow us to go at a different time which was going to have to be after our 00 day bus_tour with another company to ireland & scotland .
negative	after that tour , we then went back to you at the designated time for the tour we had missed with you due to not being_able to locate the place of destination .
negative	the process you used on getting onto the bus with the papers , etc was very lengthy , but nevertheless we finally were on our way to windsor_castle .
negative	after arriving at our destination , we were then in a line specifically divided up for groups only .
negative	then the employees at windsor had to ask for our passes while standing in line and for some reason , your numbers and their numbers were not matching up causing us at_least a half hour delay .
negative	by the time we walked up to the castle and the time of their closing , we had very little time to see much .
negative	room for improvement on this tour would be the following :
negative	0 .
negative	better directions and info on how to find where your office and tour is located
negative	0 .
negative	the checking in process before boarding the bus and at the bus
negative	0 .
negative	the checking in at the palace
negative	0 .
negative	more time to tour the castle before closing , we lost at_least a half hour - one hour
negative	of time due to the inefficiency of all of the above .
negative	0 .
negative	if these above problems are not resolved , then the tour needs to start at_least 0 hour earlier for those who have paid to see such a fabulous place .
negative	one would be better off to take the train to the castle and go on their own and have plenty of time to see all that there is to see .
negative	in_spite of all this , i will say you tried to accommodate us when we missed the first tour .
negative	thank_you for allowing_us to get on at another time suitable to us .
negative	not a reliable delivery service ... scheduled delivery should have been 00st_march and i eventually contacted despatch company who had been holding it at their depot since that date making it 0days late !
negative	on their web_site it states that if you request a pick_up longer_than 00hrs notice then they will try and get their before 00 this did not happen and when speaking with a representative i was told i never seen this and i was wrong the female was very rude and abrupt and could not give me any info regarding pick_up , so i requested the number of the company being used and could not even give me there , and yet no secret i got the number from google , i spoke with a lady_who could not be more helpful and pleasant , well this was fruitless in the end as they did not even pick the parcel up , rude and abnoxious , stay away .
negative	bought a bunch for my mum in law and two flowers were snapped would not reccomend no food with flowers
negative	purchased a childrens play shed with a 00 year guarentee against rot .
negative	after just 0 years and it being on a slod base with a waterproof membrane on the floor bearers the floor is rotten and the rot speading up the shed .
negative	on contacting customer_services they state " the felt needs replacing ".
negative	i explained the rot was from the bottom and they now claim .
negative	as the shed isnt surrounded along the bearers by pea gravel preventing the rain splashing up onto the wood then i havent installed it correctly ."
negative	basically their childrens playhouse is rotting because the bearers have got wet and thats beacasue i have allowed it to rain on the shed !!!!!
negative	!
negative	how good is that , a shed thats designed for outdoor use but cannot get wet .
negative	customers services have said they will not do anything to help as i have allowed it to get wet its not their problem .
negative	avoid as the build quality is poor and the staff are rude and unhelpful .
negative	although the tom_tom was second_hand it wasnt checked as it needed a password andall the information was in polish
negative	worst company i have ever dealt_with ....
negative	ever !!!
negative	sent my phone on the 0th_june special delivery recieved by them on the 00th_june still no payment i called on friday 0th_july as i think i have given them more then enough time now to pay up , they told me the money would be in my account in the enxt 00hours .
negative	waited_until monday still not recieved called back on monday to be told the money would be in my account by 0pm that night it wasnt called tuesday again told i was the next in the que to be paid and it will be in my account by 0pm still not recieved called today and demanded i speak to the manager , at 00 . 00 i was advised he will call back within 00mins - called back at 00 . 00 to be advised the manager was on his lunch and will call me at 0 ; 00 , he still hadnt called me back at 0 . 00pm so i called again id been left a message on my phone whilst i was waiting for them to call me and it was a rather blazay " sorry for the confusion " the money will be in your account by the 00th_july for 0 what confusion ?
negative	and 0 00th_july 0_weeks after they recieved the phone ............. no when i got through to a advisor i was told the manager was in a meeting then that he was on the phone i advised i wasnt getting off the phone until i had spoke to the manager so to get him out of his " meeting " or off the phone_call he was on within 0mins i was speaking to the manager he blamed the slow service on technical_difficulties so i pointed_out all the review sites and reviews from a year_ago with the same kind of service - to which he told me i should take these review sites with a pinch of salt i work for appliances_online which has brilliant reviews on trust pillot so i advised this was utter_rubbish - ive demanded the money be in my account today but apparently there are a million other people in this que ...... to which i have told this manager to go and speak to the account department and fast track my payment - he is apparently calling me back tonight at 0pm - i very much doubt he will but guess_what il be calling back tommorrow !!
negative	!
negative	i will never use them again .
negative	they failed to collect the parcel , failed to rearrange for 0_days , would not give me my money back ( even the extra i paid for next_day delivery - which clearly didn_'_t happen .)
negative	on chat to customer_services for over half an_hour and still no apology .
negative	awful
negative	well what can i say !!
negative	pretty_much the same as everyone else !!
negative	ordered the bluebud 0inch tablet for a christmas_present , it has never arrived .
negative	i was issued a tracking code which when you use on royal mails website says " this item cannot be tracked untill its delivered " so that helps !!
negative	wowcher said maybe i could call royal_mail to let them know so they could improve their site !
negative	i have called bluebud 000s of times .
negative	always engaged .
negative	sent emails .
negative	never replied .
negative	have contacted wowcher god_knows_how many_times .
negative	they also never reply go calls of emails .
negative	so frustrating .
negative	last_week i had an_email askin me to review wowchers service and the item .
negative	hahah .
negative	probably not the best idea when i haven_'_t received it !
negative	funny enough .
negative	they didnt reply to that email within their 0 day time_scale .
negative	called last_week for a refund .
negative	" oh " " i shall pass this to the refunds team as they need to see if you have a valid reason for a refund ".
negative	0_days they said .
negative	guess_what !!
negative	yes !
negative	it '_s been 0 already !
negative	please steer well clear of wowcher and their not so amazing a deals .
negative	i '_m not sure about a wow a day .
negative	i would say its about time they called it a day !
negative	!
negative	it may seem like a good deal on the cover .
negative	but once you add up the constant phone_calls .
negative	your time .
negative	your patience and frustration .
negative	not to mention disappointed kids at christmas .
negative	please spend the extra on the high_street or reliable amazon / ebay .
negative	have now taken action with the small_claims court .
negative	thanks to my dad being a solicitor , its pretty easy .
negative	everybody should pursue this route .
negative	i ordered a 000gb ipod_classic online .
negative	it arrived after two_days but the ipod is corrupted and will not restore .
negative	i emailed cex but after two_days of no reply , i went to my local cex store .
negative	they were friendly and tried to be helpful but were unable to solve the problem .
negative	i am extremely disappointed at my service and agitated that i have received no response .
negative	unacceptable experience .
negative	very stressful experience buying from viagogo .
negative	booked tickets for lionel richie for my mams birthday on 00 . 00 . 00 and concert is tomorrow 00 . 00 . 00 and have still not received tickets or any email_confirmation that tickets are arriving which is the protcol that the website specifies is supposed to happen .
negative	contacted viagogo to no_avail as they blame sellers and only act as an agent .
negative	no further updates received and not kept in contact about tickets even_though when speaking to an advisor i was informed that they would look into it and call me back .
negative	would not receommend to anyone .
negative	not a happy experience .
negative	purchased as a present for my friend '_s 00th_birthday .
negative	however , despite someone being in all day the flowers did not arrive at her address .
negative	i received a text to say that the flowers were at her flat and had been left in a secure_location at the front of the property , in the porch .
negative	i complained to serenata and they said that they ' would look into it as a matter of urgency ' and i would hear in 00_hours - not really much use as they were a birthday_present , nor is 00_hours particularly ' urgent '.
negative	i pointed_out that the driver was clearly in error as the property '_s entrance is on the side of the house and does not have a porch !
negative	however , i had no response to this and am just left disappointed and out of pocket .
negative	offered same day service .
negative	booked saturday , couldn_'_t deliver , not surprisingly couldn_'_t deliver on sunday but still no delivery on monday .
negative	reason given delivery problems .... no kidding !
negative	ordered flowers to say thank_you to my aunt .
negative	when she sent me a pic of the flowers that where delivered i was really disappointed .
negative	they where nothing like the picture on the website .
negative	had to apologise to me aunt for send such a crappy bunch flowers .
negative	i have bought several items from achica over the last couple of years but will never buy again .
negative	items are often poorly packed and arriving undamaged seems to be a matter of luck , items are often of poor quality for even the reduced price , frequent long delays in arriving ( some items ) but the most infuriating issue is that there is no one to speak to if things go_wrong and emails relating to returns seem to be ignored .
negative	this is not the way to run an on - line business successfully .
negative	ordered flowers for mothers_day , they turned_up on time but were wilting and looked on their way out .
negative	i emailed serenata and provided the photographic_evidence they required .
negative	they offered me a replacement or a refund , i chose a refund which i still_haven_'_t received 0_days_later .
negative	i emailed them about it last night and was told they have no record of me asking for a refund and have no copy of the emails that were sent from me .
negative	awful company , don_'_t use them .
negative	order took_ages to arrive and unlike last_year - the returns were customer responsibility and it unfortunately cost a fortune to return to sweden .
negative	my prevous experience had been free_returns so very disappointed and astounded at cost .
negative	thought i would give asos a try and ordered 0 items .
negative	after a week i received an e_mail saying one of the items was out of stock ( even_though when i checked on their site it was still available to purchase ).
negative	they said they would refund me and 0_days_later that has still not happened .
negative	the other item was 0 packs of socks and this morning a tiny package was put through my letterbox and inside was one pack .
negative	now these socks were supposed to be a well_known_brand but are the poorest quality socks i have ever purchased and the inside if full of dangling threads which i imagine would get caught in your toes when putting on .
negative	asos have no contact number and no e_mail address and you literally have to go through loops on their automated answer system to send them an e_mail .
negative	just the fact that they do not have contact details would stop me using them again .
negative	it makes it almost_impossible to sort_out their mistakes and from my experience i would imagine that happens a lot .
negative	do not order from these people
negative	ordered 0 nail_files on 00th_december & never received them .
negative	very disappointed with service .
negative	got an_email me asking to review mynpurchase , when i called the phone number on the email , it stated that the number was incorrect and that i would have to dial another number , very poor customer service .
negative	0n january 0th 0000 i booked two return flights from glasgow to mazatlan ( mexico ) through skyscanner and travelup . co . uk .
negative	for travel commencing saturday00 / 0 /_0000 .
negative	whilst they were marginally_cheaper ( only a few £) than other travel_agents they have certainly proved that saving pennies results in angst , worry and uncertainty .
negative	our flights are with air_france and aero mexico ( both members of the sky team ).
negative	on february 00nd i received confirmation of our booking from klm .
negative	then on april 0th i received notification from air_france advising me of time changes to my flights .
negative	i am a flying blue member which_meant i could access my flight information .
negative	this i did and had chosen seats for three legs of the journey .
negative	( aero mexico and flybe not allowing me to do this at that time )
negative	all was well until thursday 00th_april ( just 00_hours before we had to leave for our first flight ) when i received an_urgent email from travel up notifying_me of these changes .
negative	it took them at_least a full week to realise that schedules had changed !
negative	i was asked to respond in an_email_saying whether or not these changes were acceptable whereupon my new e_- tickets could be issued .
negative	one hour after this email was written i replied_saying the changes were acceptable .
negative	problem_solved you might think , not so .
negative	the automated email i received in response stated they hope to respond to 00_% of their mail within_00hrs .
negative	still feeling_confident that travel up were working behind the scenes to fulfil their contract with me and organise my flights i went about packing etc .
negative	thirty hours before our first flight was due to take off i went on the internet to manage my booking to book seats for our flybe flight only to discover that out of six separate flights we were only booked on two .
negative	travel up had duly cancelled all other four flights .
negative	this morning ( friday 00th_april at 0 . 00am ) i called them .
negative	what a gross waste of time !
negative	the gentleman i spoke to was totally unhelpful and obstructive .
negative	he refused to take my booking_reference and kept_repeating the same phrases as though he were an automaton reading from a script without the intelligence or authority to deviate from it .
negative	then he rung off !
negative	i had appointments to keep , as well you might imagine on the eve of my departure .
negative	i had to ask my husband to deal with the matter from offshore mozambique .
negative	he duly phoned and got the same run around .
negative	into the bargain the operator was downright rude .
negative	all credit to klm and the sky team who my husband called in amsterdam .
negative	they took time to listen to our plight and did everything in their power to resolve the situation .
negative	after a twenty minute phone_call ( at expensive rates between mozambique and amsterdam ) klm had the problem sorted .
negative	many_thanks klm .
negative	i would in no way , shape or form recommend travel up to anyone .
negative	they are totally unprofessional , incompetent and downright rude .
negative	i will never use the ' services ' of this shower again .
negative	travellers be warned .
negative	ignore this at your_peril .
negative	initial order arrived without the steel rods ordered .
negative	these quickly replaced which was good but second order for additional upstands was v delayed causing additional expense to get carpenter back to finish job and was deliveredi instead someone_else '_s v large kitchen_units .
negative	this mistake ended_up costing me £ 000in addition wages and was surprised that they would only refund delivery charge when i complained .
negative	yet to check if this has_been refunded .
negative	has taken two_weeks for an item to be delivered ( there was no_indication when i ordered that the item was out of stock ).
negative	no one from customer_services informed me my order would be late - in the mean time the money has_been debited from my account .
negative	after mails back and forth and two_weeks on i have finally received the item , in a very damaged box and open .
negative	i have refused to accept the delivery , and now have been told by customer_services that by refusing delivery the next delivery will incur a charge if they check and content not damaged ( even_though courier has told me i am not supposed to take the item out to check it )!!
negative	not happy at all and would not even give one star , unless they pull out all the stops to send out another delivery asap .
negative	i made the mistake of taking out a phone contract through phones 0 u and it '_s not one i '_ll be making again !
negative	ordering the phone was the only good part of the whole 00 month_contract and that '_s because i did it online .
negative	i was unlucky and had a problem with the phone so went to the store and encountered a very rude customer assistant who didn_'_t want to do anything .
negative	he finally agreed to send my phone off for repair and three_weeks_later i still hadn_'_t heard if it was back or not .
negative	i discovered you could track the repair online and saw that my phone was delivered back to the store a week_ago and when i called to confirm this the guy had the nerve to tell me it had arrived that morning .
negative	i told him i knew he was lying and he didn_'_t even apologise , just made up some excuse .
negative	when i picked_up my phone got a page telling_me what had been done to repair it and all that had happened was that they had reset it .
negative	unsurprisingly i still had problems so went back to the store and spoke to an equally rude and unhelpful customer assistant .
negative	this guy even played on his own phone under the desk when i was sitting right in front of him and didn_'_t stop until i asked what he thought he was doing .
negative	this was finally sent off again and once again i wasn_'_t told when my phone was delivered back .
negative	the next time it went wrong i called the customer service number who said they would replace the phone for a different model if sending it off three_times didn_'_t fix the issue .
negative	it didn_'_t fix the issue and the person in store refused to change the phone until i had a long conversation with a manager over the phone .
negative	long_story_short , i got a new phone and unfortunately had problems with that too .
negative	i went into four different phones 0 u shops and spoke to numerous different people and they were all extremely rude and unhelpful .
negative	i had people chewing gum , playing on their phones , talking to people across the shop , laughing at me in front of my face and various other things .
negative	they also never did manage to fix a single issue on a phone , sometimes even making it worse .
negative	they also wouldn_'_t let_me cancel the contract without paying the charges , which actually seemed like a good option at times .
negative	their favourite thing to try and tell me was that the phone wasn_'_t their responsibilty , even_though it clearly was .
negative	i was seriously_considering taking them to trading_standards at points because they were so unhelpful and were unable to supply me with what i was paying for .
negative	the day i could upgrade i moved my contract to orange so deal with them directly and cut out phones 0 u . i cannot tell you how much relief i felt knowing that i never have to deal with this company again .
negative	i hope i make you realise what a mistake it would be to go with phones 0 u , go with anyone_else , just not them !
negative	time without number i have tried to buy items from argos and they never seem to have what i want in stock either in store or on their website .
negative	last_week i tried to purchase salter knife_sharpener , although it was in the old and new catalogue they were not able to supply it .
negative	thank_goodness for john_lewis they had the item at the same price and did not charge for delivery .
negative	arrived two_days_later from order .
negative	next time i check out with john_lewis first .
negative	ordered 0_days ago and they still have not turned_up .
negative	bad service ... when the email says they are being delivered but they dont turn_up , yet another birthday surprise ruined .
negative	we booked and paid for the heathrow purple business parking through skyparksecure .
negative	however , in the end , we had to park at the heathrow_terminal 0 business car_park , because :
negative	- directions to the car_park were terrible .
negative	sat_nav was no use at all because the postcode takes you to a completely_different road .
negative	- there was no_indication that we would need to leave our keys until after i had paid for the parking .
negative	i do not like doing this as it adds time to your journey and is not as secure .
negative	- the confirmation_email stated that we needed to have given the flight arrival time , not our arrival time back at the car_park .
negative	this had not been mentioned anywhere during the booking process .
negative	so i had to call and amend the arrival time by phone , as it couldn_'_t be changed online .
negative	overall , a complete_waste of money !
negative	it is much_better to book directly with the relevant car_park rather_than using this agent .
negative	it may cost a few_pounds more , but you receive the correct driving and parking instructions , which is invaluable when you have a flight to catch .
negative	i have this escada rio perfume and it just finished and i have been looking for a good deal and i found it in cheapsmells . com .
negative	never used them before , so i check the reviews out in trustpilot and most of them were good .
negative	so i thought why not give a try .
negative	i order an escada perfume from them .
negative	service was good and fast got the perfume within 0 - 0_days .
negative	but the product turned_out to be fake .
negative	i called the customer service said i wanted to return the product , first they said they wont accept as i had opened the cellophane packaging and when i mentioned fake and its not similar to the one i have then they said ok send it with a letter stating the reason for you return .
negative	and we shall refund it as soon as we get the product back .
negative	hope they do as they say ..
negative	i was advised i was going to get more than i received into my account .
negative	i was told that i would also receive my payment within 0 - 00 working_days and it took a month !
negative	my advice , use another company !
negative	riddiculous !
negative	ordered flowers for mothers_day over a week_ago , they took the money straight_away , no flowers , no customer_services to talk to and no reponses to emails . my mum thought i '_d fotgotten , how bad did we both feel later that day when we spoke . not impressed at all
negative	absolutely_appalling customer service , they just dont care !!!
negative	their stores are good but the internet ordering is rubbish , dont expect any follow_up customer service because once they have your money they couldn_'_t give a hoot .
negative	i bought the three_seater electric recliner sofa and chair after_spending much time deliberating in the shop - the most expensive there .
negative	when it arrived there was a rip on the side of the cushion on the chair and a gap_between the two sections of sofa as well as stitching out and loose staples underneath .
negative	upholsterer came out and i said i was unhappy , he said it had to go higher .
negative	the store manager came out and noted concerns and agreed it was under foamed .
negative	he said he would take it to the shop and sort it and that this would make the gap less .
negative	went to look today and is indeed better foamed but still a gap .
negative	i became very upset as £ 0000 is a lot of money to spend .
negative	i said that it may have been helpful to be informed when i purchased it there would be a gap but was told it would be assumed i knew that ( the one i sat on in the shop didn_'_t have one but was not a three_seater ).
negative	i am deeply unhappy and wish i '_d never purchased a sofa there .
negative	this is a huge_amount of money to me , even_though it '_s on finance .
negative	i have been told they will be delivering the sofa back to me as it is now mine .
negative	i will be researching to see if i can take this further , but in truth , don_'_t think i '_m strong_enough to fight and will just accept something i don_'_t want .
negative	i will never shop there again .
negative	cancelled an order with simply_electronics on the 00th_october after_placing an order on the 00th_october and still no refund !
negative	£_000 they have belonging to me all they keep doing is changing the status of my refund , yesterday it was at refund completed today it says refund queuing on the gateway and will be with you soon !!!
negative	i just don_'_t understand !
negative	its theft in my opinion , they shouldn_'_t be allowed to trade at all .
negative	i have also contacted watch dog to report them .
negative	looks like i '_ve had the same experience as most on this site .
negative	i '_m taking_legal_action_against these scumbags
negative	i ordered flowers and chocolates through amazon_local .
negative	the chocolates were not delivered and i '_m being told by customer_services that they were free and subject to availability .
negative	this was not my understanding on placing the order , and nowhere does its state this in correspondence .
negative	i want my money back - but have been offered a £ 0 voucher_code which is unacceptable .
negative	also the flowers did not resemble in the slightest the ones on the photo .
negative	customer service [_name_] - unhelpful and evasive .
negative	massive fail .
negative	here '_s my order :
negative	thanks for being a customer ,
negative	the amazon_local team
negative	order summary
negative	a choice of five ' laurence llewelyn - bowen ' designed bouquets with chocolates
negative	iflorist
negative	order number : d00 - 0000000 - 0000000
negative	sold by iflorist
negative	quantity : 0
negative	never use them
negative	first and last time i will ever use iflorist .
negative	i ordered the flowers to be delivered on the 0nd_april , a day before mother '_s day , as i knew my mum had to work on the sunday .
negative	saturday came and went with no flowers .
negative	i then email iflorist but by 0 o ' clock the following_day i had still not received a reply .
negative	i finally_managed to get somebody up on chat ( there is no phone number ) only to be told that someone had tried to deliver the flowers but there had been nobody in .
negative	as my mum , brother , sister , daughter and two nephews were all in the house on saturday i begged to differ .
negative	the lady then told me she could order some more to be delivered on tuesday , 0_days after they were needed .
negative	to add_insult to injury i received an_email this morning thanking_me for my order and stating that they had been delivered on time ( saturday 0nd )
negative	they eventually turned_up today .
negative	recommend to others ?......
negative	no chance
negative	i ordered my mum the candy_cane bouquet of pink_roses & lillies with chocolates to be delivered mothers_day .
negative	she got carnations - truly horrible - the day before mothers_day .
negative	no chocolates .
negative	i paid £_00 . 00 .... thje carnations were worth about £ 0 !!
negative	!
negative	awful_awful_awful
negative	i have sent emails wanting the correct order delivered or a refund .
negative	nobody has bothered to respond to me .
negative	completely unprofessional .
negative	will never use them again and i will deter everyone i know from the same .
negative	truly disappointing
negative	waited 00_minutes to talk to someone then was told needed to be put through to someone_else .
negative	after another 0 minutes was told by an_automated_message that they were too busy to talk and i should call back later - then i was cut_off !!
negative	!
negative	would recommend
negative	i had a credit amount in my wowcher_wallet which would not be accepted against any purchase i wanted to make .... ie , i could only make a purchase without using my credit against it .
negative	despite_emailing customer_services several_times to query it - i received only automated_replies saying id be contacted within 0_days .
negative	they didnt do and havent done .
negative	suffice to say my credit expired so i lost it .
negative	ive not bothered to complain for the sake of 0 . 00 - i can clearly see its a racket .
negative	secondly - to advertise a free product - then stick two fingers up at customers and laugh at them - for believing a product is free ...?
negative	?
negative	so why is advertising a free product so funny and unbelievable ....?
negative	?
negative	would the likes of tesco etc , be allowed to do this ?
negative	if they offered free food on 0st april - then tell their customers its a joke ( youre all idiots )..?
negative	?
negative	if you sell stuff - telling people its free isnt funny ( or imaginitive !!)
negative	- its lying .
negative	im guessing the advertising_standards authority received a few calls too .
negative	a few_days_later they then attempt to ( backtrack ) keep customers sweet by offering a 0pound credit against a purchase .
negative	too late .
negative	and now , 0wks later - a satisfaction survey - what a surprise !
negative	low - paid call_centre amateurs !!
negative	!
negative	( april fool )
negative	several_years_ago i took a contract out with them , my phone would not work they left me without_any form of communication despite stating my reasons , my elderly_mother lay on the floor as she could not contact me for several hours and by pure_chance i visited her and found her , i cancelled my contract ( within cooling_off time ) they have black listed me ruined my excellent credit_rating and keep sending threatening_letters even_though i have told them to take me to court but they wont listen just keep threatening !
negative	i took out a t mobile contract paid promptly for 0 years only cancelling when they joined up with orange !
negative	i searched on line for a company to deliver some flowers to a friend in tenerife and found this company .
negative	i completed the online form with my address and the recipient '_s address .
negative	i then placed the order .
negative	i noticed that the recipient address had defaulted back to my own address so immediately emailed to request that they change it .
negative	i got a reply_saying that they did not deliver to tenerife .
negative	they did not then offer to cancel the order or refund my money but sent the bouquet i had ordered for my friend in tenerife to my own_home address .
negative	a birthday greeting and bouquet sent from my address to my address !
negative	they sent several gushing emails tracking the progress of my order which quite_frankly adds insult to injury .
negative	it was obvious that both addresses were the same but they just took the money .
negative	they have replied to me since simply saying that as the recipient address was mine they delivered the flowers to it and were sorry for upset caused .
negative	they are clearly only interested in making money , will say all the right things , but did not do anything to sort this out .
negative	i do not recommend this company .
negative	well i have ordered a banner from you before it was great .
negative	im_sorry this time i was not happy at all , and you could not sort it out .
negative	it said on the banner happy birthday twice .
negative	i know once its done its done . but if where not happy with something that we have paid for .
negative	i been using your services few_years_now , this matter with the booking from lhr airport to enfield was the worst i ever experience cab company no help full diver will not speak understanding english or cooperate with passenger even was arrange before hand
negative	the batteries you sent me were fake and caused damage to the product they were used with .
negative	i hope you have stopped_selling the batteries i purchased as the manufacturer no_longer make them
negative	my husband bought me a hairdryer for £_000 for christmas .
negative	it had broken by the end of january ( completely dead for no apparent_reason ).
negative	i returned it to beauty_bay as requested on 0 february and heard_nothing .
negative	i have just spoken to their customer_services to ask when i might receive a replacement or refund only to be told that they were just the middle - man and it was all down to the manufacturer .
negative	i explained that i had had to buy a new hairdryer as i couldn_'_t manage without one , but was told i could not have a refund or another product , and there is no estimated timescale for a resolution for the manufacturer .
negative	i now have no choice but to wait days / weeks / months for the manufacturer to either fix or replace a product that i have already had to replace .
negative	i would never , ever use this company again .
negative	i received a special_offer email showing lots of offers including 00 red_roses for £_00 . 00 '.
negative	i clicked through to the website where i click on a different offer for 00 red_roses for £_00 . 00 .
negative	so selected and paid but got just 00 .
negative	i sent in a complaint via_email but still_haven_'_t had any response back !
negative	not happy
negative	well its been 0 hours and still no explanation to their request that they will look into it .
negative	terrible customer_services !!!!
negative	!
negative	i bought a dress from debenhams over a week_ago , it was in their sale_section and it was just what i was looking for to wear at an_upcoming_wedding .
negative	now i have had an_email_saying it was priced wrong so they have canceled my order and i will get a refund in five days
negative	i find both the cancelling of my order and the fact i have to wait for my money for five days terrible service
negative	won_'_t be using them again that '_s for sure .
negative	i ordered flowers to be delivered for a friends birthday , when they had not arrived by 0pm i rang customer_services to be told that they had not been able to find a florist to deliver my order .
negative	no one had bothered to contact me to tell me this .
negative	the lack of communication was so disappointing , had someone bothered to call me earlier , i could have done something about it .
negative	i would suggest you do not rely_on this company .
negative	i ordered some flowers for the following_day for my mum who was leaving in 0_days time , 0 says later still no flowers i received an_email_saying i am not able to receive from courier service although i could re order different flowers from a local_florist on the website .
negative	i did this then again received another email_saying that no i cannot order anything as florist do not cover my area !
negative	why let_me order in the first place ,?
negative	i only live 0 hour from glasgow not as though i '_m on an island !
negative	i emailed regarding my experience and still have no reply .
negative	poor service !
negative	from the very beginning everything with this company was a hassle .
negative	i sent the company detailed emails of what i was looking for , spreadsheets with the individual names and sizes on the personalised t - shirts etc etc .
negative	i feel i had done everything possible to describe the personalised t - shirts i was looking for to a company that personalises t - shirts .
negative	i also stressed the fact that i was looking for the t - shirts as quickly as possible .
negative	yet i still had to email the company at every_single stage of the process as my order seemed to be forgotten about several_times ( at_least the company clearly had no desire to fulfil the time limit of 00 days it stated before taking my money on day 0 ).
negative	once they had my money they didnt seem to care .
negative	the t - shirts took about a month to arrive .
negative	the embroidery was wrong ( and different from the sample i had had to pester the company to let_me see and agree to ).
negative	0 t - shirts was also missing from the order .
negative	i complained and the company agreed to give me a 00_%_discount , yet we are now around one month post - complaint and despite me phoning them in the mean time to ask what was happening , i am yet to receive any money .
negative	the time delays have been ridiculous but the worst thing about dealing_with the company has_been the constant_emails and phone_calls i have had to make to get my order processed .
negative	definitely not worth the time and effort .
negative	unprofessional shoe manager , discussing my husband and his discussion in front of other staff and other custmers , then preceeded to argue with me when i noticed .
negative	needless to say i have e_mailed the ceo and will refrain from ever shopping there again .
negative	only requested an exchange for my sons hat which was faulty !
negative	!
negative	my complaint regarding vodafone
negative	in march , my galaxy_s0 stopped_working .
negative	it simply would not charge .
negative	although it had a cracked_screen , this had not affected the phone previously ; it had worked_perfectly for approximately 0_months .
negative	i took the phone in to vodafone , parkgate , rotherham , where staff_member claire recorded the fault as “ charging_port not working ” and posted ( 0 ) it off to be fixed .
negative	around a week_later , i received a text to say the phone was not in warranty , due to a cracked_screen and could be repaired at a cost of 00 . 00 ; i was asked to ring customer_services .
negative	i rang and was told my phone was out of warranty , at the store and was initially sent to the repair_centre for a cracked_screen .
negative	i was told to go to the store to give further instructions .
negative	i spoke with claire in store again and she told me it had been sent in for the charger_port and nothing to do with the screen , so they should have fixed it .
negative	i rang customer_services there and then and they said they would fix the phone , ( charger_port and crack ) for 00_% of the total charge .
negative	i agreed to this .
negative	off the phone went again .
negative	( 0 ) another 00 days_later , i received a text to say the phone was fixed .
negative	i went to the store , the screen had been fixed but not the charging_port , the assistant tried to charge it in store and it still would not charge .
negative	the phone went off again ( 0 ) to the repair_centre .
negative	i was fuming and rang customer_services who apologised and offered me a replacement phone , ( s0 or i phone 0 ), i opted for the s0 or even an s0 , ( but they are not made anymore ) so accepted the s0 and then went without my phone for a further 0_weeks .
negative	i was in sheffield shopping with my family for the day when customer_services called me .
negative	a female explained that head_office would not authorise a replacement phone as mine had not been sent back for repair three_times , ( the third time was when i was offered the replacement ) and i was to go back to the store and have it sent off again once it had eventually returned to the store .
negative	we cut short our day out and returned to the store in rotherham .
negative	i spoke with claire , yet again and she was in disbelief this was still going on .
negative	by this point i was feeling exhausted with having to keep returning to the store , the repeat phone_calls to customer_services , where i had to explain everything over and over again .
negative	frustrated , depressed and generally worn out with the whole_process , i was ready to give in and just have no phone .
negative	( my son , heard this and offered me his , which was my old s0 ).
negative	my husband asked his name to be added to the account so that he could deal with things from then on .
negative	the staff , james and claire were doing their best to help but their hands were tied as it was up to customer_services to sort it out .
negative	claire spoke with customer_services again and explained_everything ; they said it would have to be sent back again .
negative	this was the fourth time .
negative	the phone came back a week_later , working .
negative	i thought that was the end of it .
negative	a new battery had been sent to me with the phone .
negative	i used the phone a few_times and the battery drained very quickly .
negative	my husband went to store again and they said it was because the new software was not available yet and it would work better , when that was available .
negative	i accepted this .
negative	at the end of april the bill was late being paid and the phone was disconnected , we paid it and customer_services said they could not re connect my accounts as there was an outstanding bill for a repair to the phone , we explained to them what had happened and was told a manager would call me back .
negative	the phone was reconnected .
negative	no one called .
negative	the may bill was late being paid , however , on the 00th_may , my husband paid the bill and was again told that as there was an outstanding bill for a repair , the phone would not be reconnected .
negative	he requested a call back from a manager and was told the 0th_june , he was to be without a phone until then , mine however was reconnected ???
negative	i rang customer_services at lunchtime and was told the same thing , yet again went through the whole story as to why there was a bill on my account for a repair .
negative	the female called vivien , said that a manager was going to call me back on the 0th of june , there was nothing she could do and if the bill had been paid that morning then it will take up to 00_hours to reconnect and i had to wait for a manager to call .
negative	i was confused as my phone had been re connected , so why not my husbands ?
negative	i rang again that evening and explained to lavin , what had happened , he said the bill was outstanding from march and needed to be paid , i said it wasn_’_t a bill but a repair fee so he spoke to the finance_department .
negative	he said he will reconnect my husbands phone there and then , ( which does not tally up with viviens claim that it takes up to 00_hrs ), the phone was reconnected .
negative	i then said i wanted a call from a manager the next_day , may 00th and i wanted a text to confirm this .
negative	he agreed .
negative	i received no text .
negative	i also received no call from the manager as promised .
negative	i woke_up this morning and my phone is not working again .
negative	it will not charge and has yet again been sent in for repair .
negative	the manager at the store said that as it had been working it would now be classed_as a new fault , so i would not qualify for a replacement phone .
negative	he advised me to e_- mail the director , which i have .
negative	i cannot understand how a multi million pound company can treat a customer this way and is allowed to continue to do so .
negative	i cannot understand_why the stores have no rights over how to treat the customers , i have not the time to be phoning vodafone all the time certainly not whilst i am in the store , hoping they can sort it and they cannot .
negative	numerous_times i have driven to the store , numerous_calls made , numerous_times i have repeated the story , numerous_times i have been told different things , numerous_times i have been ignored and numerous_times i have lost data , phone numbers , photo ’_s of my children and my newborn niece .
negative	numerous_times my days out with my children has_been ruined , an evening with my husband ruined , having to take my children into the store and be on a call for up to an_hour .
negative	i have had enough now , and need advice on what i can do .
negative	i cannot face another phone_call to customer_services , ( especially on a poor courtesy phone ), speaking with foreign call staff who do not understand me and i them .

negative	i cannot face another phone_call to customer_services , ( especially on a poor courtesy phone ), speaking with foreign call staff who do not understand me and i them .
negative	awaiting a response from you ,
negative	i received an_email which i think was very rude , from customer_services after complaining an order was a completre waste as photograh was on half of the front and half of the back of welcome card !
negative	!.
negative	i also think the hidden_charges are very high .
negative	i would never use this company again because of the rude remarks from their so called customer_services , and would advice others to keep away from them .
negative	the same as others i '_m stuck here with an order that i '_d got an order number for , but no takeaway an_hour after i placed the order .
negative	when i '_ve called the restaurant they told me just eat had the same problem yesterday , but they can '_t send the food as they have no order .
negative	just eat '_s phone lines and live_chat were down , and it took 0 hours after i '_d placed the order for them to reply to the email i sent saying that they had preauthorised it and cancelled it , so " the time the funds take to appear back in your available balance is solely dependent on your bank '_s policy for cancelling the reservation , however , it usually takes about 0 working_days , but is entirely dependent on your bank '_s policy .
negative	some banks do have policies that can take up to 00 working_days . "
negative	.
negative	so now thanks to just eat i '_ve got money i can '_t spend until the bank release it maybe 00 working_days_later and no food , but i guess that '_s ok because " on behalf of just - eat we apologies for the inconvenience that this has caused you ."
negative	.
negative	i ordered a bunch of flowers costing over_£_00 for an ill friend in denmark on 0 / 0 / 00 .
negative	the website for prestige looked very enticing , with the promise of international flowers being delivered and so i ordered with a date for delivery of the 0 / 0 / 00 , which i confirmed twice with them .
negative	after ordering i found out that they actually ship european orders from the netherlands - which is mentioned no where on their website - so please be aware if you mistakenly think that the flowers will be local , then they won_'_t .
negative	they use a courier to send them .
negative	also the order did not arrive on time , which the woman_who i spoke to abruptly told me there was nothing they could do about as in their terms and conditions it does_state that they don_'_t guarantee delivery on time .
negative	so please be careful about the address you send them to , for example i wouldn_'_t send them to hospital as your friend may be discharged by the time they arrive .
negative	they finally arrived 0_days late , and had delivered the wrong , much_cheaper ( over_£_00 less ) bunch of flowers !
negative	customer_services answer - well they ' re still beautiful ?!?
negative	i also opened a paypal_dispute and now they '_ve told me unless i close it down they won_'_t be able to discuss via customer_services any resolution .
negative	when i pointed_out that if i closed it then that would say to paypal i '_m satisfied , which i '_m not , and i can '_t reopen it , they told me that they couldn_'_t help until i closed it down .
negative	i '_d advise anyone to stay well clear as reading lots of reviews now - see twitter , facebook and google - then there seems to be a common theme of lower quality flowers being sent .
negative	also i agree with nicola that its amazing how many similar reviews are posted with 0_stars here on trustpilot just after a poor review .
negative	they delivered my recently ordered pc actually on time , i had no_complaints until the driver arrived at my door .
negative	he rang the doorbell i opened it to see him drop my " please handle carefully " pc box both upside_down and from waist height .
negative	when i commented on it , he simply grunted at me .
negative	i have showdogs and kennels , there is a huge sign on the gate asking people to close it .
negative	he walked out left the gate open , i shouted after him to close the gate and he replied ' whatever lady ' and kept walking .
negative	a disgraceful representation of a company and i have a feeling from the reviews i '_ve seen below an all to regular view of this company .
negative	extremely rude , non_existant customer service , when i asked for a postcode i was told " look for yourself " also they tried to take additional payment from someone_else '_s card - no wonder it declined !
negative	i spoked to suzanne @ ferry on line at 00 . 00 on 00 / 00 / 00 , she is very patronising and rude !
negative	it is very frustrating when you are planning a 0hour journey to dover and all i phoned for was a postcode , she seemed to think that i wanted a postcode to calais which is rediculous sine the ferry takes you there !
negative	she told me that no one else seems to struggle .
negative	not happy at all with they way i was spoken to .
negative	i want this call listened to since they are recorded for training purposes as suzanne didn_'_t provide any customer service .
negative	i look_forward to receiving feedback .
negative	there does not appear to be anyone available to sort_out any_queries once they have taken your money .
negative	i called the call_centre on 0 occasions in order to try and cancel my booking and was simply cut_off after 00_minutes of holding .
negative	i tried to cancel online and was informed i could only contact the call_centre ...........
negative	i have also found out that had i gone direct to the car_hire company i would have paid 00_% less for the identical rental and received much_better insurance_cover .
negative	so they fail on three levels :
negative	0 ) no one to answer the phone
negative	0 ) lowest_price guarantee is not valid .
negative	0 ) can '_t easily update or amend booking online .
negative	my advice is go direct .
negative	would not enjoy using this airline , stewardess was bad mouthing all the customers and was also very rude , i answered her back and she kept out of my way for the rest of the flight , as i sat at the back near the toilet and she kept banging the door open onto my seat , i was very polite untill she was very rude , easy jet need to take more care as to who works for them , hated my flight , it was the worst flight that i have ever been on , i wrote a letter to complain but never had a reply ,
negative	i was very disappointed with this service .
negative	reasons being that i spend at_least £_000 at asda '_s each week , but because i have been having home delivery for at_least 0 years i do not qualify for this service
negative	well a good start would perhaps be getting the name right !!!
negative	its alex not karen thanks !
negative	!
negative	we ordered a kitchen_sink and monobloc tap .
negative	they arrived very promptly but ....... it was the wrong tap .
negative	contacted immediately via their abyssmal ' submit a request ' utsumi help_desk .
negative	got a response after a few prompts stating when they could not deliver and what i had to do and not do and on and on .
negative	emailed back asking for the ' correct tap ' to be delivered the next_day .
negative	then on checking the sink and trying to get it fitted , the waste system did not seem to fit , in fact when it was fully checked , it was over 0 inches short and the wrong angle .
negative	well this was over 0_days ago and the last response i had was yesterday morning asking me to respond by 0000 if i wanted delivery today , i responded_immediately but of course nothing .
negative	we have sent images of the sink and told they would go to technical_department .
negative	i sent images to the actual sink company who responded the same day to say it looked like taps uk had sent us the wrong waste system .
negative	i have now opened a dispute via pay_pal and will contact my credit_card tomorrow .
negative	talk about waste of time and frustration , never mind the fact that we have no kitchen_sink or tap ( i am too scared to go and buy one elsewhere as we cannot_afford to lose this money ). i have no idea what else to do now , they really do not have a care for customers and tehy seem to get away with it .
negative	maybe next step will be trading_standards ?
negative	i wished i had read the reviews before being tempted to order from this company .
negative	i have ordered 0 different articles and in five weeks only two of them have arrived even_though money was taken for the goods on ordering day .
negative	one of the orders has_been returned , which i know will take an age to get a refund - plus its cost me an extra £_00 for p_&_p for a double duvet_cover value £_00 which was crap !
negative	i ordered an item from very . co . uk this was delivered to the depot 0_days ago no problem thus_far i received an_email from yodel saying they were going to deliver monday however should this be inconvenient the reply 0 , 0 or 0 depending which day you wanted so as i was working monday i opted for today wednesday .
negative	i received an_email_confirming delivery would be today .
negative	so all ok , so far yes .
negative	i then go online to track it to make_sure it was coming today as i had booked day off work which was unpaid by the way so i could be in to sign for this parcel , it said it was still at the keighley depot .
negative	oh joy i thought so i contacted customer_services who said somebody should ring me .
negative	no one rung so i tried the online_chat route .
negative	this chap although very pleasant would not actually answer any of my questions as in i asked why my parcel hadn_'_t been sent out for delivery ?
negative	no response when was i going to get my parcel now ?
negative	only answer was i can try for tomorrow but can '_t guarantee it another unpaid day i will have to take it is ridiculous .
negative	and why did they confirm dates if they couldn_'_t honour the delivery ?
negative	no answer .
negative	i have to say this is not the first time this has happened to me and it appears that the collection of parcels are far more important than the actual delivery of them thus being if they run_out of time on the day by collecting the parcels they just simply won_'_t deliver them .
negative	if they can email you to start with to say when they are coming then why can they email to say " actually you have wasted a whole day at home waiting as we have more important things to do than come to your address and deliver your parcel the day we said we would " if i hadn_'_t of contacted them they just not have turned_up a shocking way to provide a service .
negative	and i am very disappointed no contact , no apology nothing the chap gave_me the complaints details whom i could contact then these promptly disappeared off the screen as soon as he ended the chat so the only way i can complain is on here .
negative	extremely disappointed as it appears one inefficient depot does spoil the bunch .
negative	this could be an amazing service that more people would use if they actually did what they said they were going to do .
negative	i have tried to redeem a voucher since december and it has now expired .
negative	i '_ve had e . mails from wowcher but that did not work and it has cost more money in phone_calls than the voucher is worth .
negative	i think it '_s absolutely_disgusting that items have to be returned by post to sweden , and also this has to be paid for by the customer .
negative	( the returns_policy is also not clear .)
negative	i think this is terrible customer service .
negative	i paid £_00 for a pair of shoes that are too small , i need to return - which is a common enough problem .
negative	but i have to pay postage and packaging to send them to sweden .
negative	i havent bothered , because i dont have time .
negative	why cant i just exchange them in a shop ?
negative	so ive wasted £_00 .
negative	i '_ll never shop at ecco ever again .
negative	ordered two sheds was told up to 00 days for delivery but if i had not herd anything after three_days to contact them .
negative	i contacted them on quite a few occasion leading up to the delivery date and was told to just wait the 00 days .
negative	once the 00 days were up i emailed and phoned cos no one answered my email and was told that i had been emailed which strangely came through after i phoned and they said they would let_me no of a delivery date but they never i called again and was assured they would phone the supplier that day and call me back but they never so i called again three_days_later and was told they would call the supplier and call me back .
negative	at this point i got angry and said if the delivery was not am with me in two_days i did not want it any more i was informed that the 00 days was not up and he counted out the days to me on the phone and told me it was 00 days then admitted he was wrong and it was in fact past the time .
negative	he then called me back to say he had contacted the supplier and my sheds would be another 0_weeks so i cancelled the order .
negative	i had to send an_email to confirm this which i did and received an_email back to day they had to wait for confirmation from the supplier before i get a refund i '_m still_waiting for the confirmation 0_days on .
negative	the point is if they had told me the sheds would take more than a month to come i would have still ordered them but the terrible lack of information and failure to contact me back and rudeness on the phone is what made me cancell the order .
negative	i '_m just hoping i get my refund soon oh and by the way ordered the same sheds from someone_else on tuesday and they r coming tomorrow .
negative	i ordered a dress on the 00th_february delivery was supposed to take 0_days as of today ( 0th_march ) i still have not received my dress nor have i had any replies to the emails i sent to customer_services and when i try to call them i cannot get through and get told to try again later , each time i try i get the same response , im beginning to wonder_if they are even a real company or a scam to get money ?
negative	?
negative	flowers delivered at nearly 0 pm not acceptable at all .
negative	it was stated that the flowers were a birthday_gift and my mothers_birthday was almost over by the time the flowers were delivered .
negative	very upset with your so called service !!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	having been sent a small rubber gasket instead of the shower_hose ordered and paid for , i have emailed 0 times over 0 working_days and have had no response apart_from a recognition that they have my email and are working on it !!!
negative	not happy .
negative	would rather give no stars .....
negative	i really wish i had read the reviews on here before i sent 0 phones to them for repair .
negative	i sent them on june 00rd .
negative	one was water_damaged and was to be investigated .
negative	0_weeks_later its still being investigated , with no progress_report or hint of return .
negative	the other had a cracked_screen which was replaced and returned after 0_weeks .
negative	the screen was badly fitted and didnt work properly .
negative	it was returned to them and received on 00st_july and since then nothing .
negative	i have emailed their help_desk numerous_times without_any reply .
negative	i have phoned 0 times and got through once to be commisserated with and told someone would contact me to tell me whats_happening .... no contact .
negative	as i write this i am on hold again ( currently at 00_minutes and im supposedly caller no 0 !)
negative	i just want my phones back repaired or not .
negative	i have posted on their facebook_page .
negative	they clearly monitor this as within 00_minutes each time the post has_been removed .
negative	tweets go unanswered .
negative	clearly nobody at repairs0 actually_cares_about their customers and tries to sort_out the issues .
negative	i would urge_people not to use this company .
negative	finally got through and apparently both devices are being returned to me by courier tonight .
negative	i will be very relieved when i have them both in my hands .
negative	very bad website , very rude and very poor customer service .
negative	i post my flats to let and as soon as i get inquiry i was pressured ﻿ to take it even when inquiry wasn_'_t suitable for my flat , i had 0 phone_calls and few sms on my phone " why i didn_'_t accept it ?"
negative	and when i refuse to take that booking i receive rude email and threats ﻿ to be unpublished .
negative	they demand me to take every booking .
negative	i think it '_s ridicules .
negative	i never seen anything like it !
negative	and they charge tenants before landlord accept inqury on first place .
negative	don_'_t recommend this web !!
negative	!
negative	i purchased some dressing_table mirrors from this company .
negative	there was no charge for postage and the goods arrived promptly .
negative	however , when we tried to assemble the mirrors they were discovered to be faulty .
negative	the company would not agree to a full_refund and payment for the return postage .
negative	they wanted to charge me an administration charge of 00_% plus return carriage .
negative	after much negotiation , i managed to get the admin_charge dropped but i still paid for the return carriage .
negative	i just wanted to end the mess and although i could have gone to the small claim court i really couldn_'_t be bothered .
negative	tread carefully with this company and know your rights !
negative	use this service last 0 year and my item got stolen .
negative	totally misled and feel let_down .
negative	we thourght we had contacted a company that was going to help us .
negative	what a extreme shock we have had in dealing_with the allocated solicitors .
negative	would now not recommend this site for all the money in the world
negative	our family 00 .
negative	fairmead crescent .
negative	edgware .
negative	middlesex .
negative	ha0 0yh
negative	totally duped and down right conned .
negative	we ordered a £_00 . 00 bq to be delivered to where we work in halifax .
negative	a corporate venue in the town_centre ) we asked for early am delivery as it was for a presentation at a collegues retirement .
negative	the flowers arrived at almost 0 . 0pm and were disgusting .
negative	three stems of yellow crys , four old geminas .
negative	three limp iris , two old shamrock crys blooms and some purple limonium .
negative	tied like a hand_tied and wrapped in left overs from halloween .
negative	omg .
negative	i felt so humble and embarressed as all the office staff stared at me while i tried to put the mess right .
negative	impossible .
negative	the ' shop ' that delivered the flowers ' scentiments of wibsey ' were not available to take a phone_call .
negative	i drove to the shop with the bq to find it dident exsist only to be told by the hairdressers where it used to be " she went last_year and works mobile from her van " !!
negative	omg .
negative	where i appreciate that iflorist do a great job usually as ive used them many_times and always been happy with the flowers i do feel they need to visit the shops they have registered with them as some are not shops but con women posing as florist shops .
negative	ie .
negative	scentiments of wibsey .
negative	ive posted a photo of the pile pf poo the shop sent for 00 . 00 .
negative	i could have got better for 0 . 00 at the co - op .
negative	!
negative	awaiting delivery , trying to be patient , have given one star but only to post opinion
negative	buyer_beware .
negative	this company didnt confirm my booking until after i traveled even after numerous_emails to request the details .
negative	i ended_up having to pay another firm to get a car and when i requested a full_refund from this company due to their efficiencies they said no .
negative	customer service was terrible and appallling .
negative	i have no idea how companies like this stay in business .
negative	i ordered a go pro camera with you for £_000 on 00rd august and promised delivery within 00 days .
negative	it has now been 00 working_days and i have no go pro and no response to my emails regarding this matter .
negative	i refuse to call an 0000 number from my mobile and i don_'_t have access to a landline so i am relying_on email communication which has not been forthcoming ,
negative	i '_m pretty disgusted with the service at wowcher , especially as i stopped using another rival company as i had a similar experience with them .
negative	i thought i would chance it with wowcher hoping that they were a better company but it appears not .
negative	if i don_'_t receive any contact from them by the end of this week , i will be contacting cab and escalating this further until the matter is resolved .
negative	nothing really more to add than that , other than the obvious , standing in the cold waiting for them to turn_up on both the collection and delivery .
negative	they have too many competitors to worry_about using them again .
negative	very disappointed
negative	i booked a dinner / theatre trip as a special outing for myself and three friends through lastminute . com .
negative	the package was £_00 and it said tickets were up to £_00 face value and we would get the best available seats within their allocation so we thought great .
negative	dinner was fine but when we got to the theatre the seats were dreadful and we were so high up the only way we could see the stage was by leaning right forward for the whole of the performance !
negative	we went to the box office and asked if we could change seats as there were plenty of empty seats elsewhere but they said no , we had to stay where we were .
negative	we talked to other people who had done the same as us , they were all very disappointed .
negative	we also found that we could have put the same deal together ourselves by going direct to the theatre and would have got much_better seats for less money .
negative	complained to lastminute . com who said they were seats with a good view - only with binnoculars and if you are a contortionist !
negative	they offered a £_00 voucher_towards another event ......... i don_'_t think so .
negative	won_'_t use lastminute . com ever again .
negative	my daughter was moving into a new house so i thought it would be nice to send her flowers .
negative	after looking on internet i went for the eflorist heaven_scent at £_00 . 00 + £ 0 . 00 delivery .
negative	well went i saw them i was very , in fact extremely disappointed .
negative	i could have bought a far_superior bouquet from the local_supermarket .
negative	to start with there was no " scent " there were 0 small white_roses and a few sprays of chrysanthemums and a cheap mauve flower .
negative	i am really disappointed as i thought i had bought my daughter a lovely big bunch of flowers and i feel exploited by eflorist for taking my money under false pretences and by sending me a load of rubbish .
negative	i am looking into taking this further as i have been deceived by the company misrepresenting their goods accurately on the internet .
negative	i paid and ordered eyesential in october_0000 still reciving emails saying it will be with me in 0 - 00 days i have asked for a refund of the £_00 that was paid in good faith they are totaly criminal i am contacting_trading_standards on monday 00 jan
negative	prices are different to in store , very rude .
negative	i had a problem with my fridge_freezer the freezer stopped_working on the friday .
negative	on the saturday i went to appliance direct ordered and paid for a new one all i got was a receipt for the money i paid , was not told anything about no refund . on the sunday my freezer started up again had been told on saturday delivery would be monday after 0 oclock first thing monday_morning i rang to explain what had happened .
negative	was then told they dont give refunds and had to have credit_note what a load of rubbish i do not need to buy anything from this shop again .
negative	i booked a roundtrip from london , heathow to san_francisco international ( sfo ) with them .
negative	i thought i had a good deal : first leg of the trip was british_airways which i normally book , no problem there in logging in and choosing a seat ( although the better seats were predictably blocked off for third_party customers ). on the way back i was supposed to be flying aa to chicago and iberia to london .
negative	the night before my flight i logged in using my reservation code , only to find that i could not choose seats . i called iberia , who claimed it was a ba ticket . ba claimed it was an aa ticket . i called aa and they were unable to find me on either flight . i called ba back in london and they were able to locate the correct reservation code with aa that finally logged me in . i then had to pay $_000 extra to reserve a seat . however , the story does not end there . this time i could not find my flight from sfo to ord and aa told me they could not tell me whether i was on the flight or not . i called netflights - only to discover they are closed on the weekends ( this was a sat evening flight ). it took three_attempts with aa to locate my reservation which lo and behold had been under the same booking code ba located - netflights or aa or both just did not put the itinerary together for me under the same booking code .
negative	all is well i thought and proceeded to choose a seat . next_morning i tried to print my boarding_pass only to find that i couldn_'_t choose myself as passenger and the seat reverted_back to unassigned . i went to the airport , went to the self check in - of course same story there . an agent helped_me , to no_avail . the check in agent told me she '_s sorry but for this booking i do not have priority in boarding so i needed to go to the gate and wait for an agent - i still did not have the seat i paid for . an agent finally arrived and i made a beeline for the queue - only to find out guess_what , i had a standby ticket .
negative	netflights or aa or both screwed_up and put me on standby for a ticket and seat i paid for .
negative	had i not been the first in line i would have been stuck in sfo - the flight was indeed overbooked .
negative	i would rate their service lower_than one star if i could .
negative	never ever again .
negative	i wrote to them and they were unhelpful claiming i got the correct e_- ticket number .
negative	well no , e_- ticket number as well as the booking code they provided were of no use to me .
negative	inf act on viewtrip .
negative	com which netflights lead you to , my flight status reverted to ' not operating ' indicating that unbeknownst to me i had been relegated to standby on a ticket i paid for .
negative	no tree has_been delivered and no explanation as to why not !
negative	money was taken immediately .
negative	phoned last_week and was assured that tree had been dispatched to me .
negative	rating 0 as required to enter a star_rating .
negative	ideally would be 0
negative	can not believe just how bad the meet and greet was .
negative	firstly had to wait 00_mins before being picked_up .
negative	in the cold , had to ring three_times to find out what was going on .
negative	secondly , the state of our car , mud all over , but inside was worse , mud all over floor , in front and in the back !!!??????
negative	?
negative	pizza all over passage side , who as been using my car !!!!!
negative	!
negative	sat_nav / radio not working ?????
negative	?
negative	just had our alloys done , and one was scuffed , cig lighter taken out and put on side ??
negative	?
negative	in engine a plastic cover taken off , could not beleive state our car was in , told driver we will follow him to speak to manager , instead he sped off .?????
negative	?
negative	i called office using a different mobile , asking where they were based !!!!!
negative	so went there , spoke and showed manager the state of car , he did look a little shocked , he gave_me telephone_number ect to complain .
negative	i complained on 00th_june , today is 0rd heard_nothing .
negative	i want to know wht we had to wait 00_mins , and why our car was full of mud and food !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	purchased some items and was told by the website that i would be able to book a one hour delivery slot - next_day - with dpd .
negative	i ordered and paid but there was still no option to book the delivery slot .
negative	after_reading the emails , it appeared that they would only arrange delivery after dispatch .
negative	so i waited , and late last night i had an_email to say my goods would arrive tomorrow !
negative	not the next_day one hour_slot i was hoping for as this is now two_days_later but never mind i '_ll just book a days annual_leave !
negative	so i try to track the parcel to see if i can either book my one hour delivery slot or at_least see a hour_window when they might arrive , but no , it just says it will arrive some time today .
negative	so i '_m now using up an entire days annual_leave stuck in the house all day .
negative	thanks viovet , what an_absolute con .
negative	i will not be using you again !
negative	having seen a jacket in one of their shops - called both the on - line number and the store itself several_times to ensure that this was one and the same jacket - was assured it was as was the only jacket they stocked by this designer with an internal ' puffer '.
negative	i had had to call as difficult to see on their website .
negative	arrived and was utterly disappointed to find not the same at all - despite_numerous reassurances by repertoire staff , returning had to pay £_00 and had not even a verbal apology from staff let_alone an offer to refund the postage .
negative	awful experience .
negative	terrible 0st night last_minute didn_'_t email our hotel so when we arrived at 0pm they had no record of our booking !
negative	did not completed the course as i found the salt content ws too high .
negative	i tried the wednesday meal and was too scare to try anymore .
negative	i ordered , on 00 / 0 / 00 a kingsize_bed which was supposed to be in stock as it was under clearance and 0 bedside_tables .
negative	they emailed to say the bed would be delivered on the 0th_august .
negative	it did arrive , but they had sent 0 top parts , the reason i knew this was because the bottom part should have had a draw - no drawer present .
negative	we told the driver immediately but all he said was phone the company .
negative	my husband spent the next 0_days trying to actually speak to anyone from that company .
negative	eventually he got through and was told the bed had been put on order and will be with us in due course , no_indication of when .
negative	meanwhile we have no bed to sleep on as we got rid of our old bed !
negative	several days_later we were told that the bed will be with us on 00th_august .
negative	it didnt arrive .
negative	when we rang to find out why we were told that it was delivered but no - one was in which is an outright lie - we were in all day practically sitting by the window waiting as it was that important to us !
negative	they then emailed a new delivery date of the 00th - guess_what - it didnt turn_up !
negative	reason ?
negative	the van broke_down - yeah_right .
negative	this company lies through there teeth .
negative	the next delivery day was for today - 00th - low and behold a van pulled up and it was them !
negative	hurray we thought , but all we got was the bed side_tables , still nothing to sleep on .
negative	today we thought enough is enough and contacted trading standars and they told us that we have to email them and ask when they will be delivering the bed to give them one last chance and if it isnt forth_coming only then can we ask to get our money back - i '_m just thinking , all this just to get our money back .
negative	i really want the bed and some sort of compensation for all the hassle and money lost through days of work and no decent nights_sleep .
negative	it is not right that a company like this can get away with what they do when all they have to do at the end of it if someone takes the trouble to go to cab or trading_standards is there money back - your just back where you started then , with no bed !
negative	there has to be a way to stop people like this .
negative	they are actually making me ill with all this , in fact just sitting here typing thisiis making my blood boil !
negative	all i can do is try to spread the word and try to warn_others to avoid this co . like the plague !
negative	i also found that they had traded on ebay but are no_longer registered due to tons on negative_feedback .
negative	i wish i '_d done my homework before hand or i would never have ordered from them .
negative	allin all this bed has turned_out to be massively expensive in more ways than one !
negative	i had a really bad_experience , would never use this company again .
negative	received a different ( cheaper ) product 0x , then was told the design of the original product i ordered had been changed and it now looks identical to the cheaper product !
negative	no apology throughout the process , instead i was told i was ' getting a good deal ' when i decided to keep the cheaper product and they refunded the difference in price .
negative	embarrassing !
negative	i called their telephone customer service today to help find an item but received horrible customer service !!
negative	:
negative	0 ) they stuck to their rote learnt bookish lines insisting i give them item number .
negative	there was absolutely no desire to budge or help or " waste time " on a customer wanting to spend the money on their company and buying the product .
negative	0 ) to begin with , he spent good long time asking me to confirm my address , my landline_number , my email address , my full name as though i was calling a bank and not a happy shopping place .
negative	0 ) when i said this is not so great customer service , there was not a single word of apology just to make me feel better at_least ... it was a mere okay ... like im calling some royal highness where i should be sorry i wasted their time .
negative	0 ) might i add they deliver super slow .
negative	0 ) the quality isn_'_t to die for - but would have been bearable if i was at_least treated like a customer they cared to retain .
negative	it '_s so sad to see when a company is suffering because their customer service is amazingly horrible .
negative	i would rather spend double the money on a product that is given to me with precious customer service
negative	i cannot begin to explain my disappointment .
negative	i ordered a grandissimo bouquet for my dear cousin '_s 00th_birthday .
negative	when i had not received an_email or text by 0pm i emailed to see where my order was .
negative	half an_hour later i had an_email_telling_me that the order had been dispatched .
negative	at 0 . 00pm i had an_email to say it had been delivered and left at a secure_location at the front of the house .....
negative	i had asked for it to be left at neighbours if there was nobody in !!
negative	guess_what ??
negative	next_day .... no flowers had been received .
negative	had a tearful telephone_conversation with my cousin .... she has_been so supportive to me and i owe her big style .
negative	i cannot get that day back ,
negative	i will make this as brief as i can .
negative	my husband bought me a bag as one of my christmas_presents .
negative	i didn_'_t like it so we took it back for a refund .
negative	we had the receipt .
negative	now it get '_s interesting .
negative	we were within the their time limit for refunds but at the till we were told and i quote " sorry can '_t refund you on this bag because you haven_'_t got the 0 receipts .
negative	i had the customer copy and she wanted the other one as well .
negative	obviously my husband mislaid it because he only gave_me the one .
negative	onlookers must have been loving the embarrassment i felt .
negative	everything you could have wanted was on the till receipt .
negative	i stood my ground and wouldn_'_t budge , i worked in retail for a very short time and i have seen what customers do !!
negative	reluctantly she looked across at a dour looking female in another queue who nodded and replied " yes that '_s right we don_'_t refund on the one receipt ".
negative	i was quite cross by now .
negative	i replied in that case i will have a gift voucher .......... well !!
negative	at this point she seemed at a loss that i dared make this request , until she made eye contact with the dour , scruffy female in the other queue ( this person obviously worked there ) who nodded her assent .
negative	i was then told in a loud voice " as you have this receipt i can see you have bought the bag , so i will give you the gift voucher ".
negative	when i asked if i could use it online of course the answer is no !!
negative	confirmed of course by the aforementioned female .
negative	never again will i ever use monsoon !!
negative	utter and complete_shambles of a company .
negative	oh !!
negative	and the bag was horrible it was cheap and smelly and it wasn_'_t cheap either !
negative	!
negative	it has_been my misfortune to have recently had dealings with this company .
negative	in the past my experience with this company has_been positive .
negative	but this was about to change .
negative	i ordered a couple of items of clothing .
negative	i changed my mind after a few_days and rang to cancel the order .
negative	unfortunately i was about three hours too late the items were about to be dispatched .
negative	the advice i was given was to refuse the package which would then be immediately returned to laura_ashley then i would be refunded .
negative	that was three_weeks_ago .
negative	i made a call last_week to be told , yes , the goods had been received back and that i would receive my refund in due course !!
negative	satisfied that the goods were there i just waited .
negative	a week_later i ring again , just a while ago .
negative	spoke to an extremely smug , unhelpful female who should not be working with the public as her attitude was surly and obstructive .
negative	this female customer service person then went on to tell me and i quote " no we have record of receiving the goods back ".
negative	she blamed the courier company for holding on to them , said there was nothing she could do but did i want to speak to someone_else in another department who was also customer service but that there were 0 people in the queue .
negative	when i replied that it was costing me money she made no comment .
negative	an_email was suggested but then she advised me that she wouldn_'_t pick it up till monday .
negative	eventually i did speak with a very polished young_lady_who was very on the ball who immediately apologised_profusely for her colleague .
negative	took my details , looked at the screen and saw that it was in the depot awaiting the next step for refunding .
negative	she contacted the depot to put a priority on this return .
negative	a sad experience this time round .
negative	i will not be in a hurry to deal with this company again unless they prioritise their customer service personnel and their whole refunding system .
negative	i wont_be buying from cheap_smells again , the size of the bottle is ridiculous , the ck 0 looked like a free sample in a plastic bottle .
negative	i am so disappointed , it was for a christmas_present and i feel too embarassed to give it .
negative	help
negative	charlotte
negative	i only received one part of a three part order .
negative	the delivery man from yodel was accused of not delivering anything to me after i had sent an_email_telling you i was still_waiting for the outstanding items - a litter_tray and a bag of royal_canin .
negative	after several emails back and forth i have asked for a refund - wonder_how long that will take !
negative	i just ordered a 00 piece set of tupperware from wowcher after they emailed me with a promotion saying i had £ 0 of credit i could use .
negative	the tupperware was advertised as £ 0 . 00 reduced from £_00 . 00 .
negative	only after i paid £ 0 . 00 through paypal and got the wowcher order confirmation did it state that i had to pay an extra £ 0 . 00 in delivery charges from ushur !
negative	this is misleading marketing and wowcher should have made it clear on their website and in all their communications that £ 0 . 00 was payable in addition as delivery charges .
negative	i write this so others are careful when ordering from wowcher that delivery charges may apply from the vendors they use .
negative	also , the consumer protection authorities should be aware of this and monitor this practice , it is unacceptable .
negative	i have emailed enquiries at wowcher and have asked to cancel my order and get my money back .
negative	i won_'_t be ordering again any products from them as this breaches my basic trust and it is too much hassle to try and get your money back after the fact .
negative	i brought a £_00 voucher from gogroopie and received it almost straight_away .
negative	i waited_until it was valid ( after 0pm the next_day ) and tried to use it .
negative	it said the voucher was invalid so i emailed the go groopie .
negative	i waited a few_days and received no response so emailed them again , again receiving no response .
negative	i then sent them a few messages directly through the contact form on the website with no luck .
negative	i couldn_'_t find a phone number anywhere .
negative	luckily i paid with paypal so was able to open a claim .
negative	again there was nothing from the company so i escalated the claim and paypal received no response from then so they refunded my money .
negative	it took over a month .
negative	but at_least i got my money back .
negative	do not use this website , they are a scam !
negative	!
negative	if you are tempted , then use paypal so at_least you are protected .
negative	they should not be trading , disgusting
negative	after looking at many websites i had ordered the specific flowers for a blue bunch and my mothers favourite flowers are agapanthus and delphinium - neither of which were in the flowers .
negative	instead there were 0 stems of blue aster and 0 stems of non specific purple flowers .
negative	there were 0 white_roses but they were well out and unlikely to last very long .
negative	very disappointed - not at all what i had ordered .
negative	please can the propper flowers be sent to my mother .
negative	ordered placed and paid for 00 august , 0_weeks_later still no delivery , several emails later i am told that once a parcel has left them its in the hands of the royal_mail - no offer of refund but will replace , and take no responsibility if goes astray .
negative	i will never use nombox again , and even now not sure i will see my items .
negative	i am writing about tesco westwood store , scarborough . i used to shop there regularly , spending about 000 - 000_pounds weekly . accessing the store on foot is a nightmare , you have to walk round the entire outside of the store , the main doors are round the back . i returned a blind i had bought to customer_services , the woman was so horrible , and you would have thought that she was refunding me from her own pocket . there was some fittings missing , but she talked down to me , and i was offended . another time i was in store choosing easter_eggs for 00 people , so was spending a bit of time in that aisle . an assistant was re - stocking with a large trolley in the centre of the aisle . she was looking very stressed , and was obviously displeased with me looking at the display with my trolley . she was only doing her job , but it was her face , as though i was in the way . i went elsewhere . the next incident was awful . i was in the store with 0 children , and an assistant was stocking the biscuit aisle . there was a packet of broken biscuits on a shelf , and my little_girl picked_up a broken piece and ate it . well , the assistant went to town on me , saying she could call the police , it was theft , and was so wrong . i was so upset , i wsa actually buying mobile_phones and the weekly_shop , and i put everything back and left the store crying , and shouting at my little_girl . i have never , ever , been in there again , or shopped at tesco in any other way . also , at that store , if you need to call a taxi , you have to wait outside on the ramp in all_weathers . they are taking over our town too , it will be the final nail in the coffin for scarborough , i can tell you .
negative	if you want a company that :
negative	0 . lies ,
negative	0 . gives you wrong information ,
negative	0 . blames everyone else when things go_wrong ,
negative	0 . are unhelpful ,
negative	0 . have terrible customer service ,
negative	0 . try to rip you off ,
negative	0 . refuse to help you ,
negative	0 . hang up on you
negative	0 . leave you waiting on hold for ages
negative	00 . sends you on wild goose chases
negative	then look no further , because with expedia you have found all that , plus much much more !
negative	!
negative	i was unfortunate_enough to have to have dealt_with expedia last month , and i swear i will never ever again use this dreadful company even if they became the last travel company on the planet .
negative	trying to get a refund from these is like trying to get water out of a stone , only the stone would probably be a lot more helpful and courteous .
negative	their customer service should really change their name to customer disservice , as this gives a much_better portrayal of the service you will receive from expedia .
negative	their staff are rude , arrogant , unhelpful , send you on wild goose chases , hang up on you , refuse to help you out , speak down at you , insist they ' re correct even when all the facts say other wise , ignore your requests and generally don_'_t appear to be able to understand basic english .
negative	very poor website - constantly crashes , pages show up as " page not found ", company take payment info and then website goes down , promise a 0p sale , yet website would not work .
negative	total con !
negative	ordered the mattress which i was informed would take up to 00 days to arrive .
negative	ordered the mattress on the 0th , received it on the 00th .
negative	originally placed order due to having visitors and wanted to use mattress for our guest .
negative	phoned up company twice to chase and to get a delivery date .
negative	the first time i phoned i was informed the mattress was out of stock .
negative	the second time i phoned i was spoken to by a customer service assistant who told me that they had sent me an_email the day after_placing the order asking me to contact them with a delivery date .
negative	i told her i had never received the email and had previously been informed the mattress was out of stock .
negative	the assistant was very argumentative , she spoke over me and was extremely rude .
negative	i was not being listened to as a customer .
negative	based on my experience i would not recommend this company .
negative	it states 0 - 00 working_days to receive order , i am still_waiting since 00th_oct_0000 , still no sign of order .
negative	have called them today and they said item still not dispatched and would be next week now after they said they would be with me last_week !!
negative	all paid up but no goods , will not be using them again !
negative	very bad and poor customer service
negative	we ordered a small shed from internet_gardener last_week .
negative	when we were sent a letter to advise of the delivery date and asking us to contact the internet_gardener themselves to rearrange if it wasn_'_t convenient , we immediately called to reschedule to a more suitable day to ensure that somebody would be here to accept the delivery .
negative	i was reassured on the phone that this wouldn_'_t be a problem , and that the courier company would be contacted immediately to advise them of the change of date .
negative	not only did the courier turn_up on the original date , he then tried to deliver to our neighbours , who were obviously unwilling to take in such a large item .
negative	to the couriers credit , they worked their route around our house so that they were able to come_back later to redeliver , when thankfully we were back from work .
negative	they told us that they were never informed of the change of date .
negative	when we received the assembled shed it was packaged terribly , wrapped in shrink_wrap with huge gaps and tears in it .
negative	some of the panels were damaged , which thankfully my boyfriend has_been able to fix himself .
negative	we had high_hopes for the service from internet_gardener and have unfortunately been let_down on this occasion .
negative	we would be very cautious_about using their services again
negative	ordered a bed realised it was too_big and i am being charged to change it !!!!
negative	arghhhh
negative	i would not use this website again .
negative	i wanted tickets for prince igor at the london coliseum and somehow got onto this website instead of the official coliseum website .
negative	this cost me dearly .
negative	the tickets cost £_00 more on this website than the official website for no advantage whatsoever .
negative	and of course i am unable to cancel them .
negative	also note that when you purchase tickets on this website they do not disclose the face value of the purchased tickets .
negative	this has to be for a reason !
negative	i ordered and paid for a print to be made and delivered at the most expensive next_day delivery ( for a birthday_gift ).
negative	the print arrived 0_days_later - too late for the birthday surprise .
negative	i called printspace to ask if they could reprint at their expense so i could collect in person and avoid the problem .
negative	they said no - it was too expensive .
negative	i work in the industry and don_'_t understand your logic - the price of a reprint versus losing me as a long_term customer does not add up .
negative	really disappointing .
negative	your website is misleading - ordering a print at lunchtime and paying for next_day delivery implies that you will get the print the next_day not up 00hours plus later ...
negative	its a shame as i liked your company and would have been happy to continue using your services - but in light of my recent experience - i will not use your services again .
negative	didn_'_t deliver my items .
negative	no response or explaination .
negative	ignored my emails .
negative	no customer service .
negative	had to cancel payment myself as they where just going to keep it .
negative	very very disappointing .
negative	use a reputable_company , not play . com !
negative	p0g might be cheap but please do not use them .
negative	check their no compensation items list and prohibited items list .
negative	these cover every item known to man , which then covers them for never paying any compensation out , even when they are proven to be at fault .
negative	they will still take payment and allow you to take out extra insurance for your precious items but never tell you they are not actualy covered , untill you try to make a claim .
negative	i have now had 0 expensive items smashed by them and these were not fragile items but they still managed to smash them and of course the scam comes into place and no compensation .
negative	they don_'_t actualy employ proper drivers with vans , any old herbet turns_up in their old banger , no wonder everything gets broke or ' lost '.
negative	so pay a bit extra and employ a proper delivery firm .
negative	be warned .
negative	bad treatment
negative	products were nothing like advertised ones - staff difficult and unhelpful do not order from this company - even_though they say they always publish reviews good or bad they never published mine - couldn_'_t_believe my luck when asked by this independent reviewer to rate my experience !!
negative	believe me it was bad .
negative	i cannot say strongly enough that i would never advise anyone to deal with this company , their products or their staff - save_yourself a lot of trouble and shop elsewhere .
negative	after having saved up for 0_months i finally had enough money to buy my boys some wardrobes for their new bedroom , i didn_'_t want flat_pack furniture as my husband and i don_'_t have the time or energy after working all week and i wanted them to be perfect .
negative	how wrong was i !
negative	the delivery driver turned_up at 0 . 00am on 00 . 00 . 00 and moaned that my children were still asleep in the room so left the furniture at the top of the stairs and left .
negative	as we unpacked the furniture we were happy with the first wardrobe even_though i thought they would be more solid paying £_000 each but the second wardrobe had a chunk out of the bottom and the delivery drivers had already left .
negative	i phoned the customer_services on a 0000 number costing me more money only to be told they would replace part of the wardrobe , after telling them this was not acceptable they told me i would have to wait a week for a new one and the delivery would be on 00 . 00 . 00 ( yesterday ) .
negative	i had to take yet another day off work and when i unpacked the wardrobe the packaging had been stapled to the wood leaving a huge scratch mark on the front .
negative	also the doors were not aligned properly and so i set about phoning again and was told if i kept the wardrobe they would give me £_00 . 00 refund , which i refused as i paid £_000 and now as i have no more days off until christmas i have to wait_until 00st_september so it can be delivered on a saturday !!!
negative	i am_disgusted with the way i have been treated and still have no wardrobe and no compensation !
negative	argos i would suggest you get new handy men and delivery drivers and i sit and wait for yet another wardrobe !!
negative	lets_hope its perfect so i can finally have a complete new bedroom for my children .
negative	after being exited at the unusual party ideas , i was greatly disappointed to have paid £_00 . 00 to receive the order the next_day before 00 only for the incompetent person to have sent the order to the wrong post_code therefore not getting the order .
negative	worse still on phoning partyrama no apology or offer of the £_00 . 00 !!
negative	i was not able to have the order of well over_£_000 . 00 because it was the last time i could guarantee being in to sign for the order which was for my 00th_birthday which was going to be difficult enough due to the passing away of my father earlier in the year !!!
negative	my party was ruined and nobody cared !!!
negative	i am surprised and appalled at the lack of customer service .
negative	i feel very very let_down by partyrama .
negative	they have not sent my item bought on the 00th of jan .
negative	i have also written twice and not received a reply .
negative	rubbish company .
negative	i bought some glasses and they sent the wrong ones .
negative	they put the wrong product on their site , it was their mistake , which to be fair they admitted but it '_s a nightmare to return them , they soon took my money i just want it back , simple .. it '_s hard when you can '_t just pick_up the phone as they ' re in spain .
negative	i '_ve tried_ringing once but they weren_'_t very helpful .
negative	i will go elsewhere in future .
negative	i ordered a dress on october 00th , it still has not arrived !
negative	tried to call them but after listening to inane music for 00_minutes i gave up !
negative	i have queried my order 0 times by email , every time i get a standard reply apologizing to all_sorts of possible complaints but not actually to me .
negative	they may sound cheap but if they take your money , hold on to it for a few month and never send the goods , it is very expensive !
negative	i will avoid them in future and post this review on other_sites !
negative	i ordered a steam_mop through kgb , when the mop never arrived , i wrote to kgb numerous_emails asking for a refund , they did not even answer . if you want to use these sites stick to groupon , i had a similar problem with one of their deals and they refunded me without_any_problems ! i have now referred the case to my credit_card provider .
negative	...
negative	i ordered items never recieved them .
negative	no refund ! no item !
negative	do not buy from them !!!!
negative	!
negative	i was extremely disappointed with the service and delivery from serenata_flowers .
negative	previous feedback had made them seem as if they were so dependable and used quality flowers .
negative	my mother is quite old and i stated on my order to " please be patient " as one of the options when making my order .
negative	when i rang my mother to wish her a happy mother '_s day , she did not sound as happy as i thought she would be .
negative	she said she heard someone at the door , but before she got there the person had gone .
negative	the flowers had been left_outside her door , which was not a secure area , as she said things had been stolen from outside peoples homes there before .
negative	she also said all the flowers were wilted and old looking .
negative	i won_'_t be using this company again .
negative	i am so upset that her day was spolied !!
negative	!
negative	during the last few month i have had the most terrible experience with this platform '_s service .
negative	i had posted a review for a company i '_ve been using for quite some time .
negative	without_any explanation whatsoever my review got suspended .
negative	when i tried to find out what was wrong i was asked to provide information and documentations containing personal information .
negative	as i was trying to be helpful i sent them what they requested and for weeks there was no response .
negative	during this time i was unable to even log_into my account .
negative	i got banned for no reason and they had basically accused me of posting a lie !
negative	i got so frustrated i tried to contact some of the other people who had posted reviews for the same company .
negative	imagine my surprise when i found out i was not the only one going through all this .
negative	" trust " pilot had requested at_least three more people for documentation containing information about their purchases and their addresses and phone numbers !
negative	who do they think they are ?
negative	now a few email complaints later i was finally granted the permission to use their service again .
negative	my initial review was deleted .
negative	i would not be surprised if this one gets deleted , too .
negative	apparently if you write something they do not like your review disappears .
negative	and your account is to follow .
negative	edit_:
negative	i just found out that there were other people who went through the same issues but their reviews did not get deleted and are still on the site .
negative	i would very much like to receive an explanation .
negative	why was my review deleted ?
negative	what exactly didn_'_t trustpilot like about it ?
negative	was it against some rules ?
negative	what was the reason ?
negative	i believe i deserve an explanation .
negative	does not work and haven_'_t got any packageing to send back will not buy again unless you can send another that works
negative	express delivery , £ 0 . 00 , slowest delivery still_haven_'_t received my dogs_medication which he needed 0_days ago .
negative	why pay express delivery , nothing express about it .
negative	also emailed to say one of the items had been cancelled due to stock , 0_days after order , took my money for it rather_than saying out of stock .
negative	waited for so long and now the full order isn_'_t turning_up .
negative	have to pay vet prices again until they arrive .
negative	i will not use this company again , i would rather pay more and actually get my order
negative	i had an order of 00 t - shirts that needed printing within 0 week , i contacted workwear_express and paid for advertised 00 hour express delivery as the weekend doesn_'_t count .
negative	on the day the t - shirts where due be dispatched , workwear emailed me to tell me that they where unable to fulfil my order until the week after offering me a refund on the express delivery which was absolutely unacceptable as the t - shirts was for an event that weekend , this left me 00hours to either find another company which were able to screen print the t - shirts , or let the 00 children know they will have no uniform for their big event .
negative	thinking this was not an option , i phoned around as many companies as possible and managed to find a company who could do them in such a short time .
negative	although this came at an extra_cost out of my pocket it was worth it to have the children '_s t - shirts ready .
negative	this was the first time i had used workwear_express and defiantly the last , will not be bringing my business to them again .
negative	i ordered flowers from serenata_flowers as a present for my mums_birthday and was so disappointed when she received them as most of the flowers were dead .
negative	they look nothing like the picture displayed on the website , my mum has a keen interest in flowers and was upset on how they looked when they were delivered .
negative	i will not be using this site again
negative	as a specialist shop in electronics you would think that they would have a wide_selection of solder , not so .
negative	they don_'_t even have something as basic as simple as 00 / 00 0 . 00mm solder .
negative	the 0mm solder takes far too long to melt , and the tips for the solder irons are poor , they should at_least be chisel , not point .
negative	i have brought a few things online from cash_generators and my experience is gettin worse many items i have brought appear in stock online they then proceed to take my money and after over a week of waiting and nothing turns_up i then phone which ever store i have brought from to find out the item i have ordered is out of stock and they will issue me a refund why do they not bother to ring or email me as soon as they realise its out of stock not wait_till i ring to do sumthing about it
negative	i ordered the bags for a charity_event to share things to the poor and needy .
negative	i paid for a next_day am delivery , i didn_'_t get it the next_day ( thursday ) , i patiently_waited for friday , i didn_'_t get it on friday , saturday was the day of the event .
negative	i still didn_'_t get it so i called on monday and the staff that spoke to me found out that it wasn_'_t even sent at all , and she was telling_me she wonders why that should be .
negative	she was even more shocked than i was .
negative	bought two pasta dishes to take to my holiday home for a quick arrival meal .
negative	the smell when cooking meatballs with pasta was reminiscent of rotten cat_food .
negative	my husband found bone chips grissle and fatty lumps in the meatballs . totally inedible .
negative	we also bought a spaghetti_bolognese it also had bones in the sauce .
negative	i contacted tesco via_facebook asked them to chase their suppliers .
negative	in a situation like this their_rivals would reimburse or offer a goodwill voucher ,
negative	they wrote a meaningless reply to get_rid of the enquiry
negative	i will use ocado sainsbury and waitrose in future
negative	morrisons are streets_ahead on quality
negative	the only good point in my area is that they have a pay at pump service station and the staff are generally nice polite people
negative	hermes have alsorts of tracking_information that is totally_untrue and waste your time waiting in for the non arriving parcel
negative	if by some miracle an item does turn_up they will throw it into the back garden or leave it by a rear door and leave no card
negative	you are unable to contact them as a recipient and have to make endless calls to suppliers to sort things out
negative	i actively avoid suppliers now who use hermes which is a shame as this includes companies such as house of fraser
negative	they left a package containing a £_000 coat in a wet cardboard package at the back door at christmas time
negative	make the post_office look like a fabulous service
negative	if i am unfortunate_enough to have to contact them i use the new business form as there is a slight chance they may read it unlike any customer service enquiry
negative	worst company i have ever dealt_with
negative	my order was pending for many days .
negative	when i enquired , i was told some products were missing .
negative	i then asked them to wait_until all products were in .
negative	they said ok but they went_ahead and sent what they had .
negative	i thought they had gathered them all .
negative	when i receivedthem , one was missing and i was not believed at first that i was telling the truth .
negative	will definitely not buy again .
negative	ordered on 00 . 00 . 00 no reply .
negative	i emailed 0 times and still nothing !
negative	i live in australia and have used iflorist many a time before ....... however i will not be using th again unless this is resolved !!
negative	i '_ve spent nearly_£_000 with this company over the past 0 years , and customer loyalty is clearly not rewarded !
negative	!
negative	i ordered a plant for my friend for mother '_s day , and incorrectly_entered the postcode .
negative	within 0 minutes of placing the order i had emailed them the correct details .
negative	no response .
negative	so i emailed them again within 00_hours .
negative	no response .
negative	i emailed them a third time 00_hours_later .
negative	no response .
negative	i then received an_email to say they '_ve been delivered - hurrah !!
negative	so i clicked on the tracking_link ......... only to see that the order has not been delivered because of " wrong_address "!
negative	!
negative	iflorist then finally replied_saying that they were unable to amend the order because of it being busy season , despite their website stating that they need 0 business days to change an order - i gave them far more time than this .
negative	i followed all of the correct processes that they stated to amend an order and yet now i '_m being penalised and offered 00_%_off so that i can reorder !!!!!!!!
negative	quite insulting really , and infuriating !
negative	what i '_d like is a refund from this .
negative	am very disappointed with the complete_lack of communication and disregard , the conflicting_information and lack of service !
negative	!
negative	my flowers have still not been delivered having been due for delivery on the 00th_may .
negative	apparently a phone_call was attempted to let_me know it had not been possible the day after they were due which was a sunday_afternoon and i was out .
negative	after that no attempt was made to inform_me .
negative	luckily i was able to find out through my sister that the flowers had not been delivered to her mother - in - law which could have been several weeks down the line , if at all otherwise .
negative	the money has_been taken from my account which i think is disgraceful .
negative	i emailed the company and they claim to have only received a blank reply from me which i only found out when i e_- mailed again , not because they let_me know the e_- mail was blank and that is where things are at today .
negative	i have been offered a full_refund or an upgraded delivery but who_knows if that will actually happen .
negative	i will never use this company again and for anyone reading this , if you decide to do so , make_sure you find out if the flowers actually reach their destination .
negative	only one of the items have arrived and having tried to contact chemist - 0 - u about the outstanding one they havent responded .
negative	also , i bought the first items mid - march and on 0nd_april they automatically took another payment , when their terms stated they would be monthly .
negative	i agreed on 00 pounds for my phone .
negative	due to illness i wasn_'_t able to make the post_office to post my phone on time and they deducted money off the 00 pounds for being late .
negative	i got an_email over a week_ago to say my phone has_been accepted and the cheque was on its way and it still_hasn_'_t arrived .
negative	too expensive read small_print they won_'_t cover you under many circumstances
negative	i purchased inks when they arrived they were not compatible with my printer even_though the website states they are .
negative	i phoned the customer service and was told to remove the inks and wipe the cartridge and re - try .
negative	still it didn_'_t work .
negative	no mention of a refund or exchange more things to try .
negative	the cartridges dont work and are not compatible .
negative	never had such a disappointing experience as a customer .
negative	they took money for my item nearly 00 days ago now .
negative	they ignored several complaint emails .
negative	they continue to send group emails about there is admin issues and your item is on its way but its not .
negative	then today another email including a form i had already filled out 00 - 00 days ago .
negative	i regret to say following this experience i will be avoiding this company from hereon as they clearly do not care about the individuals involved .
negative	groupon provides a far more efficient and satisfactory experience and when that fails for what ever reason , they are more genuinely_concerned_about the individuals and give small_amounts of complimentary compensation unlike wowcher .
negative	cheap and nasty
negative	had used iflorist a number of times so didn_'_t_hesitate in using them again for a boquet for mothering_sunday .
negative	big mistake .
negative	the roses that were delivered were dead .
negative	rang customer_services on monday 00th_march and was told i had to email a picture of the flowers .
negative	i explained the recipient was disabled , over 000_miles from me and relys on the help of carers and that to get a photos would be difficult .
negative	was told it was company policy and nothing could be done .
negative	so far i have written to the md twice ( with the photos they demanded ) and not even received the courtesy of an acknowledgement of my letter .
negative	have left messages for him to call me , no response .
negative	rang customer_services and was asked to email copies of my correspondence to the supervisor .
negative	i attached a read receipt to my email , it hasn_'_t been opened .
negative	rang again , supervisor not available to speak to me and was told i had allow them 0_days for my complaint to go through their escalation process .
negative	they have had since 00th_march , it '_s now 0th_april .
negative	received an_email claiming the florist has run_out of roses and so has the wholesaler , yet they are still advertising roses on their website , would i like different flowers ?
negative	declined offer and asked for the flowers i had paid for .
negative	chased iflorist again , no response , no replacement flowers , no refund , nothing .
negative	this company claims 000_% satisfaction_guaranteed .
negative	they don_'_t know the meaning of customer service .
negative	how they win the awards mentioned on their website is beyond me .
negative	ordered my lenses on a wednesday .
negative	paid for 0st_class delivery .
negative	a week_later i am still_waiting for them to show up .
negative	think_twice , if product is delivered faulty then you have to pay to return it , you then have to pay to have it re - delivered to you , disgusting service !
negative	i ordered two arrangements / bouquets of flowers on behalf of my mother to be delivered to two of her neighbours totalling_£_00 . 00 .
negative	as i do not live_locally was unable to see the flowers , however i emailed one of the neighbours and this is their comment :
negative	" the flowers that you arranged for mum '_s christmas_present to us were disappointing .
negative	some of them didn_'_t open and none of them lasted long .
negative	it was a shame as they did look smart on arrival although there was not very much colour in the bunch ."
negative	i would imagine the other neighbours would be the same as the order was identical .
negative	i will not be ordering off the company again as wrong item sent they did not send me the right item out straight_away had to pay for another if i wanted it
negative	appalling customer communication , i rang every week for over 0_months , they kept saying it was in the post but it never came .
negative	i left phone messages and numerous_emails but no wonder ever replied .
negative	finally ipad was returned after 0_weeks with new screen but not properly attached so ipad doesnt work at all now .
negative	have complained via_email but no response .
negative	i requested a refund but they refused .
negative	thanks my repair_centre for making me pay 00 pounds for nothing !
negative	i saw on " all my shoes " that rubbersole were offering a 00_%_discount on all orders over_£_000 .
negative	i ordered boots which were over_£_000 but did not receive a discount .
negative	rubbersole said this was because " all my shoes " is nothing to do with them .
negative	i suggest rubbersole sort_out this apparent anomaly before they have any more disgruntled_customers .
negative	sent my phone on the day it was approved somehow it hasnt made it there ???
negative	tried to contct with no joy .... was worth more than 00_quid coud this be the reason ?
negative	every other phone was next to no value got there just fine !
negative	!
negative	i am a very disgruntled customer and will not buy from , or recommend , serenata .
negative	from booking , when i had problems using a discount_voucher , to delivery the whole_process was very disorganised .
negative	i attribute most of this to serenata , and admit that i attached redelivery instructions to the wrong order number however i did mention the name of the recipient and the delivery address therefore who ever read the email did not take_note of the contents .
negative	the delivery times were late in the day which is not ideal when flowers have been despatched the previous evening .
negative	my overall opinion is that the service is badly_let_down by not being_able to speak to a person , emails answered within hours is not an efficient way to operate especially when the answers are sent to a web_page with an emailed link which cannot be opened on ipad etc .
negative	i bought 00 " human_hair , it was so thin i had to go online to find more as it just wasn_'_t enough for a full head .
negative	i found what i needed on ebay at half the price !
negative	wish i had looked there first instead of wasting my money !
negative	i placed an order on 00th_oct which was due to be delivered 0nd nov .
negative	item never came .... when i emailed my protein they said they didnt have enough stock and would let_me know when they had more stock and item would be dispatched .
negative	i then asked for a refund and was told it would take a few_days , now 0_weeks on i am still_awaiting refund and have had to open a claim with paypal to try and get money back .
negative	could never get through to customer_services on phone either .... or on one occasion i did it was the overflow and the girl said she would make_sure someone rang me back ( guess_what ..... am still_waiting for return call ) terrible service ..... would never use again .
negative	where do i start .
negative	tried to sell eurovision tickets .
negative	ups lost them on way to buyer .
negative	someone in viagogo who clearly doesnt know how to do their job properly processes this incorrectly and 0 . 0_months later i am still_waiting for my money .
negative	each time i call i get told its going to be another week ( have been calling for a few_weeks now ) but i just called now and have been told its going to be another 0_weeks !!!!!
negative	why you ask ?
negative	no reason it just will .
negative	i guess i was lied to last time i called .
negative	so thats 0_months without me getting payment and they are going to take a fee for this ?
negative	?
negative	i asked for a manager call back and was told it would take 00_hours .... 000 hours_later and i am still_waiting .
negative	never again will never use viagogo and will make_sure this review is on every website possible .
negative	unacceptable .
negative	**** 00 / 00 - have been calling over last few_weeks and have been sworn that i will get paid by today and there is nothing !!!
negative	why do they keep lying ???
negative	why dont they just pay the money i am owed ?
negative	what crooks !!
negative	dont use viagogo .
negative	i am using my contacts in the media to spread the word about this terrible organisation .
negative	***** 00 / 00 - still have not been paid .
negative	***** 00 / 00 - still have not been paid ( although called yesterday was told i would get paid today ).

negative	i ordered flowers for my mother '_s birthday and was very disappointed with them .
negative	what i thought she would be receiving was nothing like the photo on your website .
negative	yes they did arrive on time but looked rather wilted and there was more greenery than flowers .
negative	to be honest i was really disappointed with them and my mother even commented on them which made me very embarrassed !
negative	i have sent an e_- mail complaining but i am still_awaiting a reply !!
negative	!
negative	having signed_up to an agreement scottish_power have now completely_ignored it and sent a cash invoice with extremely high unit rates on .
negative	have phoned them 0 times and hung on and on and given up on all occasions .
negative	am trying to do so again now as i write this .
negative	they used to be such a good company , and easy to deal with , what has happened ?
negative	i cannot log_into my account either , wont accept my password which i know is correct .
negative	this is a warning to anyone_thinking of using this letting_agency .
negative	be warned that no matter what condition you leave the property in they will not return your deposit .
negative	this is not only my experience but that of many other dissatisfied learmont customers that i have spoken to .
negative	please if you find yourself in the unfortunate position to be already dealing_with this company , take pics of everything , do not accept any thing verbally , get yourself a good lawyer , dont expect your deposit back and do not expect any kind of customer service .
negative	there are many letting agencies so please find yourself one with good reviews and avoid this company like the plague .
negative	absolutely usless and i would never use them again .
negative	communication was non - existent .
negative	i had to actually phone them and asked where my order was , only to be told the product was now discontinued .
negative	apparently i had been emailed ... i '_m still_waiting !!
negative	this also happened to my partner with a different order !
negative	!
negative	not at all happy and not the way to treat customers !
negative	the ferry , which was scheduled to leave at 00 : 00 , was delayed by one hour .
negative	this was fine , and certainly not fatal re : my travel_plans for later that day to get to casablanca .
negative	the ferry left at 00 : 00 , almost 0 hours_later .
negative	no explanation was given .
negative	it meant that the train i took to casa arrived at 0 :_00am .
negative	i was so rushed that i couldn_'_t wait for the bus from tanger med to tanger ville , and had to pay 000 moroccan dirham for a taxi .
negative	it was a stressful experience , made even more so by the fact that the travellers were told nothing , other than the initial information about being delayed by an_hour .
negative	i '_ll never use this ferry service again , and would not recommend to other_travellers .
negative	i have been waiting 0_days and so far have recieved nothing .
negative	i do not live in a remote_area and have not been contacted about any_problems with the order so do not see why it is taking so long .
negative	at this point i just hope something is going to arrive soon .
negative	i am totally_disgusted with the service that euroflorist has delivered .
negative	on friday , 00 june i ordered a bunch of flowers and a bottle of rose wine for my sister - in - law in the hague as a surprise birthday (!)
negative	present the next_day because i could not be at her_birthday_party .
negative	i paid €_00 . 00 for this service and asked that the florist call my sister - in - law prior to delivery .
negative	on saturday , 00 june the flowers were delivered to the neighbour '_s house but no wine !
negative	i called on monday , 00 june to complain and i was told that this would be chased up immediately .
negative	it was not .
negative	on friday , 00 june my sister - in - law received a telephone message to ask where the wine should be delivered to but no telephone_number was left for her to call back , i . e .
negative	does the leg work for her own present !
negative	i called today , 00 june to complain but euroflorist are - guess_what - closed already .
negative	i must now wait_until monday , 00 june ( 00 days after the order was placed ) to sort this out .
negative	i want my money back .
negative	it will only go part way to compensating 0 expensive telephone_calls from the uk and still no delivery of the famous bottle of wine 00 days late for the birthday !!!!
negative	my money has_been taken but my complaint has_been as good as dismissed .
negative	euroflorist has no idea of service .
negative	i will never , ever use them again and neither should you good reader .
negative	i asked for a quote and they took it as i had accepted the policy .
negative	i specifically told them that i need to speak with my husband first .
negative	i smelt a rat when they asked for my bank details .
negative	i have been inundated with post from legal and general as a result .
negative	do not give them your bank details as they will start up a direct_debit with out your permission .
negative	the lady was called penny and she was very nice but just after business .
negative	it was cheaper but a lesser policy and my husband and i need time to consider our options .
negative	if i ever was going to use them they have totally put me off .
negative	took over an existing business line with a change of company name etc .
negative	service provided superb but talktalk will not send invoices out to me in the new business name despite_numerous_calls about this .
negative	i refuse to pay an invoice in someone_else '_s name !!!
negative	!
negative	as always the prices for the items ordered were very reasonable and i received my order very quickly .
negative	i had to ask for my money to be refunded from this company who
negative	were happy to take payment but not to communicate with me in any way , either by email or phone , to tell me that the frames i had ordered had been_discontinued .
negative	i had to repeatedly chase them , and only now , a month later , did they tell me that they could not supply my order !
negative	i am waiting for my refund , which has not happened yet ......
negative	items never arrived .
negative	refused refund !
negative	die_blumen waren teilweise braun oder abgebrochen .
negative	der rest war noch nicht aufgeblüht .
negative	nicht wirklich was man fuer 00 euro erwartet
negative	my bed never turned_up despite this company saying theyd deliver it on three different occasions !
negative	0 wasted days off work .
negative	first they told me it was out of stock , then i was told the delivery men ' lost ' my bed , then the most hilarious excuse ever , i was told there ' wasnt enough room for it on the van '!!
negative	!
negative	customer srvice will keep you waiting for 00_minutes plus just to avoid speaking to you .
negative	i think they took payement in full for the bed and next_day delivery knowing they woudlnt deliver .
negative	i would never use this company .
negative	partyrama prices were relatively higher than other uk party stores .
negative	i '_m an international purchaser and my purchases were cancelled after debits went through my account .
negative	i '_m still_awaiting my refund .
negative	paypal wasn_'_t succesful on ur site !
negative	on the plus_side , partyrame stock everything required for a party .
negative	other stores store bits and pieces .
negative	my most_recent experience of the short - stay car - park at edinburgh_airport is not the best : i parked my car in an end space which would only ever have 0 car beside it , below a light and as far away from the 0 space beside it as possible , all to minimise the chance of any damage happening to my car while it was parked there .
negative	my car was left on the thursday_evening and when i returned less_than 0_days_later my car had significant damage to the passenger door , so much so that the whole door has since had to be resprayed !
negative	i reported the damage to the car_park office , but they were less_than helpful , and although i was told someone would be in touch no one has contacted me to date .
negative	that was over 0_weeks_ago .
negative	needless to say i shall be thinking twice before using this car_park again .
negative	i know accidents_happen ( and parking is at your_own_risk ), but the customer service was terrible .
negative	i can not believe what i have just experienced .
negative	absolute disgusting service .
negative	i am almost 0_months pregnant , we received a delivery of some very heavy items .
negative	i asked if driver could just pop the items inside for me as he was simply dumping them outside .
negative	the driver proclaimed he is ' self - employed and has no_obligation to bring the items inside for me '.
negative	when i pointed_out that i was clearly not in a position to be lifting these items , his response was " yeah , i see your problem , but i don_'_t have to take anything inside for you ''.
negative	when i asked him how i was supposed to do it , he shrugged and said " not my problem as it '_s not something i have to do ".
negative	at which point he walked back to his van and drove_off .
negative	leaving me on the doorstep with 0 heavy items and nobody to help me .
negative	still in shock about it .
negative	absolutely apalled .
negative	shame i had to even give 0_star .
negative	would have preferred none .
negative	my son saved his pocket money , xmas & birthday money and bought a laptop at pc_world on the isle of wight .
negative	poor performance we put down to out internet broadband_connection so eventually we upgraded it .
negative	by this time the lap_top was 0_months old .
negative	we took it back as thought it needed repair .
negative	to cut a very long_story_short , they took it in 0 times promising each time to send it to the manufacture and 0 times called us to say it has_been repaired in store .
negative	each time we got it home no difference .
negative	manager was disinterested and told me i had no rights under consumer_law as it was 0_months old and we had to take it up with the manufacturer ( completely_untrue ).
negative	had an_independent technician look at it and he said he had never seen such a low spec computer .
negative	it was not capable of doing what was needed and what we told the salesperson in pc_world we needed it for , i . e .
negative	homework and gaming .
negative	my son cannot play games on it as it can '_t cope with most .
negative	i contacted dixons ( ho ) and went right to the top but this made no difference and i am now in the process of going through the on line small_claims court .
negative	they are disputing everything so we just have to wait and see .
negative	i will post the result here when we know .
negative	i can '_t get through to anyone who can refund me my money .
negative	i give them meter_readings but still no money .
negative	on my account it clearly_states how much in credit i am yet they will not refund me .
negative	i call and call and hold on for minimum of 00_mins to get through to yet another recorded_message .
negative	their complaints_department is screened by the abysmal customer service department who can only hold for up to 0 mins to get through to the complaints_department which us obviously not long enough .
negative	they are holding_onto people '_s money .
negative	no wonder the power companies are making huge profits .
negative	they do not employ enough staff and those they do employ have no idea what customer service is .
negative	i am at my wits_end after constantly telephoning them and if i do get through without the line going dead no one calls me back .
negative	very conveniently they have no record of my complaint back in february .
negative	if i didn_'_t pay them i '_d be cut_off yet they think it acceptable to withhold my money ..... scottish_power you are dishonest and a disgrace .
negative	i sent flowers for my elderly_parents wedding_anniversary .
negative	they received them on time .
negative	however , although i had written my greeting for the card , it was just a blank card .
negative	the flowers drooped badly very quickly .
negative	very disappointed and will not be using serenata_flowers .
negative	never ordered anything .
negative	have phoned and asked never to receive email again but still getting thjngs like this .
negative	please don_'_t send me anything_else
negative	i am sorry but as i have not recieved my perfume yet i could not make a review
negative	parcel 0go the worst i have ever come_across , they dont deliver parcel and mark it down as delivered , when a fuss is made they then tell you no it was not delivered courier made a mistake .
negative	you get appologised too and promised it that same day .
negative	0_days on you still_havent got it and they wont answer your emails , live_chat dont help you and you have lost your parcel to the theiving gits .
negative	booked a car and paid for it 0_mths b0 due to fly .
negative	flight delayed out of my control .
negative	when i arrived to pick_up the car their rep had gone home !!
negative	leaving me with no means of transport late at night to get to my destination some 00 mile_away .
negative	wud come out with keys but needed £_00 extra to do so !!
negative	still_waiting an_hour later for te car i paid for .
negative	never use this company there r plenty of better ones about .
negative	this is my 0st and last time to use these_cowboys !!
negative	!
negative	having brought an article from china , and wanted to return my receiver refused to sign for the parcel at the other end , thus resulting in me being bullied_into having the parcel returned as apparently i was suppose to know that the receiver was not going to sign for the parcel .
negative	which makes no sense at all , as to why would i send something if i knew my receiver was not going to accept it !!!!
negative	unreasonable !
negative	now the parcel which apparently has_been delayed in chinese customs now since august time .
negative	i don_'_t_believe them in the slightest , stuck in customs for 0_months and counting !!!
negative	!
negative	interparcel have done nothing proactive to try and get this parcel to me in good time .
negative	i have had to contact interparcel repeatedly , and even escalated it to their customer_services manager [_external_reference_] who has done nothing either .
negative	i have asked for a refund but they won_'_t give me one as they say that they will be only be billed by_fedex , despite the policy on both_parties saying that if the parcel is not delivered within the reasonable time_scale they will refund .
negative	since this has_been going on since august , and it is nearly december and still no word or parcel i think it is safe to say that i am not going to get this back therefore i am going to be seeking action to obtain a refund .
negative	interparcel have asked for all conceivable personal documentation which again was not explained as why they were required which left me feeling very uncomfortable .
negative	staff are not proactive and are too quick to repeatedly say ' i do apologize ' if do apologize then apologize !
negative	evidently your not sorry otherwise you would be doing all you can to get my parcel to me .
negative	0_months and counting waiting for a parcel to be delivered is very unacceptable .
negative	i want a refund !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered bed , paid in full .
negative	less_than 00_hours before delivery was due , i was contacted to say bed was not even in stock .
negative	was told i would be contacted when bed was back in stock but heard_nothing .
negative	on emailing again was given a date when bed was expected back in stock and told somebody would ring me straight_away when it arrived at the warehouse , to arrange next_day delivery .
negative	one week after bed was apparently due back in stock had still heard_nothing so emailed again , this time to say had got fed_up of waiting and wanted to cancel the order .
negative	took them yet another three_days to respond to this email !

negative	i ordered a motor for our washing_machine in july_0000 .
negative	the motor arrived within a few_days .
negative	the engineer then realised that i needed to order a control modules as well , which i promptly did given the good service i had had from interspares thus_far .
negative	the module never arrived , and after trying to speak to interspares '_s customer service department on the phone ( countless messages left ) and by email , and out of sheer frustration i went out and bought another washing_machine .
negative	i continued trying to contact interspares to arrange the return of the motor and a refund but never go a reply .
negative	their customer service extension is never manned , it seems , so i then tried choosing the sales extension , and that was when i spoke to a lady called [_name_removed_], who after_hearing my account instructed me to return the motor for a full_refund and said that the part that had not been delivered would also been refunded .
negative	i posted the motor back to them on [_name_removed_] instruction and was expecting a refund .
negative	several weeks went past and i eventually called my credit_card company to enquire if a refund had been received from interspares .
negative	no refund had been received , so i once again started attempting to contact interspares .
negative	i eventually spoke to [_name_removed_], who appears to be the big wig in the company .
negative	he first said that they had not received the motor and that i was not acting in good faith .
negative	i then managed to find the certificate of posting and called him back the following_day .
negative	by then , he confirmed that the motor had been received but because it had been bolted on to the machine , but never used , they would not refund any money to me .
negative	i tried to explain to [_name_removed_] that the part was only returned because i did not receive the module and that after waiting for about one month i felt that i had waited enough and went out and bought another machine .
negative	simon said that their terms and conditions clearly_stated that parts that had been fitted but not used would not be refunded .
negative	i checked their t & c and found nothing to that effect .
negative	he also promised that a refund for the part that never arrived would be made .
negative	after waiting for about one month , i contacted them again as i still had not received a refund and was told that it would be done there and then .
negative	i have now received only a partial_refund because they saw fit to deduct the cost of returning the motor to them from the refund for the part that was never delivered .
negative	so not only am i out of £_00 . 00 paid for the motor , but they also took over_£_00 . 00 from the refund that they did process .
negative	i was instructed to use their freepost returns service which now they have charged me for .
negative	i will file a claim in the small_claims court and report this company to trading_standards .
negative	i advise everyone out there not to deal with this company or with [_name_removed ].
negative	they are not serious and are out to rip people off .
negative	i wish i had read the reviews on this company before ordering anything from them .
negative	you have been warned .
negative	deal with them at your_own peril !
negative	do your homework and search for reviews on this company .
negative	i wish i had done that before i had any dealings with them .
negative	had to drive 00 miles to brighton to go on a course i was booked on and pay car_parking fees .
negative	the course was cancelled but i was not advised .
negative	was very disappointed as excited_about course and also my wasted petrol , money for parking and time .
negative	we were given a £ 0 voucher but this does not cover my costs .
negative	another lady turned_up also who was not advised .
negative	not very good service
negative	i ordered a gift that i thought was costing me 000 . 00 and it ended_up costing $_000 .
negative	i felt like you had taken_advantage of me .
negative	i will not order anything_else from you .
negative	on a scale of 0 - 00 , i would rate you a 0 .
negative	i placed an order for a ps0_game on 00th_april - marked next_day dispatch expected delivery 00 april , for my son '_s birthday
negative	i waited in - as the item stated it required ' an adult to sign ', and after several phone_calls , was told my order had been despatched and i could expect in 0 - 0_days .
negative	call 0 - informed up to 00 days .
negative	call 0 - oh sorry , your order was cancelled you should have been told and have been refunded , and oh_yes you should have been told when you called earlier as we knew then .
negative	but it '_s not tesco '_s fault of course , it '_s their supplier ....!!!
negative	ridiculous
negative	never never never again .
negative	amazon was £ 0 more , i will pay £_00 more to not use tesco entertainment ever again !
negative	lenses were ordered on 00th_may , not received until 0th_june , this is not 0 - 0 working_days as_described and left me without lens for a week !
negative	never happened before , aweful service !
negative	we ordered balloons together with one helium_canister .
negative	sadly the balloons delivered were faulty and all burst though not even fully filled .
negative	i had to get replacement balloons on sunday morning for my son '_s party which was quite stressing and even then the helium of course wasn_'_t enough to fill all the balloons i needed for each child .
negative	i complained afterwards and asked for a refund but i was told as long as i could only send back the faulty balloons but not the empty helium_canister , which we had of course discarded the same day already , they would not refund anything .
negative	we order these canisters every year but certainly never from this company again .
negative	appalling incompetent untrained staff !!!
negative	i moved_house on 0th_oct_0000 and it took until the middle of feb_0000 to receive all the money they owed me as i was in credit when i moved , after many expensive phone_calls and being on hold for a ridiculous_amount of time i was almost reduced to tears of frustration after they credited the wrong account and said i couldnt have my money until they found out where the money had gone , if i wasnt so stubborn i would have given up , but why should they keep my money , please_please dont use them i just wish i had seen this site earlier ..
negative	i wrote email to your service team , havenot got respond at all .
negative	and my goods haven_'_t arrived in 0 month .
negative	don_'_t order from this company , the packaging of tiles is insufficient and you will be stuck with boxes of broken tiles .
negative	reported problem on delivery , still no refund a week_later .
negative	very poor .
negative	i purchased a metal triple giant swing and when it started rusting after only a couple of months i contacted wicken_toys .
negative	basically , they advised that they were unable to do anything about it unless it affected the structure of the swing .
negative	i am therefore pursuing the problem directly with tp .
negative	wicken_toys are very helpful when you are looking to buy their products but the after sales service is extremely poor .
negative	they just didn_'_t want to know .
negative	i would not buy from them again nor recommend them .
negative	i ordered from boohoo . com choose next_day delivery and received dispatching and tracking_information advising next_day delivery would apply .
negative	waited in all day , daren '_t even vacuum up in case i didn_'_t hear the door , you know how impatient these companies can be , and parcel never arrived .
negative	parcel arrived the next_day luckily early before i was due to go out , so i had my clothes for the occasion i was going out for .
negative	boohoo . com were very nice and gave_me 00_% of the next order but i feel it was not their fault it was the fault of the courier and this could end up jeopardising boohoo '_s reputation .
negative	paid £_000 for two tickets which would have cost half if i had booked direct !!!
negative	!
negative	eflorist took £_00 out of my bank_account , have never delivered any flowers and are ignoring all of my attempts to contact customer service .
negative	this is the worst service i have ever received , my mother '_s birthday was ruined and not only have i never had an_apology , but the flowers have never arrived at all and i '_ve had no refund .
negative	fuming .
negative	flowers did not arrive on special day as requested .
negative	full payment taken and email_confirmation sent to me .
negative	i have contacted the company but still_awaiting reply and there is no telephone_number for me to call .
negative	very very dissapoonted
negative	i '_m still_waiting !
negative	ordered some olay cream - pack of 0 .
negative	my transaction went through and money was taken from my account .
negative	however , i subsequently received notification i had received a refund .
negative	i can only gather this was due to the item not being in stock - although i was not offered any explanation as to
negative	a ) why they were advertising items they didn_'_t stock
negative	b ) why they took money from my account for items they didn_'_t stock
negative	c ) why i was offered no explanation and or apology that the item was not in stock and hence was not going to be sent to me .
negative	not impressed at all and certainly won_'_t use again .
negative	the slowest delivery ever !
negative	last_year was exactly the same i should have learnt from last time but i ordered some items i was told i would receive 0 working_days_later , its been 00 working_days and i still_haven_'_t received an_email_confirming a dispatch of my order , i contacted elc who couldn_'_t tell me why they hadn_'_t been dispatched even_tho they are in their warehouse , couldn_'_t tell me when they will be dispatched , and that i will have to wait a further 0 working_days when they are eventually dispatched , so frustrating .
negative	i would recommend their products , i wouldn_'_t recommend their online store !
negative	please do not buy anything from them !
negative	0 .
negative	they allege that the items will be dispatched in 0 working day ... but what they do not say is that they need 0 to 0 working_days for delivery !!
negative	so , it appears as a next_day delivery , but it is not !
negative	0 .
negative	postage fees are quite_expensive compared to other online merchants and most of the items are not available in the same time - frame .
negative	so you end up paying extra fees in order to split the delivery and get the available items in 0 - 0_days and wait up 00 days for the remaining ones !
negative	0 .
negative	they say they are happy to refund without_fuss any items you may be dissatisfied with ... but when you request a return_label from their website , you are charged 0 . 00 pounds which will be withdrawn from your refund !
negative	!
negative	0 .
negative	there is specification box close to each item ... one of them refers to delivery but none of the wording used refers this return charge !
negative	0 .
negative	do not leave your telephone_number for a call - back .
negative	their customer service is so busy that they will never call you back !
negative	0 .
negative	when you point out these issues , they are saying that it is written in their t &_cs ... when you click on them , you end up with 00 clauses !!!
negative	when you ask if their customers do read these before ordering , the response i had was " of course not "!
negative	so , please don_'_t ... don_'_t order anything from them !
negative	where do i start !
negative	took payment and order on tuesday , called them on the wednesday to explain that i needed the gift to be delivered before the friday of that week as this was a business address and there would be no one to sign for it after .
negative	was advised that this would be dleivered before this time as there is usually a 00 hour delivery turnaround .
negative	stressed this was a christmas_present and the recipient would be leaving the country on the sunday - was told this would not be a problem .
negative	called on thursday to see if it had been delivered , answer was no however they would call me at 0am on the friday_morning to give me an estimation on delivery time , no call was made .
negative	after chasing all day and after_spending no less_than 0 hours on the phone to these people over several calls throughout the day i was advised on different occassions that ;
negative	the gift would not be delivered by friday as promised
negative	citylink was at fault
negative	they would call me back with an update
negative	no alternate address could be used for saturday delivery
negative	it was down to be returned to the depot as it may be damaged
negative	they were unsure where the package was
negative	they were unable to ship one to thier show_room so i could collect it
negative	the customer service manager was on lunch
negative	the customer service manager wasnt in that day ?
negative	the customer service manager had gone home !
negative	so in the unfortunate circumstance that the recipient will not get thier gift for christmas , i am advised that they can deliver it again at a date ' convenient ' for me in the new year , however there may be an additional_charge .
negative	what a joke !
negative	if you want a headache and the opportunity to speak to a number of people who will give you the run around all day and no resolution to a issue they should take owenership to resolve , then uk sports_imports are the company to part your money with .
negative	avoid at all costs !
negative	!
negative	as a business customer i expect a response from a lodged complaint .
negative	not an_automated email .
negative	birmingham parcelforce depot have given me excuses ranging_from , the parcel was outsourced to another courier , the driver has no mobile and no means of communication in his van , a manager has_gone out with the driver to locate the parcel etc .
negative	this depot are obviously having fun at my expense !
negative	good luck with that attitude .
negative	i am already looking for another company .
negative	as i type this i am 00_minutes into holding for a customer service representative .
negative	the automated_system initially said that i was caller number 0 and estimated my wait time to be 00_minutes .
negative	as i moved down in the queue , my wait time started to go up .
negative	so not happy , considering that the first time i called , they picked_up the phone and hung_up .
negative	i have been first in line for the past 0 minutes and the time is still going up .
negative	i ordered on monday_morning and my order still has not shipped ... never again !
negative	my account states that i have been paid , alas my bank_account says not !
negative	since 00st_july i have been fobbed_off with many excuses , the last one via_email last wednesday apologising (!)
negative	that they were experiencing system failer but that i would receive my refund after 00 working hours , these expired yesterday and there is still no credit into my bank as of now !
negative	i cannot_believe those people that have had a ' happy ' result !
negative	i would not recommend this company !
negative	totally let_down both by advice from customer_services on the phone and the reps at the airport .
negative	told to drive in dangerous weather to arrive at the airport ( 0 accidents and one van sideways in the fast lane , down to one lane we could drive in in snowstorm - we were told we had to drive or we '_d lose our holiday without checking in - it was frightening .)
negative	checked in at airport , no - one knew anything , some people giving out vouchers like smarties , some refusing to give anything out at all .
negative	the pressure got to the staff and they were rude .
negative	finally boarded plane and rushed on like naughty children - after 00_hours of being_messed about .
negative	obnoxious cabin_crew who we had the ' pleasure ' of putting up with drunk and loud next to the pool for most of what was left of our ' relaxing ' holiday .
negative	a letter to thomas_cook later - they weren_'_t in the slightest bit interested .
negative	neither are we - we won_'_t use them or any of their partner companies again .
negative	i pains me to even give them 0_star !
negative	they will at every turn try and screw you .
negative	after give me a good price for my phone i sent it off .
negative	they then informed me my phoned was damaged ( rubbish , it was in pristine_condition ) and offered me a substantially_lower price .
negative	after weeks of haggling and threatening to take legal_action_against them to try and get my phone back they called to say that there had been a mistake and my phone was actually undamaged and they would give me the full price .
negative	these people are scammers and they operate with the intention of wearing you down so you will accept a lower price for your mobile .
negative	do not use them !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	p . s .
negative	if anyone is giving 0 / 0_stars then they work for cash 0 phones .
negative	don_'_t be_fooled .
negative	customer service is not what i would expect from an internet company , nor is it like others that i have dealt_with .
negative	i ordered a beanbag but never received a confirmation_email .
negative	when i emailed for advice i got a call back but no details of my order where confirmed even_though i titled my email grey gaming_bean_bag and i had apparently ordered pewter - not even similar .
negative	because i never got a confirmation_email the first i knew if the beanbag being the wrong_colour was when it turned_up .
negative	the company now want me to return it at my expense and are taking no responsibility for any part they played in this error
negative	seeing as the return will cost me £_00 i '_m not going to bother and so i am stuck with a bean_bag i don_'_t want
negative	anyone want to buy a pewter gaming_bean_bag ?
negative	i was told i would receive £_00 for my working phone and only received £_00 .
negative	i will never deal with u again .
negative	iflorist caused my two sons a lot of heartache when they deliverd the floral_tribute to their deceased father '_s funeral late and more impotrtantlt it had xcompletely the wrong message on it .
negative	it took daays for them to acknowledge their mistake and added insult to injury by offering me a complimentary bouquet .
negative	crass and insensitive
negative	placed my order within 0_days they advised delivery and confirmed all goods would be deliveried , the next_day l received a call to say two of the items were out of stock would l pick replacements !!
negative	i called 0 times on the saturday and left messages as all there agents were busy , l then emailed twice from my own email address then through there website still no reply .. got a call on the tuesday advised l wanted to cancel my order attitude was shocking !!!
negative	i then got a further call 0 hours_later asking if l had chosen an_alternative and explained further l want a refund now l am waiting on my refund so this should be fun not !!!!
negative	very disappointed !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered i - caps for my mom and when she hadn_'_t received them 00 days_later i went to my order status .
negative	it stated that my order had been cancelled .
negative	i had not received notification of this so i sent an_email to customer_services as the phone line had closed .
negative	i got a very impersonal reply_saying there had been a problem with my card and i would be getting an_email shortly .
negative	another week has passed and i haven_'_t received an_email , an_apology or a reason_why my card payment was declined .
negative	my mom was left no option but to buy one month '_s supply at an exorbitant price .
negative	poor poor customer service .
negative	as a company and personally we have used eflorist on many occasions with wonderful compliments from the receivers .
negative	unfortunately this did not happen on a recent order as the basket was for a work_colleague and friend on her 00th so i saw them personally .
negative	the flowers were nothing like the ones ordered in colour or description and large areas where you could see the oasis .
negative	i emailed photos and my disappointment to customer service and received a reply_stating they would reply within 00_hours , but three_days_later i had to chase as no response .
negative	after three_attempts of calling i finally got through , but to a receptionist as the customerservice people were busy and she was not warm or friendly .
negative	however she did get a response which was you would give me 00_percent credit with a ok and goodbye .
negative	i was flabbergasted and appalled .
negative	initially i was going to give the benefit of the doubt that it was possibly just a poor florist used , and so i allowed my staff to use you again , but after this response i will be changing our supplier and advising the other friends i have recommended you too not to use you .
negative	it saddens me greatly as one of my remits at work is procurement and i though i had got it so right , but it just goes to show i get it wrong at times .
negative	we thought we were getting a really good deal going with this company and my sister organised everything and we paid the money for the hen_night .
negative	my sister then started having problems with the company saying that they couldn_'_t get us all in the same hotel and that we would be at_least 00mins walk apart_from each other , they also said that the people staying in the hotel had to pay extra money .
negative	my sister constantly tried to get_hold of management at the company and was told that the two members in charge were not available and they would return her call .
negative	no - one ever returned her call and she had to call them back .
negative	she called them back at_least 0 - 0 times but the person she needed to speak to was apparently busy or in and out of meetings all the time .
negative	in the end my sister got so fed_up that she cancelled everything , despite them saying that they wouldn_'_t give her any money back .
negative	in the end they said they would arrange for us all to stay in the hotel but due to all the problems we had already had we all agreed it would be less hassle for us to cancel and for my sister to pay everyone else the money back .
negative	we were worried that something_else would go_wrong on the actual day .
negative	i would avoid this company at all costs the customer service is shocking and all they are interested in is taking your money .
negative	i was expecting a parcel delivery from yodel from goods which i had ordered from a website which i use on a regular_basis .
negative	these goods were worth well over_£_00 .
negative	i was working on my laptop during the day which is next to the window which looks out of my the front of my house .
negative	sure enough a yodel van came up and the man got out from the drivers seat and got into the back of the van and was in there for about 0mins .
negative	the driver then got back in the drivers seat and drove_off .
negative	shortly_after this i received an e_- mail_stating that they had delivered my parcel which they clearly hadn_'_t because i had seen them drive off with no attempt at delivering the package .
negative	it '_s now been over 0 week and yodel are still apparently investigating at to where my parcel is .
negative	this isn_'_t the first time this has happened and it '_s very frustrating to say the least .
negative	i am now avoiding all companies that use yodel as a form of delivery !
negative	i bought and paid for an item on line .
negative	at no time during this process was there any indication to say that this item was out of stock .
negative	it was only when i received a ' phone_call the next_day that i was informed that there is , apparently , little or no control over what is advertised on the website and what is in stock .
negative	i was refunded accordingly but the experience was , altogether , unsatisfactory .
negative	i hope this review helps to improve matters .
negative	i booked an 00 person apartment for a girls ' weekend in madrid at the start of december_0000 .
negative	0_weeks before we were due to make our trip in june_0000 , i found out that the owner had cancelled my booking but not informed me - or house trip .
negative	obviously this wasn_'_t the fault of house trip , but the issues i had were around :
negative	- lack of assistance to find an_alternative property ( 0 phone_call to another owner who didn_'_t answer and they never followed up or tried again )
negative	- money was refunded on request but this was short of the original amount paid and seemed to me to be much more than i would expect simply due to changes in currency_exchange_rate but when i questioned this i was not able to get to the bottom of the situation and was hugely infuriated by the customer_services staff constantly confusing my booking with another ( this happened on more than 0 occasion ) so have eventually come to the conclusion that i will not get anywhere with them and will have to accept being slightly out of pocket .
negative	so they are probably great if you find a property that works out , but as soon as anything_goes_wrong they are difficult to contact and the service is awful .
negative	for that reason , i wouldn_'_t attempt to book through them again as my issue was something that could have so easily been rectified .
negative	ebay has a 00 day cutoff after which they are not prepared to get involved in any_disputes between buyers and sellers .
negative	i bought a large piece of furniture from a joiner selling on ebay and he stated 0 week delivery as each piece is custom_made .
negative	obviously , if there is then a problem with the item , seller , or delivery , the 00 days has passed .
negative	placed an order for anbesol liquid , you took card_details and sent me an_email_confirmation with order number .
negative	i waited five days and then telephoned customer service when order did not arrive , only to be told you had cancelled the order because you had no stock .
negative	i could not understand_why you would take card_details issue an order number if you had no stock , when i have ordered things online before with other_companies if there is no stock they will no let you order it and certainly do not take you card_details making you think you have paid and it is on its way .
negative	it is no fun waiting for a product for five days when you have a teething baby only to be told you had sent me an_email the next_day informing_me you had cancelled the order , which i never received .
negative	i order lots of things from the internet and i have never received such poor unprofessional service before .
negative	you need to change your system so as not to mislead people !
negative	was promised delivery by 0 . 00pm .
negative	i left house to see mother and upon my return a person came to my door and said she was visiting her friend some doors up and was given this box for me .
negative	driver left no message or asked for i . d .
negative	will contact dell about this !
negative	poor web_site , difficult to work around .
negative	poor quantity of goods available .
negative	slow dispatch time .
negative	i ordered the fitflop black boots as_described and pictured on the website .
negative	i paid £_00 for these boots .
negative	when the shoes arrived the picture on the box was correct however the contents inside the box were very different .
negative	they sent me black pumps instead .
negative	i could not be bothered to return them because i was not sure if i would get my money back .
negative	i will never shop with shoetique again , they don_’_t deliver the items pictured on their website .
negative	i still have the box the shoes came in as proof .
negative	i used to love boo_hoo but then they mixed my order up by sending the wrong thing which i needed for the next_day .
negative	then they were out of stock in which i wanted so had to get a refund , desperately wanted that outfit and paid next_day delivery !!!
negative	all to be a waste and then had to waste my time sending it back .
negative	did get an_apology email but that '_s it !!
negative	would have expected something free as an_apology or a discount or something .
negative	some of the flowers were dead and looked really tatty .
negative	i wasn_'_t satisfied at all and they went straight in the bin as i couldn_'_t give them to someone as a gift .
negative	i agree with another review .
negative	brandalley took my money immediately despite my order not being ' ready for at_least 0_days .
negative	when the item was not suitable i returned it via their collect_+ service , where they scanned a bar_code and provided me with a receipt .
negative	the returns_policy_states refund within 00 days of drop_off .
negative	00 days_later and several chasing emails , and i '_d still not had a refund , even_though i provided proof etc .
negative	claimed that my refund would be within 00days or receipt into the warehouse .
negative	only when i complained , saying i would take matters further did they then agree process the refund , which took a further 0_days to show in my account !
negative	order didn_'_t arrive within 0 working_days ( almost 0_weeks ).
negative	rang and told to wait 00 - ridiculous !
negative	almost 0_weeks ???????
negative	rang back on day 00 , was told that wasn_'_t day 00 , day 0 is not when i order , it '_s when you dispatch the goods , 0_days_later according to your rep . what a sham .
negative	will not be using you again .
negative	product never did arrive and have since ordered with beautybay , arrived in 00hrs , free delivery
negative	on 00 november i ordered a hamper for my sister and nieces through ihampers , a subsidiary of iflorist .
negative	i requested that the hamper be delivered on 00 december .
negative	as i live in cape_town , south_africa i have sent hampers on a number of occasions through other_companies without_any_problems at all and as i had ordered in good time , i fully expected the hamper to be delivered on the selected date .
negative	wrong !
negative	the hamper was only delivered on 00 december causing me much embarrassment as my sister had assumed i had forgotten her .
negative	on 00 december i e_- mailed ihampers to express my displeasure and only received a reply on 0 january offering me a 0 pound voucher off my next purchase - obviously a very safe offer as they are probably only too well aware it will be the last time i use their service .
negative	i placed an order about 0_weeks_ago if not longer , for 0 products .
negative	i have not received these products yet but the money has_been taken out of my account .
negative	i checked my wowchers online and it only says one of the codes were redeemed and the other has expired .
negative	firstly , i definitely did redeem both of them and secondly the money has_been taken out for the product so i am confused as to whether i will get the product or not ?
negative	i have emailed and had an_automated_response and i called yesterday and i got an_automated service saying no one is available to take my call but they will call me back .
negative	this is ridiculous and the lack of customer service is appalling .
negative	i have had no help or clarification and i want my products or my money at this stage .
negative	i will never use wowcher again because the hassle is not worth it .
negative	i '_ve been appalled by the service provided by cash_generator .
negative	i tried to purchase an iphone on line from them coming from their store in derby .
negative	the frist phone they sent me was the wrong_colour and locked to a network different from that specified in the advert .
negative	i called the store and they politely apologised and said if i sent the phone back they '_d refund me .
negative	a week_later another phone arrived .
negative	this one was faulty as the speakers didn_'_t work .
negative	i called them to explain the fault and they told me to send the phone back .
negative	which i did and called to check they '_d received it and make_sure they knew what the fault was .
negative	the next_day i called to find out what they were going to do about it and they informed me they '_d tested the phone , it was fine and they had posted it back to me .
negative	unsurprisingly , the phone did not miraculously work as a result of their ' testing '.
negative	on speaking to them again it transpired the manager who tested the phone wasn_'_t told what the fault was so didn_'_t test the sound .
negative	he then informed me that they could pay for it to be fixed but could not refund me since it had been more than two_weeks since my first transaction and i was not within my rights to receive a refund anymore .
negative	i don_'_t see how my only option legally is to have to wait to get it fixed , which i would no_doubt have to pay for before i got reimbursed , or pay yet again to send it back to them for them to get it fixed .
negative	what kind of shop is this that it has taken 0 deliveries , and nearly 0_weeks and they still_haven_'_t produced the item i have now more than paid for ?
negative	don_'_t ever purchase anything from this shop and expect them to get it right first time , if at all .
negative	i ordered flowers for a funeral and they did not arrive .
negative	an on - line chat the following_day identified a failure tof the florist o correcly deliver the order .
negative	i was assured that i would be refunded , but 0_weeks_later this has yet to happen .
negative	the problem with an on - line service like this is that you cannot_speak directly to someone if something_goes_wrong .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	i ordered a toothbrush , paid £ 0 for shipping , and 00 days_later i had still not received it .
negative	so i sent an_email only to be told that the product was out of stock and that i will be refunded within 00 days .
negative	if only people listened to the bad_reviews this company would be longer running , i used beginning of the year when my parcel never arrived i was told the label had probably come off , with lots of rude messages from an ebay buyer i refunded fully , it took another 0_weeks of constant_emails to get refunded and that wasn_'_t even in full even_though i had paid more to cover it , so last wed i thought i would give them another try and again low and behold my parcel has_gone wallows again .... was collected so the tracking says and that '_s it .......
negative	they don_'_t know where my parcel is and got same response " the label may have come off " that label was stuck to that package the only way it could come off if it was cut with scissors !!
negative	( because of them saying this last time ) something fishy going on here for 0 high priced covered parcels to go missing ....
negative	even_though i am covered i bet again i don_'_t get a full_refund and i will have another unhappy ebay member .... if you have any sense you will read all the negative_reviews and book with someone_else .
negative	i gave them the benefit of the doubt and i am going to be out of pocket again :( worst service ever
negative	these cartridges are not recognised by the printer and it won_'_t work .
negative	cheesy look of website , because of flowery purple
negative	copy & paste not possible , which is a pain
negative	chat windows get stuck as often as on lifeperson
negative	no improvement at all
negative	i was really disappointed with the service i had from range_cooker king .
negative	i waited in to receive delivery of my cooker to be met by a rude driver that left the cooker at the bottom of the drive as he said it wasnt his job to get into the house !
negative	luckily there were builders working in the road that helped put it in the kitchen .
negative	we unpacked the cooker to discover that the cooker was badly_damaged the grill was dis - lodged from the main frame cooker , the back was bent and the cooker glass smashed .
negative	i reported this immediately to range_cooker king to be told it wasnt there problem as following delivery it was the manufacturer probelm .
negative	it took 0_weeks to get someone out to look at the cooker to be told it was a write off which i told them on the day it was delivered .
negative	a new_cooker was eventually delivered .
negative	i would not use this company again , you get what you paid for , yes it was cheaper_than curry '_s or comet but the service was poor .
negative	don_'_t be_fooled , laura_ashley is a company that has appalling customer service .
negative	i bought a sofa in store with a new laura_ashley credit_card , but cancelled within the 00 hour_window .
negative	it took me 0_weeks and 0 emails to the ceo to get my money back .
negative	they also tried to charge me 00_% for cancelling but i had mithered them for written confirmation of my cancellation so they didn_'_t have a leg to stand on .
negative	that '_s another point - you deal with the customer_services on the phone but they don_'_t send confirmation emails so it '_s your word_against theirs .
negative	a very dangerous game when £_000s are at stake .
negative	each time i had to email the conversation to them via their website form so that i could get written confirmation .
negative	i am_disgusted with the service and couldn_'_t be more relived that i cancelled my order prior to it '_s arrival .
negative	if their customer service is this bad , i don_'_t even want to imagine the final product !
negative	took a week for my lenses to come through the post , was too late for me by then as i had an_emergency situation to use them for .
negative	placed an order of just shy of £ 0000 to be told i would receive around may 00th , have not heard from company to arrange delivery and when i phone today they say that there was a backlog of of orders and i wouldn_'_t get mine until next shipment in around 0_weeks !!!!!
negative	when i asked to speak to a manager the sales girl [_name_] said she was busy and would call me back which of course she didn_'_t then wouldn_'_t answer any of my calls after .
negative	worst customer service ever , they say they have no idea or a system regarding their back orders , but they are quick enough to debit my card shocking !!!!
negative	not even an offer of an_alternative .
negative	i ordered online with pets at home and i wish i never bothered !
negative	i had a bad_experience last time i did , with parcelforce leaving it outside the front_door for anyone to steal !
negative	this time however , they never picked_up the damn parcel !
negative	so now i have to wait for pah to get in contact with them .
negative	i am so angry !
negative	will never ever shop with pah online again .
negative	better off going instore but i couldn_'_t go this week so i had to order online .
negative	parcelforce , please just stop operating as a company .
negative	you suck !
negative	i ordered some dog_food from viovet last friday .
negative	i paid for next_day delivery , going by their times etc , i should have got my parcel tuesday .
negative	i didn_'_t , as it got mis sorted and went to a different depot !
negative	idiots .
negative	just got it and i '_m very annoyed .
negative	my puppy cake mix has exploded all over the new toy and dog_food .
negative	i thought it was sand at first !
negative	maybe the packaging wasn_'_t quite right as i was expecting a box , but they shouldn_'_t be handling things bad in the first place !
negative	surpirsed they are still in business based on these reviews !
negative	so hopefully , i can get a new_puppy cake mix !
negative	can '_t wait_until viovet change their delivery service !
negative	having worked for a company for over 0 years who use citylink and send many parcels through them daily - i have never had so many incidents causing so much stress and problems from one company .
negative	here are but 0 of those incidents that have happened in the past 00_hours :
negative	0 .
negative	my customer calls me to say the goods havent arrived ( despite us doing our job and the courier failing to deliver - obviously the customer will balme us as we are their contact ).
negative	i call citylink as on the site all it has his " package mis sorted ".
negative	the man i spoke to advised that the address was wrong , and they are now going to be delivering them to the correct_address .
negative	i ask what the new address is which he tells_me and it is exactly the same as the original address .
negative	after i ask to know why this package has_been delayed when the " new " address has no changes from the original , i was greeted with a lot of stuttering and dithering before being put on hold for 00_minutes for him to " investigate ".
negative	he then had no new information to give me so i expect he probably went for a cup of tea and found out nothing .
negative	the package was finally delivered to the " new address " 0_days late and missed the customers event the goods were needed for so rendered_useless so a refund was made from our company .
negative	0 .
negative	a top_priority client needed goods for another event - he calls to say they havent arrived .
negative	i call citylink and the person i speak to says they were sent to the wrong depot ( for no apparent_reason other than stupidity ).
negative	they said they would be sent to the correct depot today , to be delivered tomorrow ( only 00_hours after the event they were needed for had finished - therefore , again rendered_useless ).
negative	i asked to speak to a manager who i begged and pleaded with to get these to the customer on that day to make it in time for the event .
negative	she said she would find out and call me back .
negative	now this is the best bit - despite us having paid for the pre00 :_00am service on that day ( and it now being past 00 :_00pm ) she said we could get the parcel there today but it would be after working hours and it was cost us £_000 . 00 !!!!!
negative	so i said , so let_me get this straight , we have paid to have these good delivered this morning , someone at your moronic operation has sent them to the wrong depot meaning the parcel is late and you ' re saying we need to pay for this ???
negative	yes she says .
negative	the route cause of this was that citylink had failed to update our it system with them which mean the majority of the packages we sent out would be sent to the wrong place .
negative	their remedy for this was to go through each manifest individually to make_sure they went to the correct_address .
negative	this is absolutely not possible as we are a huge manufacturing company distributing hundreds of parcels daily so to have someone check this manually would take hours of time which we cannot_afford to have someone doing .
negative	i have been imploring to my superiors to stop using citylink and am hoping that finally we will be looking to use an_alternative courier .
negative	you would think that with the amount of money we spend with them , we would be treated as a priority and they would do their best to keep us however when i expressed my dissatisfaction and the fact we will be looking to leave , the response i got from the manager there was " ok ".
negative	i am absolutely_disgusted and will avoid using citylink at all costs when it comes to personal use and will endeavour to get the company i work for to stop using them !
negative	!
negative	do not use this company - chocolate teapot - useless !!!

negative	googled for a valentines florist , iflorist was the first result .
negative	unfortunately for me their service , communication , flower quality and experience is the complete_opposite .
negative	in all dealings i have made over the internet i have never ever had such a bad_experience , i received the email about the nottingham distribution center being delayed to the 00th .
negative	at this point i emailed to cancel the order ... to which i received no confirmation or correspondence .
negative	so the flowers arrived at 0pm on the 00th even_though they were unwanted .
negative	the next problem is the quality , if you want petrol_station forecourt flowers delivered by a courier then all i can say is this is the company for you .
negative	they were an actual embarrassment , weltered .
negative	on to the communication , the call_centre never answer and i have had no emails still .
negative	the grand summary is the " valentines_day flowers " i ordered did not arrive on valentines_day and arrived even_though cancelled which is neither what i wanted so i will be chasing a full_refund .
negative	the other inconvenience is the £_00 i had to pay a local_florist and the inconvenience of rushing_around to sort this on valentines morning .
negative	to summarise i wouldn_'_t wish this level of service on my worst_enemy .
negative	this item would not be able to hold my cat ( who is not over weight ) as the parts used to put the bed together were so cheap and just collapsed when i tried to hang the bed up .
negative	yes i got tablets for my poor cat mac , he is very nervous and eating himself and his fur , but sadly the tablets i purchased form this site just didn_'_t work in fact since taking them he has almost stopped eating ,
negative	the flowers were delivered to the wrong_address which was my fault this is not my issue when they were delivered on saturday they looked beautiful by monday they have started to die they were sent to my friend to cheer_her up because her mother died last_week i feel awful because you do these things in good faith through the intranet
negative	i ordered 0 chairs and paid in full on april 00th 0000 and the delivery date has changed 0times now due for delivery in may valerie what happened to your assurance that after 0 delivery failures you said you contacted the factory and they would definitely be delivered in jan_0000 the most_recent delivery time was week_commencing 00 april i contacted infurn last_week and was told the chairs were on schedule for delivery as planned however i checked the website and see delivery has changed to may 00 this is completely_unacceptable it will be 00 months since i placed my order i have commenced legal_action now as i doubt i will ever see the chairs it is illegal under european law what is going on in this company my money should be refunded immediately
negative	new review
negative	i now see my chairs are not due for delivery until march having received assurance they would arrive in january it will be nearly a full year since i placed my order and have had the delivery time changed 0 times this is unacceptable i have contacted the bank and my laywer there is no point valerie in contacting me unless you have a definite date for delivery or assurance of full_refund in the next week
negative	i placed an order for 0 grant featherson chairs on 00april and paid 000 . 00 euro delivery expected august when it came near to delivery time it was pushed forward to october 0 th and yet again when it came to near delivery time it was pushed forward again to december this is completely_unacceptable i have made numerous_calls and received calls from people who just sit at a desk and don_'_t know anything about company where the warehouse is based or who the manager of the company is i asked all these questions and was told the supervised would contact me heard_nothing since i just want to know where my chairs are and when they will be delivered someone must know that truthful answer i have commenced legal_proceedings through european circles to prevent this company from trading they are not open honest and transparent just let_me know where my chairs are and don_'_t get a guy sitting at a desk who hasn_'_t a clue to call me i want to speak to someone_who will tell the truth
negative	very bad feedback !
negative	i was receiving 0 - 0 times per week emails from scubastore asking me to pay for order , although when order was done , they have informed me that item is not available .
negative	0 times i '_ve sent emails to them asking to stop sending to me requests to pay , my emails were ignored !!!!
negative	very bad service !!!
negative	!
negative	always mess up my monthly repeat order .
negative	customer service is terrible , they never know anything and are not prepared to chase_up an order or find its_whereabouts .
negative	emails_informing of pending delivery are few and far between .
negative	if i were a company i would never use them .
negative	definitely don_'_t use unless you want to be let_down .
negative	you are much_better contacting takeaways direct , usually you get better service and quicker delivery by contacting takeaways direct .
negative	if you have to pay by card ask the takeaway if they have their own website for ordering .
negative	i had a problem where my order was rejected - the reason being that it was too far ( if you could say 0 mile was too far !)
negative	the customer service rep who called me to confirm the rejection was rude and offensive , and lets_face it who_wants to be put out by a company who can '_t be bothered with your order - avoid don_'_t give this company something for nothing go direct !
negative	even if just one person is put off ordering by reading my review would be worth it !
negative	avoid_avoid_avoid middlemen making money off everyone and giving really poor service in return !
negative	i ordered 0 same day balloons but despite_being advertised that they could be sent alone or with flowers the order was not delivered .
negative	at around 0pm on the day i was expecting the delivery for my friends wedding send off i enquired with iflorist who informed me that they could not send balloons alone - despite_being a £_00 order !
negative	i was offered a £ 0 voucher_code but this didn_'_t work when i tried to use it .
negative	when we opened the box on christmas day we were very disappointed to find there was no plug adaptor provided with the keyboard , as you can_imagine we had a very upset child when she was not able to play it
negative	i ordered a particular bunch of flowers for my mum .
negative	they were delivered but were the completely wrong order .
negative	i have now rung them over 00 times , half of the times i have been cut_off completely and the other times it is a mixture of no option to leave a message or leave a message .
negative	i have now left 0 voicemail messages .
negative	i have had no contact back .
negative	i have emailed several_times_now and again no reply .
negative	the order was delivered on friday and i would have expected some response now .
negative	i am extremely disappointed not only with the flowers received but also with the standards of the company .
negative	i will be contacting_trading_standards
negative	i bought an item as a christmas gift for my partner .
negative	unfortunately the item was not suitable , superfi refused refund even after many emails and emailing manager .
negative	offered an exchange as a gesture of good will !!
negative	!
negative	appalling customer service , to get a refund you need to return within 0_days of order ... and so they obviously dont care about the christmas market .
negative	still have £_000 worth of audio_equipment unopened in its box which is completely_useless and worthless thanks to superfi .
negative	incdently , superfi were still selling the item at full price and so wouldnt have made any loss by refunding me .... as i said appalling customer service ... i will be taking my custom striaght back to amazon who are top_notch company !
negative	i wowchered 0 bracelets rrp £_000 . 00 @ £_00 each .
negative	at checkout i paid £ 0 . 00 pp each .
negative	only 0 arrived .
negative	there us no phone contact with customer_services , only a faulty email .
negative	i contacted wowcher who over 0_weeks have sent in excess of 0 emails .
negative	all ignored !!!!!
negative	wowcher have only a mobile number for fasgion revenge which is never answered .
negative	wowcher have returned the £_00 and the £ 0 . 00 pp which fashion revenge has kept !
negative	the bracelets are cheap rubbish .
negative	what if i had paid full price !!
negative	rubbish goods .
negative	rubbish company !
negative	steer well clear .
negative	i had two bedrooms fitted last_week .
negative	so much of it was dented , scratched , chipped etc so even before it was fitted i was told a french polisher would be out to rectify .
negative	that was just the start of the problems though .
negative	now both rooms are finished i have two a0 pages of things which are wrong ranging_from a top not being square on the chest of drawers to a shelf which was supposed to pull out being fixed as static .
negative	worse still i complained a week_ago and the only response i have received so far is an_email to say if i don_'_t receive a response in 00 working_days that i can phone them .
negative	it '_s amazing to see hammonds response to another_reviewer that should would receive a response within 00_hours !
negative	my solicitors are being instructed today so fingers_crossed this can be resolved .
negative	in my view hammonds charge top prices for inferior quality goods .
negative	they have refused to answer my query about a non - delivery of flowers for my mothers_00th_birthday , and when i received one call on 00 / 00 / 00 claiming i would be fully refunded , they have ignored all of my email messages requesting feedback .
negative	worst still , there exists no number to call them on , and the only option is to leave grotty messages on feedback sites in a vain_hope that they ( serenata ) will read it and put matters right .
negative	even if they have a good reputation , i can only go by the service i received , ( or in the case of my mothers missing flowers ), did not receive !!
negative	sad .
negative	i have having a lot of problems with virgin_media , to call them on the phone takes over 00min and most of the time its call_centers abroad and they are not very good with the british accent when yopu get thru to someone that understands , they take_note and you never frothemagain till you phone them back to remind them , my problem been going on since november last_year .
negative	perhaps someone from virgin will s
negative	ee this and get in touch lol .
negative	i just want my front driveway repaired and the blackbox put back into the ground and new tar placed around it , this was dug up in november , when a new cable was installed , black box covering cable is on the pavement and people are tripping_over it as it is on a public pavement at the side of my driveway .
negative	your service is terrible , only once have you been reliable , my lastest booking you have failed to collect to days running , not good enough im_afraid
negative	i ordered flowers choc balloon and vase & card , on the wednesday before mothers_day , so i got a e_- mail saying we have had delivered the flowers , so i was very surprised when i called my mum on sunday saying she had nothing from me .
negative	i tried_calling iflorist and they had one of the most busier day of the year and they are off .
negative	i email there 00 hour service and still_waiting for them to call me back ( 00_hours ).
negative	took me a hour to get through to them on monday , but they take your money straight anyway on the phone with a message we will speak to you soon very busy at the moment thanks for your patience , ( thats a laugh ), so at 00 . 00pm got a call from my mum flowers had arrived , but not happy to paying full price for that i feel i should have a refund of at_least half the payment as not got the service i paid for .
negative	hope to hear from you .
negative	sooooon
negative	ordered next_day delivery on tuesday the 00nd of october order did not arrive till 00th of october and was needed for a charity party on the 00th ...
negative	which could not go to as we were doing a theme and every were else was sold out last_minute ...
negative	so disappointed and angry at the service i received ... also i phoned every day since the thursday after outfits were ordered and not a lot if help was given ..
negative	still_awaiting a refund really not happy
negative	i ordered on sat with next_day delivery so goods were to arrive tue for my sons graduation wed .
negative	they never arrived .
negative	contacted my tuxedo who said they would give full_refund back to my paypal .
negative	this was done but there is some problem with the funds and i am still_waiting for them to clear into my account
negative	how_dare they say ' tickets in the first 0 rows '.
negative	when our tickets came for the barry manilow concert at the o0 , they were row h !!!!
negative	row a - b - c - d - e , have all been taken out .
negative	( possibly for wheelchairs ), when we complained , they said that h is the 0rd row , but this was not made clear on the selling site .
negative	so in fact our tickets are up much higher than we wanted ., in what would have been the 0th_row .
negative	i am going to report this to the official body that deals with selling .
negative	this is deliberate misleading customers , and conning them into buying tickets thinking they are going to be nearer the front .
negative	i ordered a bed which arrived and wouldn_'_t fit through my door , after lots of arguments i got a refund , however in the meantime a friend lent me money to get a bed that would fit and unfortunately we had to use this company again but this time the bed fit and all has_been truly wonderful .
negative	phone first and make_sure it is what you need . dont do as i did and go by the photo as theses are not of the same bed .
negative	all resolved now and i am really happy .
negative	never use this company .
negative	they are supposedly working on a ' real time stock update ', but this is not the case .
negative	i ordered some wellies , they quickly took the money from my account , over a week_later they then mailed to say they didn_'_t have them in stock !
negative	i asked for a refund and i am still_waiting three_weeks_later .
negative	i have e_- mailed at_least four times and have called several_times and have had no reply .
negative	they still have my money !
negative	terrible customer service !
negative	i recently had to send my driving_licence ( both paper and photo card parts ) to dvla in swansea to have my photo updated .
negative	as these are such important_documents , i sent them by recorded & tracked delivery .
negative	this was my first mistake !
negative	the licence has not yet ( nearly 0_months later ) arrived at dvla ... according to the tracking_information on the royal_mail '_s website , it is still at the post_office branch i handed it into ( not so , incidentally !
negative	).
negative	i have complained about this numerous_times and have been repeatedly fobbed_off .
negative	no - one takes any ownership of complaints or problems , and no - one ever admits that the royal_mail is in the wrong , or offers an_apology .
negative	i eventually submitted a complaint , and a claim for compensation , nearly 0_weeks_ago .
negative	i received a response to this ... asking me to submit a claim for compensation !
negative	when i replied that i already had , and that their response was in relation to that , i heard no more .
negative	to date , i have not received any compensation , apology , or explanation .
negative	i do not have my driving_licence , and will now have to pay £_00 for a replacement ( and god only knows who has my original licence - very worrying in the current_climate of indentity fraud ).
negative	the only redeeming feature of the royal_mail for me is my local postie , who is a gem .
negative	he '_s unfailingly_helpful and cheerful ... the royal_mail could really do with employing a few thousand more like him !
negative	!
negative	i used parcelhero for the first time last_week , and was very impressed , intending to use them going forward .
negative	however ... looks like it was too good to be true :-(
negative	i arranged for a parcel to be collected from me yesterday between 0 - 0pm .
negative	this was perfect for me as i was at work until_0pm .
negative	when i got home at 0 . 00pm , there was a ups card through my door telling_me the courier tried to collect at 00 . 00 !
negative	i got straight on the phone to parcelhero to complain and sort this out .
negative	the girl i spoke with said that the courier wasn_'_t able to attempt to collect again today and that " if they ' re in your area earlier_than the time you have arranged collection , they '_ll try to do it then ."
negative	this is not clearly_stated on their website - you are offered either 0 - 0 ; 00 - 0 ; 0 - 0 , or 0 - 0 time slots .
negative	nowhere does it say that the time you pick is not guaranteed to be honoured .
negative	i was then offered to have the parcel collected at the same time on monday .
negative	this is not suitable because : 0 ) my client is expecting to receive the item on monday .
negative	and 0 ) i will be at work from 00 . 00am - 00 . 00pm on monday , tuesday and wednesday , so will not be home at that time to hand the parcel over to the courier .
negative	i arranged for the parcel to be collected between 0 - 0pm on friday for exactly these reasons .
negative	i do not think this is an unreasonable request , nor is it unreasonable to expect this service to be carried_out as expected .
negative	next , i was told i could take the parcel to my nearest ups depot and drop it off there .
negative	however , on entering the tracking_number into the ups website , i learn that i will be expected to pay a surcharge to them for the privilege of driving over there myself and handing in an item i have already paid to have collected !
negative	!
negative	at this point , i realised that i was getting no - where , and that the excellent service i received from parcelhero last_week was obviously a blip !
negative	i e_- mailed and asked for my payment to be refunded , on the basis that i have not been provided with the service i paid for .
negative	i was therefore very bemused to receive a reply_stating that my refund would be made within 0 working_days minus a £ 0 surcharge !!!
negative	this is a disgrace !!
negative	you have not offered the service i paid for , and have been unable to offer any alternative to assist me , but you expect to keep £ 0 of my money for nothing !!
negative	!
negative	i intend to take this to trading_standards as i fail to see why i should be liable to any charges for requesting a refund for a service that you failed to provide .
negative	i never thought i '_d find a company who could surpass the abysmal service offered by yodel but , amazingly , myhermes have managed this !
negative	!
negative	i don_'_t know where to begin ... non - existent customer service , items not collected , misinformation ( aka " lies "), fraudulent signing for delivery of items , items disappearing whilst in their ' care ' ( i use that word ironically ), items left out in full public view to be nicked , items nicked by couriers , items deliberately damaged by operatives , massive delays , no response to e_-_mails , being kept hanging for ages on a 00p - a - minute phone line ..... need i go on ?!
negative	!
negative	seriously , avoid this company - i can '_t_believe that they are legally allowed to continue trading , such is the breadth of their incompetence and downright shifty business practices .
negative	they may be cheaper_than some other courier companies , but with myhermes , you don_'_t even get what you pay for .
negative	i wish i could give these_cowboys minus stars !
negative	i was clearing_out a room after a relative died , and boxed up his dvd '_s .
negative	we used two companies .
negative	the first [_link_] and the second music_magpie .
negative	we sent 00 dvd '_s to music_magpie by courier , and 000 to [_link_] ( as they offered more money ).
negative	the boxes were both collected / posted on the wednesday .
negative	the wednesday after i had received payment from [_link ].
negative	yet music_magpie were denying receipt of their parcel even_though we had a courier collection leaflet .
negative	i rang up on the thursday and was told the parcel had arrived at the depot today .
negative	i asked why it took so long - he said its not a priority .
negative	nice !!!
negative	he said that i should get an_email_saying that it had been received that day .
negative	i received the email two_days_later then expected after 0 more phone_calls .
negative	waste of time .
negative	i still am yet to receive confirmation or email / cheque from them .
negative	poor poor service .
negative	i suggest you use sell to [_link ], if you want your dvd '_s to be a ' priority '.
negative	i cant_believe it has taken 0_weeks longer then the other company to check not even a third of the total the other company checked .
negative	i am a frequent flier and seasoned teaveller and have been looking for flights for early 0000 .
negative	opodo were advertising some amazing deals , so i used their flight search_facility to track them down .
negative	i found the flights , selected them , went on to the next page , spent a while filling out my personal details , went to the next page to put payment details in - ' sorry , these flights ard no_longer available , please reselect '.
negative	so i changed dates , found more flights , selected them , filled out my details , went to pay -' sorry , these flights are no_longer available ...'.
negative	repeat this about 00 times over .
negative	terrible website .
negative	it lies about it '_s deals .
negative	rubbish .
negative	will stick to expedia , ebookers , sta and airline websites .
negative	i '_ve been with t mobile for about a year now , and they have been absolutely rubbish in every instance of customer service i '_ve needed from them .
negative	once i couldn_'_t pay my bill , i rang them to tell them , and to tell them when i '_d be able to , and they essentially talked for ages and told me they couldn_'_t do anything , i '_d continue to get calls about it and they would stop my services on a certain_date regardless .
negative	so basically there '_s no point in their ' customer_services department ' at all because the computer decides who to ring and who to cut_off and there '_s no point in communicating with them at all .
negative	my phone has_been stolen twice .
negative	the first time i was annoyed because they made me pay 00 pounds for a replacement sim for my contract .
negative	they are giving away pay as you go sim cards so they can '_t be expensive to give - it '_s just that t mobile want to wring every last drop of money out of you they can .
negative	the second time the same thing happened except this time someone has used my mobile to make calls of 00 pounds over my usual bill .
negative	not only did t mobile not query this , they now say that because it happened before i contacted them it '_s my problem , i have to pay it and also the 00 pounds for a new sim_card .
negative	i had to email them twice over three_days before i got a response to my email_telling them my phone was stolen , i then replied to this and asked for a break down of the charges , and it '_s been a week and they haven_'_t answered .
negative	absolutely rubbish .
negative	i cannot_believe_how terrible their service is , i really can '_t .
negative	i will never be going with t mobile again , no matter what they offer me when my contract_ends .
negative	my daughter saved for two_weeks for ipod_dock adaptor .
negative	money taken from account on day ordered .
negative	0wks later not item .
negative	no reply to emails .
negative	rang company and get answer machine .
negative	thanks for ripping_off a 0yr_old kid you , set of ###.
negative	too many guidelines and policies .
negative	i just wanted to review my shopping_experience .
negative	simple .
negative	i think argus_car_hire is a scam company .
negative	we booked our car_hire with plenty of room for our_luggage ( argus actually states people and luggage capacity on their website ) and paid .
negative	when we arrived in florida to collect our car , they said that what we had paid for was a much smaller car and would not hold the luggage we had .
negative	we confirmed that we did in fact pay for the right size stated on argus ' website , but they were not having any of it .
negative	in order to proceed getting the size we had originally paid for , we would have to pay extra .
negative	we were completely at a loss as to what to do , especially with the time difference , we could not phone argus up and explain the situation .
negative	anyway we paid the extra , which turned_out double what we paid for the car originally and we decided to take it up with argus when we arrived back .
negative	it took them ages to respond and when they did , all they said was we had upgraded .
negative	we did not upgrade !
negative	we appealed the decision but still nothing .
negative	so , it is either argus who are not describing the size of vehicle properly or it is alamo in florida who say you have undersized just to get you to pay extra , both mis_- advertising .
negative	either way it is extremely bad business and in my eyes its a scam .
negative	it is a terrible thing to have to go through this at the start of your holiday and we had not budgeted for this extra , so it had to come out of our spending money .
negative	as i hire_cars when i go away , i will never , ever consider_using this company again and i will tell as many people as possible to do the same .
negative	transaction 0000000
negative	ordered 0 mumford and sons tickets for 00 december .
negative	christmas_presents for 00 year_olds .
negative	knew others were going so needed seating in particular area .
negative	made this clear
negative	promised i had bought the best seats , my girlfriend usually buys all our tickets so i am novice and believed viagogo .
negative	bought for section 000 knowing others could watch the 00 year_olds .
negative	paid £_000 . 00 thought it was expensive but viagogo said they were the best seats again .
negative	tickets arrived section 000 and further back than promised seating .
negative	face value £_00 . 00 ... so basically have been charged_£_000 . 00 for £_00 . 00 tickets that are wrong .
negative	plus booking plus postage plus_vat
negative	spoke to viagogo who wanted copies of the tickets .
negative	e_- mailed them thursday and they haven_'_t even bothered to contact me .
negative	all e_-_mails since ignored , just wait and wait on phone line .
negative	can '_t send two 00 year_olds to be on their own .
negative	tickets are not those ordered .
negative	viagogo sold these tickets with a guarantee .
negative	so what is this guarantee worth ?
negative	never again ... and i expect a solution .....
negative	transaction clearly_shown on top of review .... viagogo obviously have replied without reading .... standard uncaring reply ..... be great to have more details on the people who post good reports
negative	tried to make a purchase from this store it takes your details and then puts you to the amazon web_site .
negative	thank god i hadn_'_t got to bank detail stage steer_clear .
negative	....
negative	we were very disappointed with flowers we ordered recently for a funeral .
negative	there were only half the amount of flowers we were expecting and they looked half_dead .
negative	the blind we ordered did not come with instructions how to fit , i contacted them and was told they would send some in the post , we waited a week , still no instructions .
negative	had to contact them again on a few occasions only to be eventually told that the instructions were on line !!!
negative	wasted 0_weeks for the blind to be put up .
negative	was not impressed with time wait as the blind was a blackout_blind for a sky light in my sons_bedroom , therefore 0 more weeks of late nights for my son waiting for the sun to go down !
negative	!
negative	had a booking in barcelona for about 0_months , and had been arranging check in with the host .
negative	then about two - three_weeks before we were due to go , i received an_email_saying that our booking had been cancelled and if we had any further questions we should call the customer service number .
negative	absolutely ridiculous because of course we had questions .
negative	this was a stay in the middle of a longer one so , it was impossible to cancel altogether .
negative	i then got an_email from a customer service rep in italy asking me to call them , which i did , but i am dreading seeing my phone bill .
negative	i spent most of the time on the phone being passed around to different reps who either didn_'_t speak_english or weren_'_t handling my case .
negative	she eventually offered me 0 alternatives , all of which were horrible and obviously all they had left , and i was told that if i chose one any more_expensive i would have to pay the difference .
negative	i inquired_about some sort of compensation but was eventually told that they would give me 00_% of the extra it would cost if i chose one of their options .
negative	i decided in the end that this isn_'_t a good deal , and asked for my money back , though i lost about £_00 in fees altogether , for something that wasn_'_t my fault .
negative	i then had to book something_else on another website which was more_expensive as it is last_minute anyway .
negative	so this has_been a very costly transaction for me .
negative	needless to say i won_'_t be booking again .
negative	they delivered only part of the order .
negative	when i complained they only offered tiny percent of the mistake and then hung_up on me twice in the process .
negative	rude , useless , and still_awaiting the refund
negative	i paid £_00 . 00 for a bunch of half_dead flowers which would have cost me no more than £_00 from asda , and they would have been superior quality .
negative	these flowers obviously had not been prepared by a local_florist and had also appeared to have been stored somewhere hot .
negative	it was supposed to have bee a large display which it wasn_'_t .
negative	the roses were rotten in the middle and were not the large laurence lleywelyn bowen ultra violet bouquet i had ordered as they were made of pink and white_roses ( in fact i do not recognise them from any of the llb displays so i can only_assume they are from a lower cost product catalogue range ).
negative	i was embarrassed when i went to visited my mother on the sunday due to the very poor quality of the blooms and the small size of the arrangement - i was expecting her to be wowed !
negative	trying to complain to this lot is almost_impossible .
negative	all calls go to a recorded_message_saying they cannot answer .
negative	i logged a ticket and received a reply leading me to link to track my complaint which requires a log in .
negative	i tried to reset password ( i did not recall having a password ) and get stuck in a loop because the captcha verification does not accept anything i enter .
negative	arghhh !!
negative	!
negative	just to let you know i have still not heard_anything from iflorist in relation to my complaint .
negative	i have logged a dispute / claim with paypal and i encourage anybody_else who experienced the same as me and many others to do the same ( either their credit_card company or paypal if that '_s how they paid ).
negative	not happy , will find other company to use
negative	i ordered flowers for my friend '_s birthday and paid for next_day delivery .
negative	i received an_email at 000pm the day they were due to be delivered to say they were cancelling my order as they had no florist to fulfil the order .
negative	no flowers and too late to order more for the same day - totally_unacceptable and very poor customer service .
negative	the title pretty_much sums it up !
negative	either you devote your entire day to sifting_through the piles of poorly sorted clothes in the shop or you dont !
negative	wish there was an easy option .
negative	online would be perfect !
negative	i feel the need to point out this company is in league with marisota , if you search for their reviews it will tell you alot of what to expect !
negative	if i were you i '_d steer well clear , and if your tempted in for gods sake make_sure you keep note of who you speak to and when it can help when it comes to writing a complaint to their md !
negative	i ordered a pair of boots for £_00 .
negative	they didnt turn_up next_day despite me paying in full on my debit_card and being assured they would , then marisota sent me out a replacement pair and didnt charge me for them until they could find the other parcel .
negative	the replacement pair turned_up at the wrong_address !
negative	this over the space of 0_weeks having given up i didnt bother trying the boots and instantly returned them .
negative	in the midst of this there were lots of phone_calls , emails & live_chat conversations held .
negative	eventually wrote a long and rather strongly worded letter to their md mark cheshire , they gave_me 00_%_off ( ha not using that !)
negative	and a written apology which has still not been recieved !
negative	eventually got a refund after them having my £_00 for 0_weeks !
negative	appalling !
negative	this company create the seller marketplace but have no call_centre to speak to and hide_behind email .
negative	avoid !

negative	my friend celebrated her 00th_birthday last_week .
negative	i wanted to send her a bouquet of flowers , saw something i liked on e_- florist , ordered , paid .
negative	job_done .
negative	what arrived bore_no_resemblance whatsoever to the bouquet that i had ordered , and whilst i appreciate that there may be some substitutions , this was taking poetic licence too far .
negative	i have never seen such a cheap looking bunch of flowers in my life .
negative	i did email e_- florist with my complaint , but haven_'_t heard from them , not even an acknowledgement .
negative	perhaps they are too busy working their way through the mountaim of complaints in their in - tray , or perhaps they don_'_t care .
negative	i will not be using this company again , and i will be telling all my friends , who hopefully will tell all their friends , not to use this company .
negative	total disappointment .
negative	i contacted customer service , who agreed that there had been a 00_% substitute of flowers , but they were not interested .
negative	shocking , shocking company .
negative	and now eflorist have had the cheek to say they have replied .
negative	oh_yes , they have replied all right .
negative	to tell me that a 00_% substitution is , in their opinion , acceptable .
negative	get this eflorist - it is not acceptable - your company has an appaling track record on here and deserves to fail .
negative	customer service is the only_thing that will ensure survival in this climate .
negative	your company has none .
negative	still_waiting for customer service to contact me after 0 emails !!
negative	!
negative	not happy with the products deliver an still not acknowledgment from anybody !!
negative	!
negative	not a web a would buy from again !!
negative	!
negative	not happy customer !!!!
negative	!
negative	we bought a washing_machine from this company after_reading the product description and believing it would fit into our new_kitchen .
negative	when we tried to install it we found the depth was considerable more than stated on the website ( the drum_sticks out quite a way )
negative	we emailed 000 .
negative	they didn_'_t reply .
negative	eventually we reached them by phone and asked if we could exchange it for another machine which would fit .
negative	they refused , even_though the replacement would have cost us £_000 more .
negative	they won_'_t give us a full_refund either and say we '_d have to lose 00_% of the purchase price .
negative	i placed an order of previously purchased items .
negative	three_months later i had not heard_anything , then suddenly an_email popped_up , which appeared to show they had been emailing me for some time although i had not received any of them .
negative	they told me they did not have my item and so offered a different one .
negative	as it was the school_holidays ( we run a pre_- school ) i glanced over the description briefly and double_checked the sizing , and gave the go_ahead .
negative	when the items arrived a week_later they were not fit for purpose .
negative	the tabards did up virtually in the armpit , and they were shorter_than we wanted .
negative	when i called to speak about this i was told we should have looked more closely .
negative	i explained that if you were offering a ' like for like ' alternative , i would expect it to be like for like , and that i checked out the sizing .
negative	as for the length , this is not something i was expecting to have to check as i had ordered off the back of what we already had , and therefore i did not check this .
negative	the picture was also the only one on the website where the lady had her arms bent up , making the tabard appear longer_than it actually is !
negative	although we may not be ' big business ' for workwearhouse , we will not be using them again .
negative	my order was small and light_weight .
negative	it took five days to arrive which is unacceptable compared to other vet med sites where next_day delivery is usual .
negative	ordered my glasses , they came and were lovely .
negative	however they did not have a wide field of variofocal vision as their website claims .
negative	the viewing area was about 0mm at the bottom .
negative	the website claims show this as being about an inch .
negative	they were actually the narrowest field of variofocal i have ever_experienced .
negative	i sent them back the same day .
negative	seven weeks_later after numerous_emails and phone_calls , i still have no refund .
negative	once you '_ve ordered and paid you have to go to the banks or courts to get your money back .
negative	avoid like the plague !
negative	i '_ve had to go to my bank and register a dispute .
negative	the banks response ?
negative	this is a very dodgy retailer !
negative	that says it all really .
negative	don_'_t go there !
negative	ordered 0 tallboys from bedroom_furniture world on 00th_march still_waiting for them 0th_april 00 days_later even allowing for bank_holidays delivery is a joke .
negative	emailed the company on 00th_march asking where delivery was they replied_saying it would be delivered now after easter .
negative	used their tracking_system to find out delivery company used would be xdp derby .
negative	item finally reached derby apparently on 0th_april when it was apparently put out for delivery .
negative	derby depot apparently put the items out for delivery on 0th_april and apparently put a card through the door .
negative	they apparently were going to deliver it yesterday pm slot despite waiting in again guess_what its still not here .
negative	i use the word apparently a lot here because its a bit of a guessing game as at no point have i been emailed or texted or rang to say the delivery is on its way .
negative	off my own back i have attempted to contact the derby depot this alone is a joke .
negative	the depots landline_number is actually a voicemail for a mobile number .
negative	i have rung this number left numerous messages and only twice been rung back .
negative	i have been given excuses like they have a backlog , the driver isnt answering his phone , the drivers are behind because they cant go out until the hub arrives ?
negative	!!!!
negative	i phoned bedroom_furniture world yesterday after waiting in a queue for ages finally spoke to someone_who said the item was definately out for delivery yesterday pm .
negative	well it never arrived .
negative	the xdp depot also state a card was put through my door on 0th_april well it most definately was not .
negative	at the time it was apparently carded on 0th_april at 00 . 00 my husband was in the house .!!!
negative	i am absolutely_disgusted with the apalling service i couldnt recommend to anyone .
negative	i have lost money on phonecalls and time waiting in for a delivery that never arrives
negative	dear prachi , i have already complained on your website on the same day i left the review .
negative	today i have received a mobile phone answer phone message to say that the van that was delivering my items broke_down on friday another excuse !
negative	the van with my furniture is apparently at the garage being fixed and i may !!!!
negative	get it delivered tomorrow !!
negative	i wonder_if i am to put my life on hold just in case i may receive the items ?
negative	i also wonder what state the items may be in if they ever arrive having been out on the van for 0_days and now at the garage .
negative	my order no by the way is the one sent already to your website .
negative	i shall e_mail your site again to say that this must be escalated to senior level as it is beyond a joke .
negative	thankyou
negative	update 00 / 00 / 00 definately wouldnt use this company again shocking customer service !!!!!!.
negative	the only way to contact customer service is to sit in a telephone queue for approx 00_mins or e_mail them and expect a rubbish response in a couple of days .
negative	they are fond of posting a response on here that looks like they are going to do something about it but then they dont .
negative	i eventually received my furniture after all this time .
negative	as soon as it reached my door i had to turn it away as the furniture was broken !!!!
negative	i then e_mailed world_stores to complain again .
negative	i asked for a refund which they are supposedly doing although it hadnt reached my card yet .
negative	despite me asking for some senior response to my complaints they seem to have ignored this all together all they did was send a brief e_mail apologising for my experience and stating they would refund to my card .
negative	so no response as to what they thought of it all , no response from senior_management by way of apology .
negative	so its seems their management arent really interested in customer service .
negative	what does this tell you ??
negative	rubbish company
negative	ordered some bedroom_furniture through bedroom world on 00th_march items still not arrived 00 / 00 / 00 !!
negative	items apparently arrived at depot in derby on on the 0th_april and was apparently put out for delivery on the same day .
negative	i say apparently because i had no phonecalls to say the delivery was coming out to me .
negative	the xdp website then shows as carded at 0 . 00_pm .
negative	this is a complete lie no card was put through our door and neither was any attempt made to deliver the items .
negative	on the 0th the item was put out for a pm delivery again with no contact to myself made by the company .
negative	i waited in until_0pm and guess_what the items didnt appear ?
negative	!!
negative	according to xdp website their driver must be working all night as its says its still out for delivery from yesterdays pm slot ?
negative	!!
negative	i myself have used bedroom world tracking_system and have attempted to phone the derby depot .
negative	the landline_number given diverts to a mobile voicemail .
negative	i have phoned the mobile number several_times .
negative	the majority of time it is not answered .
negative	on the odd time it has_been answered by a lady_who has told me they have been delayed because of waiting for a hub to come in so the drivers can get out , also they have a backlog and have taken on extra drivers also that the drivers dont answer their phones also promised the items would be delivered .
negative	it is an_absolute_joke especially as bedroom world state you can watch a video to say how reliable their delivery is .
negative	i am_disgusted with xdp and their service and not impressed with bedroom world either .
negative	my advice would be to use neither
negative	update 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	items finally arrived .
negative	items damaged on arrival .
negative	had to return immediately !!!.
negative	i managed to find a number for head_office customer service .
negative	i spoke to a very helpful and polite lady called barbara who was very kind .
negative	i have asked her to pass my complaints onto the regional manager who will address hopefully some of the issues i have had with xdp .
negative	obviously its too late for me now as i couldnt possibly face the process of going through a reorder of the item .
negative	so i have cancelled and requested a refund from world_stores who run bedstore .
negative	i am most unhappy with their customer service as well and have left them a seperate review on this site .
negative	i dont normally leave negative_reviews as things do go_wrong at times , i think i am a reasonable person but have been pushed too far on this occasion .
negative	i would also like to think by me complaining it may improve their customer service for the next person ?
negative	i can only hope so !!!!
negative	!
negative	too many_times_now we '_ve bought goods from good honest traders only for them to be let_down by their choice of courier .
negative	the first parcel arrived 0_weeks late and it was thrown outside our from door , when i complained about their service to the driver he became aggressive and said i should watch myself because parcels can sometimes go missing
negative	every time since then parcels delivered to me by this company have taken a minimum of 0_weeks to arrive .
negative	it has got so bad that i now ask the people i '_m buying from if they use myhermes or not , if they do use them i politely refuse to buy from them .
negative	total_joke of a company
negative	i ordered a present for my brother , for christmas .
negative	the item was in stock and i was charged for it .
negative	0_days_later , i was called to say " that was an_error .
negative	we charged you , but don_'_t have it in stock .
negative	would you like something_else ?"
negative	i refused , and am still_waiting for the money to be refunded .
negative	i was not offered any form of compensation or discount off a future order .
negative	i now have limited time to find the item elsewhere in time for christmas .
negative	would definitely not recommend .
negative	we are a pub holding company who run a number of sites across the country for varying lengths of time .
negative	british_gas is the main supplier of 00_% of these sites .
negative	the amount of time i spend trying to baby british_gas in order for them to get it right is down right ludicrous .
negative	when exiting a site , 0 times out of 00 we end up receiving an incorrect final_bill .
negative	for most people receiving a final_bill for £ 0000 would be distressing .
negative	knowing british_gas ' incompetence at billing this was queried with them , only to be told that had made a mistake and the final_bill was actually only £ 0000 .
negative	this isn_'_t the first time this has happened , we also received a final_bill for £_00 , 000 when actually it was £ 0000 and most recently a bill for almost £_00 , 000 which when queried ( armed with meter reads to prove the bill was wrong ) it turns_out we actually only owed a meagre £_000 as the final_bill .
negative	these days when these types of bills come through , it does not cause me any stress as i know full well that british_gas are unable to calculate final bills correctly the first time .
negative	also this week i received a final_bill for a period in 0000 , for a site we vacated in 0000 and was only generated and billed may_0000 .
negative	however , i never received this bill but instead got a phone_call chasing payment .
negative	when asked for a copy of the bill so i can check the figures ( previous_experiences dictating this is a must ) i was threatened with the risk of a late payment charge .
negative	i fought back and told them under no circumstances would a late payment charge be accepted when it '_s taken them over 0 years to bill us in the first place .
negative	on the upside they do tend to answer the phone '_s quickly ( never more than a 00_min wait so far ) but the fact i even need to make these calls in the first place is atrocious .
negative	i am beginning to think i should receive a wage from british_gas for helping them correct their own mistakes every time we vacate a premises .
negative	do not order from them !!!
negative	i have no idea how the hell they have even one good review and now i suspect they are actually doing fake buys them selves to be able to create what looks like real buyer reviews .
negative	they take your money and i waited to 0 to 00 working_days for my item .
negative	it is now 00 working_days and no item , have emailed them 0 times and no response what - so - ever !!
negative	!
negative	i have told them now i want a full_refund and my order cancelled !
negative	but like everything else this has_been totally_ignored .
negative	i am now having to put in a claim through paypal and by the time i get my money back it will be about 0_weeks since placing the order and no sunlgasses !
negative	!
negative	the total_lack of customer service says to me that if anyone does get their sunglasses from them double and triple check them because i would definetley guess at them being fakes !
negative	i mean they say one of the places they get stock from is china .
negative	need i say more ??
negative	?
negative	if ' smartbuysunglasses ' ( thats a joke in itself ) is a real company and reads this refund me my money and cancel my order nowwwwwww !!!!!
negative	!
negative	we booked for meet and greet with gls .
negative	we called 0 mobile nos that were provided on the booking about 00_mins before we reached gatwick , but no reply on one of them .
negative	the other mobile was switched off !.
negative	this was between 0 . 00 and 0am .
negative	i had called one of the nos about 0_days before , and he had told me to call him about 00_mins before i get to the airport and they will pick_up the car .
negative	i must have made over 00 calls in total .
negative	talk about stress_free parking !
negative	we waited around .. spoke to all the wardens and other meet and greets no one heard of them ..
negative	we had to park in the short_stay as we were getting late .
negative	we had to pay £_000 for 0_days .
negative	i have asked to be compensated with the refund of the booking , short_stay chages and compensation for the stress it caursed me and my family .
negative	they are not prepared to refund the short_stay car_parking charges as they say they contacted us - which is a lie !
negative	i can get a proof of the calls made and received from my phone .
negative	now lets see what_happens : (
negative	this was at gatwick not at heathrow .
negative	got a reply from the company and they just come up with lies after lies , saying now that he was waiting for us before we even called him !
negative	now he can read our_minds !
negative	!
negative	having been a long time customer over 00 years and through all the changes having had 0 phones at once all linked to one account for my children , very quick to take the money but as soon as you have to contact them ......... long_waits on phone to get through months of waiting for issue to be resolved . no phone back on the 0 times promised !
negative	don_'_t they realize they are losing customers because of this issue you would think that some where in this company someone would take control of this .
negative	never again l wil ; l be cancelling all contracts and dealing_with a uk_based company where l can deal with people face to face . stores not much_better not interested .
negative	no wonder by the time you do get to speak to someone you are at the end of your theater poor souls working for a company where you have to take all the flak !
negative	!
negative	we have been using ferry savers for a number of years but this latest experience is not good .
negative	our son fell on a welsh mountain while on a school trip on monday .
negative	he was plastered at bangor hospital on monday and is having surgery tomorrow , friday .
negative	as a result we have had to re organise our trip to france and switzerland .
negative	we were due to sail from dover to calais yesterday at 0pm .
negative	we tried_unsuccessfully to telephone ferry savers on tuesday 00th_july ( we waited on hold for 00_mins ).
negative	we finally got to speak to someone on wednesday 00st_july after holding for another 00_mins .
negative	ferry savers are now making us choose another date and charging us for making the change , and it is likely we shall have to change it again and be charged again .
negative	shame on you ferry savers !
negative	i ordered birthday flowers , carefully choosing a bouquet with no lillies , as our daughter has cats . our daughter sent me a picture on face book , clearly showing a bunch of flowers that bore_no_resemblance to what i ordered , containing lillies . i have e_mailed the company to complain but have not had a reply .
negative	i cannot make contact with our daughter , to warn her of the danger to her_beloved_pets .
negative	i just hope they are not poisoned .
negative	i ordered what appears to be a beautiful_bouquet of daffodils and tulips from marks and spencer to be delivered today , march 00th 0000 .
negative	the tracking was available on their site to follow the progress and it was through city_link '_s delivery service ; all happily going well in the fact that the package had been picked_up and delivered to their depot last evening , 00th and telling_me it would be delivered this morning between 00 . 00 and 00_noon .
negative	they were destined as a lovely gift to brighten easter for my seriously_ill mother and as time went on and no word of excited thanks as would be normal for her by telephone , i kept checking throughout the day on city_link who say on their site that delivery could take up until 0 . 00pm a opposed to the stimate assured me by m & s .
negative	eventually , i again checked both my account on m & s as well as city_link as it got beyond 0 . 00pm with no word from mum ...
negative	only to discover that i have been refunded the full cost of the bouquet because m & s inform_me that due to some kind of hitch , my flowers will not be delivered for another 00_hours ?!
negative	!
negative	well .... as tomorrow is good friday and city_link do not deliver then , at the earliest it will now be saturday .... and what kind of a bouquet of daffodils and tulips delivered days late will be opened as a gift ?
negative	we all know the life - span of spring flowers and i am so , so disappointed to be so badly_let_down on behalf of mum .
negative	she isn_'_t yet aware of them arriving but i '_m now going to have to tell her so that she won_'_t think i '_ve been on some inferior site and sent shoddy flowers .
negative	easter was meant to be special for her this year , surrounded_by colour and spring indoors as this could well be her last one .
negative	i just wish i '_d known about all these reviews earlier so that i could '_ve done other arrangements .
negative	when bad firms consistenly act in such an uncaring way they do not realise the disappointment and frustration they bring on customers and recipients .
negative	i will order another lovely bouquet but it '_ll have to be after easter now and with a different company .
negative	how very poor the service is from city_link by the looks of all these reviews .
negative	what should '_ve been a joyous day has resulted_in all the aforesaid emotions as well as anger and irritation at the futility of not being_able to do anything .
negative	other than never ordering from anyone ever again who uses this so - called " courier " service .
negative	after along awaited delivery ( which didn_'_t turn_up 00st_october waited in all day ) finally 00 . 00 sat 0 november bed_base is delivered only to be dragged across the back of the lorry by the driver who damaged all 0 corners of the bed breaking the packaging and scuffing up the faux edging and wasn_'_t bothered at all infact quite rude !
negative	new one arriving wed 0 november really hope its not dragged out lorry again as sleeping on the floor isn_'_t that great ...........
negative	i had been mislead on wowcher , i ordered some hair extentions under the impression that is what i was ordering , only to find out after i had paid £_00 , i had only brought the ' wowcher '.
negative	i have emailed them asking for a full_refund and still no reply .
negative	i am considering taking further_action if i do not hear i response soon .
negative	they will take your money , tell you the product is out of stock , then fail to deliver a refund despite_numerous_calls and emails .
negative	tomorrow i '_m starting a dispute for the transaction with my bank , and have let a couple of consumer watchdogs know given the huge_amount of reviews online saying the same things .
negative	full of promise , very slow on payment .
negative	a small trade has taken over a month before receipt of cheque .
negative	zapper are poor at comms , very slow to pay and rejected a lot of dvds that were accepted by competitor at excellent price .
negative	in relation to other service providers , zapper are poor .
negative	i '_ll never use zapper again .
negative	particularly as my original honest post was reported to trustpilot for allegedly contravening guidelines .
negative	what '_s the point of independent and honest review if it '_s censored ..?
negative	bought a watch for anniversary_present from watch shop having seen reviews .
negative	it arrived fast but it didnt work .
negative	i have had lengthy conversation with watchshop who would not try to help remedy the problem without me returning the watch at my own_expense and waiting 0 - 0_weeks while they assessed the situation .
negative	the watch was bought 0_weeks ahead for an anniversary and discovered to be faulty 0_days before the anniversary when i tried to set and start it before wrapping .
negative	despite offering to buy a second watch so i could have the present in time , watchshop refused to make any attempt to help me and said they couldn_'_t guarantee a refund so they didn_'_t advise me to get another .
negative	their only solution was that i return and wait .
negative	no flexibility .
negative	treated with suspicion .
negative	i was told i could not speak to anyone more senior than an assistant supervisor and that on no account would the md or ops manager speak to a customer .
negative	i called kahuna who produce the watches and despite two phone_calls from them to watchshop asking them to contact me and promising them promising to do so , watchshop did not call me .
negative	this company claims amazing customer service ..... it is amazing but not in a good way .
negative	beware , it '_s easy to get good reviews when things go right ( and they are quick to send ).
negative	what matters in customer service is how you try to help the customer .... they don_'_t .... they just robotically repeat their policy and don_'_t try to help your situation .
negative	with overnight delivery , they could have got another watch to me and in time .... they chose not to so .
negative	so no anniversary_present .
negative	i could go on and on .
negative	got this for a present , tried to set it before wrapping and discovered it didnt work .
negative	hugely_disappointing .
negative	someone should have checked before sending it .
negative	watchop customer service was totally abysmal .
negative	they have one solution only , you pay for the return and we will decide if it '_s a valid claim and you may or may not be refunded .
negative	they even told me that despite the fact it was still wrapped with the face sticker on , i had had it three_weeks and so it may not be their fault .
negative	their procedure takes 0 - 0_weeks .
negative	they were unhelpful .
negative	i was prepared to buy a second watch to get it in time for the occasion but they were not keen as they made it clear they would not_necessarily refund me the first .
negative	the most senior person they would allow me to speak to was a deputy supervisor , apparently the ops manager and md " don_'_t talk to customer ".
negative	after a lot of time trying to get some help , i was told they treat all customers exactly the same .... which was not encouraging !
negative	i could go on .
negative	they advertise amazing service , it is .... but not in a good way .
negative	this was finally resolved by the company who supply the watches directly with me .
negative	they fell over themselves to help and were immaculate in their customer service in every way .
negative	not only did they take back and sort the watch out within a week , they kindly fixed our older beloved watch free of charge to compensate for the appalling service at watchshop .
negative	the final and by then amusing final_straw from watchshop customer service is when they sent me an_email asking how they had done ??!!!!
negative	i sure told them and , predictably , have heard_nothing back .
negative	incredibly bad .
negative	i '_m_sure if all goes well it '_s fine .
negative	what counts is what companies do when things go_wrong .
negative	it '_s easy to get 0_stars when you send out a watch fast that work .
negative	before you buy have a good look at the poor ratings .
negative	you will see a pattern .
negative	if you are happy to take the risk , go_ahead .
negative	i tried to order some items on the website .
negative	at the checkout i was told the payment was not acceptable so i tried again later ( two times ) but the end of the payment procedure was again told error .
negative	than i gave up .
negative	after a week i have got 0 packages from the company ( with all of my orders in ) and of course a reduced bank_account .
negative	the best thing in this story ( which was not as good for me ) is that although the packeges arrived at the same time i was charged three_times for p and p .
negative	i did not complain but i promise i will never order anything anymore from this website .
negative	booked for a monday driver didn_'_t turn_up and the rebooked for a tuesday again no show , had to get a refund
negative	i would not use this company again , the box was completely broken could never give the sock_aid as a present .
negative	i purchased a product which did turned_out did not come with all the essential parts , when i contacted the company about it they were aware that it wasn_'_t supplied and also were able to say it wasn_'_t possible to get it .
negative	why would anyone sell a product without making_sure all the relevant pieces are enclosed and available .
negative	very disappointed !
negative	the spray that i ordered for a member of the family '_s funeral was nothing like the one the got delivered .
negative	in fact a spray didn_'_t get delivered - a bunch of wilted chrysanths did and they looked like they '_d cost a couple of pounds and been sitting on a garage_forecourt for a week .
negative	when i complained they didn_'_t come_back in time to rectify or do anything constructive i . e .
negative	send sympathy_bouquet to apologise to sister in law - they just refunded my money ( which they would have to have done anyway and said thay would discipling the florists ???
negative	they also said it was the florists fault and that theyy were just kind of the mediator - ???
negative	?
negative	ordered a speaker for a vivaz was totaly the wrong one
negative	so went threw all internet forms and sent the thing
negative	back this was 0 and a half weeks_ago still_waiting for my
negative	refund thay said the first day it will be in tommorow
negative	the next_day 0 hours and so on 0 and a half weeks
negative	still no joy thay say problems with paypal
negative	i still_waiting prob never get it back
negative	so be warned
negative	not happy at all

negative	the ups collection man was very helpful , but 00_hours_later my parcel was returned .... turns_out even a gift has to have a commerical invoice .
negative	at 0pm ( 0 hours after collection ) i first noticed there was a problem via the online tracking .
negative	as it was out of hours , i had an online_chat to see if i could email a commerical invoice over .
negative	online help was not helpful .
negative	decided to try calling after school drop_off the next_day .
negative	by the time i got home , the parcel was already returned .
negative	a phone_call to ups basically called me stupid and said it was totally my fault , and they would not as a gesture of goodwill be offering me another collection without full payment .
negative	what a waste of money and unhelpful customer_services .
negative	transglobal offered the best rate , but ups were not helpful .
negative	will not be using again .
negative	don_'_t know why i still bother to look for things in argos - they never have what i want in stock , either in my local_store or for home delivery .
negative	the mattress was good but the bed that we bought with it was rubbish , the slats broke and fell out when we wanted a refund they only gave_us £_00 although we paid £_000 .
negative	do not buy this bed , no compansation even although they agreed the bed was faulty
negative	paid_extra to receive my order next_day .
negative	in the delivery instruction i asked for it to be left in our shed .
negative	sent out by a courier company who refused to leave it and took it back to the depot .
negative	luckily received the item a couple of hours before i had to wear it .
negative	the item itself was of incredibly poor quality .
negative	both straps on the top were barely stitched on and shock_horror broke within an_hour .
negative	the corset had little loops for the ties to go
negative	through , when pulling to tighten them the loops broke so was unable to wear it .
negative	overall pretty annoyed .
negative	high prices , poor quality and terrible delivery .
negative	will not be using again .
negative	this is very annoying .
negative	another of these companies where you place an order , the money is withdrawn from your account and you wonder where your product is .
negative	i ordered a pair of glasses , my account was debited and only because i randomly checked the order status , i saw that the glasses i ordered are not in stock and that it can take an indefinite time ' more than a month ' to get them delivered .
negative	i find this quite impertinent as this company didn_'_t even bother to notify_me that the glasses are undeliverable !
negative	i want my money back or a confirmation of an exact delivery date .
negative	as i need these glasses urgently , i would actually expect some kind of indemnification as i have to place an order somewhere_else to get glasses and who_knows when i '_ll get anything from this company .
negative	i tried these_guys once , fortunately paying through paypal so did not have trouble getting a refund .
negative	i have tried again as they have stuff i want .
negative	again they have debited my paypal_account immediately and my order now shows " awaiting picking ".
negative	not sure at this stage if this order will work .
negative	will update .
negative	however , do not attempt to purchase from them unless through paypal / credit_card or some other means of getting your money back .
negative	i did not receive what i ordered for a long time .
negative	i sent 0 - 0 emails asking where the product was .
negative	now , over a month after my bank card has_been debited , i telephone to find that my order has " been lost in the post ".
negative	in addition , the company is awaiting delivery of my item and will not despatch for a further week !
negative	i cannot understand_why the company has never responded to my emails - and when i telephoned i got through to something like a call_centre who could not actually do anything .
negative	i do not rate this company in terms of efficiency but cannot , as yet , comment on their product .
negative	i ordered flowers for mothers_day .
negative	the contact from serenata after ordering was appaling .
negative	i had an_email at 0 in the evening saying they were delivered at 0 in the afternoon , however the flowers had not been .
negative	nor had they been left with the neighbours as requested on my order .
negative	there is no phone number on the website to discuss this with someone and the emailed response via the website is not very helpful , with a slow response to comments .
negative	i will not be using this site again , back to interflora .
negative	after receiving the samples ( which took the full five days to arrive ), we ordered for delivery on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	on 0 / 00 / 00 we were then informed that the goods were out of stock until 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	as we needed the tiles quickly - which is why we placed the order for a tile that was ' in stock ', we had to cancel the complete order and go elsewhere .
negative	to date , still_waiting for confirmation that money has_been refunded .
negative	ordered some flowers online to be delivered next_day for a family birthday and they did not receive them till 0_days_later !!!!
negative	unbelievable after several emails they still do not respond despite asking for a full_refund . my sister eventually received them 0_days_later in a very sorry_state after being in the couriers van for 0_days with no water !!!
negative	they do not reply to any emails you send and just take your money !!
negative	!
negative	still not received my order after over a week .
negative	have contacted you to chase , still_awaiting reply .
negative	in desperate_need of medications and unimpressed with the delay in receipt .
negative	no information that the product was sent from ireland and the return package was very costly .
negative	dreadful service .
negative	drove 00 miles to collect machine , found a big dent in the side .
negative	phoned customer service to be told that we they would not pick it up and that we must travel 00 miles to return it !!
negative	after further_discussion he said they would refund a mileage amount and when i asked about the time and disruption he said the store was authorised to give further compensation which could be negotiated and the store would have details of the complaint .
negative	guess_what , when we returned it the staff could not have been less interested , they said they knew nothing about the problem , it wasn_'_t their problem and tried to omit the compensation .
negative	when reminded they came back with 00_% which was not enough for the aggro .
negative	there was no negotiation .
negative	there was a bloke next to us also returning something so the stock is clearly crap .
negative	the staff in colne were ignorant and did not at any point apologise .
negative	last time i will buy anything from argos .
negative	update - they now say any store shopper must be " capable " of returning even a washing_machine - i am old and cannot lift so am i barred ?
negative	i want to warn_people about salesmanaged based in milton_keynes , as i have been the victim of the director '_s previous company house0market . co . uk and he has left me £_000 out of pocket .
negative	he ran an online estate_agency and we paid over_£_000 plus_vat for them to market our home on rightmove_etc for one year last may 00st ..
negative	i searched for our house details today after it had gone very quiet and they had vanished from the sites .
negative	i tried to email them and the email bounced , website gone and domain_name expired .
negative	he thought he could do a moonlight flit and shaft all his customers , but i did some sleuth work on the net and found that the company was still active with him as a director and they had cash in the bank but high debts .
negative	he had however started up two more companies mk exhibition and movey ( a video - making business ) and he also runs a company called salesmanaged in milton_keynes .
negative	i called the number but was intercepted by a receptionist who pretended he was not in ( of course he was , but hiding from all his creditors and customers no_doubt ).
negative	i emailed him and got a very self - centred and unprofessional response , as below :
negative	" house0market was run by my business partner so i was not involved directly with your property .
negative	unfortunately the business has ceased_trading , it was a business_venture that didn_’_t work and unfortunately we all lost quite a bit of money which we are trying to recover from .
negative	i can understand that you feel you have lost out , but we were not in a position to finance the business anymore .
negative	we have done nothing wrong other than the fact we have not succeeded in this venture , but if you wish to try and blacken our name in other ventures where we have different partners that have not been involved in house0market that is up to you and we can not stop you doing this .
negative	best regards
negative	peter barnett
negative	most of this is lies as he is a director , was involved as i dealt_with him and he can_afford to start up 0 new companies , but not reimburse his customers .
negative	i want to warn any potential_customers of salesmanaged , mk exhibition or movey that they should not pay up front for anything from this bloke .
negative	he is currently trying to get people to give him £_000 for stands at an_exhibition in milton_keynes - they may well find themselves shafted .

negative	i had a couple of domain_names with 000 reg and they sent me an_email in nov 00 saying that my card_details had expired and that unless i updated them they would not be able to autorenew .
negative	as i no_longer need the domains i did not update - and they took the money anyway !
negative	i feel like i have been tricked by them and when i complained they refused to reimburse_me .
negative	they quoted another hidden rule , that i had only 0_days to request a refund which of course they were gleefull to point out had expired .
negative	none of this was pointed_out to me , i was unaware that they had set_up autorenew and they purposely mislead me in their emails .
negative	this is a disgraceful practice and i intend to take it all the way to the financial_ombudsman as apparently autorenews are within their remit .
negative	as documented in various_forums ( just google ' homefiresides '), this company is completely fraudulent !!
negative	you will not receive your goods as the company went into_liquidation months_ago .
negative	company also known as firesgalore .
negative	avoid !
negative	i found this out the hard way after paying them £_000 .
negative	the process of getting a potential car i was going to buy hpi checked was no problem at all .
negative	i hpi checked the car and came back with clear !
negative	i then_proceeded to buy this car ; it stated no accidents and hp checked clear !
negative	once we bought the car , we soon found out this car had been in an accident at the front and back and had airbags missing !
negative	do not trust hpi checks !
negative	it would have cost us over_£ 0 , 000 to make the car safe and as a result meant we had to sell it for scrap !
negative	i would like to know why the hpi_check came back clear ??!
negative	!
negative	i ordered two items from here and after paying and receiving an e_- mail_stating that my items had been dispatched i thought everything was fine .
negative	... a week_later i get 0 e_-_mails explaining that the items were now ' out of stock ' they are refunding me but now i have to wait for this before i can go out and try and buy from somewhere_else .
negative	had an awful takeaway , and impossible to complain or get money back , would never recommend this service to anyone
negative	i searched the internet for meet and greet services and this one comes up as one .
negative	once i received confirmation it actually isn_'_t a true meet and greet .
negative	i phoned immediately upon realising that it wasn_'_t a meet and greet and was told to email and they would cancel it from their system .
negative	i did just that and they still charged me .
negative	when i phoned back to complain they told me it was too late .
negative	i sent another note of complaint and they ignored my email .
negative	do not use this company ~ they do not offer a true meet and greet service .
negative	and they have fleeced me of my money .
negative	thought it might be different based on the claims about mutual benefits and sound ethics .
negative	i noticed its " compare market " link shows giffgaff as the cheapest payg uk provider .
negative	but it only includes companies that are more_expensive in the uk !
negative	what about asda , sainsburys , three , talk mobile ...
negative	seems misleading and not very ethical .
negative	was going to try 0g that it had been banging on about since last_year but find it '_s now only a trial that i need to apply for and it '_s limited to 0gb .
negative	i stuck with 0g but the speed is appalling in the day and although it claims to be unlimited it will ban you from purchasing more unlimited data bundles if you use more than it likes .
negative	it wouldn_'_t tell how much is too much and is really vague but sends a warning on the only occasion i was able to watch ( just about ) world_cup footy despite constant buffering that i will be banned next time if i don_'_t stop using a service that eats too much data !
negative	it '_s forum staff are generally crap and just spout rubbish about being different and don_'_t seem to understand that they need to actually deliver a good mobile service not just talk it up .
negative	if the service works there '_s no need for a community of other customers to paper over the cracks and offer the same boiler plate answers that just increases frustration .
negative	for some customers it looks like a way of life not a mobile service provider lol .
negative	in short it '_s crap so save_yourself the hassle and pain .
negative	well past its use by date avoid !
negative	returned jacket for replacement didn_'_t get confirmation had to ring to find out status .
negative	when replacement would be dispatched they couldnt tell me so i asked for a refund instead i am still_waiting .
negative	unacceptable
negative	order placed on 00th_dec .
negative	still no delivery .
negative	no correct tracking_number , or at_least the tracking_number i have been given doesn_'_t exist with yodel .
negative	no response today from customer service , either from yodel or rubbersole .
negative	will be returning product when it arrives out of principle .
negative	i purchased mothers_day flowers from this company and they never arrived .
negative	i tried to contact them . during the course of the day but the phone line was constantly_engaged .
negative	eventually i emailed them to which i got a reply and they assured me thay the flowers would be delivered before 0 :_00pm sadly no delivery was made :-(.
negative	take my advice do not order anything from this company
negative	had mobile broadband with t - mobile .
negative	utter_rubbish : connection dropping all the time , bandwidth , ping and speed ridiculous .
negative	despite the fact they claimed the coverage at my home was perfect .
negative	spent absolute ages on the phone to their customer_services ( several_times ).
negative	sometimes they managed to " fix " things for a few hours .
negative	then it got back to what it was before .
negative	wanted to end the contract , however even_though they were not delivering the services i was paying for , of course i was not allowed to .
negative	when the 0 . 0 year contract ended , i ran away as fast as i could , closing the account in the process .
negative	yet , only recently i found out , it was not actually closed : my credit report still shows it in an active state .
negative	the web - site is fairly basic , you cannot review / track your order once it is placed .
negative	in fact there '_s not much you can do , once you ' re logged on .
negative	plus , the registration process sends confirmation_email to you with your password in plain text !!
negative	!
negative	also their wish - list feature functionality is confusing and difficult to use .
negative	ordered 0 items from this web_site ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ).
negative	when my order was delivered more than 0_weeks_later ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ), only 0 items were inside the parcel with no invoice or a note or anything suggesting a split delivery .
negative	when i finally got through to the customer_services ( phone is always busy or not being picked_up ; also when promised to be called back , they did not do so ), i was told the 0rd item is still to be delivered .
negative	ten days_later ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) i have received what should have been the last delivery , however it contained an item i did not order .
negative	again , i spent_ages trying to get through to the customer_services .
negative	they apologised and asked me to send the wrong item back , claiming they would refund the postage and that the 0rd item i am waiting for is not in stock now .
negative	however , it will be dispatched as soon as it is in stock .
negative	after a few more phone_calls , during which i '_d been promised the missing item , i was told ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ), that the item is not available and would be re - ordered from the supplier .
negative	two_days_later i am told it won_'_t be available until march .
negative	truly frustrating and awful experience .
negative	used a voucher for spend over_£_00 for next_day delivery and didn_'_t arrive next_day took a few_days
negative	tried to order some kids sippy cups and for an item thats 0 . 00 they wanted me to pay 0 . 00 delivery - hence i did not buy !
negative	i ordered flowers for my mum who just came out of hospital & i wanted to cheer_her up .
negative	i ordered the " urban love song " what my mum recieved was 0 carnation & 0 frecias that were nearly dead .
negative	i was absolutly discusted with what this company provided it was nothing like what u ordered & when i tried to contact them the emails bounced_back & the telephone_number was not conected !
negative	please can you forward me info on what to do next re contacting serenata_flowers !
negative	order not received
negative	i used to website to book a holiday to kreta last_year .
negative	we got to the airport , were looking_forward to the holiday and - boom .
negative	the flight was changed to one day earlier - but they didnt feel the need to give us this information .
negative	i am still struggling with them to get my money back - even if this wouldn_'_t make up the dissapointment they caused us by this spoiled holiday .
negative	will not use this site again !
negative	i asked for some samples , payed the 00 hr delivery .... it '_s been a week ... i still don_'_t have anything .
negative	the sales_department wont answer the phone or my emails .
negative	the delivery took over 0_weeks to arrive even_though the items were in stock .
negative	in the meantime i bought some from lloyds pharmacy , cost half as much for the same amount of meds .
negative	ok , this is my fault for not checking the prices beforehand .
negative	lesson_learnt ...
negative	then eventually the meds arrived from one click and i was able to throw_away the lot as it contains lactose ; something that was not listed on the ingredients when i ordered it .
negative	i '_m lactose_intolerant and can '_t take anything with lactose as even the tiniest amount upsets my stomach .
negative	so very unhappy and definitely will never use it again and will recommend others to stay away from this service !
negative	i '_ve been a 0 customer for almost four years .
negative	or rather , my husband has as it was more convenient at the time to put the contract in his name even_though i '_ve been using it .
negative	setting_up the contract was easy .
negative	upgrading to a more_expensive contract was even easier .
negative	i didn_'_t even need to speak to anyone , everything could be done online .
negative	i was happy with the contract while i just needed it for phoning , texting and occasionally using the internet .
negative	even when i went abroad , the roaming was switched on and it was all good .
negative	until the next time i went abroad .
negative	i was cut_off from the rest of the world for two_weeks as 0 had randomly decided to switch off roaming without telling_me first .
negative	when i got home and managed to phone them they told me i should '_ve phoned to switch on roaming before i left even_though it worked last time i was abroad .
negative	i don_'_t even know what their logic was ...
negative	then the problems started .
negative	i wanted to switch the contract from my husband '_s name to mine as it was getting annoying that he had to phone them everything i wanted something .
negative	so we went into a 0 store .
negative	i '_m not sure if the people in there are trained for anything_else than selling because they just told us to phone customer service , who on this occasion told us that it wasn_'_t possible to change the contract that easily .
negative	we gave up .
negative	one time i had a problem with my bill , when i '_d gone over my free minutes ( something they '_d previously notified me of by text but this time they neglected to tell me and so i accumulated a spend of over_£_00 instead of my usual £_00 .)
negative	after a lot of very frustrating phone_calls they finally agreed to refund £_00 because they '_d stopped the notifications without actually telling_me they would .
negative	i '_m not sure they ever did refund me though .
negative	months past and after a lot of minor problems that all required lengthy and very frustrating calls to customer service , i finally decided to switch to another_provider .
negative	so my husband phoned them from work ( as he '_s still the person named on a contract ).
negative	after half an_hour ( of his work time ), they told him they '_d phone him back .
negative	instead they phoned my mobile and left a message_saying i '_d been authorised to make_changes to the contract , could i please phone them back .
negative	so i did .
negative	it took five_minutes just to get through the pre_- recorded adverts and nonsense they '_d like you to know about before they even let you talk to a person .
negative	( also , if they ' re closed , they still make you listen to all the nonsense before they tell you they ' re closed and when you should phone back ).
negative	this guy then told me i wasn_'_t authorised to do anything , could my husband phone back .
negative	seriously ?!
negative	so my husband took another half hour out of his work time only for them again to say they '_d phone back .
negative	he made sure they had his work number this time but they still managed to phone my mobile , only this time i had magically been authorised to do anything i wanted with the contract .
negative	i told him to cancel it .
negative	he spent litereally 00_minutes arguing with me about how i should stay , they '_d fix everything , they '_d give me a better deal , they '_d instantly change the name on the contract , they '_d give me more free minutes etc etc .
negative	it took all the patience i '_ve ever_owned ( and a bit more ) not to swear and hang up on him .
negative	he was so pushy and tried to put down the new provider i '_d chosen .
negative	i even went as far as saying " i '_m_sure you can fix everything , but can you please just let_me deal with any_problems i '_ll get with my new provider and cancel my contract !".
negative	eventually it turned_out i was more stubborn than him and his sales_pitch ( although he insisted he wasn_'_t from the sales_team and i was the only costumer who '_d ever been offered this amazing deal ) and he finally agreed to give me my pac_code so i could end my contract and take my number with me .
negative	most frustrating morning i '_ve had since ... well , since last time i tried to fix a problem i had with 0 .
negative	he said he '_d send me the pac_code within two hours .
negative	i do hope this is the one time they keep their promise because if i have to phone them again i '_ll probably just throw my phone out the window .
negative	also , if 0 reads this , please don_'_t contact me with offers of better deals or apologies .
negative	i '_m not interested and i don_'_t want anything from you .
negative	i just want to warn_people to stay away from you .
negative	this is a ridiculous website .
negative	i was looking for a cheap sd_card and found this website that had them so cheap it was hard to believe .
negative	turns_out it was because it shouldn_'_t be believed .
negative	it said shipping was free and the items would be ordered via_amazon '_s check - out system so i figured if amazon were involved , it was probably alright .
negative	however , when i went through to check out , shipping was about £ 0 with an estimated delivery date about a week_later .
negative	i decided not to use it and ordered my sd_card on amazon instead .
negative	the worst aftercare i have ever had no help what so ever happy to sell the phone and as soon as it sold they don_'_t want to know never ever will i go in the shop again
negative	i ordered on line 0 bouquets for friends birthdays , the first appeared to process successfully and email sent to confirm .
negative	the second kept comi g up with message_saying problem processing payment and gave a number to call .
negative	this number was not recognised .
negative	after several more attempts i gave up and used another firm .
negative	the following_day , the dilivery i '_d had confirmed was not delivered to my friend and the friend who '_s order couldn_'_t be processed received two bouquets !
negative	i spent_ages attempting to contact the company to discuss / rectify the matter but jo phone numbers were recognised or answered .
negative	i completed endless contact forms on their website asking someone to call me .
negative	just to receive multiple emails which simy said ' we have responded to your ticket ' and to go to an enclosed link .
negative	all this link did was take me back to their website .
negative	one friend still has no flowers , the other whose order didnt pricess had two which i have paid for and i still have had no contact from the company .
negative	to say i am pissed_off would be an understantment .
negative	a completely frustrating and appalling experience when trying to arrange a lovely surprise for friends .
negative	am now going to have to write to the company i stead as they seem determined not to be contactable by phone !
negative	yet they '_ve sent me this feedback form to complete despite all my emas of complaint !
negative	never seem to be able to find my address , i never get a call asking for directions they simply return the parcel to the depot & i always have to call them giving them exact directions .
negative	in the past they have delivered 0 parcels in one week each having the same problem , i don_'_t understand_why the driver doesn_'_t call before he heads back to the depot & secondly why the company don_'_t log the directions on to their computer for future_reference .
negative	they never knock they simply leave the parcel on the doorstep regardless of whether i '_m in or not !
negative	sometimes , i wonder when folks write a bad_review , however , not until it does happen to you .
negative	very rude customer service .
negative	waited 00 and didn_'_t got any package even when i had to check with the local royal_mail distribution center and this happened twice .
negative	however baffling is that have been using my address to shop online and receive stuff all over europe and the us .
negative	would ' nt give them half star either .
negative	i ordered flowers 0_days before they were due to be delivered to my mum only to find out that she never recieved them on her_birthday .
negative	when i phoned eflorist to find out they said i should have been informed they do not deliver to northern_ireland .
negative	they certainly took my money quick enough and sent me a reciept if my brother had not told me she never got them i would not have known .
negative	wonder_how many people have been ripped_off like this and do not know !!!!
negative	!
negative	absolutely_disgraceful , distressing , rubbish service !
negative	!
negative	never deal with this company , they are untrustworthy suppliers and fraudulently extract money out of unsuspecting_customers .
negative	i run a small business and have used myhermes for the last_year sending a few parcels a week with them ..
negative	it was only upon doing a customer survey that i found out the extent of what has_been going on !
negative	i have paid for every item to be signed for on delivery .
negative	it appears now that although the parcels have been getting there , they have not been getting them signed for and have just been leaving them on doorsteps etc in all_weathers , open to potential thieves too !
negative	im horrified !
negative	they have marked each time that a signature has_been received !!
negative	i make teddies from childrens special first outfits or from babies who have died from cot death so the contents of my boxes is absolutely priceless and irreplaceable to my customers .
negative	also my customers have complained about severe damage to the boxes .
negative	i only use new , firm , substantial boxes and my contents are well_packaged , if they weren_'_t no_doubt the teddies would have been damaged as the boxes are so damaged .
negative	i will never use them again now , they have definitely lost my business !
negative	i placed my order and then wanted to make_amendments to this almost_immediately .
negative	there is no way that you can contact anyone to do this .
negative	we ordered two_bunches of flowers both were delivered with the same persons_name on them even_though the order stated different names .
negative	very disapointed in customer service .
negative	will not use company again
negative	i placed my first order on june 00 for syndol tablets .
negative	i '_m still_waiting and it '_s july 0 !
negative	i spent over_£_00 and got £_00 worth of half_dead flowers really disappointed would never use again
negative	it has_been 0_weeks since ordered 0 bottles of perfume from this company , i have contacted 0 times , and allowed extra time .
negative	yes they responded twice .
negative	once to say i am sorry etc , the other time to say when it comes if i do not want them to send back for refund .
negative	how can i send back when i still have not received them .
negative	i have contacted asking for my money back , and they fail to respond .
negative	i have not received the perfume , and it cost me £_00 . 00 i am very disapointed in this company and want a refund of my money .
negative	i would avoid this in the future as payment goes quickly , they take days to so called dispatch and i have never received the parcel .
negative	i have given this company time to respond and rectify this problem , but they have not .
negative	they have no customer service techniques which is very disapointing .
negative	if you are reading this half price perfumes , please refund me , you have no right to keep my money !
negative	i ordered supplements for my dog .. in good time before they ran_out , as i live in the country and cant get to the shops .... they have well ran_out now !!!
negative	no answer to my numerous_emails .. tried there online help service ... thats a joke ... and as for tying to get an answer on the phone ... am i sick of hearing ' i '_m sorry ' etc .... will just have to order them from elsewhere and take the financial hit .... lesson_learned .. never use this company ...
negative	i just wish i had read these reviews first ..
negative	avoid this company at all costs .
negative	i ordered an electric bbq grill which their website claimed was " in stock ".
negative	i was given an estimated delivery of 0_weeks time and it was finally delivered 0_weeks_later after i sent a chasing email .
negative	when it arrived it had a 0 pin european_plug , something that was not flagged on the item description .
negative	we tried it with 0 plug adapters but it blew the fuse on each one .
negative	when i asked to return the item i was told that the terms and conditions of imperialprice state that an item having a european_plug is not an acceptable reason for a return .
negative	having contacted trading_standards , i have learned that it is a criminal offence for a company to sell electrical items in the uk with a european_plug .
negative	i have written to imperialprice informing them of this , but have had no response .
negative	i regularly buy from serenta for my friends and family ordered some for mum for her_birthday was very annoyed when she sent me a picture the night she recieved them every one was dead will never use again
negative	products didn_'_t arrive as promised .
negative	i had to email three_times before i got a response .
negative	( telephoning was not an option as whenever i called i was always 0th in the queue ).
negative	eventually products arrived via courier and i was offered £ 0 off next order .
negative	not likely to happen as i won_'_t be using them again
negative	i was very disappointed .
negative	the flowers were not fresh , some of the roses were dying !
negative	and the whole bunch had very few flowers and was bulked up with a huge_amount of leaves .
negative	i wont_be using this company again .
negative	food good but delivery options and actions totally_unacceptable .
negative	was offered free delivery on website but this wasn_'_t actioned and when i asked ' why ?'
negative	i was given an unacceptable answer .
negative	curt with no sign of respect .
negative	still no further response .....
negative	i purchased a portable_dvd_player for my sister to put in her car for my niece .
negative	as she is such a technophobe it sat in the box for three_months .
negative	when she finally went to use it the screen was faulty .
negative	it was another month before she told me so by the time i contacted wowcher they say it only has a three month_warranty .
negative	despite me contacting them three_times , each time waiting between one and two_weeks for a response .
negative	i am getting_nowhere they sold an out of box faulty product and they really couldn_'_t care less .
negative	i wouldn_'_t recommend buying anything from this company .
negative	their customer_care and after sales service is very poor .
negative	i agree with everybody below .
negative	something needs to be done with the way the company treats their customers .
negative	i phoned ofcom to report this and the more people that can do this the better .
negative	my mother of 00 was left with no phone or 00 / 0 care line for 0_days .
negative	her fire_alarm is also linked to the care line which requires a phone line to operate .
negative	the customer service department are rude , arrogant , don_'_t call back and cant understand what they say due to the language_barrier and the fact they talk too fast .
negative	its too long to tell you the whole story .
negative	i urge_people to call ofcom to complain and get a reference_number , then write a letter to talktalk with this reference_number so something can be done .
negative	whoever owns this company should be ashamed with how they operate their customer service .
negative	i have been trying to contact you via_email , but as of yet no reply !
negative	my flowers for my mums_birthday were never delivered , despite you sending me confirmation that they had been .
negative	upon speaking to my mum i could only appogise for the hurt and embarrassment caused by your incompetence .
negative	i am awaiting an_apology and a refund at the very least !
negative	if you continue to take your time in dealing_with this matter appropriately , i shall be contacting_trading_standards .
negative	my order came to £_00 , i then paid £_00 for next_day delivery before 0pm ( friday ), as i had a party friday and saturday .
negative	my package did not come until the saturday when i wasent home and then royal_mail said i had to wait - so therefor i didnt get to dress up for my halloween parties .
negative	i have since sent about 0 or 0 emails to customer service and not had one reply .
negative	shocking from such a well knowen buisness !
negative	i received a telephone_call to offer a different flower as the cala lilies were not in stock .
negative	i was assured it would be pretty green flowers and i accepted the alternative as i needed them to be delivered the same day .
negative	unfortunately , they were replaced with whispy floppy leaves , which were not even wired to thus keeping the structured shape as shown on the web_site .
negative	this spoilt the complete look of the display .
negative	it certainly looked like a very poor make do alternative .
negative	if it '_s possible to give no stars i would do .
negative	i ordered a dining_room set from their diningroomworld site .
negative	it was stated that the item would be delivered next_day .
negative	notified at the last_minute that they couldnt deliver .
negative	i had to phone them to find out when it would be delivered .
negative	told them i couldnt do week days and it would have to be delivered on a saturday ( which they wanted to charge me for !
negative	after pointing_out it was their lack of fulfilment for next_day delivery and that i refused to pay the saturday surcharge , they agreed to cover this charge ) that was 0_weeks_ago .
negative	for the last 0 saturdays i have patiently_waited for the delivery and nothing has arrived .
negative	what an_absolute_joke .
negative	pathetic service .
negative	no communication .
negative	it is shocking to think that a business that treats their paying customers like this is actually still in existance ........... now waiting for a refund so that i can buy this item from a company that actually wants my business .
negative	i ordered a pair of boots for a weekend away that i had planned , 0_weeks_later the boots still_haven_'_t arrived .
negative	the after sales service is terrible i have contacted the company 0 times and now they say they have sent me a letter via the postal service and i have to complete a form to claim my money back .
negative	0_days_later the letter hasn_'_t arrived .
negative	i just want my £_00 back .
negative	if i ran my company like this i wouldn_'_t have any clients .
negative	i was horrified to see that your site used my cookies to change the price or the flight after i had made my search .
negative	you should just be honest and keep the prices fixed .
negative	it '_s just greed .
negative	being honest hurts no one .
negative	i booked a hotel in london through_expedia . com last night for 0 nights_stay , 0 deluxe singles ( no breakfast_included ) - best price guarantee !.
negative	guess_what , the next_morning when i had more time to surf online , i found at_least 0 hotels booking websites offering a much_cheaper price for the same hotel same room type same traveling period plus breakfast_included !!.
negative	i will never use expedia . com again .
negative	they sent my order to a different address and when the people from where it was delivered to some what eight and half hours_later when i got the meat it had all gone and was stinking £_000_pound gone and no one is taking the blame both party '_s have aid not there fault will be seeking_legal_advice
negative	00 / 0 /_0000 well someone called yesterday and still full of rubbish but that '_s ok as i will be getting my meat from you main rivals after have a long chat with then i am very pleased
negative	so looking_forward to that
negative	i ordered a go_kart from join0buy on 0th_september for £_000 . 00 with a delivery date of 00 to 00 days .
negative	no delivery received .
negative	i contacted the company on 0st_november for an update on delivery as it was due for delivery to be told they were not able to get_hold of the go_kart so they would refund my money .
negative	then they had the cheek to tell me it would be 00 days for the refund .
negative	they have already had my money for over 00 days and now i am having to battle to get it back .
negative	i did not cancel the order you breached the contract by failing to provide the goods .
negative	i want my money back .
negative	i am still_waiting for the refund and have had to go through my credit_card company to try and get my money back do not give this company your business you will be disappointed !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered an apple ipad 0 from this company on 00th_june , they took my order and full payment from my credit_card immediately .
negative	then the next_day i got an_email requesting a scanned_copy of the front of my credit_card and a scanned utility_bill , i wasn_'_t happy about providing this information and as they had already taken the money couldn_'_t see why i had to provide it , they wouldn_'_t send me the goods so i cancelled the order .
negative	0_weeks_later i am still_waiting for the refund to be processed .
negative	they should not take the money until they have carried_out any checks they require .
negative	i have had to involve my credit_card company now to get my money back .
negative	i consider what they did to be theft or fraud , no goods should mean no money is taken !
negative	i have contacted you about this - you have never contacted me and i still have not received my order .
negative	i have given up and am horrified by both your service and customer_care .
negative	i will not recommend you to anyone - in fact quite the opposite would advise people to stay well clear .
negative	item ordered , wrong item delivered because item was out of stock .
negative	no one communicated any of this to us .
negative	0_months later finally item arrives , again apart_from chris the communication has_been shocking .
negative	would not use again if my life depended on it .
negative	time_consuming and fail to deliver on promised .
negative	very very disappointed .
negative	was messed_around with dates for delivery , website wasnt working_properly , finally ordered and a simple basic white bathroom_suite wasnt cheap , but ordered .
negative	said 0_weeks , it took 0 week to get it delivered and after delivery driver left after checking product codes and name on boxes , open boxes and despite all boxes saying white , the units are a gare - ish blue .
negative	give me strength !!!
negative	no_doubt it will be another 0_weeks to get the right ones and i will have to take a half day off work to be in for pick_up and another half day for delivery , and beyond pathetic apologies there will be no recompense .
negative	d not under any circumstances use homebase for anything that requires delivery and you cant see the product being ordered .
negative	sales in othr shops now passed , so will pay an extra premium to change to a more reliable company .
negative	the flowers were meant to be a surprise for my friends birthday so i asked for the flowers to be delivered last tuesday .
negative	later i had an_email to say i could have a refund because they couldn_'_t deliver on the day so would give me an upgrade for delivery the following_day , which i agreed - so i asked for the flowers to be delivered after 0pm on the wednesday .
negative	they were not delivered on that day either .
negative	eventually i had a phone_call from my friend thanking_me for the flowers and she told me that her son had a telephone_call from the florist at about 00 o ' clock on thursday saying that they had a flower gift to be delivered and that they had had a puncture and were sorry that they were late but had put in a box of chocolates by way of an_apology .
negative	these flowers were a gift and meant to be a surprise delivery so why did the florist deliver at the wrong time and why the phone_call ?
negative	i have since seen the flowers and even the so called upgrade i am extremely unhappy about the quality of an expensive flower gift
negative	i purchased an item of nightwear 0_weeks_ago
negative	the item was worn twice and the seam came undone and frayed
negative	figleaves . com refuse to admit this item is not fit for purpose and will not acknowledge / recognise my complaint
negative	i can get nowhere with them
negative	i will never use this company again
negative	i ordered a book , which took an age .
negative	was told it would not be arriving as couldn_'_t get more .
negative	so emailed and cancelled and ordered from elsewhere .
negative	yet a couple of weeks_later the took the money and sent the book to the local_store .
negative	very unimpresed .
negative	i bought a shed in the so - called end of august sale .
negative	it was meant to be the same quality .
negative	looking at the quality of the timber and the sections , including the windows , most of the sections seemed to be warped , misshaped , split , not square glass , very rough and some of the wood was wet with thick mould and don_'_t even get me started on the doors .
negative	it would appear that the sale sheds are made of of timber that didn_'_t pass quality control first time for the full price - none sale sheds .
negative	i don_'_t know what the none sale sheds are like but i would advice to avoid the so called ' limited sale sheds '.
negative	rough !!
negative	i wish i had sent it back as it '_s cost us quite a lot of money buying new timber and windows to replace some of the worst effected .
negative	i didn_'_t ring them as we had payed for people to come and erect it .
negative	when they pointed_out that the shed had been built from inferior wood we had no choice but to continue with the erection and pay for the replacement woods / glass .
negative	the company themselves must be very aware of the quality of the materials sent out .
negative	shocking
negative	rubbish !!!
negative	courier didn_'_t collect , customer service poor , would not use again .
negative	also dont_bother paying for sms_message , they don_'_t bother sending that either .
negative	order 0000000
negative	i wish i '_d researched this company and read_reviews before i sent my phone to them .
negative	like many people on here they revised the initial offer to a much_lower amount once they '_d received the phone .
negative	i needed the money so accepted begrudgingly and it '_s taken forever to actually receive the money .
negative	they don_'_t answer emails and it '_s takes at_least 00_minutes to get through to someone on the phone .
negative	customer service is non_existent .
negative	in the past i '_ve always used envirophone and have never had any_issues .
negative	please_avoid this company !
negative	i cancelled an order 0 hour after_placing it .
negative	they still sent the item 0_days_later , numerous_calls / emails later they arranged collection but said i had to pay all carriage_costs .
negative	they then denied having received item back .
negative	only after complaints to trading_standards and isis did i get a full_refund 0 weeksl later . they do not answer phone_calls or phone back when they say they will , only because i persisted did i get the refund .
negative	would never use again .
negative	i ordered the flowers before 0am and was promised same day delivery .
negative	they did not deliver until after lunchtime the following_day and despite 0 messages from me vis their website they have given no apology and no explanation .
negative	you are unable to email them directly and i could not find a telephone_number to contact them .
negative	very bad customer service .
negative	ann_summers have treated me awfully .
negative	they took £_000 out of my account when it was only meant to be £_00 , that was in the first week of march , im still fighting to get my money back !
negative	they keep trying to brush it off like there is nothing they can do .
negative	its appauling !
negative	will_definately keep on complaining and keep going higher until they refund me !
negative	we recently gave our 0_months notice to end our contract on our rented flat , and shortly_afterwards greene & co started to book viewings .
negative	unfortunately almost every viewing request we '_ve received has_been for that day , not providing the 00_hours notice they are legally required to give .
negative	i '_ve had 00 + conversations with the letting_agents and even made a formal_complaint to the head letting_agent about this , but they continue to ask to view the flat without 00_hours notice .
negative	we are buying a property and often have confidential documents on display in the flat , so it '_s not appropriate for strangers to be in our flat without the proper notice .
negative	i '_m at my wits_end with greene & co and have unfortunately had to lodge an official_complaint with the property osbudman over this .
negative	i found the nigel_o ' hara through google shopping and they were offering a fantastic deal on the watch i had been looking to purchase .
negative	made my order on friday 0rd of jan at 0pm , but 00 days_later still_waiting for delivery .
negative	website stated that the economy delivery would take 0 - 0_days once dispatched which seemed reasonable and inline with other site '_s economy delivery option .
negative	unfortunately what the website didn_'_t clearly state was that dispatching times are snail pace .
negative	i received an_email on the 0th_jan ( 0_days_later - 0 working_days ) saying my order had only just been dispatched !
negative	now 0_days_later ( 0 working_days ) i am still_waiting for my order .
negative	i have contacted customer_care about the speed of delivery and received an_email thanking_me for my patience , but no explanation as to why delivery was so slow .
negative	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
negative	edited : i have now received a response to my customer_care enquiry letting_me know that my order will now not complete this week but next week .
negative	i have advised them to cancel the order and refund me due to the unacceptable level of service .
negative	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
negative	update_:
negative	nigel_o ' hara processed my refund quickly and with no questions , but later reported my review on trustpilot .
negative	i can see this is the case with many other negative_reviews and agree with the review who said nigel_o ' hara do not want people to know the truth about their poor service .
negative	i would advise against using this site and have amended my star_rating according .
negative	such a shame as they have an opportunity to step up with their customer_care and respond to their users on trustpilot / communicate order statuses clearly before it gets to the trustpilot stage and they are shooting themselves in the foot .
negative	having made my reservation via the rentalcars website i rang to confirm that i would be able to pick_up my car using a debit_card as i don_'_t travel with a credit_card .
negative	i was assured that was in order .
negative	on arrival at hertz in cape_town i was told that they never accepted debit_cards or cash .
negative	hertz rang the local rentalcars agent who said that whoever had advised me had made a mistake , but that they couldn_'_t help and i '_d have to take it up on my return .
negative	in the interim they couldn_'_t help me with car_hire .
negative	i was stuck at cape_town airport at 0pm with no means of transport .
negative	hertz made an exception and accepted a hefty cash deposit - their staff were friendly and tried to be accommodating .
negative	in sharp contrast to rentalcars .
negative	i sent two phones in september_0000 they told me for weeks they are waiting for parts , i had already paid them for parts which cost £_000 .
negative	to go on the website today and see it has_been ceased is very worrying they have 0 new phones worth a total of £_000 .
negative	i have emailed them thry said i will get the phones back and be reimbursed .. how true that is i dont_know doubtful !
negative	!
negative	paid for items 00st_december for delivery mid_january .
negative	goods didn_'_t arrive so emailed them to be told delivery now 0st_march .
negative	once again no goods and then told over the phone deliver end of march .
negative	i have now cancelled order as they have had my money for over 0_weeks .
negative	no correspondence from them at any stage of this saga and no apology just some rubbish about chinese new year .
negative	they should not be taking customers money , making promises that the delivery date would not be changed again only to let you down once more .
negative	will never shop_here again .
negative	interesting enough it seems to me most reviews on here are by people who have only written one review in the past .
negative	wish i had noticed this before ordering .
negative	thank_you for your reply .
negative	i have never received any emails saying i would have to wait 0_months or that the delivery date had changed 0 times .
negative	i understand that you have had supply problems but the chinese new year has not lasted for three two months plus .
negative	thank_you for the refund .
negative	i have ordered elsewhere and they are arriving tomorrow .
negative	just so disappointed i have waited all this time and given you the benefit of the doubt .
negative	goods not received .
negative	rang twice and told it was going out today .
negative	ended_up cancelling order .
negative	no communication received from them .
negative	no apology and their attitude is one of couldn_'_t care less .
negative	keeping my fingers_crossed where my refund is concerned .
negative	would not shop_here again .
negative	this company will not make it in the internet_shopping world with this level of service .
negative	shop elsewhere .
negative	even_though i provided all the requested information i have still not received my cash_back from october_0000 .
negative	no reply to my further emails .
negative	case is still pending on top_cash_back as they havent_heard_anything from go_electrical .
negative	this company should not advertise on cash_back web_sites if they have not intention of paying .
negative	wish i had read this review site before dealing_with this company .
negative	i will not bore readers with all the details as its pretty_much what previous_reviews have said .
negative	all i will add is that returns are not £ 0 . 00 .
negative	their returns_label does not include postage_costs so you foot the bill .
negative	plus they deduct the £ 0 . 00 from your refund even_though i sent proof of postage .
negative	in total it cost me £_00 . 00 in postage to send back poor quality dresses .
negative	i would give no stars to this company if possible as their customer service is awful , they ignore your questions and queries and only answer what suits them .
negative	no phone number which is very convenient for them , although i guess you would never get through with the number of complaints they must receive .
negative	i have sent 0 emails and am awaiting a reply , which i suspect i either wont get or they will ignore the content .
negative	i will be reporting this company to trading_standards as very false_advertising and statements are made on their web_site .
negative	do not buy from this company as you will regret it .
negative	don_'_t understand_why itv_player can play useless adverts but not the program me i am trying to watch useless useless useless sort it out !!!
negative	!
negative	dont order flowers from serenta go to your local_supermarket you would get better flowers for less money there
negative	i booked for my tyres to be done on a specific day that was said to be available , a day i had taken off work to do so , after lots of messing_about and unreturned phone_calls i was told that my tyres hadn_'_t arrived , wasted my time as i had to arrange another day to have them done !
negative	wont_be using you again !
negative	i ordered flowers for my mother '_s birthday from eflorist , after myself receiving a nice bunch for my birthday from them .
negative	i carefully chose from the selection shown as ' available for delivery that day ', a bunch to the taste , colour and favourite blooms of my mum who is a keen_gardener and knows her plants !
negative	at 0pm on the day of delivery i had a call from eflorist saying that they didn_'_t actually have the flowers in stock and could make something up in red '_s , pinks and purples .
negative	i was disgruntled to say the least .
negative	it was already 0pm and she had received nothing and it was not going to bear any resemblance to the beautiful yellow and purple bunch i had chosen .... but i agreed , as it was very late in the day .
negative	at 00 : 00 i received an_email from eflorist , saying they would not be able to deliver at all that day !!
negative	i was furious to say the least and cancelled the order , rejecting an offer of an upgraded delivery for the next_day .
negative	why advertise a service you simply cannot provide ?
negative	especially in a business that is all about making the day of someone you love ....
negative	totally_unacceptable - very upsetting
negative	if i pay for it then i should get it so will go to bank and get it my money back that way
negative	the wrong product was sent and i have spent a week trying to get details of how i return the unwanted goods and re - order .
negative	no response thus_far
negative	i ordered two x factor buzzers , only one arrived .
negative	i had a problem trying to get anyone at the company to reply to my phone_calls and emails as i needed them urgently for a works meeting .
negative	i requested a new delivery address due to my time_constraints .
negative	the company ignored this .
negative	i eventually had delivery of the second one to the wrong_address and too late for me to use it .
negative	therefore a complete_waste of money .
negative	i tried to tell the company this , but , yes , you guessed it , they were not interested at all with no apology or offer of refund .
negative	anyone want to buy two buzzers ?
negative	?
negative	not worth will
negative	after being informed that my delivery would be with me between 0 & 0 on a monday , which in my opinion is unacceptable in this day and age to expect the customer to hang_around all day , regardless of work commitment , to await a delivery which does not materialise , i waited_until the thursday , when a battered and water_damaged item arrived , i received no communication whatsoever from uk mail to advise me of even what day my parcel was arriving , the item after being dropped several_times by a driver who was very rude arrived damaged and had to be sent back , this being the 0nd damaged item i have received via this courier firm , not impressed in the least with this company
negative	they would not let us leave with out paying £_000 and told us we would have internet with 0_weeks after 00 weeks and being on the phone everyday we tried to cancel it
negative	we paid viagogo £_000 for £_00 ticket , what a rip - off !
negative	!
negative	i didnt reveive my order yet
negative	thoroughly annoyed after purchasing this toy .
negative	the offer states the rrp was £_00 . 00 , so when i saw the offer price of £_00 . 00 i snapped it up !
negative	only to be disappointed when the toy arrived and it was tiny and quite basic .
negative	i checked online ( even directly on little_tikes ) and the toy was being sold everywhere for no more than £_00 . 00 .
neutral	my initial phone conversation with the company went well and was very impressed managed to get an_appointment the same day a friday for someone to come out and see me .
neutral	that '_s when things started to go a bit wrong the man that was sent to attend my address and finalise the details called to say he was running_late but would be arriving so we waited .
neutral	i then received a voicemail stating that the man has turned round and would not be attending .
neutral	i telephoned the man straight back who informed me he had been working since early and had an early start he had been stuck in traffic most of the day and as it was would not be getting home till late .
neutral	if i wanted to go_ahead with the loan i would need to contact the office myself and arrange it all as he didn_'_t have time to do this .
neutral	i tried to contact the office but as it was a friday and gone 00 : 00 the office was closed .
neutral	i was unable to contact anyone until the monday , when i contacted the office on the monday another appointment was made for that afternoon but no apology was made for the lack of customer service received previously .
neutral	the man came out the monday_afternoon and was polite and the loan was arranged and payment received a couple of hours_later .
neutral	so that i was quite impressed with .
neutral	i purchased a hoodie for my grandaughter who is petite , when the top arrived it was way too small , but she was able to return at no cost to herself , and received a larger item which fitted her perfect just a few_days_later .
neutral	keith and his_mate did an excellent job - i cannot_praise them highly_enough .
neutral	nothing was too much_trouble .
neutral	i wish i could say the same about the office personnel - broken_promises and appointments that were not kept .
neutral	however doors look very nice and appear to be of good quality .
neutral	since posting this adam davis has replied - i have tried to contact him on 0 occasions with no luck so i await his call .
neutral	since updating adam davis has called me - he assures_me that he takes very seriously any negative_reviews and says he will take steps to ensure that the problems i had do not happen again .
neutral	he says that the problems occurred because of a change in office management and hopefully that has now been sorted_out .
neutral	i am completely_satisfied with his answers and his response .
neutral	he also gave_me a discount for the missed appointments so i am now happy with the way i have been dealt_with .
neutral	i was pleased with products i purchased unfortunately it took rather longer_than i was anticipating for them to arrive .
neutral	your competitors can send goods to me within 00_hours i don_'_t see why it should take 0_days from you .
neutral	the last time i used airparks the drop_off & pick_up were much nearer the terminal_building , & no steps were involved .
neutral	this time i had to struggle with my case up steps & had a fair walk .
neutral	if it had been raining , i would have arrived inside the airport
neutral	soaking_wet .
neutral	i asked the reason for the change , & told it was made by the airport .
neutral	i feel that no consideration is being given to the ability of passengers to walk the distance involved .
neutral	the goods arrived promptly with no_problems with delivery .
neutral	the products are indeed great quality and the prices are good .
neutral	my only issue is that when i opened the box and took out one of the two packets of spelt spaghetti , i noticed a big hole in the top of one of the packets which i only discovered after i picked it up and the product dropped all over my floor !
neutral	there were no sharp objects to cause this hole in the box as i checked it myself .
neutral	more care on packing the goods would be appreciated as i was not happy about this !
neutral	these products are much more_expensive than regular supermarket goods and because of this i expect a higher standard .
neutral	why is your vat ridiculous now and why do you keep on raising my bill .
neutral	i '_m going to be paying £_00 a month at this rate for a rubbish phone
neutral	my experience with nationwide_vehicle contracts is quite patchy .
neutral	they have an excellent website but i experienced real difficulties trying to contact the customer_services team to obtain a clear_indication of when the car was going to be delivered .
neutral	i was given an initial date for delivery ( albeit provisional ) but there was subsequently a delay of 00 days .
neutral	as it happens i wouldn_'_t have minded in the slightest had someone explained this to me , however when i rang to check the delivery date was as agreed at the outset i was initially met with confusion followed_by a wall of silence and found that no one returned my calls , in the end i was left with 0 unanswered telephone_calls and 0 unanswered e_-_mails and then had to rent a car ( at some expense ) to cover the interim period - all of which could have been avoided had someone simply contacted me .
neutral	on the more positive side i am very pleased with the car , the delivery driver was excellent and the member of staff who finally dealt_with the delivery date from nationwide was extremely_helpful .
neutral	very dissapointed that my deliveery never arrived .
neutral	when i rang up was told 0 of the items were out of stock , the person i spoke to is trying to erolve the situation
neutral	it was delivered a day late and was damaged on arrival , despite clear_instructions that the parcel was very fragile .
neutral	i don_'_t think i would use again if i was sending a cake .
neutral	however , a sturdy parcel should be fine and the costs were very reasonable .
neutral	i ordered a laptop battery , from a reputable_company but delivery charges too high
neutral	flowers were delivered on time as requested and updates as to receipt and sending were bang_on .
neutral	however , i was disappointed in the size and had to buy other flowers locally to make them look more special
neutral	we bought a plain bathroom mirror and while the quality of the product is good the fitting_instructions didn_'_t exactly match the product and the mirror stands a long way off the wall .
neutral	the instructions say screw the " hooks " into the wall until 00mm is showing out of the wall but that '_s not possible as they have a shoulder on them and therefore the depth is not adjustable and it sticks out significantly more than that .
neutral	the mirror ends up about 00mm off the wall which doesn_'_t give the sleek look that i '_d hoped for .
neutral	ordered a product over two_weeks_ago , dispatched on the 00th of feb , yet still_waiting to receive my order !
neutral	brilliant service usually but slightly_disappointed this time .
neutral	ordered for my son '_s six form leaving prom , thought two_weeks was plenty of time for a bow_tie and cuff_links ,( having ordered prom trousers and shirt last_year with no trouble ).
neutral	ten days_later and i '_m still_waiting did phone after one week only to be told that there was a delay on the cuff_links .
neutral	they did refund the postage but looks like i might need a full_refund as prom is in a couple of days :(
neutral	i have used a couple of times , first time took_ages as they had to be ordered in which is fine .
neutral	second time i actually rang to check delivery and was told approx 0_weeks .
neutral	i therefore ended_up buying others elsewhere to cover gap in my supply .
neutral	lenses from here arrived few_days_later .
neutral	this is efficient but the information ` i was given resulted_in extra unnecessary expense .
neutral	the flowers that arrived were smaller_than_expected and different_colours to those specified .
neutral	found it impossible to find out what time they would be delivered - they didnt arrive until around 0 . 00 in the afternoon .
neutral	the t shirts were printed to a really good quality .
neutral	the colour of the shirts was lighter_than it appeared on the website .
neutral	but overall i was happy with them .
neutral	the fact that they ended_up costing c £_00 each was a bit_pricey .
neutral	and then the fact the delivery options were 0_days or 0_weeks was frustrating , as i '_d allowed just over 0_weeks and then found that i had to resort to paying another £ 0 per item , just to get them within the 0 week window i needed .
neutral	quite_frankly it was extortion !
neutral	the guy '_s who were delivering the cars were very good but i still had to wait nearly 0 hour gor my car which really delayed me getting home .
neutral	i was impressed with the service and quick dispatch of the item but i paid for next_day delivery but got it two_days_later .
neutral	i normally wouldn_'_t mind but it was for a gift and i had paid specifically for next_day delivery and in plenty of time .
neutral	just one criticism .
neutral	no_indication of whether the hotel i booked had an elevator .
neutral	important for a disabled_person .
neutral	ordered and was supposed to get my purchase ages_ago ...... to date , still_waiting after receiving and email_saying there were problems get the order out .
neutral	the day we got the computer it would not work so we had to phone them to change something on the settings , very helpful so i can '_t fault them . problems all week so phoned them again , they tried to sort it out , after a few phone_calls ( at my expense ) we were left to use the computer for the weekend but the problem still wasn_'_t resolved - therefore emailed them and after some communication the computer was sent back on the thursday after .
neutral	i am still_awaiting my computer back and to know what the problem was with the computer .
neutral	i am not completly happy as the item should not have had a problem to start with but the tech staff were very helpful .
neutral	spacious_villa well_equipped in a nice location , although we were glad we hired a car as entertainment in calleo salvege was limited .
neutral	there were 0 lovely bakeries and adequate supermarkets not much more_expensive than the hypermarket which after 0 visit we didn_'_t bother with . there was a butcher which unfortunately was shut for holidays .
neutral	the pool was lovely , plenty sun_beds but parasols weren_'_t great .
neutral	the pool and table_tennis_table were brilliant and much enjoyed .
neutral	sleeping accommodation and bathrooms were fine but upstairs shower in en - suite was so small as to be inadequate . linen and towels were clean but had seen better days .
neutral	we had a lovely holiday at villa mojon but the villa would benefit greatly for better maintenance as we thought it looked tired which was a shame as it could be a lovely property .
neutral	so saying villa_plus were good to deal with and our experience was mostly positive
neutral	first time user of iflowers .
neutral	so / so experience .
neutral	0 ) the flowers were advertised as free delivery in usa but a delivery charge was applied at checkout ; i accepted this charge ( around £ 0 gbp ), so although the headline price wasn_'_t what i ended_up paying , i did have the opportunity not to complete the order .
neutral	0 ) flowers were ordered for delivery on friday 0th but were delivered on thurs 0th .
neutral	again , not the end of the world that they arrived a day early , but also not the service i paid for .
neutral	0 ) i provided a cell number for the recipient and iflowers contacted me via_email to say they also needed the home telephone_number .
neutral	i was happy to provide this and could have done so easily at the time of order , had i been asked .
neutral	instead , i had to provide this via their chat_function , which was slow ( took around 00_minutes , all in all ).
neutral	the person was polite but they appeared to be handling multiple conversations , as the delay between responses was noticeably slow .
neutral	0 ) the flowers look good , which is the most_important element , but i probably_wouldn_'_t use iflowers again , due to the minor_issues described above .
neutral	back to interflora . com for me next time .
neutral	i ordered the flowers on monday_morning for the same day and paid £ 0 . 00 delivery .
neutral	they didn_'_t arrive that day .
neutral	however i did get a phone_call to let_me know and that they we arrive the following_day .
neutral	they said i could either have a refund of the delivery of only £ 0 something or have extra flowers in the bouquet because of their mistake .
neutral	when the flowers arrived the bunch seemed very small for what i paid and there didn_'_t even look like they had added extra flowers .
neutral	i paid £_00 . 00 for these flowers and i could or received better from a super marker for half the price or even less !
neutral	so i really don_'_t think they were worth what i paid and there wernt any flowers added either .
neutral	they are not bad but do lack customer service skill
neutral	we share our front_door with 0 others flats and the 0 of us agreed at the beginining of february that we would like a black composite door with chrome fittings on the value doors chap '_s second visit .
neutral	we must have said ' black door ' about 00 times , and when the chap read our order back to us he definitely said black with chrome fittings , so we were happy .
neutral	the chap said he would send the final paperwork to the lady_who signed the contrat , yet he did not .
neutral	we ' assumed ' that the door would turn_up as requested as we all heard him say black etc , as you would .
neutral	a month passed and we forgot to chase the promised final paperwork - even_though it should have been sent through without the necessity to chase .
neutral	anyway , the chap came to install our new door yesterday and when he got it out of the van it was red ,,, by this time it was too late as the old door was long gone and ' we ' had signed the wrong contract so didn_'_t have a foot to stand on .
neutral	none of us like red so this caused a lot of anger and upset , you don_'_t spend £ 0000 on a door willy nilly / we are now stuck with a gross bright_red door for 00 years +
neutral	note - the door / frame / window etc were installed well and seem to secure but not what we wanted .
neutral	this was at the end of the day a list of human_error and my warning to you is check the paperwork thoroughly .
neutral	the value doors chap made a mistake and we didn_'_t pick it up / weren_'_t given a second chance to pick it up as he failed to email the final agreement .
neutral	far from ideal .
neutral	not happy at all with the administrative side of value doors service and our stupidity .
neutral	i ordered some flowers to be sent to my mum for her_birthday earlier this week - i was happy with my purchase and looked forward to hearing how nice they were on her_birthday .
neutral	i contact my dad several_times on mum '_s birthday to see if they had arrived , by 0pm i was a bit_worried that they weren ’_t going to arrive at all so called eflorist and to my horror i had inadvertently order postal delivery flowers not courier as expected ...
neutral	i was not happy at all ...
neutral	i had to call my 00 year_old mum and explain what a silly idiot i had been , she said it was ok , but i knew it wasn_’_t .
neutral	anyway , the flowers arrived via the local postman the next_day in a an over sized box so they had been banging around in the box and of course they had had no water for a few_days and had been in and out of royal_mail warehouses = not a very nice delivery of flowers to a loved one .
neutral	moral of my post – read the delivery instructions properly !!
neutral	!
neutral	i have had mixed experiences when dealing_with beautybay .
neutral	if you qualify for uk standard shipping then generally they are ok - however they did ship the wrong item on one order and refused to re - ship my order until they had recieved and accounted for the return .
neutral	i ended_up reordering the item as i was in a hurry to get it and returned the unwanted item and i had to chase for the money to be put back on my card .
neutral	if you use uk saver shiping be prepared to wait at_least a week before your item arrives .
neutral	items delivered on time but poor quality .
neutral	did as promised with a next_day delivery on a saturday .
neutral	the email_confirming order came promptly but that was it .
neutral	no delivery confirmation .
neutral	slow rersponse to query raised on the monday .
neutral	no reply until the tuesday , but they did reply , eventually .
neutral	just left me hopping from foot to foot wondering what was going on .
neutral	good selection of arrrangements but no sizing information .
neutral	pig in a poke guess whether the standard or better or the best made any , if what degree , of difference .
neutral	you just have to guess_what flowers at that cost might , or might not look like .
neutral	took rather longer for parcel to arrive than i expected : i had hoped they would be with me for bank_holiday , but never mind .
neutral	manchester_airport is easy to use & handy , parking is expensive , but parking away from the airport is unreliable
neutral	my experience of diet_chef was ok .
neutral	the meals were ok .
neutral	i have decided not to continue using them as i found it expensive and like i said earlier the meals were ok .
neutral	i can '_t eat red meat or dairy and found it very diffcult to pick the meals that i could have , this of course isnt diet chefs fault .
neutral	we did enjoy our afternoon in amsterdam , but i was disappointed when i received an_email prior to our departure saying that we would be arriving later than_expected .
neutral	in the end we had only 0 hours in the city , so we had to cut out some of the things we planned to do .
neutral	in addition , i had pre_- booked the meals for my family and on the second evening was presented with a bill and was told i had not paid for one of my children - despite me having all the paperwork showing my booking details .
neutral	we sat for half an_hour whilst this was sorted_out , with other diners observing the situation - which was quite embarrassing .
neutral	finally , it was blamed on computer error and we were ' allowed ' to leave the restaurant - with no apology from the abrupt young_woman_who made the error .
neutral	on top of that , she lost one of our room key cards during the whole_process ( as she took it to get our drinks bill ).
neutral	we were told not to worry_about it - even_though your literature clearly_states that anyone can enter your room with a lost key .
neutral	so i went and got the card cancelled and was issued with a new one .
neutral	i '_m_sure you can see why i would be reluctant to travel with you again .
neutral	i was a little disappointed by the colour - but you can never be sure on the internet , can you ?
neutral	the service was absolutely unbelievable - my order arrived the very next_day , despite problems i had paying online .
neutral	i rang the service line and spoke to an extremely_helpful irish lady_who sorted everything out within a minute or two .
neutral	i will certainly consider_using this company again .
neutral	i thought i was getting a good deal , the flowers were gorgeous but sending them to nz worked out very expensive .
neutral	i love this site , money for nothing ' n all that , but find passwords a bit of a problem !
neutral	maybe its me , being crawled all over by a helpful 0 year_old not great when using a computer , but a found it a real_headache to actually log in and claim my money .
neutral	managed it at 0rd_attempt , now do i write down new password or just expect to repeat procedure next time ...?
neutral	!
neutral	i was overall pleased with your service , however the colour of the flowers were not of that shown , as i was attracted by the colours this did let the side down . i would however use the service again but recomend future custmers to clearly state the colours of the flowers that they would like and are purchesing .
neutral	florist could not find the house but did eventually show up .
neutral	i am not very techy and found the package easy to use with lots of choice .
neutral	i was told it dispatched last tues but i am still_waiting for delivery the following mon and can '_t seem to get any more detailed tracking_info other than it is dispatched .... where is it ?
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a bunch of flowers for my best friend who has just come out of hospital .
neutral	i ordered a lovely looking bunch .. however when i saw what was delivered i could have bought the equivalent from a supermarket for about no more than a tenner .
neutral	feel massively ripped_off and disappointed .
neutral	my flowers are now sitting next to a £_00 bunch from tesco '_s and the one '_s from tesco '_s look gorgeous compared to mine .
neutral	arranged nice but cheapest flowers on the market .
neutral	be warned .
neutral	also found it very annoying that there is no phone number for this company .
neutral	i only booked because it said the £ 0 exit_fee was included on site but once booked it said it was payable upon collection and i didn_'_t realise they were so far away from airport so how in the event of bad traffic can they get there quickly ?
neutral	during the payment part of the on - line ordering process i received error messages and was unsure as to whether or not my order had gone_through .
neutral	i immediately sent an e_- mail querying this and hoped for a speedy reply .
neutral	despite a chase_up e_- mail , the reply was not forthcoming and after a few_days i had to waste time and money on a phone_call to check the situation .
neutral	whilst the phone_call did confirm my order was ok and the customer service person was very polite , i am annoyed at having to make the call in the first place !
neutral	i also thought that at 0 working_days , the delivery is too slow .
neutral	on a positive_note , the product is good .
neutral	i
neutral	the staff in the shop were helpful and informed about the range of sofa_beds available .
neutral	after thought at home , measuring and discussing we returned to the shop where we were again looked after by staff as we finalised our purchase and i paid a deposit .
neutral	details of material care , including paying a little extra for coating the fabric , length of order time etc were repeated to ensure we were aware of the commitment and expectations .
neutral	we have since received messages addressed to mr rather_than mrs , the mrs who has this web address , and the mrs who paid the deposit .
neutral	not impressed with the misogynistic attitude !
neutral	i was disapointed because there was no air_con an we got bitten to death !
neutral	plus the t . v .
neutral	was all dubbed in german !!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i find the price of mobile phone insurance good value but it '_s a very frustrating company to try and communicate with !
neutral	the website allows you to create an account but there is no functionality yet but it is coming apparently so that will be great because it '_s very hard to contact the company by phone ( engaged_tone for hours at some times of day , i guess it just gets busy ).
neutral	i wanted to change my device when i upgraded my phone .
neutral	after a few emails and a phone_call to do this , i got confirmation by post - of a change of address ... not that my device had changed .
neutral	i then managed to get through by phone ( woop !)
neutral	a week_later to renew my contract and they had the wrong_address on file for me ?
neutral	to be honest at times i wondered_whether the company still existed as it felt really odd and nothing seemed to match up .
neutral	anyway , after the last call , all was ok .
neutral	so a mixed experience but it doesn_'_t fill me with confidence if i ever have to claim .
neutral	fingers_crossed !
neutral	i '_m_sure it will be much_better when the website functionality is up and running .
neutral	i ordered an infant halloween_outfit for my 0 month_old_son who is no means small for his age .
neutral	when it arrived i was so excited and couldnt wait_till try it on him , to my total disappointment it was huge .
neutral	it would better fitted on a two year_old !!
neutral	i think a review on sizing would be a good idea !
neutral	so i ordered an snes super scope from ebay last_week to use as a prop for a convention this coming weekend and it was dispatched quite quickly .
neutral	i thought " great , i should get it by friday or saturday at_least " and nothing could go_wrong right ?
neutral	wrong !
neutral	it '_s the following_monday , i '_ve been waiting for my package .... or at the very least , updates on it ... my tracking_number is p00lmbg
neutral	loaded_onto perth van
neutral	at 00 : 00 , mon , 00 sep_0000
neutral	delivery attempted , we will reschedule
neutral	00 : 00 , sat , 00 aug_0000
neutral	loaded_onto perth van
neutral	00 : 00 , sat , 00 aug_0000
neutral	they have attempted a delivery , whilst it was true that i was out of the house on saturday and didn_'_t come home till after 0 , why was there no calling_card left ?
neutral	was the parcel even delivered or did the guy just think " screw it they don_'_t really need this ".
neutral	and loaded_onto perth van .... why is it so hard to get it to dundee ?
neutral	it '_s literally the next town over , it '_s at_least a 00 minute to an hours drive and i live in a street that is really not hard to find because it '_s outside the city_centre which is small .
neutral	it doesn_'_t take at_least 0 hours to get it to the next city over
neutral	i '_m yet to contact them but when i do i will not be happy
neutral	next time i will pay for the shipping with royal_mail and not always go for the free shipping
neutral	[ update ]
neutral	i have contacted the customer service line and they were actually really helpful , they just had a problem with my address .
neutral	i provided the details and the package actually arrived whilst i was on the phone .
neutral	i made my latest order on september 00th and by today , october 0th there '_s still no sign .
neutral	i know i only went for normal delivery but two_weeks does seem a long time !
neutral	if i '_m paying for delivery i can accept a few_days but not the best part of a week .
neutral	product dispacted from gibraltar and not mainland_uk .
neutral	lovely , good quality products though this most definitely isn_’_t the company to use for the faint_hearted or those wanting a stress_free time !
neutral	the invitations were the easiest and best ordering experience but it went_downhill from there .
neutral	misinformation was given regarding motifs , the print colour of our order of service ’_s was wrong and then finally we received an a0 table plan when an a0 was ordered .
neutral	mistakes were corrected quickly , quibble - free and courteously – however there were far too many and they really shouldn ’_t have happened .
neutral	i missed the first delivery , then they decided to redeliver 0_days_later to our neighbours but didn_'_t leave a card informing is of this .
neutral	bit frustrating as by this point i had contacted then and they were tying to track the order .
neutral	phone system particularly frustrating too as you can '_t speak to anyone but the online team were brilliant .
neutral	can '_t fault them !
neutral	well_done .
neutral	just tweak the delivery systems !
neutral	one of the three items requested was wrong when it arrived .
neutral	this was quickly put right but shouldn_'_t have happened .
neutral	arrived in good time , good value for money .
neutral	could not order the frontline for my cat because i needed a prescription ????
neutral	confused because i have managed to get it from somewhere_else without_any problem .
neutral	inputting the information on the website for hotel and valet_parking at gatwick , and then correcting inaccurate info was next to impossible for me .
neutral	phoned and received next to no help from the first person , second person said she would change the info if i emailed and then didn_'_t , but the third person i spoke to was great !
neutral	they checked with the hotel and the parking company that they had the right info and then emailed me to confirm .
neutral	absolutely no_problems with hotel and parking company also v good .
neutral	great website , easy to order .
neutral	prompt delivery .
neutral	my only_gripe was that there is a small pen mark ( 0cm long in black , could be a dressmaker '_s mark ?)
neutral	on front_panel which of course shows up clearly on the white fabric .
neutral	not enough time to return for a new one so just kept it , shame for the price it cost .
neutral	as i already said , unbeknown to me , the drivers dumped all the packaging outside the property in the pouring_rain .
neutral	it was left to me hours_later as i didnt know they had done that to try and clear all the polystyrene inside the packaging and then dispose of the very heavy cardboard_box .
neutral	we have had strong_winds and heavy_rain and it was a difficult_task .
neutral	i have no problem with the product itself .
neutral	love the company and have used them on a few occasions i have alway had fast deleivery but needed the contacts the following_day and paid for special delievry and it came no quicker_than it would if i '_d stuck to first_class , arrived after my usual post so wasted money on special delivery
neutral	arrived very quickly .
neutral	dress fine .
neutral	hat on the large side so will have to alter it .
neutral	while ordering the selected mattress was straightforward , with a user - friendly website , i was frustrated by the delivery ' service '.
neutral	mattressman was unable to give me a delivery time - only to be available from 0am to 0pm .
neutral	it arrived about 0 . 00 .
neutral	also , having only one delivery man and not being_able to take it upstairs ( it took myself , the ' delivery man ' and a neighbour to carry it along the drive ).
neutral	although i was told about the one - man service , i didn_'_t appreciate the weight of the mattress .
neutral	another niggel would be that the company didn_'_t offer a disposal service for the old mattress .
neutral	but on the plus_side , it was available at a competitive price , in stock and delivered the following_day .
neutral	i order a monthly repeat of a private_prescription , and the prescripton is on file .
neutral	if i ring the order through it is fine , but if order online the process is far from easy , since matching the prescription with the online order seems to cause confusion .
neutral	also , the delivery is not cheap for small items .
neutral	in fact the small packet of pills that i order comes in a box three_times larger which seems to justify the postal_costs ; and then it won_'_t go through the letterbox , causing inconvenience .
neutral	i am still_waiting for my order but have been advised to wait 00 days .
neutral	the aftershave is for a present next week so if it doesn_'_t arrive this week clearly it '_s lost and there won_'_t be time for me to order it in time !!!
neutral	disappointed as my previous_orders have always arrived within the week !
neutral	a lot of crooks !
neutral	the furniture is lovely !!
neutral	the buying of it from_start to finish was a joke , wrongly advised at initial sales then had to visit the showroom 0 times to sort_out due to inefficient sales / admin personnel !!
neutral	the time it was all happening i was in the process of packing up our old house , working and try to sort_out family and what did i get apart_from three visits to their showroom a free tin of polish !!
neutral	absolutely_shocking way to be treated , don_'_t get me wrong the staff were pleasant enough but didn_'_t seem to have a clue what was going on !!
neutral	as for the delivery organising people i don_'_t even want to go there
neutral	i changed the car_registration online the week before we left ( twice as the first time i did it the confirmation_email still had the old car_reg on it ) and when we got to the barrier , not only did the automatic number_plate reader not recognise my car but when i pressed the help button the operator had couldn_'_t find the booking information .
neutral	he did however let us in & quoting the booking_reference let us out when we returned .
neutral	it is of course possible that we would have had the same problem if i hadn_'_t had to change the details , but maybe something which needs looking into ?
neutral	apart_from that i was happy with the whole_experience , including the transfer_bus which i had to use again to return to the car to collect my phone !
neutral	from the picture i expected this tree to have plastic pine needles on it but instead it has tinsel ones .
neutral	however once fully_assembled it looks ok , just not as real as it looks in the picture .
neutral	we booked with this company via fife council in - tend system .
neutral	we phoned to confirm times and that we needed a trailer for our_luggage and had this confirmed by the lady on the phone .
neutral	unfortunately when our minibuses arrived they forgot to bring the trailer for the luggage .
neutral	one of the minibuses went back to kirkcaldy to collect it .
neutral	once back they then realised that they didn_'_t have the key to open the trailer , it was still back at the depot !
neutral	so they had to use a tyre wrench to prize the trailer open .
neutral	the children eventually left about 0pm .
neutral	about an_hour and a half after they should have left .
neutral	this was not a very favourable experience .
neutral	we did confirm in our online booking and again on the telephone that morning about the trailer so were very disappointed at the error .
neutral	we are unsure_whether we would opt for minibuses and trailers next time .
neutral	i continue to use tesco as it is close and i have a reward card but the pressure for profit is , in my view , having a real impact on customer service with my local_store ( altrincham ) having understocked shelves , too many ' home delivery trolley '_s , and too few staff too often ; although the staff who are there work hard to offer a good degree of customer service .
neutral	initially loved moonpig , but now find the cards are much the same , with the personalisation very predictable .
neutral	find myself using it less
neutral	the service was very good , capsules arrived quickly but i am afraid we do not like them anywhere_near as the nespresso ones .
neutral	the capsules are quite hard to perforate when you pull the handle down on the coffee_machine .
neutral	i was happy with the service from orange , but i was underpaid by £_00 with no explanation why .
neutral	the phone i recycled was a 0 year_old_iphone_0gs which was in good working order and immaculate_condition so i was very surprised i didn_'_t get the full_amount offered to me .
neutral	really happy with the product but when ordering did not receive delivery details kept asking but never got it and when no one was in was left on my doorstep but i live in flats anyone could have taken them
neutral	i bought two packets of tablets for cleaning contact_lenses .
neutral	the two slim boxes would have fitted very easily into a padded_envelope .
neutral	instead they arrived in a brown cardboard_box 0 inches by 0 inches with the two slim boxes of tablets packed at the bottom and the rest of the box filled with screwed_up brown_paper .
neutral	there was no way the box would go through my letter_box so i had to go to our post_office sorting centre ( round_trip of about 00_minutes ) to collect the box .
neutral	all quite unnecessary .
neutral	matress described as firm but so soft that the first time i sat on it i actually fell_off !!
neutral	lovely bedstand but think about a different matress .
neutral	shopping online with you as a personal user was easy and efficient .
neutral	the 00 bags arrived promptly but as they were in a plastic_bag they were somewhat creased .
neutral	these bags were bought t to deliver christmas_gifts and had i seen the quality / density / weight of the paper used i would not have bought them .
neutral	i had anticipated a much_better quality / thickness of paper .
neutral	i am not sure how this could have been better advertised on your site but it would have been helpful .
neutral	our beautiful new furniture arrived today .
neutral	it is exactly as_described on the website and just what i wanted .
neutral	unfortunately the delivery men struggled to get the chest of drawers upstairs for us and gave up leaving it in the centre of our living_room where we hoped to sleep tonight whilst the bedroom is being finished !
neutral	within 00 seconds of them leaving my husband measured the gap ( took the drawers out to make it lighter - not sure why the delivery guys didn_'_t want to do this !)
neutral	and we had it upstairs in no time .
neutral	unfortunately they had already put 0 dents in my lovely new furniture when i pointed_out the dents the driver was very weary in his voice and stated he could ring the office but then they would have to take it away and rearrange - but since all our other furniture has already been disposed of i had little choice but to keep it dents and all .
neutral	so overall lovely product and i would use the company again but i '_ll be moving the furniture myself thanks !
neutral	was able to check the history of the car but there are cheaper checks out there .
neutral	just needed to do it in a hurry .
neutral	it is coming to two_weeks since ive ordered from directsight and one pair of glasses still_hasn_'_t been dispatched .. in my opinion this is very poor .
neutral	disappointed with the delivery time . takes too long .
neutral	still_waiting for final part of my order the most_important part my shoes ????????????????????
neutral	once received will be well happy x
neutral	goods arrived later than_anticipated and the packaging was tatty and torn !
neutral	not_necessarily your fault , its more likely to be down to the courier !
neutral	shame the envelopes were blue inside , couldn_'_t see from picture or description , was hoping they were white inside .
neutral	the products and prices are great and when they ( finally ) arrive they are of good quality .
neutral	but it is now week 0 since my order and i have recieved nothing .
neutral	starting to get a bot concerned and have had no reply to my e_- mail asking where my contact_lenses are .
neutral	sadly , this now will make me think_twice about ordering from them again
neutral	unfortunately my partner had already put the blind up when i realised there was a hitch of material right through the middle of it so because of this i don_'_t pull it down fully because it '_s very noticeable .
neutral	i ordered my duel_fuel cooker and in 0days it arrived i wanted to have it installed with ao . com and the only_thing that let it down was the fact that they couldn_'_t connect it in my area !
neutral	!
neutral	i was disappointed and a little annoyed but i found some one that charged me £_00 less_than ao . com if they had of fitted it for me ...
neutral	but apart_from that i was delighted with my purchase delivery slot and service ..
neutral	i thought this would be a great way to dispose of my old_mobile phone in an environmentally_friendly way , whilst getting some cash_back to boot .
neutral	my phone wasn_'_t a high end mobile ; just a bottom end smartphone , but it worked_perfectly .
neutral	the options on fonebank . com '_s website were ' working ' or ' not working '; for a ' working ' model the cashback was £ 0ish and for a ' not working ' model it was 00p ( paid as an amazon_voucher ).
neutral	well , as it was working ( i know because i went through the phone before logging_onto the site in order to delete all my personal items and reset the factory_settings ) i obviously selected the ' working ' option .
neutral	but it had a cracked_screen , and this is where i feel the site lets its customers down .
neutral	the site recommends posting the phone by special delivery , which in itself costs over_£ 0 .
neutral	i felt that the cashback was a bonus , and wasn_'_t too worried if the phone went_astray so opted for the cheaper 0nd_class postage at £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	the phone arrived_safely , and i received an_email from fonebank . com informing_me that they had received it ... followed_shortly by a second email_confirming that my cashback of 00p would be paid .
neutral	i was more concerned that the phone would be disposed of responsibly than the cashback , but i do feel that the site is somewhat misleading .
neutral	my phone was working , and the cracked_screen did not hinder it working , so i was a little surprised to only receive the minimum cashback .
neutral	i feel that the phone condition options on the site should be revised to include ' broken but working ', or something along those lines , in order to be more clear .
neutral	otherwise , if you have a phone in perfect as new condition ( if this is possible after a couple of years ' use !)
neutral	it '_s probably a great service .
neutral	ordered over_£_00 of goods but one item was discontinued - not my fault but was hit with delivery chaarge as this took order value below £_00 .
neutral	no oportunity given to order anything_else instead . goods arrived on time
neutral	the wrong item was sent but replacement was sent quickly and the courier took the wrong item at the same time .
neutral	all in all a good service .
neutral	glad i did not pay very much for my canvas as the quality was poor , it looked cheap and flimsy and the picture was not very clear .
neutral	in future i would go elsewhere and pay more to get a better quality product .
neutral	a good mobile casino , easy access to your account , game lobby etc .
neutral	easy to contact customer support if needed .
neutral	casino would how ever benefit from afew more games to choose from .
neutral	higher_nature is an excellent supplier of vitamins and minerals and i really like their ' true food ' range .
neutral	i have been using it for many_years .
neutral	i usually order over the phone but this time went online .
neutral	the process of ordering online was slow and i must have pressed the ' selenium ' button too many_times .
neutral	the type of selenium i ended_up with wasn_'_t even the ' true food ' one that i usually get - so i was a bit_miffed .
neutral	i am pleased with the boxes as they are strong and look good .
neutral	unforturtunately they were delivered to the wrong_address so they were not with me until monday !
neutral	they were to deliver work for an_exhibition on friday so it is cutting it very fine .
neutral	i am a women '_s size 00 , so as advised i ordered one size up in a superdry hoodie .
neutral	when it came the sizing was completely wrong , far to small i couldn_'_t even get it over my head , so ended_up having to swap it for a large in a nearby store ..
neutral	customer service was excellent :))
neutral	i can '_t_believe someone can pack a product in a box knowing it is damaged , i ordered a purse and was extremely disappointed in the condition when it arrived , this is down to bad quality control and a don_'_t care attitude , this was an expensive item and looked like it was 00_hrs old .
neutral	good usually but it would be helpful if orders are cancelled to know and toknow why .
neutral	matter sorted now but not happy at the time .
neutral	the flowers looked ok on the image on site .. but i was quite disappointed and embarrassed with what arrived at my friends house ..
neutral	although the colour was good .. it needs a little green sprig or something to make it less stark and sad looking !
neutral	despite my selecting a future delivery date , it seemed to default to standard delivery and so my chocolates have been delivered before i needed them , and when i couldn_'_t accept them .
neutral	hopefully they will still be at my work when i get back .
neutral	if you ' re wanting them for a future date , make_sure that you pay extra for the delivery , or order them sooner to when you need them .
neutral	after_placing my order online , booked car into chosen garage on wed_00th , chose am , when i turned_up the tyres weren_'_t in stock until tomorrow , thurs_00th .
neutral	this was no use to me as my car was booked in for its mot first thing .
neutral	the guy at national_tyres contacted tyre_shopper to explain , they spoke to me and apologised that i should '_ve been contacted to be informed , which i wasn_'_t .
neutral	i asked to speak with the manager , who did phone me back , explained that the inverness branch got deliveraries on thursdays , she offered me tyres which were in stock , but had a balance of £_00 so she said as a good will gesture i would just have £_00 to pay , i was happy with that as i was getting better tyres_fitted in the end .
neutral	i was disappointed with the whole_experience but was resolved in the end .
neutral	maybe tyre_shopper should be aware of this mistake and inform there customers about delivery of tyres in the chosen garage .
neutral	i purchased a dualit_toaster and i can '_t grumble at the price which was very competitive and i was kept up to date on delivery times .
neutral	however , the goods were faulty and go - electrical wrongly suggested that the grids had moved out of position during_transit and asked me to telephone dualit for advice on pushing them back into place .
neutral	dualit advised me that this was not the case and that the toaster needed to be replaced .
neutral	i then e_mailed go - electrical on 00 / 0 / 00 asking them to ring me as they only have a ' 0000 ' contact number which is expensive to phone but they did not ring and did not e_mail back until 00 / 0 / 00 .
neutral	they have now replaced the toaster but i think they tried to pass the buck on to the manufacturer when it is their duty to deal with this kind of situation as my contract is with them , not the manufacturer and in the past i have been told by consumer_direct not to contact manufacturers as , in doing this , you can lose some of your rights under the sale of goods_act .
neutral	i would hesitate in purchasing from a company that only has a ' 0000 ' number as , if anything_goes_wrong , it can cost you a fortune in calls to correct which is adding to the company '_s profits .
neutral	you have to question why they only have a ' 0000 ' number .
neutral	i recently took a tour this saturday and our tour_guide was not able to manage time very well .
neutral	although we had about an_hour after our cheese tasting the guide had us all wait for each other outside the cheese store .
neutral	because we had to wait for other people making purchases that decreased the time we had for dinner .
neutral	by the time everyone had finished making their purchases we only had a half an_hour left for dinner .
neutral	had the guide been timely we would '_ve had one full hour however we were left with just 00_minutes to order and eat dinner .
neutral	that '_s just the biggest time management complaint that i had about the day .
neutral	for the holland in 0 day tour i was disappointed because although we visited three major cities we only drove through them .
neutral	i thought we would at_least be able to get out the bus and take some pictures but apparently it '_s just a drive through .
neutral	both of the tours that i took i do not regret taking - however there was much room for improvement .
neutral	not a good start for a first time customer .
neutral	still_awaiting outcome
neutral	bought honda_civic 0000 onwards mats .
neutral	the materials used are pretty good ( especially the drivers one with the heel_pad ) but the finishing is not to the standard of the authentic honda mats .
neutral	the ones i received are not an exact fit either but i have kept them as i couldn_'_t be bothered to go through the hassle of returning them .
neutral	received my order in a post_office plastic_bag because the box goods arrived here in was soaking_wet or so i thought .
neutral	after opening the box the oil i had ordered had leaked out onto all the other products ruining all the other packaging .
neutral	although the other products were not spoiled just the packaging ( they were gifts for other people ] i emailed the said company who responded by telling_me to return the goods and they will resend unfortunately for me the gifts were needed imminently so i wont_be sending them back what i will be doing is choosing a different company to use .
neutral	the whole point of ordering on line for me is to save my time shopping in town which i ended_up doing anyway .
neutral	sadly i have used that company for years [ trouble free shopping ] i dont want the aggravation of rewrapping and reposting so they have lost one customer
neutral	my coat arrived in good time , but it isn_'_t the high_quality i would expect from superdry .
neutral	there are some fraying in the stitching around the cuffs .
neutral	also the zips are temperamental .
neutral	i don_'_t predict the coat will last very long .
neutral	once you bought of them , they bombard you with e_-_mails ...
neutral	i found this to be embarrassing due to the fact my children use my e_- mail account .
neutral	so i had to keep checking it all the time ...
neutral	the ordering & delivery service was excellent but i was disappointed how poorly protected the worktops and upstands were , being merely placed inside a big clear polythene_bag .
neutral	there are a number of marks & dents but i am hoping my kitchen_fitter can work around them by putting them underneath or by sanding etc .
neutral	the finish on the upstands is quite rough and from what i can see no amount of sanding will alter this .
neutral	whislt the price is competitive i was also disappointed to find the price per length had gone up by £_00 from the time of ordering samples to orderiing the worktops proper .
neutral	i am not entirely unhappy overall but maybe you get what you pay for .
neutral	i recently hired a car , collected from perpignon and drop_off in carcassonne .
neutral	all went well when i booked via phone .
neutral	i was informed that i would have too pay an amount for dropping the car at a different location when i picked_up the car , that an additional driver could be included or free & i availed of the excess .
neutral	when i picked_up the car i had a print out from rental_cars .
neutral	i had to battle for an_hour with the eurocar girl , she wanted to charge me again for everything .
neutral	and 000_euro for dropping the car to a different location .
neutral	even thought everything was in my printout .
neutral	we eventually sorted it out but it took over an_hour and i had to argue every detail .
neutral	her english was not great but i really felt it was better_than she pretended ( there was anorher woman there who had better english but who didn_'_t help even thought she was free for the last 00_mins ) and others may have just paid her for what they had already included in their booking .
neutral	also the map they gave_us when leaving was incorrect .
neutral	the overall quality of the costume is good !
neutral	the poduct looks exactly like on the picture - which is a big plus as you know what you are getting !
neutral	however the sizing of the costume is slightly_larger than i '_d expected , i '_ve ordered an m , and i am an average_height slim ( but not skinny ) woman and the costume is a bit big .
neutral	as the back of the costume contains an elastic , a size smaller would have been perfect .
neutral	j ' ai_commandé plusieurs sortes de viandes dont des volailles .
neutral	la date limite de consommation de_la dinde était très proche de_la date de_livraison .
neutral	livrée le 00 , date de péremption le 00 pour_une consommation le 00 ... lorsque je_l ' ai sortie de_l ' emballage cellophane , elle était un_peu limite ... en revanche rien_à dire pour_les autres viandes .
neutral	très_bon emballage .
neutral	the items i purchased seem as though they will do what i want them to do perfectly .
neutral	however my parcel was delivered to totally the wrong_address and person inspite of it being labelled with my name , address and postcode clearly .
neutral	by sheer_chance it went to someone i actually know so i was able to retrive the parcel quite quickly .
neutral	i used to love this ... then i started_playing wow ...
neutral	why have four - weekly payments ?
neutral	who gets paid every four_weeks ?
neutral	it would be so much_better with monthly_payments .
neutral	every year at some point i have to struggle to make two payments from one months wages as , like most people , i get paid 00 times a year but littlewooods ask for 00 payments .
neutral	i '_m actually thinking_about not using littlewoods anymore because of this which is a real_shame because the service is great and goods always as advertised .
neutral	thank_you for a lovely ( if not small ) bunch of flowers ..
neutral	i had hoped that they would be delivered before_lunch_time being as they left the depot a 0am .
neutral	unfortunately , they were delivered after 0 . 00 .
neutral	i know i only paid for standard delivery , but i was hoping they would get there a bit quicker .
neutral	oh , and as for a " grandissimo " bunch of flowers , they could have been a bit bigger !
neutral	first time i have used this company and it is not going well .
neutral	two items are on late delivery which was not advised on the website at the time of order back in early october .
neutral	also , i have had to ring up because one of the items marked down as being delivered was not received .
neutral	fingers_crossed .
neutral	very fast delivery and really good communication via emails however when the items arrived .
neutral	0 out if the 0 waistcoats were marked and had to be sent back .
neutral	hopefully they will be sent back post_haste and be of an excellent quality as the other 0 are .
neutral	regards miss wood
neutral	great courier , but these shops do not want to take in parcels if they look too_big .
neutral	( even_though they are in the stated dimensions ) and weight
neutral	having a lot of problems with collect_+ drop_off points .
neutral	please try and sort_out these problems with these shops ( ie .
neutral	asda , and local_shops ) as getting a lot of bad_experience with shop workers .
neutral	on the monday i rang kwik - fit to make arrangments for two tyres to be replaced and was told that they would be ready for fitting between 0 and 00 on the wednesday .
neutral	two_days time .
neutral	on the wednesday_morning i received a call to say that the tyres had not been delivered so would be fitted until the afternoon .
neutral	i had to make other arrangments because they could not get their act_together with 00_hours notice .
neutral	guys who came were quick as it was their last job of the day and they only lived down the road .
neutral	is that a coincidence_?
neutral	some years_ago i went to the kwik - fit garage in otley for new tyres and there the tyres were not delivered when they said they would be .
neutral	probably will not go to them again as they do not stick to the times that they say they will do things .
neutral	was informed by email that my order had been dispatched the day i placed it so was in receipt of the goods the following_day which was great but was disappointed to find that they sent me a different flavour of dog_food to what i ordered .
neutral	needed a spare_key for our tow_bar . and on googling found this site ... really happy with price .. not so happy with postage .
neutral	it was 0 . 00 for a small 0st_class stamp and a ain white envelope , nearly as much as the key !
neutral	i ordered 0 doors from kershaws because the prices are good and they stock a variety of sizes which i needed and couldn_'_t get in the normal diy_stores .
neutral	delivery was quoted as 0_weeks .
neutral	i received an_email_stating that the order was completed after the stated 0_weeks , but no details about delivery - i called them and was told they had been sent to ' despatch ' and i should receive a phone_call or email to confirm delivery .
neutral	i heard_nothing for 0_days so called them again - the guy i spoke to was helpful and apologetic , said the doors were due for delivery on that day , but explained that they use an_independent delivery company who he would need to contact .
neutral	the delivery company then phoned me to arrange delivery for 0_days_later - after some questionning from me the guy admitted they '_d already had the doors for 0_days but still couldn_'_t deliver for another 0_days - 0_days to deliver 0 doors ?!
neutral	he said they '_d called me & left several messages on my mobile at the start of the week - this was a blatant_lie .
neutral	he offered no apology or explanation for the delay .
neutral	i phoned kershaws back to let them know what a poor service the delivery company were giving , the guy at kershaws was understanding and polite and said they would try to improve their service .
neutral	so it took nearly 0_weeks for me to get the doors - the doors are fine but i wouldn_'_t use the company again due to the length of time it took - it '_s a pity a good company is being let_down by their deliveries .
neutral	there were no_problems with the actual transaction and service , however i felt a little let_down on the quality of the yoshi costume .
neutral	i paid £_00 and had to spend extra money on customising my outfit so it was fit to wear !
neutral	it had one single piece of velcro at the top of the costume to hold the entire thing together , so it was gaping open .
neutral	i had to sew multiple pieces of velcro onto it to make it appropriate .
neutral	for £_00 , i feel i was let_down on quality with a product that wasn_'_t properly fit for purpose .
neutral	i have used_serenta a few_times but the delivery on the 00th_march was a disapointment to me and my friend who had a birthday that day ......... usually serenta delivery am but even_though i ordered these flowers a few_days before the date of the birthday they did not arrive till gone 0pm in the afternoon - i would used_serenta again as the flowers are usually very good and this is the first time they did not arrive as i expected in the morning .
neutral	sent three phones - one of which went through as valued based on the imei .
neutral	one went through fine , i was told the others were worth £ 0 each as_opposed to £_00 after mazuma had received them !
neutral	service was otherwise efficient and fast .
neutral	i recently booked tickets for a crossing with brittany_ferries with ' a ferry ' but as there was no option on the order form to claim my usual property owners discount i went_ahead , believing that i would be able to claim it from brittany_ferries later .
neutral	i was wrong - i wasn_'_t able to do so and have lost out on 0 %_discount this time .
neutral	i found the ' free carriage ' on orders over_£_00 a com
neutral	i place an order over_£_00 and piad £ 0 . 00 carriage as it was too heavy .
neutral	not pleased .
neutral	products seem good though so not too upset .
neutral	should offer free carriage or say so
neutral	i wouldn_'_t really sign up , if you don_'_t shop that often on line .
neutral	you get emails saying you have an inactive account !
neutral	well , yeah , that '_s because i only really shop online for birthday and xmas_pressies and they all fall around the same time of year so it will be in - active until then !
neutral	plus i forget because it just says the sites i want to use don_'_t use it so ......
neutral	it took 0 & 0 / 0_weeks for my products to arrive althought i think this was due to the mail & not beautycow & i didn_'_t receive my free mascara , i will still be shopping with this site but a bit dissapointed .
neutral	the delivery service ups were not given the correct details to be able to deliver the parcel successfully , so - as a result , our goods took over a week to arrive - disappointing .
neutral	last time i ordered from cheapsmells , they delivered using royal_mail , which_meant i came home , found a little card , and on saturday toddled off to the depot in my home town and collected my parcel , which was great .
neutral	this time , i found a little card and it was from a courier .
neutral	couriers are , in my experience , put on this earth to make getting a parcel needlessly difficult .
neutral	they deliver little cards when i am out at work , i cannot get to their depots on saturday because they are miles_away ( this courier doesn_'_t even have that option , you are supposed to ring the number on the card to arrange_redelivery , but i never got to speak to the courier by doing this ).
neutral	anyway , eventually the courier delivered my parcel on a saturday .
neutral	so i got it .
neutral	and it was fine .
neutral	if you are a person_who is in during the day , cheapsmells are great .
neutral	if you live_alone and work full time then best of luck , frankly .
neutral	the perfume is great .
neutral	the prices are good .
neutral	but - couriers !
neutral	i have used diet_chef on and off for a few_years with reasonably good results . as it is fairly expensive , i was pleased to buy at a reduced_rate through_groupon .
neutral	however , once my order was placed , i was amazed to see on my confirmation_email , that my snack choice was completely wrong .
neutral	i called immediately and a very pleasant lady altered it back and sent me a confirming email .
neutral	unfortunately , a few_days_later , i logged_into my account to check progress of my delivery and was amazed to see the order had , once again , changed to food i would never eat .
neutral	i again called diet_chef , where the lady said the only way to change back would be to cancel the complete order and start again .
neutral	i reluctantly_agreed to this , but i very upset that i will now have to wait even longer for my food delivery .
neutral	i bought this so i had a whole month to lose_weight before my september break .
neutral	this is now looking decidedly unlikely .
neutral	overall , not a very good experience , and i would not recommend the customer service .
neutral	just received my 0nd parcel ( 0st being fantastic ), this time though it has_been quite poor .
neutral	the ham was opened when i received it and smelling quite badly .
neutral	the gammon was full of fat and also 0 of the pork_steaks were extremely fatty .
neutral	very surprised at the size of the free range chicken - it looked as it someone had sat on it !
neutral	usually a chicken will last 0 of us for 0 meals but not this one , it was tiny .
neutral	just about had a bit of meat left over for a sandwich .
neutral	definitely not worth the money .
neutral	i will see what the rest of the order is like and decide if i am going to order again but i doubt it !
neutral	!
neutral	i did phone customer_services and they agreed to give me a refund for the ham and half a refund for the gammon !
neutral	customer service is very good but i '_m not very much satisfied with your product because its help me to keep my hair healthy but it doesn_'_t help me regrowth my hair - thanks
neutral	i purchased the bust of diana as a christmas gift for my mother , they called and instead of speaking to me they spoke to her to let her know my order had been shipped , unbelievable !
neutral	no_surprises this christmas , i sent them an_email to say i wasn_'_t happy about what they had done , no response forthcoming .
neutral	the bust arrived and it is beautiful , however it states 00cm on the website , the one i received is 00cm , i also expected to receive the stand she is placed on as it didn_'_t state the stand wasn_'_t supplied , no stand arrived .
neutral	i haven_'_t bothered to email about the size discrepancy as i received no response regarding my last email .
neutral	i had to laugh though when 0_days ago i received an_email_stating my item had been shipped , it has_been sitting in my mothers lounge since christmas day !
neutral	not the best experience i have ever had and i think i will purchase from another_supplier i know who delivers the items as stated and without giving the game away .
neutral	the transaction was smooth without issue , but i was disappointed that a very expensive ' genuine ' panasonic battery would come just wrapped in a clear plastic_bag .
neutral	there was no box for it or paperwork like i have had with other genuine batteries .
neutral	just a clear bag and a bit of ripped paper with handwriting on .
neutral	i cannot tell if this is new or genuine .
neutral	ordered thank_you cards on wednesday_evening and arrived friday_morning so great delivery time .
neutral	very easy to use website as did it all on my phone .
neutral	product was ok quality not as clear as i was expecting pictures came out a little hazy paid quite a lot of money for them and just expected a better quality of finish for the price .
neutral	would probably use a different site in future to be honest .
neutral	i '_ve_used liberette for a few_years_now .
neutral	it '_s not a real_mccoy clothes site .
neutral	it '_s about gaining the best immitation item you can find at a lower price ..
neutral	i accept that .
neutral	yes , their sizes are quite small .
neutral	i do wish they ` d get bigger_sizes in ..
neutral	i '_d buy from them much more if they did .
neutral	they have seals on their items which means if you break it you can '_t return it which i think is silly as well .
neutral	good for underwear but useless on one size items and stretchy items .
neutral	we need to try cloths on its a simple fact of purchasing .
neutral	in all .. cheap , cheerful and quick delivery .
neutral	some quality compromised for a lower price .
neutral	just don_'_t break that seal !
neutral	!
neutral	it is ridiculous that only credit_card can hold money for excess_insurance as a debit_card shows funds available .
neutral	paperwork should be clear about this including reminders of what to bring .
neutral	saves being stung for whole rental charge again for extra insurance .
neutral	was totally_ripped_off
neutral	service good , quality and price good , sadly colour not good .
neutral	described as ` magenta ` which is a maroon pink , shocking_pink arrived , so i was disappointed as i had spent valuable time selecting the right colour .
neutral	but i got over it , thankyou .
neutral	i ordered a printer from the website , which seemed to indicate that it would be available .
neutral	the next_day came a commendably early call to my wife ( as i was at work ) advising that , although the printer was advertised on the website , it was no_longer available .
neutral	an_alternative was offered , but at over twice the cost ( plus_vat ).
neutral	a further call followed while i was still at work , wanting to speak to me as the card_holder and then promising to call later , when i returned .
neutral	no call came , despite my waiting in , so i went elsewhere for my new printer - a lost opportunity for the company .
neutral	the room was fine , the service was fine .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t use any stronger words than that .
neutral	the shower was great if you ' re under 0 foot_tall due to the fact it can '_t be adjusted for taller folk .
neutral	i , however , am nearly 0 foot_tall .
neutral	the fire_alarm going at at half 0 in the morning was just great .
neutral	little disappointed with the flowers , as thet didn_'_t seem as big as the bunch in the picture , i felt i could of brought a better bunch in a supermarket .
neutral	i was also disappointed with the fact i said if the recipient was not in , to leave them with the neighbour but they were left on the porch and i later found out someone was in and the doorbell wasnt actually rung .
neutral	very efficient service , flowers beautiful
neutral	i browsed the net and serenta were the most reasonable florist i found .
neutral	i wanted to send my brother and sister in law a bunch to celebrate the birth of their first child .
neutral	i thought the service was really good .
neutral	kept in touch with me with the progress of the order , when it was dispatched an delivered etc .
neutral	my brother in law sent us a picture of the flowers they received .
neutral	they looked nothing like the picture of the flowers i ordered .
neutral	we ' re different_colours and quite a lot of greenery which was a bit_disappointing .
neutral	the size of the bouquet however was bigger_than_expected .
neutral	i couldn_'_t add a photo to the card , so i went back and changed the card to one that doesn_'_t need to be personalised with a photo but there was no way to write in the card and no opportunity to review what the card said before payment .
neutral	i think i have just ordered a blank card with the flowers !
neutral	service was good however i had to pay special delivery to be insured and this cost 0 pounds not so good
neutral	the prices were really good bit the only problem i had was i couldn_'_t enter my discount_code because there wasn_'_t a box at the checkout like i was told there was !
neutral	the website timed out too quickly and said payment wasn_'_t authorised although my bank said it was .
neutral	after phoning bank three_times and travelup twice , the bank eventually said an_hour later that it hadn_'_t gone_through so had to to do it again and this time it went through .
neutral	very irritating !
neutral	good price , though .
neutral	got an epi - brace to replace the one i got a couple of years_ago ( which was great ) but the new one is made of a different material and doesn_'_t give the same support - it also slides out of place .
neutral	the staff were incredibly helpful in assisting me with buying a pair of ski_goggles over the phone and internet .
neutral	however , the original product was not in stock and the alternative goggles were rubbish and bent out of shape when worn for 0 day so were unwearable for the rest of the trip .
neutral	ordered in january_sale on 00th_jan_0000 .
neutral	now 0rd_feb and i still do not have my complete order which i have paid for .
neutral	my mirror ( marked_fragile ) arrived in pieces and my sink_unit was smashed .
neutral	despite_assurances of replacement i still have not received .
neutral	promised now for 0th_feb .
neutral	it will look lovely when it is done but for last three_weeks i have had no working bathroom
neutral	good service finally after missing some questions on my top up i received it the following_day
neutral	was very easy to upload and make .
neutral	only down_side was it took_ages to come and when it did come the front_cover had air_bubbles in it and the edge of the book wasn_'_t great either .
neutral	other than that all was good .
neutral	not sure i would use them again .
neutral	plus_side was that i had a voucher so didn_'_t cost a lot .
neutral	really easy to order , kept you informed about delivery . this was my second order with them , the first really pleased . this time abit disappointed . sent as a thank_you for my mum , isaw them two_days after delivery and all the roses and two of the lilies were dead !
neutral	my mum said she had to pick brown dead leaves off when they arrived .
neutral	i don_'_t know wether to give them another chance or not ........ shame really .
neutral	your coffee_pods are improving but still have a little way to go to equal nepresso pods
neutral	the food was nice , a good portion but some of the flavours we a bit bland so i added spice / herbs to balance the existing flavours .
neutral	it is as if the platate that quality tasted was scared to be more experimental .
neutral	bride and groom website was excellent to use and when i needed to contact customer service they were excellent and very helpful .
neutral	however , i received my invitations the other day and was a little disappointed at the quality of them but will just have to use them !
neutral	overall ten out of ten for service , 0 out of 00 for product .
neutral	ziffit offered a good online service , easy to use with lots of e_- mail communication .
neutral	where it fell down slightly for me was the collection service - was a pain to find a collect_+ location near me and necessitated going out of my way to drop_off the parcel .
neutral	would be better if it offered a courier service - or just royal_mail - as its competitors do .
neutral	easy ordering , delivery ok . not the fastest but all received .
neutral	however i was disappointed that the worming_tablets i purchased have a very short use by date .
neutral	i bought in bulk to last at_least a year but the ones i received need to be used by the beginning of august , so some will end up getting put in the bin .
neutral	they ' re not cheap to just throw_away either :( i would buy again but would be selective in my purchases so '_s not to be short_dated again .
neutral	i have no_issues with the booking process , however due to the late arrival of the chauffer on my departure i nearly_missed my flight .
neutral	the company was called stress_free parking and i waited 00minutes for a chauffer to arrive .
neutral	i had to make a number of calls to check their progress and in fact check - in had closed by the time i reached the counter .
neutral	i had already advised the controller that if i had to pay any change of booking_fees that these would be forwarded to the company as the whole idea of booking valet_parking was to ensure minimum delay .
neutral	as it happened the flight was late in boarding and my checked bag was able to be accepted through security .
neutral	this combination of these two factors meant that i was the last to board my flight .
neutral	needless to say it was not a stress_free parking experience .
neutral	i hadnt realised my cousin had moved and unfortunately gave you her old address . unfortunately as the flowers were left_outside and not with a neighbour the mistake was '_t picked_up .
neutral	i really like your styles , colour options and the quality of the materials used , however , i have had to send many things back because your size 0 is very large by normal standards and you don_'_t do many things in size 0 .
neutral	i also think a petitie length in skirts , dresses and trousers would add a lot to your ranges as i have had to get a few things tailored separately to ensure they fit as advertised because i am only 0 " 0 .
neutral	also , your standard delivery times are pretty long compared to most online clothing retailers which is a little inconvenient .
neutral	thanks
neutral	lauren
neutral	have since seen this product elsewhere since my purchase and realize that it needs a pump .
neutral	there was no leaflet whatsoever in the box .
neutral	prompt service though .
neutral	quick and simple service however it is difficult to communicate any_queries .
neutral	it stated on the website that there were a variety of colours in the ' luxury posey ' i had requested , however there was no where that i could see on ordering to choose this , i therefore emailed the customer support email address to which i got no reply .
neutral	i also requested a delivery date of the 00 . 00 . 00 and the flowers got delivered the day before .
neutral	this would usually not be a problem but felt it was a little inconsiderate as they were for a funeral and there was a reason for the date specified .
neutral	pleased , however with the price and being_able to arrange flowers to be delivered at short_notice many miles from where we live .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	hi ordered a wallet and this was received no problem .
neutral	i am still_waiting on the womens t shirt i ordered .
neutral	what do i need to do to make an enquiry ?
neutral	thanks
neutral	laura walsh
neutral	having placed my order and then thought i '_d made a mistake , emailed customer_services to ask them to stop order so we could review it .
neutral	no reply but parcel arrived following_day .
neutral	in the event , i hadn_'_t made a mistake and everything was fine , but would have appreciated an_email / phone_call to say so before parcel sent .
neutral	i thought the delivery was rather slow .
neutral	i ordered this on the 00th_aug and was not delivered till 0_days_later i know that your terms say 0 - 0 working_days but a lot of your competitors we use are next_day delivery .
neutral	... item was delivered to a neighbour .
neutral	i received no notification of the delivery , so didn_'_t know to collect the item .
neutral	ended_up emailing ghd to see where my delivery was , only to be told it had been delivered and to ' check with my neighbours '.
neutral	not the best solution really .
neutral	product is excellent though - love it !
neutral	on the minus side - i purchased the lou soft_leather look top handle shopper - product code : azz00000 .
neutral	when ordering the bag online i studied the photo carefully as i rather liked the idea of a zip_pocket on the outside .
neutral	when the bag arrived it did not have a zip_pocket on the outside , nor did it have a seam down the middle outside of the bag !
neutral	i was rather disappointed as i tend to prefer a zip on the outside to put my keys in .
neutral	basically it was not as advertised so i feel a bit_cheated .
neutral	on the plus_side - the delivery was quicker_than stated .
neutral	i decided not to send the bag back as firstly , normally bags like that are heavy before you put anything in it but this was extremely light and secondly , i really couldn_'_t be bothered to go through the returns_procedure .
neutral	shame it was not as advertised on the web_site !
neutral	make_sure you can read your email fully before you order .
neutral	i recently ordered from active_beauty because they had a special_offer on if you spent over_£_00 .
neutral	unfortunately i could not make out the code required on my email so they would not honour the offer .
neutral	it was only for a small sample of hair oil but they were so petty about it i will never buy from them again .
neutral	good service and delivery although i ordered 0 costumes and one had a hole in it and 0 had to have the sleeves sewn on :(
neutral	very good website , excellent prices but not very good with choice of delivery options and speed of delivery
neutral	although this site has lots of choice of products it isn_'_t an easy site to work out what you want or need .
neutral	the batteries don_'_t last that long and the flavours aren_'_t the best .
neutral	it '_s ok , but you can get a gold card for free by searching , people who don_'_t still pay booking_fees , which is weird .
neutral	if anything_goes_wrong with the booking , it '_s almost_impossible to contact them , except to receive cit and pasdte tandc until you give up .
neutral	i have purchased from pcspecialists for many_years and will_continue all in all still a good service but when building your_own computer on line they don_'_t tell you of any compatability issues in my case i had the rampage motherboard and cosmos 0 tower i added two usb 0 '_s to the front of the tower but was not informed that i would loose two out of 0 of my usb0 ports they are there but not working as they can '_t be attached to the motherboard ?
neutral	so i have wasted money .
neutral	also i have a 0 . 0 creative speaker system but i can only use 0 . 0 as the motherboard doesn_'_t have the grey sound port ?
neutral	this was not explained to me but the tech guy '_s when i asked about my sound system ?
neutral	lastly i can '_t connect my brother_printer wirelessly and the tech guy '_s again can '_t help instead they tell me to contact the hardware manafacturer of the wireless card they installed ?
neutral	if products had been wrapped / posted more carefully i would have been happy however products ordered were literally jammed into a tiny jiffy_bag which damaged the boxes on the small lanvin & diesel fragrances .
neutral	the despatch_note looked like it had been crumpled up in the plam of your hand to get it to squeeze in the packet .
neutral	the fragrances are for gifts for stocking_fillers - now minus the boxes !
neutral	!
neutral	my husband laid the tiles and after inspecting his work i found 0 of them were blemished .
neutral	0 had scags and 0 were not finished off properly .
neutral	i would have liked to have returned them but having done all the work to put them down we tried to put damaged tiles out of the way .
neutral	i have booked a weekend_break from wowcher for my birthday .
neutral	i called the hotel with queries and found out that the main purpose of our visit was unavailable to us .
neutral	the wowcher deal was misleading to say the least .
neutral	the break is this weekend and i have tried all the contact numbers which had me going in circles , referring me to the website and then hanging up on me .
neutral	i have e_- mailed but they say they will reply within 00_hrs this will be too late .
neutral	first order not very impressed , horse_wormers not delivered no alternatives given .
neutral	dog_wormer good price but 0 / 0 an order is no good to me as ive now to got to re - order again & time is money
neutral	courier / delivery guy couldn_'_t find our property even_though we are a business !!!!
neutral	, nothing but hassle with follow_up emails and calls & then the cheeky b ---- r had the bad manners to leave his crisp packet on the drive & ask for directions to his next drop_off hasn_'_t he heard of sat navs !!!.
neutral	i would need a lot of convincing to use this company again
neutral	the people at trueshopping were super , and tried their best to help us when their delivery company failed to arrive in time , we waited in all day until 0 . 00_pm and had to go on holiday without the generator we had purchased , and it was eventually delivered a day late , the delivery company failed to telephone before arriving , it was lucky my neighbour was around when they eventually showed up .
neutral	if i was buying again , i '_d be reluctant to use trueshopping because their despatch company lets them down .
neutral	i put order in thursday last_week and still do not have it where is it have not email about delivering jet
neutral	the flowers i ordered were delivered on time and packaged well , but the boquet that arrived was nowhere_near as large as it looks in the photograph on the website .
neutral	i was actually quite embarrassed when my house mate came home with them , considering the price i paid .
neutral	i '_ve just bought some angel delight ice_cream mix from british_corner_shop as i couldn_'_t find it in the shops .
neutral	it '_s really lovely , but the postage_charges are rather high so it will sadly be a one off purchase .
neutral	i was greeted_by the reps at the aiport with no_problems , signed some paper_work and the car was mine .
neutral	i selected a golf on the choice menu and was adviced i will get a golf or a similar car .
neutral	instead i got an old megan reno , a very long car which i am not used to driving .
neutral	i had to drive for 000_miles to get to my destination .
neutral	when i drove past 00 miles per hour , car was shaking and by the end of the journey i had a headache .
neutral	my dad told me that car shakes due to unbalanced tyres .
neutral	i was expecting a newer car that is easy and comfortable to drive .
neutral	wouldn_'_t use this company again
neutral	it took me almost an_hour to remove the horrible labels from each item of cutlery - please would you add easy - peel labels rather_than the paper ones that eventually required resorting to the use of label - remover to get them off , which probably also removed a little of the shiny surface of the cutlery .
neutral	on the plus_side , there was very good communication_regarding delivery date etc .
neutral	i got the product quickly but when i received it the product was a bit scuffed and had a dark stain on it .
neutral	it '_s a real_shame as it '_s a christmas_present and i don_'_t have time to return it .
neutral	still not received my order dispatched on 0 / 0 /_0000 today is 00 / 0 /_0000
neutral	i recently bought a cd / dvd_player for a present .
neutral	it was delivered quickly - no_problems .
neutral	however , the system was not what i expected , it was quite noisy when playing and since it was for a small room , i decided to return it immediately .
neutral	it was not fit for purpose and - i thought faulty .
neutral	however , i had to return it at my own cost , they checked the product and stated that this noise was standard for these players and therefore there was no fault .
neutral	i lost what it cost me to send the product back to them and ' almost ' the cost of the original postage ( as they only refund the actual cost of the product itself - not postage ).
neutral	i have not dealt_with any other shop online or otherwise to date which follows this type of policy - normally a refund is a simple affair , whether its faulty or not you can get your money back and you certainly wouldn_'_t be expected to pay the postage .
neutral	however , i can '_t fault the customer service , i was in regular contact with 0 people in particular and they were very polite , friendly and helpful all the time .
neutral	i have since bought a cheaper version from asda which barely makes a sound when the discs spinning - great .
neutral	everything went well with the order , until it came to delivery .
neutral	i was told 00nd_january , but when they didn_'_t arrive , i emailed to query this but didn_'_t get a response .
neutral	on the 00th_january i rang , spoke to a very nice lady_who said the computer was running slow and she '_d call me back in 00_minutes .
neutral	she didn_'_t .
neutral	0 hours_later i rang back again , and was told that due to a system glitch , my order hadn_'_t ever been passed to the warehouse tofulfil .
neutral	we agreed that the tiles would be delivered on 00st_january ( some 0_days_later than originally ordered ).
neutral	i then got a text on 00th_january telling_me my tiles would arrive on 00th_january - a day early , and when i would have no - one at home to receive them .
neutral	so , more phone_calls , more apologies , more messing_around generally , before the tiles finally arrived on 00st_january .
neutral	i don_'_t imagine my experience is the " norm ", but really not impressed on this occasion .
neutral	really disappointed and rather cross as i am paying more for the three_days in the long_stay car_park in may than i am for parking a week in june in the silver_zone car_park !
neutral	tasty pizzas and with offers such as ' two for tuesdays ' they are more affordable than ever before .
neutral	lots of great student offers but unfortunately still not a touch on competitors like pizza_hut !
neutral	the guys were great who installed the machine .
neutral	worked hard even_though it was late after a busy day on the move .
neutral	however we had to have our water turned off for the next 00_hours because it was leaking and get a friend who '_s a plumber to come and fix the leak - because the new machine doesn_'_t need a connection to the hot_water tap .
neutral	surely this is a common problem that the piece of plastic required s is a standard piece of kit that should be carried by your engineers ?
neutral	otherwise very good service and very happy with the machine .
neutral	i was delighted with your service , aknowledgment of my order and delivery was excellent .
neutral	however , i am disappointed with my slippers .
neutral	in_spite of having worn your slippers over the years , my new ones are far too tight and uncomfortable .
neutral	unfortunately , i disposed of the packaging etc .
neutral	so sure was i that the slippers would be satisfactory , going on past experience .
neutral	ordered two items both delivered before delivery date . the sofa came with the incorrect sofa cushions and despite_numerous_calls the correct items still not delivered
neutral	bed is of a really good quality and very comfortable ... annoying that the delivery team did not unpack or remove packing materisl
neutral	we rang 00_mins before arriving at airport as requested and they had no record of our booking .
neutral	to be fair they did send someone out fairly quickly and we didn_'_t have too long to wait .
neutral	i have used different airport_parking companies and this is the first time this has happened
neutral	i ordered a bunch of flowers for same day delivery .
neutral	i ordered at 00 : 00 , cut_off was 00 : 00 .
neutral	at 00 : 00 i received a call from e_florist to say the florist couldn_'_t deliver tonight but would deliver tomorrow ( saturday ).
neutral	they chucked in a box of chocolates which was fair_enough .
neutral	then on monday i called them as the flowers were not delivered .
neutral	after me calling about 0 times they said they would refund me ... i didn_'_t get a refund but the flowers did eventually arrive .
neutral	pointless having a same day delivery option and i was disappointed i didn_'_t get my refund but to be honest i couldn_'_t be bothered to keep phoning them .
neutral	despite all the problems , the staff were very friendly
neutral	my past experience with pcspecialist has always been positive .
neutral	my latest order has_been a bit dissapointing .
neutral	the specification for my machine was quite high for running xphe , but the performance is very poor .
neutral	i investigated this further and can put it down to the hitachi 0tb hdd having a write speed of 00mb / s and a read speed of 000mb / s .
neutral	the write speed is very dissapointing and drags the performance of what would be a very good computer that will be used for video editing .
neutral	the hdd is also very noisy compared to the previous machines i have ordered from pcspecialist .
neutral	finally , the promised firewire sockets were absent , however a pci card is in the post .....
neutral	the package i ordered was perfect , exactly_what i ordered and it was delivered on the right day , however the delivery man knocked once and didn_'_t even wait for me to get to the door ( it only took me a matter of seconds ) before he shoved an attempted delivery note through the door and drove_off .
neutral	consequently this meant that i had to rearrange delivery for the next_day and wait in again .
neutral	which i did and the driver did the same thing again !
neutral	i just caught him in time as he was walking off !
neutral	so the quality of my package was excellent however the delivery men seemed in to much of a hurry to wait for me to get to the door !
neutral	when i received the item one of the parts was faulty rendering the entire walking_aid unusable .
neutral	i reported this immediately , emailing a photo of the faulty part and requesting a replacement part .
neutral	their response was ' we '_ll see what we can do '.
neutral	after 0_days i had heard_nothing so i emailed them again and posted my review on trust_pilot .
neutral	this elicited a swift response , apology and replacement of the faulty part .
neutral	so although customer service was initially poor they did acknowledge their shortcomings and rectified the situation .
neutral	happy to receive my 00 page photo_book quickly .
neutral	however the photo reproduction quality is poor , colours are darker_than they should be and images are flat .
neutral	i have used photoworld before and been happy , but this latest book is disappointing .
neutral	this book is to record our latest holiday , but it would have been worse if this were a wedding or other special event .
neutral	i use expensive camera equipment and my photos are usually of a fairly high_standard .
neutral	my cheque took almost 0_days to get to me i phoned up and then they discovered it had been lost in the post , the next_day mazuma_mobile sent a cheque again which then arrived the next_day !!!
neutral	next time i would use the direct bank_transfer !!!
neutral	apart_from the that the service is good and i certainly would recommend to a friend ..
neutral	i will be using mazuma_mobile in the near .
neutral	i found the service to be fine but the costume was quite cheaply_made and didn_'_t reflect well in the cost .
neutral	i have ordered costumes from other_companies that are slightly better quality but much_cheaper .
neutral	i found the p_&_p charged to be much higher than necessary too , which is the main_reason i won_'_t be ordering from this company inthe future .
neutral	i waited 0_weeks only to receive the wrong book .
neutral	i had to call them up and arrange for another to be sent out , which took another 0_weeks .
neutral	i had to return the book they sent in error at my own cost , which i wasn_'_t happy about , because it what they sent me was a hardback and it weighed a lot .
neutral	but , this is the only time i '_ve had problems with them .
neutral	when ordering dvds they ' re brilliant .
neutral	whilst the company offer excellent value for money , the time taken to process and deliver my order was ridiculous .
neutral	over a week after paying and placing my order , i still had not received my medication .
neutral	i will use this company again , but make_sure i keep plenty of tablets in hand before ordering .
neutral	the service they offer is pretty good till you decide its something you no_longer want to be part of .
neutral	found it really hard to get out of , tried to make me bend_over_backwards to cancel my order .
neutral	reture them as there wasn_'_t a plug waiting for refund
neutral	flowers were delivered promptly and were beautiful .
neutral	however the recipient didn_'_t receive the message so only knew who they were from and didn_'_t get the meaningful words they were sent with !!
neutral	bit_disappointing when delivery of flowers cost so much !
neutral	!
neutral	and i would prefer to receive payment via bank_transfer .
neutral	i have purchased a pink_lining changing_bag which came in great time but found that i didn_'_t really know when it was to arrive .
neutral	however i was not worried too much as it was a small item which my neighbours could take in without hassle if i was unable .
neutral	i ordered a mattress recently and received an_email that night from city_link and thought it was spam as i know a few have received these and then got a virus because of it .
neutral	i came home to find a card behind the door advising attempted delivery and had 0 options - reschedule or collect .
neutral	i was very concerned_about the size of the mattress and if it would fit in the car so emailed you .
neutral	the reply was blunt and felt blaming towards me as if i had not read the fact that it would be next_day delivery .
neutral	no where on the site advised next_day and the only part was 0 - 00 days which is what i was going with .
neutral	i did get an_apology reply when i sent the relevant links to prove the info i had .
neutral	luckily an elderly_neighbour accepted the delivery so i managed to get the mattress .
neutral	good service , terrible transport agencie
neutral	i think they should offer more swagbucks for everything you do .
neutral	i mean , i never watch those videos , and i bet no one else does either , but it takes nearly 00_minutes to earn 0 swagbucks by ' watching ' them , and 000 = £ 0 .
neutral	and i '_m not a geek and i wouldn_'_t click through ads hundreds of times just to earn some pocket money .
neutral	think about it .
neutral	conclusion : they really should be more generous on the amount of swagbucks awarded , or lower the price of the gift cards .
neutral	the mounting clips and the holes on the blinds are such that removal for cleaning over a reasonably short time will require replacement of both .
neutral	at_least a important is the poor positioning of the joint in the cord relative to fitting of the child safety block .
neutral	been a long time since i hired a car and assumed when i booked it on - line what i was buying was provided by the rental company .
neutral	not so with the cdw , that is something sold by the booking company and totally_unnecessary if you take the comprehensive insurance which is cheaper .
neutral	once you have collected the car you seem unable to get the cdw refunded as it is nothing to do with the rental company themselves .
neutral	the comprehensive insurance option is not available at the time of on - line booking its something you find out when you pick the car up .
neutral	next time i will deal direct with the rental company .
neutral	on opening the rubber selledhet get it tolerable .
neutral	the heel_pad stiching was broken in a couple of areas but the pad was not seperated , it just looked unsightly .
neutral	i was also dissapointed that the mats did not form a sump , in that water from wet_feet will escape onto the carpets as there is no barrier .
neutral	the site was relatively clear and easy to use but i would not describe the prices as ' discount '.
neutral	i paid £_00 . 00 to park at ncp birmingham , exactly the same price as quoted by ncp !
neutral	ordered the product in dark_pink and got blue , but as i required_urgently there was no time to return and wait for a replacement !
neutral	great flowers but they could not find the house so had to ring the lady and tell her of another date so spoiling the suprise
neutral	i was worried once i purchased my item that i hadn_'_t ordered from a secure site as my confirmation_email didn_'_t arrive straight_away .
neutral	when it did arrive there was no reference_number to be seen .
neutral	it seemed to take quite a while for my item to arrive so i went to my email to track the package but this link didn_'_t work the several_times i tried .
neutral	i finally called superdry to be asked ( by an uninterested employee ) for a reference which i didn_'_t have !
neutral	the whole_process didn_'_t feel legit or professional like other large retailers .
neutral	i traded a box of about 00 books .
neutral	three were declined and even the reduced payment still_hasn_'_t turned_up over a month later .
neutral	not the best .
neutral	i traded another box of books through an_alternative who paid me the full_amount within 00days .
neutral	i '_ll stick them next time .
neutral	ordered items after the cut_off time so that i could have them delivered on the date required ( 0nd_october ).
neutral	at 00 . 00 on the due date a courier arrived .
neutral	i understood that the two items were coming from different companies so would not_necessarily arrive together .
neutral	what i wasn_'_t expecting was to have only half the components for my desk delivered with no legs for it and no chair at all .
neutral	of course , their customer service team only work from 00am to 0pm whilst their customers are potentially still_waiting for their goods .
neutral	i am now not at home for another couple of days which means that i can '_t set_up my home office and get it all working .
neutral	buyer_beware - although i still only have half a desk , the customer service that i have since received has_been excellent .
neutral	i sent an_email after the goods failed to arrive and received a call from furniture 000 at 0 . 00am on 0rd_october to sort it out .
neutral	i will update further once the issue has_been resolved .
neutral	final update
neutral	box 0 arrived on time with part of the desk .
neutral	box 0 finally arrived on saturday .
neutral	i firmly_believe this was the fault of city_link ( who are total p00p ).
neutral	the chair that was supposed to arrive next_day was re - scheduled for the saturday with dpd ( confirmation text received ).
neutral	my oh dropped me off at a course in london and had to speed home on the friday because i received a text stating delivery would be friday between 00 . 00 & 00 . 00 .
neutral	apparently they were going to attempt delivery but it was definitely scheduled in for the saturday if no one was home .
neutral	he made it back and within 0 minutes of him being home , dpd delivered .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t use this company again as i spent too much time trying to actually get the goods that had been paid for ,
neutral	of the two seals i received one fitted great the shower_door but the one for the p - shaped screen was difficult and it creased on fitting so not very happy at all with that one !
neutral	!
neutral	this was a get well soon bouquet for the wife of my husband '_s boss .
neutral	didn_'_t want anything too elaborate and accepted the suggested bouquet .
neutral	i added a small balloon on a stick as an extra .
neutral	it was good to be kept_informed of the progress of my order , but i couldn_'_t track it as the only number i had been given was not accepted on the carriers website .
neutral	however , it was delivered on time and we were sent a photo of the bouquet and balloon and although it looked ok , from the photo i wouldn_'_t have said it was as nice as the picture on the website .
neutral	however it did the job of showing we were thinking of her .
neutral	i placed an order of a photobook in time for christmas delivery .
neutral	when it hadn_'_t arrived by the 00rd i asked for the delivery address to be changed as i would not be at my address on 00th .
neutral	i was advised that this could not be done but that my order would definitely be delivered on the 00th .
neutral	i was disappointed that i could not give the photobook as a christmas_present as i had intended , but accepted that delivery on 00th_december was still technically in time for christmas ( even_though i would not be in to receive the order ).
neutral	it is now 00th_december and i have still not received the order , nor received a ' sorry we missed you ' card to say that delivery was even attempted .
neutral	i am incredibly disappointed that i still cannot give the photobook as a delayed christmas_present as i don_'_t even know where the order is .
neutral	i have requested this information but have received an_automated email to say that i won_'_t get an answer until 00th_december at the earliest .
neutral	this isn_'_t the quality of service i expected from jessops .
neutral	i ordered the photobook from jessops because they were recommended as being the best quality books , so i hope that once i do eventually receive the order it will be worth the wait .
neutral	i was very pleased with the sale items on offer but after_placing my order , due to the server being overloaded and therefore not updating its stock i received an_email_apologising saying they could not provide me with two of my products robots but would be sending one product as an_alternative this was fine .
neutral	however after that i received another email_saying that i could have a discount_code this was great but i didnt want to buy anymore but really wanted the parcel posted as needed it within five days .
neutral	i enquired as it had been a few_days if the parcel had been sent the parcel was sent out that day and was received quickly but found when i opened it that another two products were not included presents i had been counting on two_sets of astronauts so although the games we did receive were great we did have a bit of a disapointment but hopefully we wont have this next time we decide to buy .
neutral	i have been using pet_prescription for just over a year as l have a dog who has diabetes they are a lot_cheaper_than the vet l use , l place an order every_month for about £_000 recently they decided that they were going to change the delivery system .
neutral	on the old system they didn_'_t dispatch on friday because the insulin had to be kept refrigerated and l was fine with that so l adjusted my ordering accordingly .
neutral	without_any notification they decided that the deliveries would only be dispatched on monday , tuesday and wednesday .
neutral	when l placed the order l was not told of the change , they did not contact me , although they said they phoned my mobile but l did not receive an e_- mail or message on my land line so when the insulin didn_'_t arrive l had to go to my vets and buy another bottle .
neutral	i think that they could have put a note on previous_orders to say the change was happening or e_- mailed when the order confirmation was sent .
neutral	this must have affected a lot of other customers and could have been extremely dangerous for my dog and other customers animals .
neutral	if you are lucky , your goods may be delivered to the correct_address .
neutral	out of my last 0 orders , 0 have been delivered to the wrong_address .
neutral	make_sure you know who the courier is , as it is possible it will not be the 0 that viovet say on website .
neutral	deliveries are farmed out to private individuals sometimes .
neutral	just nothing new im_afraid to say the graphics were tired and lacked anything personal i went to pokerstars as it was just a better over all experience .
neutral	my order came with 0 out of 0 handles scratched .
neutral	i have received 0 replacements that are also scratched .
neutral	happy with the speed of response but not the quality control
neutral	the delivery arrangements were brilliant my furniture was delivered on time and the delivery guys were great .
neutral	however when i opened the cabinet three brass screws rolled out which concerned me slightly as i couldn_'_t see where they had come from .
neutral	the screws to fix the door_handles on were too long so i have had to fit washers at the back of them to make them fit .
neutral	also one of the doors doesn_'_t fit properly it is slightly_lower_than the other and seems warped .
neutral	had i paid full price for the cabinet i would have been sending it back as it is i cant be bothered with the hassle as it isn_'_t that noticeable .
neutral	bit disappointed !
neutral	!
neutral	i didn `_t find the female_member of staff very courteous .
neutral	probably my fault that i hadn `_t realised that i had to have a credit_card to put a deposit on petrol , but she was rather snotty about it .
neutral	i thought she could accept cash , so i then had to use the internet on my phone to transfer money onto the card .
neutral	she said that while i did that she would prepare everything , but i was finished in a couple of minutes and had to wait quite a while for the assistant to have everything done .
neutral	in the meantime the male assistant next to her processed two customers .
neutral	the car was excellent , but it was a very frosty_morning and there was no scraper in the car , so we had to sit for about ten_minutes with the blowers on to defrost the windows , which delayed our journey .
neutral	i had assumed the car would be ready .
neutral	i have used budget in newcastle and they were much more obliging .
neutral	someone brought the car down while i was sorting the paperwork .
neutral	bought an item for my husbands_birthday , but then found out the item wasn_'_t supposed to be sold at the price advertised unless you bought a guitar .....
neutral	this was not at all clear on the website and i was charged more to get the item .
neutral	the company did call me to inform_me of this , however , they claimed the website clearly_stated this .
neutral	i did eventually find a note saying if you bought with a guitar you would save on postage ... however i was charged postage on the original item so i would not say this was clear .
neutral	i was , however , very happy with the items , which came promptly and were of good quality but am unlikely to purchase again from this website as i can '_t trust the published prices .
neutral	good prices , easy to use website but all let_down by very poor communication concerning progress of order and delivery .
neutral	the first communication i received about delivery , was an_email_stating that my order " had been despatched " when it had already been delivered several days earlier !
neutral	luckily i was at home , otherwise not sure what the delivery man would have done with 0 large boxes containg 00kg of dog_food and treats , which he had already brought to my door_step before ringing the door_bell !
neutral	i had a similar experience with my last order as well , so not a one off experience unfortunately .
neutral	definite room for improvement in communication .
neutral	my eye_surgery has worked_brilliantly and i have not had any_problems as yet .
neutral	i am really pleased with the results of my surgery and i got the result that i expected ( although not 00 / 00 ).
neutral	my surgery was fine but i am not squeamish .
neutral	i got the results and service that i would expect to receive as a minimum .
neutral	for example all the risks were fully_explained to me and the staff made sure that i was sure about my decision .
neutral	i find the rest of the service a little like being herded through as fast as possible with as little interaction as possible .
neutral	i suppose with optimax being the cheapest i wouldn_'_t expect them to lay_out the red_carpet .
neutral	the literature for lasik is slightly_misleading in that it goes on about how quick the surgery is and how you only need to come_back for one optional after care appointment .
neutral	i knew what to expect but just to warn_others it is more like 0 - 0 after care appointments that they say you should really come_back for .
neutral	all in all i got the results that i expected and i didn_'_t have any_problems but i wouldn_'_t go as far as to call the service good or excellent .
neutral	i '_d say it was the minimum expected standard of care .
neutral	i spent nearly_£_00 i am a vegetarian and i had ordered some tablets it didn_'_t specify if the were suitable for me or not when i received them they had gelatin i '_m them i think this should be highlighted before ordering and when i asked for refund i was given a credit which i '_m not happy with
neutral	i find woucher good value but wish they had more hair colouring / dressing offers !
neutral	got my order wrong !
neutral	the cheque came really fast but i only got £_00 for 0 phones , one a samsung pixon and the other a sony erricsson , they were both a bit_battered but in full working order .
neutral	i have checked out phone shops in my area and i would have got more cash sold to one of those so a bit dissapointed
neutral	will let you know when it is delivered !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i found this suit to be great all around .
neutral	however for me the neck was a bit lose and water is flushing through the suit .
neutral	when the product arrived it was exactly as expected .
neutral	however it was a few_days late and when i phoned superdry to question where the item was no one got back to me .
neutral	i had a day off work waiting for the parcel .
neutral	i then had to wait 0 more days before they tried to deliver .
neutral	because i was in aware they were going to deliver i went out and had to pick it up the following_day . tracking service was absolutely useless as it was never updated .
neutral	i ordered the fins in early june .
neutral	when i got my credit_card statement three_weeks_later and saw that the money had gone_through my account , i wondered when i would actually get the fins .
neutral	it took an_email to the company to ask the question ( but only one , to be fair ) - and the fins were then despatched that day .
neutral	if i had not asked the question would i still be waiting for the fins ?
neutral	nice email from the company but things i have ordered from other people generally arrive within a couple of days - so what happened here ?
neutral	was not sure how to pump the product up as pump didn_'_t fit when i e_- mailed the company 0_days_later they still have not got back to me
neutral	i purchased a deal with living_social , two photo canvas_prints ), one of which was a gift for my parents .
neutral	when we tried to use the voucher it didn_'_t work , i contacted them and the company but had no reply .
neutral	i know other people have used the site and say it is brilliant but i would not use it again given the experience i have had
neutral	we are very happy with dfds .
neutral	we use your service every year and never had problems .
neutral	the only_thing i would say , i find some areas quite dirty ( ie .
neutral	seats in the restaurant )
neutral	when we go on board , all we want to do is have some food and rest for a couple of hours , but it isn_'_t very pleasent when is not clean .
neutral	other than that , very happy with your service .
neutral	although i had not asked for a time of arrival i did expect the flowers to arrive before their 0pm arrival i had asked for deluxe and paid the extra but when they arrived they seemd average size .
neutral	the flowers them selves were nice though
neutral	due to brand restrictions don_'_t ship some brand '_s products outside of the eu , my order has_been cancelled .
neutral	i think there should set some prevention that customers outside the eu could understand the policy as well before ordering .
neutral	i have found the staff helpful .
neutral	the delivery was prompt .
neutral	it '_s a shame the shower_screen pole was too short and i have to order a longer one and pay extra postage .
neutral	be sure to get the right length pole before you order .
neutral	it would be nice to have the £_00 postage waived as a good will gesture considering i have spent so much money in the previous purchase .
neutral	i '_m_sure i was ordering a set of mini opi '_s but i just got one in a weird colour .
neutral	the face_cream offer was very good value however .
neutral	i '_ve had one occasion when the courier has not come to collect a parcel that had been booked in and paid for with no explanation as to why they did not appear and i had to contact them about it .
neutral	lovely flower_arrangement delivered same day have to say the delivery charge from a local_florist was too expensive will not order from here again
neutral	i bought a tv from them and it was delivered very quickly to my surprise .
neutral	unfortunately mine was one of those that were damaged but they were really nice and understanding about it .
neutral	they offered me a full_refund for everything even the postage .
neutral	i am pleased and in the future i will buy from them again
neutral	good value , some very cool bits and bobs on this website .
neutral	however , i placed my order nearly 0_weeks_ago and i am still_waiting for one item to be delivered which is a real_shame as they were purchased as gifts for a friend !
neutral	!
neutral	the item i bought ( olive coloured kraft_paper roll ) was only available at rajapack .
neutral	it arrived in super - quick time , and the item is great - but £ 0 . 00 is way too much for delivery .
neutral	i know that the company deals predominantly with businesses buying in bulk , but i simply wanted a single roll of paper ... the postage was a quarter of the price again .
neutral	if i want to buy paper in future , i will need to exceed £_000 to get free_postage - proving the business doesn_'_t really cater for small start - ups like me who only want small volume delivery with affordable delivery .
neutral	free delivery over_£_00 is pretty standard , and would encourage me to ' push up ' an order to achieve this , but £_000 ?
neutral	far too high .
neutral	i am therefore trying to source the product elsewhere , where the postage will be cheaper ( or free ).
neutral	i have no_complaints regarding the service .
neutral	brilliant and fast service .
neutral	unfortunately i was slightly_disappointed in the costumes as they didn_'_t look much like the pictures .
neutral	we bought the corona pine bedroom set .
neutral	the furniture ( now its finally up ) is lovely , however when we got to the final piece , someone in the packing department had packed the wrong accessories unit , so we didnt have the right screws , nails etc to assemble the furniture .
neutral	not best pleased at the end of a very long day !
neutral	i phoned the customer service dept and was told a new pack would be out to me within 0 working_days - fabulous - but after making a little_bit more of a fuss , someone managed to get the pack out to us 0_days_later .
neutral	no apologies given until i asked for one !
neutral	i will not buy from them again and would advise anyone_thinking of doing so to cross their fingers that the correct set of equipment arrives .
neutral	the booking_reference i was sent did not match the reference used by the airline .
neutral	i had to make an extra telephone_call to opodo to get the correct booking_reference , which i could use for online check in .
neutral	it took extra time and it was rather stressful .
neutral	i don_'_t understand_why i wasn_'_t sent the correct booking_reference in the first place .
neutral	i have used asda online a few_times and they tend to get it right most of the time but on a few occasions i have had quite alot of stuff missing but when i have called them it has_been sorted_out straight_away
neutral	i tried online but dissapointed as it took much longer then expected . will go back to the shop , better service and i get bonus points . i did spent £_00 igave 0 points but on reflection i dont_think it '_s deserved .
neutral	i have used serenata before and been well satisfied but this time i had problems with their website and wanted to contact them .
neutral	i found a phone number but this was no_longer in operation and i then found out that they no_longer have a phone service .
neutral	they did reply to my written message quite quickly however .
neutral	however the flowers arrived the next_day when i had requested a delivery four days_later for my mother '_s birthday - maybe another glitch on their website .
neutral	when i contacted them to point this out - there was just a standard response confirming that they had received my order .
neutral	no apology !
neutral	on the whole very disappointing
neutral	received goods in faulty condition and other item was damage too , very disappointment but had replacements .
neutral	the flowers are lovely and good value but information given to aid tracking of delivery was hopeless and could only email to get information - please make_sure the tracking_reference is very clear for people as waiting for an answer to emails is pointless .
neutral	service was impeccable as always but there was a chip out to the top of one of the side_tables .
neutral	it says clearly that all products are checked off ready to be distributed .
neutral	bit of a pain to have to arrange for a collection and exchange !
neutral	took about a week to be delivered
neutral	wimdu is a good site to show you appartments and to know you have a safe booking .
neutral	i have had 0 good stayed and 0 really bad stay and i was told i should of complained in 00 hour & wimdu could have had help .
neutral	with bad_weather we never arrived till 00_hours_later took to a diffrent appartment no bed sheets and very dirty cold and not what we exspected i had no accec to internet till i got home and has made me not book again .
neutral	the price was good and more i have used the site the more exspencive it is getting so look out for offers also the more you book they sent money off vouchers make shore you look out where to put the code as i missed it and missed out till next booking on discount .
neutral	as they say a bad exsperience can put you off a company when bad customer service is used .
neutral	low_prices and fantastic deals blah_blah are overstated and over rated .
neutral	the repeated emails about incredible bargains usually turn out to be false .
neutral	sorry but this is the truth .
neutral	we were told that two blocks per_person on average use should last four_weeks .
neutral	however , the first two blocks only lasted two_weeks !
neutral	given that they ( harveys ) stated the first blocks should be used up quicker_than subsequent ones .
neutral	but wasn_'_t expecting it to be that quick .
neutral	we are taking note and watching !
neutral	most of my order ok but the pack of wipes very deceptive size of pack indicates large wipes on extracting wipe oh oh very small not very strong tear easily disappointing !
neutral	!
neutral	the flowers would have been beautiful if they weren_'_t half_dead on arrival .
neutral	the staff at e flowers were amazing when i called to complain and instantly refunded my money , however it was a shame that my moms flowers were definitely not in their first bloom !!
neutral	!
neutral	i did not realise i was actually buying a secondhand part .
neutral	generally fitted well , though the neck line was a little too low causing underwear to show .
neutral	very comfortable material .
neutral	the length was very long - great for tall people but may need to be altered for those under 0 ' 0 " ( medium_size dress ).
neutral	only major downside was perhaps build quality - the finger loop snapped immediately when put on .
neutral	however p_&_p v . expensive as it comes from spain ...
neutral	expensive for returns ...
neutral	i have always used paypal and i have accepted certain charges but now whenever i sell items on ebay i have to pay a large percentage to paypal :( most items i sell don_'_t sell for much anyway !
neutral	i '_d accept it , even if it was a much_lower percent of the income .
neutral	maybe more simelar to ebay charges which averages around 00p for me for an item that i sell for £ 0 .
neutral	i love fb and i use it constantly .
neutral	it does everything i need it to and it doesnt need to keep changing to be like other_websites !
neutral	it was betetr when it was a little_bit more simple .
neutral	the simplicity was what separated it and made it stand_out from the other social_network websites !
neutral	we were really happy with the products we bought ( a set of skis with bindings and a snowboard ) although we have not tried them out yet !
neutral	i got a bit_confused with the questions they asked about the binding settings and am still not sure_whether they have been set_up for me or not but i guess it '_s best to take them to an expert to check out anyway !
neutral	the only real disappointment was the way they were packed up for delivery .
neutral	they arrived in two_separate boxes - one with the skis in and one with the board , but there was no protection other than the box itself ....
neutral	the bindings had ripped through the cardboard and there was a nick in the snowboard which isn_'_t ideal ....
neutral	it wouldn_'_t have taken much to either secure them in the boxes to stop them moving round or to add in some bubble_wrap to protect them in transit ....
neutral	placing the order was easy !
neutral	getting told it has_been dispatched a dream , getting the delivery to madeira portugal !!!
neutral	0_days and still_waiting
neutral	service was quick .
neutral	unfortunately the boots were too_big for me so decided to swap them for another pair ( from easy wellies ), this cost me a further £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	could understand this cost if i was just returning the boots but ended_up buying a more_expensive pair anyway .
neutral	would probably think_twice about buying from you again because of this .
neutral	i have never had a moment '_s problem with my o0 phone !
neutral	mine is a simple one as i only want it for making and receiving phone_calls and texts .
neutral	being an only child , and having lived on my own at certain times of my life , i appreciate having knowing that i can now be connected easily to everyone else .
neutral	at the same time , i don_'_t get too many cold calls and have never had a real nuisance call .
neutral	then there are the frequent competitions , which are fun , the prizes often being free calls - which are always welcome .
neutral	the service from eflorist was extremely fast and easy , however i believe more care should be taken into the florists selected for completing the job as the bouquet was relatively_small and plain for the price paid compared with flowers i have purchased directly from florists myself .
neutral	they were very simple but fully closed so they may last long but it was pretty_much 0 lilly '_s and 0 roses with a few leaves for £_00 pounds plus £ 0 delivery .
neutral	also there customer service line claims to close at 0pm but by 0 . 00pm after being on hold for 00_minutes it was cut_off and they said they were closed .
neutral	the flowers were ordered at 0 . 00 am and we ' re not recieved until 0 . 00_pm .
neutral	the star_rating above seems to be more focussed on the personal contact aspect of doing_business with ss , rather_than the overall quality of the products , web based shopping_experience or paper based catalogue advertisements .
neutral	when dealing_with ss people over the telephone , my experience has_been good ; although the specific ingredient information i wanted at the time was not clearly given to me .
neutral	the paper based ss catalogue is awful , too busy , too much splash and big letters , too many products that appear to be similar and not enough explanation about product content or why some are different in strength etc_.,
neutral	i contacted ss to ask about what 0kci meant or was , they said it was a unit of measurement , but could not explain further .
neutral	ss do not give full enough details about the acronyms ( epa , dha ) they use , or ingredient measurements used .
neutral	numerous products all look to have similar ingredients .
neutral	as a buyer i have difficulty in recognising which product might be right for my particular needs .
neutral	it begins to get too much and takes up too much time decding what i want and in the end i just close it down and put off purchasing .
neutral	hi , love the products , good prices , delivery service was brilliant , unfortunately have spoken to customer_services three_times to try to resolve problems of being unable to login to my account and place further orders .
neutral	still_unresolved by it , have now requested account to be closed .
neutral	would prefer if delivery time was shorter
neutral	i was initially impressed by the service i received by silver_shuttle - regular_updates_via_email and text , and a prompt , friendly and helpful driver to take me to the airport .
neutral	however my experience on my return to the uk was quite different - i was left waiting at the airport as the driver was half an_hour late to arrive , and once he had arrived he did not even apologise for the delay nor did he offer to help me to the car with my luggage .
neutral	the back seat of the car had food and drink stains on the seat , and the driver did not speak to me at all throughout the journey .
neutral	i was surprised and disappointed by this change in the level of service i received from silver_shuttle - it was not the welcome home i had hoped for after a long business trip !
neutral	order arrived in different batches which was fine_except most of the first delivery was left on the van and had to come separately after a phone_call to bbs .
neutral	shower_tray was faulty but as it couldn_'_t be inspected until the plumber came to fit it - builders in house and couldn_'_t leave a shower_tray unwrapped and unprotected there was nothing i could do about it - 0 day policy
neutral	didn_'_t receive the voucher_code deduction at checkout and the free gifts specified didn_'_t arrive !
neutral	however , the items i ordered were received by me the next_day .
neutral	i do wish simply_supplements would specify the size of their products though .
neutral	i have ms and as a result i have problems with swallowing .
neutral	the size of the information print is ridiculously small and the products really should come with a leaflet in my opinion .
neutral	we ordered save the date magnets from bride and groom_direct with the promise they would be shipped within 0 to 0_days of the order .
neutral	after two_weeks with no news i rang to chase them up and was told the carrier cards were out of stock .
neutral	i was annoyed that we hadn_'_t had a simple email or phone_call to explain the delay .
neutral	when they did eventually arrive a month later than promised , they were lovely cards .
neutral	we may use them again as the products were so good but we will be ordering a long time in_advance !
neutral	i chose to send a planted rose .
neutral	this was eventually unavailable .
neutral	the alternative was ok but certainly not worth the £_00 + it cost - more like £_00 .
neutral	i would be unlikely to use this company again .
neutral	i would have chosen something between two and three stars - it was not acceptable but not actually bad .
neutral	aaaaaaaaaaaa
neutral	dissapointing result , sorry .
neutral	the order arrived swiftly and enclosed a wonderful thoughtful addition of a chocolate .
neutral	unfortunately it turned_out to be unsuitable .
neutral	i ordered some small batteries for a led lamp i use with a magnifying_glass for close sewing work .
neutral	these were recommended as a suitable_alternative , slightly_different number from the one on the battery itself and had the advantage of being a strip of 00 , when i need 0 and have two such magnifiers .
neutral	unfortunately they don_'_t fit or do the job they ' re needed to do and i will have to attempt to send them back and order the right ones which come in packs of 0 when i need 0 .
neutral	good value for phone , beware though as said screen was cracked and reduced price .
neutral	no crack in phone when i sent in a jiffy padded_envelope .
neutral	did not receive emails went to spam
neutral	i have had a few good deals including non surgical face lift and a spray_tan ..
neutral	the spray_tan was a particularly good deal , recently tho i ordered a mini cam corder and it failed to arrive .
neutral	got an e . mail saying it was on its way , still didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	sent company am e . mail and i have now received it ...
neutral	paid £ 0 . 00 delivery weeks_ago ...
neutral	don_'_t know if wowcher vet their suppliers but delivery on this item was real slow
neutral	great value and really easy website but , the delivery time was double the time stated on the website .
neutral	i will use again but make_sure i order well in_advance of a special_occasion
neutral	delivery was made however , item was signed for by a neighbour but no card was left to inform the recipient that it had been delivered to another address .
neutral	this has meant that i was informed that it had not been delivered and could have caused me to have incorrect feedback .
neutral	there was also no one available to contact on a saturday with this problem .
neutral	fortunately the neighbour turned_up with the parcel 00_hours_later .
neutral	otherwise it wold have been fine .
neutral	really impressed with the customer service and the design and layout of the plan .
neutral	i was disappointed to receive a bent table plan with the covering all bumpy .
neutral	in addition the top table name was incorrectly spelt on the plan but was correct on the table cards .
neutral	lovely looking flowers and great customer service but disappointing small bouquet for the price .
neutral	ofl could well do with a more flexible approach to deliveries , later in the evenings , early mornings and especially weekends .
neutral	however they sort of make up for it with a lot of contact with emails and texts_letting_me when delivery was due .
neutral	not that i would have been any more able to be there but luckily have a friend who works form home and was able to be there for me .
neutral	not everyone could be that lucky though .
neutral	their lack of flexibility to deliveries made me seriously_consider purchasing from them and forced me to look else where and had it not been for the friend being_able to help me out i would have most certainly gone else where .
neutral	all that said , the furniture arrived and once i had unpacked it myself it is lovely and well made
neutral	the wedding_invitations were excellent when they arrived .
neutral	they were despatched when the company had said they would be when i ordered but i didn_'_t receive them for another week .
neutral	they should have been delivered on friday 00th_june by my yodel tracking said they had tried but no card was left at our house .
neutral	had to ring the company who gave_me the driver '_s number rang him explained where i lived as i thought he must have gone to the wrong place before .
neutral	said he would deliver following_day at about 0 . 00am no delivery until_0pm .
neutral	he rang to find directions which i had given to him the day before .
neutral	not at all impressed with myyodel .
neutral	bride and groom themselves i have no complaint with .
neutral	it was very easy to order the flowers and look at what the bunch should look like when it arrived .
neutral	i liked the text_message updates about the delivery progress .
neutral	however , i was very disappointed when i saw the flowers the day after they were delivered to see several of them wilting already .
neutral	upsetting as it was sent as a special thank_you .
neutral	i '_ve_used ebay for several_years .
neutral	around half of the items i have trouble with , several never came and paypal were a pain to get the money back .
neutral	too risky on the whole to use .
neutral	although i like the offer and pictures of the b_& b '_s , i find it hard that you can '_t see whether there is a vacation or not .
neutral	you have to contact every b_& b in order to know if they can house you .
neutral	flght was cheap and on time , hense the 0_stars !
neutral	but to be on time the landing had to be done into a strong headwind , ive never been so scared in my life .
neutral	but i guess that is what it is , no thrills get from a to b !
neutral	flowers for my mothers_00th_birthday arrived on time , but were badly_damaged .
neutral	he box they arrived in was wet and crushed and the bird of paradise flower_arrangement badly_damaged .
neutral	customer service requested a photo but were able to waive this requirement when i explained that at 00 years old and 000_miles_away this wasnt possible .
neutral	a new arrangement was then delivered on the requested date and the flowers were beautiful .
neutral	this is not the first time i have used serenata and is the first time i have had any_problems .
neutral	i will use them again because of the excellent service .
neutral	well , good items , shopped few_times .... good shopping_experience .... worth a try .
neutral	product as decsribed but ordered on line as i didn_'_t have time to go to the shops .
neutral	went to the shops twice before package arrived !
neutral	had one lot of tablets and received them , only by luck as it seems now !
neutral	the second time of ordering i have been waiting since the 00th_dec .
neutral	the courier service has tried to deliver them twice_now and unfortunately i wasn_'_t in the first time - i did phone after the first time , to hermes the courier service , but could only leave a message_advising them of the best time to deliver .
neutral	i don_'_t think the message was heard as they tried to deliver again when no one was at home - i rang a second time , stating when there would be somebody in to receive them .
neutral	this again hasn_'_t been picked_up as two_days went by when there was opportunity for them to deliver and for someone to be in .
neutral	i will now be ringing to get my money back for goods that i haven_'_t received .
neutral	think the website and ordering are fine it '_s just the delivery service that isn_'_t good . very
neutral	delivery was great however , flowers received could have been a better arrangement considering it was a small gift bag - disappointed !
neutral	delivery was very quick however taps were not exactly as picture which was a bit_disappointing .
neutral	can '_t comment on how it works as it hasn_'_t been put in yet .
neutral	i had a groupon deal for a two week pack so ordered the only pack i could see on exante website to find out i was also charged_£_00 by exante aswell as the groupon deal .
neutral	when i called customer_services i was told i had ordered the wrong two week pack .
neutral	it is not clearly_stated on there website that they have other options and was told i had to type in to the search to find the groupon deal .
neutral	i was told i could return the pack and they would send me the groupon deal but i would have to pay for postage to return which a was minimum £_00 .
neutral	be careful you order the right deal .
neutral	thank_you for providing a good quality package including all what i asked for .
neutral	unfortunately the 00 promised days to come to me were finnally more than 0_weeks .
neutral	fortuantely i was not in a hurry to acquire these otc medicines , however i am not sure to ask you any request in case i need them with more urgency .
neutral	thank_you for your kind attention
neutral	i was really impressed with the colour , especially because i have dark eyes .
neutral	however the contact_lens didn_'_t sit on my eye just right and so i would have a kind of fuzzy halo around my vision where the colour started .
neutral	it probably obstructed by vision by 00_%, a shame because i would have loved to wear them for every day but it probably isn_'_t safe when driving .
neutral	ordering the flowers was very easy , and the florist contacted me directly to check on delivery details .
neutral	they were delivered on the same day , and i was impressed with the turnaround .
neutral	however , when i was sent a picture of the flowers by the recipient , i was quite disappointed .
neutral	i '_d paid for a large bouquet , but it looked decidedly small , and not arranged to the standard displayed on the website .
neutral	they didn_'_t have the visual impact i was hoping for , and for that reason i probably_wouldn_'_t use the service again .
neutral	good but a bit more expinsive than go direct sometims ...
neutral	had problems with the website did not get to order all the items as the website wasn_'_t working_properly .
neutral	the goods did order were delivered on time and were of good quality .
neutral	i did get a apology and a good will gesture from the company .
neutral	will attempt to use the website again .
neutral	thought the deliver took slightly too long .
neutral	villa rudi , cala_d ' or
neutral	on a plus note the outside of the villa was beautiful and well_maintained , and the views were lovely .
neutral	and the resort was stunning and clean .
neutral	unfortunately when first entering our villa our opinion was of disappointment .
neutral	there was a very unpleasant musty smell .
neutral	we appreciate that the humid heat does not help .
neutral	but surely you should be used to this and deal with nasty odours ’ accordingly .
neutral	the inside of cupboards , wardrobes and drawers all had the horrid smell , so had to be left open for days .
neutral	i '_m_sure many of them are not used and left empty , in this case they should still be cleaned and dusted inside regularly to avoid nasty odours .
neutral	the whole villa desperately_needed updating , especially the bathrooms .
neutral	they felt grubby and dated , especially the stained shower curtains and the thick dust on top of the mirrors .
neutral	shower curtains can be replaced for an extremely low_cost , and the fact that they had not been replaced for the season just goes to show how little you think of the comfort of your clients .
neutral	the dishwasher was diabolical , it run for approximately 0 and half hours and the dishes were still not properly clean .
neutral	it was in a bad state of disrepair and needs to be changed .
neutral	the tap in the utility_room needs changing , it fell_off on use , and i got drenched !
neutral	the sofas were very grubby , we could not sit on them without towels .
neutral	again they need replacing .
neutral	our rep . sally was efficient but i found her unfriendly and uptight .
neutral	most reps . are usually cheery and friendly .
neutral	she spoke very rapidly and seemed as if she just couldn ’_t wait to deal with us and move on .
neutral	it just made us feel very undervalued as clients of yours .
neutral	maybe she was just having a bad day !
neutral	also , you need to make it clear that we are supposed to pay extra and book our own seats for the flights .
neutral	my husband and i are very used to doing this , being frequent travellers .
neutral	we did think about doing it but there was no obvious link ?
neutral	so we assumed that villa_plus had carried_out this task .
neutral	arriving very early at luton , after little sleep and being told that our 0 year_old had to sit on his own with strangers , was not a good
neutral	start to our family holiday .
neutral	a hire_car was arranged through avis , we only had around 0 people in the queue in front on us but the wait was still well over an_hour .
neutral	we arrived on the 00th_july but the queues were much longer the following saturday when we dropped the car off .
neutral	friends of ours have stayed in your villas and been happy , but obviously for some reason you do not have the same standards in all your villas ?
neutral	we came away feeling sorry for the next family who had to endure the inside of this villa .
neutral	my husband and i are desperately_trying to put it down as a bad_experience , and are trying to just forget about the villa .
neutral	easily_navigated website but delivery was later than_expected .
neutral	i had a good experience with trophy_store .
neutral	their service was fast and reliable .
neutral	the trophys are good for the price i paid , however , the engraving shields were not fixed properly to the wooden sheild so i had to hammer the nails in more so that they were secure .
neutral	apart_from that , they are fab .
neutral	having read the reviews about cleverboxes quality of service we were very disappointed with the service we received .
neutral	we placed our order but never received an acknowledement email to say it had been received .
neutral	no correspondence to say when goods would be dispatched or they had been dispatched .
neutral	to get any information had i to go into my account and that wasn_'_t update therefore we had to ring customer_services to find out about our order and they in turn had to speak to the supplier of the computer to find out what was happening to our order .
neutral	i appreciate that we placed our order over the christmas_period and delivery times would differ but all one needed was to be kept inform .
neutral	well when i first started out with jpj it was great - really geared up to make a good experience for those having a go .
neutral	unfortunately as time went on the opportunity to win the occasional good prize reduced and so , when i started i would occasionally get all the wilds and now it is impossible - not happened for more than three years .
neutral	i can only_assume that jpj have reduced the chances of a good prize so the more games offered and the more members joining the less likely you are to win .
neutral	it '_s easy to get hooked and easier to lose a lot of money but if you only play with what you can_afford to lose its good fun but don_'_t expect too much .
neutral	good costume but on blowing up the face first time , it deflated ..... so now trying to find hole !!
neutral	!
neutral	i usually buy my train_tickets from first great western , but i switched to loco0 this time because i wanted to buy a civ ticket to ' london international ' to connect with my eurostar journey and protect me from any cancellations / delays affecting my onward jouney .
neutral	however , i thought it was a shame that i had to pay £_00 return for my ticket , when i was under the impression that advance tickets that are also civ are available sometimes ... but not from your website ?
neutral	cant_fault the jacket or taunton_leisure but not happy that it was left on my back doorstep especially when the gate is locked .
neutral	good job the alsation was not in the garden !!
neutral	not even a note pushed through the door to say it had been left there .
neutral	great product - delivery was disappointing .
neutral	although you emailed me last thursday during the day my book still didn_'_t come until tuesday which even for second class is frustrating .
neutral	it was a gift for friends in australia and it will be late for a 00th_birthday .
neutral	i used the old jessops quite a lot and that was speedier somehow .
neutral	the delivery came on time , there was a crack on bosch drawer .
neutral	not suited to lenses bought , can '_t return as packet is opened .
neutral	should have stuck with the high_street .
neutral	love my fit_flops
neutral	firstly , i purchased my air - walker directly from the physio_room - it was reduced to £_00 . 00 plus £ 0 postage , so i ordered it thinking i was saving myself a few_quid .
neutral	later i checked on amazon and i was annoyed to see it listed for £_00 . 00 and free delivery !
neutral	now on amazon its back up to £_00 . 00 but still has free delivery , so if you are seriously wanting to buy this boot , check amazon first .
neutral	the boot arrived 0_days from placing my order ( i chose 0 day tracking mail ) but obviously the first day you place your order is not counted .
neutral	first_impressions were good , very sturdy_construction , but the velcro_straps are almost 0 ," wide and it was almost_impossible for me to pull the velcro_straps apart , and that was before i had the boot on .
neutral	no instructions came with the boot although it looks simple enough .
neutral	however , the velcro metal supports as each side of the boot , scratched my skin as the ends were exposed over the top of the sock .
neutral	having broken a 0th metatarsal my foot was very sore and swollen and i found it very difficult to get my foot exactly in the correct position .
neutral	it was only after 00 days that i discovered the actual inner of the boot ( sock ) could be detatched from its cradle .
neutral	it appeared that my sock was positioned incorrectly so my heel wasnt getting right down on to the sole of the boot , the two metal velcro covered supports grip the sock with such strength that it won_'_t budge unless you separate sock and cradle .
neutral	once i discovered this it made all the difference .
neutral	i was able to adjust the sides of the sock so the scratchy velcro bits at the top were not exposed to my skin .
neutral	i also found that the second strap on the leg comes off ( if you want it to - not recommended ).
neutral	i should say that the hospital put my boot on for me replacing a hard cast which i said i no_longer wanted to wear ., but i wasnt allowed to weight bear .
neutral	going back to the velcro_straps , they are very very difficult to manage .
neutral	i ended_up cutting and tapering the ends of each strap to make it easier for me to grip the end so i could pull the velcro apart to take the boot off .
neutral	0_weeks on and i '_m now allowed to weight bear .
neutral	the boot offers excellent support and cushioning to my foot allowing me to start walking again .
neutral	i think physio_room should put instructions in with the boot explaining its construction .
neutral	the straps need either to be thinner , or have some sort of end on that makes for easier gripping .
neutral	i would recommend this boot to others and would purchase physio_room products again , however , i will be checking amazon first !
neutral	good enough but when the tracking service from royal_mail said it was delivered and it had not arrived i got in touch with physioroom by telephone .
neutral	the person whom i spoke just said it showed up as delivered and suggested i contacted royal_mail .
neutral	i said this was his responsibility and he agreed to check it out for me .
neutral	he phoned back saying royal_mail still said it was delivered .
neutral	i knew it wasn_'_t as i had stayed in all day for the delivery .
neutral	it was delivered to a neighbour and put through their letterbox by mistake .
neutral	i did not feel physioroom was helpful .
neutral	ordered 00 pygmy bulbs but was sent two different brands - they are not identical shape or colour and yet they all go onto a large 00 bulb light_fitting ...
neutral	so whilst product was good and sent quickly i wanted one matching brand of bulb only .
neutral	i was disappointed when my acrylic picture arrived as it has a black particle embedded in the acrylic in a portion of the sky which is instantly obvious - i will not be displaying it .
neutral	i think the problem should have been picked_up at quality control before sending it out .
neutral	however i was very pleased with the quality of the calendar and would consider purchasing again .
neutral	bought many bits and bobs from here to go with my mini .
neutral	whilst happy with things that work , i have had many bits that only work for a week or so , and can only put down to cheap chinese labour , and the 0 day return_policy is rubbish cos if you buy a box of cartomizors and only 0 out of 0 work , you are stuffed .
neutral	i have bought spare batteries that have lasted 0 - 0_weeks and a box of cartomizers that had 0 out of 0 that worked , but cos of the returns_policy , have no comeback .
neutral	i am def having a moan .
neutral	i like your product when it works and would prefer to buy all the time , and sadly i do , cos i don_'_t have time to research other of same .... but i am pretty fed_up that half of what i purchase from you only lasts a couple of weeks .
neutral	oh_yes ... i forgot about my usb_charger !
neutral	cos it stopped_working about a month after i bought it .
neutral	i used that at work only , so it was not a constant use thing .
neutral	i had to buy a new mains charger when i got fed_up with trying to have a permanently charged battery at work and home .
neutral	please either sort_out your quality or sort_out your guarantee to enable people like me the right to goods that they buy , matching their expectations or the right to return faulty goods as they come_across them .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	hi
neutral	please could you let_me know where my policy is i thought it would have come through the post by now .
neutral	mrs heather kay
neutral	first issue : if i want to change the quantity , i have to start all over again , making a new order .
neutral	second issue : i would like an_email_confirmation that my order has_gone_through .
neutral	many_thanks !
neutral	i ordered a pair of gucci_sunglasses for about £_000 , but happily found a 00_%_off voucher .
neutral	due to them over_£_00 , they should have been delivered next_day .
neutral	a few_days passed ( i was lenient considering the christmas post , but no glasses .
neutral	i phoned sunglasses_shop to check they had not been lost .
neutral	the customer service person told me that they were showing as out of stock , but it was an_error they were in stock .
neutral	it was frustrating as is been expecting then to be delivered and at no point did anyone contact me saying there would be a delay .
neutral	so they said they would post immediately for delivery the next_day .
neutral	however i was going on holiday at 0am the next_day and arranged for them to be delivered the day after i got back , and guaranteed delivery by royal_mail before 0pm .
neutral	sorted .... or so i thought .
neutral	when i got back from holiday , i was excited_about my delivery , and at about 00 . 00am thought i would just check they were on their way as no dispatch email had been received .
neutral	they hadn_'_t been dispatched !!!!
neutral	ahhhhhh .
neutral	i was reassured again they would be delivered before 0pm the following_day by royal_mail .
neutral	i also had an_email from the customer service guy confirming it .
neutral	the next_morning came ...... starting work late as waiting at home for glasses .
neutral	the tracking email cane through ...... from ups .
neutral	not royal_mail and not guaranteed by 0pm .
neutral	phoned again , the manager was very apologetic and refunded my 00_% of what i '_d paid .
neutral	but all in all an awful customer experience from sunglasses_shop .
neutral	only good thing is when the sunglasses eventually turned_up , i loved them .
neutral	would think_twice before using sunglasses_shop again .
neutral	i went in to the jessops store on manchester to look at examples of the different albums to help me decide on what size to get , what type of cover and to get design ideas .
neutral	there are so many different options and it '_s hard to judge from the website .
neutral	the assistant was helpful , but didn_'_t have any samples to show me but said he had kept asking for them .
neutral	you should provide your stores with samples otherwise i might as well go to smile box .
neutral	arrived promptly .
neutral	would have liked a different cover but couldn_'_t work out how to change it once started , and help section not clear
neutral	i had a poor customer experience in the covent_garden shop and was unable to try on the range of sizes i needed .
neutral	i then ordered the size i wanted to try on line and it came quickly , but was no good .
neutral	i then had to pay £_00 plus to return it properly tracked .
neutral	the booking was okay i guess , despite_being promised £_00 off if i booked before a certain_date and then never materialising once booked !
neutral	the activities ( its a knockout ) and the nightclub were okay other than the fact we were strictly informed to be at club before 00pm for the guestlist entry and vip ( as paid for ), so we left the restaurant / bar in a rush to ensure we got there in time .
neutral	we got there at about 0 . 00pm only to be find no queue and the club not opening until 00pm , so we hung around like a load of desparados !
neutral	eventually we went in , didnt even ask for party name , as they werent expecting us , i enquired_about booking a table as i noticed some had been reserved , to which the manager explained that she didn_'_t know what had been promised by hen_heaven , but it was extra for a table reservation and she didn_'_t have any available , so instead gave_us a wristband each for an exclusive part of the club - whcih she , didn_'_t have to do .
neutral	we sorted_out surfing as an extra activity external to hen_heaven and glad i did , as it was only the activity organisers that seemed to do anything right !
neutral	very much doubt i would hen_heaven again , would rather source activities myself without the expensive overheads that hen_heaven do
neutral	sizing info could have product measurements .
neutral	they offer extra discounts but don_'_t tell you when they expire .
neutral	i got an_email_informing_me of an extra 00_%_discount , when i tried to use it it doesn_'_t exist !
neutral	with respect to order delivery they are the best i '_ve come_across , but i haven_'_t yet sent anything back .
neutral	i am pleased with my battery_operated tea lights but they do flicker much_quicker_than i would have liked .
neutral	was hoping to order some more but wouldn_'_t as the flickering could drive you mad .
neutral	it '_s a shame that the actual dreams stores are unable to provide goods at a better price and shorter time frame - i visited a store and the assistant was so helpful , but could do little about the delivery charge and nothing about the waiting time for delivery .
neutral	i was able to get the product online for less money and much sooner .
neutral	good for me but it felt wrong .
neutral	do they want their stores to close ?
neutral	ordered a 00kg_bag of dog_food and some dog_biscuits .
neutral	the order took longer_than i expected to arrive .
neutral	when it did arrive the dog_biscuits were broken and the bag of dog_food had been opened and resealed with tape and the food scoop was missing out of the bag .
neutral	i am not impressed with the overall experience really .
neutral	doubt if i '_ll use pet_supermarket again .
neutral	i have ordered these glue boards for my electric insect killer .
neutral	they are ridiculously_expensive for what they are and then another £ 0 is banged on for postage !
neutral	there is no weight it them at all .
neutral	necessary or my gadget is redundant .
neutral	but overpriced , and the high postage is hugely un - necessary .
neutral	my first order with inkstation was a dream not only were the prices the best i '_d seen but what really sold me was the express delivery as i live in remote australia i got my first order within 0 - 0_days .
neutral	alas i only got the express delivery on my first purchase and now comes snail_mail .
neutral	i still buy from inkstation as the prices are so good but a bit dissapointed that now i have to wait 0 to 0_weeks for delivery .
neutral	i ordered a beautiful bunch of flowers for my best friends birthday and paid_extra for them to be bigger .
neutral	what she got was a little bunch that looked nothing like the picture .
neutral	they were still nice but not what i '_d wanted !
neutral	because i was not in and depite saying leave in the porch if not in .
neutral	a card was left and i had to phone the courier they said they were not alloowed to redeliver the next_day .
neutral	so i had to drive twenty miles to the depot to collect it .
neutral	this was very inconvenient when i had expected it to be delivered .
neutral	good range of cat toys on site at competitive_prices .
neutral	one product i purchased did not arrive in a good state and not as advertised on the site , so i had a refund .
neutral	you need to check at times that you will be getting the exact product as pictured as some ranges vary i . e .
neutral	design of animal toy etc .
neutral	overall , good service .
neutral	quality is not always quantity .
neutral	a bargain is only one where the product stands up to it '_s promise , which is lacking in my opinion quite_often
neutral	usually the quality is excellent , though not always the best priced one !
neutral	prompt delivery is great but one of the products received was broken
neutral	ordered a garden badminton net and the parcel duly_arrived next_day .
neutral	however it was badly packed , no return_label and the goods were incorrect .
neutral	phoned tennis_nuts who tried to persuade me the tennis net they sent would extend to a badminton net - it was not even the ordered make .
neutral	correct parcel delivered quite quickly after 0 phone_calls but again was so badly parcelled that the delivery company waited to make_sure the goods were intact .
neutral	not a very good experience really !
neutral	i am delighted with my new door ( solidor ).
neutral	it looks fabulous , and is very ' functional '.
neutral	it was installed at the end of last_year and along with my new brick built porch , the door improved the cosiness of my home over the winter .
neutral	i have no reservation in recommending the door , however ...
neutral	within a month of installation , i had an issue with a fault lock chamber , which no - one could be blamed for , but resulted_in me being locked out of my home at 00 . 00 in the morning on a freezing_cold day , with the key jammed in the lock .
neutral	i had no option but to call a lock smith to drill the lock and replace it .
neutral	this went_smoothly until having re - accessed my home , i contacted timber composite doors for a refund .
neutral	i was told that i should have contacted them before ringing for a lock smith .
neutral	they could not and would not understand that i had no way of contacting them as i didn_'_t remember their company name and strangely_enough , i don_'_t carry around all of the paperwork associated with work on my property .
neutral	they and the manufacturer refused to refund my costs , until i personally delivered the faulty chamber to the door manufacturer .
neutral	i eventually received a refund on the cost of the locksmith , but would advise anyone buying a door through this company to make a note of their name and phone number , so that if the lock fails within a month of installation , you can contact them , for them to arrange a locksmith , as getting compensation is a long and arduous_task .
neutral	on a positive_note ...
neutral	i am still delighted with my new front_door !
neutral	:-)
neutral	the manager of the shop i didnt think he was very friendly .
neutral	i would have thought that the large_amount of cardboard which my purchase came in would have been taken_away by the van_drivers like other shops do .
neutral	mix_up with payment when ordering did not linkmy papaypal payment .
neutral	arrived when they were meant to
neutral	the hamper arrived beautifully_boxed but the granite slab was unprotected in the hamper and arrived broken .
neutral	i found contacting the help_desk very difficult and confusing .
neutral	the help_desk needs to tell customers when an entry has_been updated .
neutral	it seems odd to get an_email to confirm that i have just signed for delivery , but issues reported to the help_desk do not create progress emails .
neutral	the problem has now been resolved to our satisfaction
neutral	i thought the site was really good with superb discounts and the delivery service was great as it was quick and i was kept up to date with when it was coming , however when the delivery arrived there was a lot of broken tiles and chipped , i ordered more than i needed so had enough to tile but a lot of waste .
neutral	without going into too much detail i had a pretty bad_experience with an individual who worked at this company , however , the owner who is a very understanding and pleasant lady got in touch with me and put things right thankfully .
neutral	i probably_won_'_t use them again but i am very grateful for her apology and goodwill in putting it right again and hope their business is not damaged as a result .
neutral	good size and manufacture but the wheels make a terrible noise when being pulled along a pavement
neutral	ideal for a wheelchair_user or disabled_person .
neutral	a huge villa , great swimming_pool and gardens .
neutral	photos on link are probably old as villa is in need of decorating in bathrooms .
neutral	basic kitchen_utensils more are needed .
neutral	the sky only shows spanish tv no british channels work .
neutral	we had to thoroughly clean the kitchen on arrival as it poorly cleaned and the maid service was poor , they only made the beds nothing else .
neutral	the bathrooms and kitchen were ant infested each morning so be prepared .
neutral	we had an issue with the villa and the rep in spain was not very helpful yet bob who works at villa_plus in britain was extremely_helpful throughout .
neutral	we would stay here again as it '_s the only villa with wheelchair access which we need .
neutral	the day after i made my order i received an_email to say my items were out of stock .
neutral	i contacted them to reorder but was informed they were in stock and would be sent asap .
neutral	i haven_'_t had any confirmation they '_ve been despached so not sure how to review figleaves !
neutral	normally i find them quick and efficient .
neutral	0 times out of 00 everything is fine , but every now and again they are very slow to despatch the goods and seem to need a reminder , leaving you not knowing whether or not you need to buy something in the shops to tide you over until it arrives
neutral	basically good service and good correspondence but i had to chase_up a refund for returned goods .
neutral	this is a very easy and friendly site to use with plenty of confirmation emails along the way so you know how your order is proceeding .
neutral	sadly the flowers i ordered ( roses and stocks ) were not great .
neutral	the roses were fine but the stocks were damaged and dying on arrival .
neutral	firstly my name is alison as you would know if you had checked that i am the bill payer and the name you keep calling me is in fact the person to whom the article should have been delivered .
neutral	paid for delivery on a tuesday , finally delivered on the friday after an e_mail and a phone_call .
neutral	still_waiting for confirmation for repayment of delivery charge .
neutral	call_centre staff helpful but would have been much_better if you could provide direct access so you can talk to same person twice .
neutral	not impressed physio_room and if saw a product on your website would shop around before bought from you again
neutral	i bought one hamper from serenta and one from virginia hayward , both similar price with similar contents .
neutral	unfortunately i was less_than impressed with the presentation of the serenta trio of ales ' hamper '.
neutral	it was less hamper more just shredded_paper in a box , especially when compared with the wicker_basket and tissue_paper that the virginia hayward contents were presented in .
neutral	found a very competitive price and the site was easy to use .
neutral	unfortunately the drop_off address was wrong . it changed in june_0000 .
neutral	was also unhappy that vat was added to sms notification and insurance without warning .
neutral	my dog_food was delivered on the very last day of the specified time .
neutral	i have asked customer service twice - do not forget to place my phone number over the package , please !
neutral	result - ignore !
neutral	you keep posting package with home delivery without placing my phone number over the package .
neutral	as a result - local delivery service arrives in the middle of working day , when no one is at home .
neutral	first time they have send a package back to chemistdirect , marking it as undeliverable !
neutral	second time - luckily i was at home and was able to receive the package .
neutral	otherwise the story would repeat .
neutral	please always place customer phone number over the package if that is home delivery !!
neutral	!
neutral	only problem is with the buckles as they keep slipping so tops are loose ....
neutral	several_times initially we had to call the repair man out as the stitching was coming away .
neutral	the sofas are now less_than 00 months old and already showing poor signs of wear .
neutral	had a delivery just before christmas 0 items missing , got a refund and a voucher for a free delivery in the future .
neutral	would have been nicer to have my delivery cost refunded as i had to go out to get missing items , havng a delivery is to avoid going out so delivery was a waste of time
neutral	easyjet ... cheap flights ... you get what you pay for ... small seats , & fast turn_around ... if money is tight then you can '_t beat them , if you want comfort then this isn_'_t the airline for you ... they do " what it says on the tin ", nothing more ... having said that crew were bright & chirpy , & helpful .
neutral	bugbear : i wish all families with babies were put in the same area of the plane , so those of us without children don_'_t have to endure ( bit_harsh ' endure ' but can '_t think of another word ) ' surround sound ' baby crying ...
neutral	acceptable experience , but not desired quality ....
neutral	i would use again if i knew what happened to refund
neutral	great for keeping in touch and finding old friends but the changes without my choice are annoying , why cant the new styles just be a choice ?
neutral	plus each time i have to reset my privacy settings , they should just stay the same .
neutral	i thought that the products on the website were a unique collection and it was easy to find what you were looking for .
neutral	however there was a problem with the payment section of the website , which_meant that i could not complete my transaction .
neutral	when i phoned up about it on the saturday i was told to ring back again on monday as they had had the same problem the weekend before and the person i needed to speak to was not in until monday .
neutral	i found this really frustrating and not very convenient - not the best customer service !
neutral	other people less patient than me would have probably given up on the sale !
neutral	the lady i spoke to on the monday was friendly and apologetic and explained why i would have to complete the transaction over the phone , which was due to a problem with the website coding .
neutral	the goods were very quickly dispatched and were with me within 0_days of ordering .
neutral	i had given my office address for delivery my order was split in 0 and one parcel got sent to my office and the other to my home .
neutral	it was only by_chance that someone was at home that day otherwise i would have had to drive 00 miles to my nearest sorting_office to pick it up .
neutral	again matalan launch another 00_%_off all stock .
neutral	brilliant !
neutral	can buy all the grand_kids their holiday wear without paying next prices but still getting the same quality !
neutral	not so everything i ordered was out of stock even_though they had only just come on line .
neutral	why don_'_t they have more ?
neutral	ordered from debenhams event instead .
neutral	is it just happening to me ?
neutral	ordered a dress and had to return it as the sizes were on small side but loved the dress so went to reorder but completely sold out and if you look at many dresses on the website they too are sold out .
neutral	so it doesn_'_t matter_how good the product is if you can '_t get_hold of it .
neutral	now cinderella won_'_t go to the ball over christmas !
neutral	sent flowers to a friend as a congratulations for her new job , she was delighted as she was sent flowers .
neutral	however i wasn_'_t as impressed as i had hoped i would be as they didn_'_t look like the photo on the webpage .
neutral	they looked rather slim and a bit old to be honest .......
neutral	ordered two items a potty n clips .
neutral	the delivery driver was awful full bettled the door ( middle if afternoon + its main door , was no need ) near enough threw potty box at me .
neutral	asked him about clips n he saud don_'_t ask me that '_s all i got n this was half way up my path ano this is not important but it '_s all about service with a smile he clearly didn_'_t want to be on this job .
neutral	anyways contacted store , they were lovely asking if mayb the clips were inside the box , bt no such luck & they had ran_out of them n couldn_'_t replace them , so now i '_ve had to order new ( off a different site )
neutral	it would be useful if in the information the dimensions of the ' toy section ' of the pinata is included - not nose to tail .
neutral	i have used achica a number of times so they can '_t he that bad but having had numerous unfulfilled orders i won_'_t depend_on them so i '_d never buy birthday_presents from them .
neutral	they are also quite bad at communication .
neutral	everything is email and i have on more than one occasion had to chase them beyond their delivery deadline .
neutral	they have some interesting stuff but they could do an awful_lot better
neutral	fantastic tarriff - unlimited_texts , unlimited mins and upto 0gb internet download for £_00 ( not including_vat ) when the cheapest any other provider could do for that was £_00 .
neutral	black iphone 0 being delivered to my door in the snow at christmas was another thumbs_up .
neutral	now then , the downside ...
neutral	i was sent the wrong sim_card 0 times so couldn_'_t use the phone for 0_weeks !
neutral	anytime you phone the call_centre , the staff either don_'_t have a clue what they ' re talking_about ( i '_ve had to phone apple who '_ve re - directed me back to tesco on numerous occaisions as tesco staff say they can '_t deal with technical questions about iphones !)
neutral	they ' re also very patronising !
neutral	some would think the £_00 saving is worth it , some wouldn_'_t so that '_s just a personal_preference .
neutral	my order hadn_'_t been delivered , only part , so phoned them up to see where the rest was .
neutral	their phone lines are terrible .
neutral	i phoned twice in the morning yesterday , no one answered both_times .
neutral	i was waiting for about 0 mins each time and then there was a ring and an_automated_message_saying they were closed .
neutral	it was 00am .
neutral	finally got through in the afternoon .
neutral	was told there was a problem with the supplier .
neutral	i was only told today that there has_been a problem for 0_weeks .
neutral	makes me wonder_if i hadn_'_t have phoned , would anything have been said to me ?
neutral	i phoned today and had the same problem phoning , saying they were closed etc .
neutral	when i got through i explained again my problem , and i was offered a refund of the lead and the rest of the order sent out .
neutral	i don_'_t know why the rest of the order couldn_'_t have been sent anyway .
neutral	but oh well .
neutral	got there in the end .
neutral	it '_s a shame , because i '_m a bit_iffy about using their service now as their website doesn_'_t say if something is out of stock .
neutral	i only went with envirofone because i had read they pay you the same day as soon as the phone has_been checked over .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t go with them again simply because of this .
neutral	i had to wait a week for my payment after they got my phone .
neutral	i actually phoned when i had an_email_saying they had my phone .
neutral	i waited_until_0pm for the money but i asked them why i hadn_'_t had it .
neutral	i was told it isn_'_t same day and loads of people had also said the same thing i did to them .
neutral	so sort it out and make it clear to customers !
neutral	they '_ve got very repetitive promotions , normally in places that are not very known ... prices are ok but nothing exceptional .
neutral	you really have to look for it , to not miss a good promotion as there '_s only a real good deal once in a while .
neutral	the sales_person was brilliant .
neutral	he seemed surprised that we already knew_exactly_what we wanted and had done our homework already !
neutral	we had to do this as in the shop there are no leaflets with measurements on , they are all on the website , so if you want to make_sure your furniture fits , you have no choice but to use the website .
neutral	therefore we made the sales persons job very easy ..
neutral	i did have to remind him to put the free item on the order - twice !
neutral	good experience in the shop .
neutral	not too great with the after sales .
neutral	trying to tell me that they would be delivered after the final delivery date i was given , then all of a sudden they had a delivery slot the day before the one on my paper_work !
neutral	they even said that i hadn_'_t contacted them , when i had phoned them previously about the order .
neutral	the main delivery driver was brilliant , polite courteous , told me exactly_what would happen , asked where i wanted all of my items and was really great .
neutral	the second delivery person was an agency worker , he didn_'_t acknowledge me and was not listening to the other man who gave him full instructions on where they were going with the furniture and step up here etc .
neutral	the agency worker still managed to drop one of the glass cabinets .
neutral	i was not a happy_bunny .
neutral	he left the house rather quickly when that had happened .
neutral	i spoke to the main driver who was so apologetic and he wrote on the delivery slip that the other person had dropped the item .
neutral	he couldn_'_t have done his job any better .
neutral	luckily after unpacking the furniture , nothing was broken .
neutral	it didn_'_t make the experience great as it is expensive furniture and obviously i did not want broken furniture before i had even signed for it .
neutral	it became quite a stressful day .
neutral	trying to unpack the items is very difficult especially knowing that if it needed to be returned all of the packing would need to be reused .
neutral	it is not an easy task with the boxes and the fact that the items are so heavy to be able to take it apart for reuse .
neutral	as i had 0 huge items to unpack within 00_hours to check it was not easy due to all of the packaging and with the added factor that an item had been dropped , i really had to unpack everything very carefully incase it was needed for reuse to return .
neutral	after approximately 0 hours ( there were 0 huge boxes ) everything was unpacked and checked .
neutral	luckily there was no damage because of all of the packaging !
neutral	it also takes_forever to wax the items and it stinks whilst you are doing it .
neutral	it leaves a great finish though and they do look very nice .
neutral	the stick on feet protection are rubbish and if you put them on and then move the item , they come off straight way - we paid_extra for these and they are a waste of time ..
neutral	i am very happy with the furniture and the experience in the shop and the main delivery driver .
neutral	the after sales and agency worker , well that '_s another story !
neutral	great product and posting , shame they don_'_t bother emailing back .
neutral	liquids last and good value for money but the menthol are not as minty as i like .
neutral	taste quite chemically not a fan .
neutral	sent one email with pictures attached didnt get reply phoned and was told that the reason i had not had a reply was that they had been very busy i then sent another email and still didnt get a reply so i phoned them again a week_later still to be told that they have been busy i told them i needed a reply to my email i was told they would look into this next_day still no reply to my email phoned again and spoke to another person and they would look into it i finally got a response later that morning and purchased some runners that they thought would fit they arrived 0_days_later .
neutral	such a shame that i had to chase to get my email looked at twice and then the products were sent to me .
neutral	brilliant in store , knowledgeable but un - pushy .
neutral	even after going away for 0 hours we were remembered when we went back .
neutral	delivered on time , kept_updated on delivery progress , very polite , happy and friendly delivery men .. even removed their shoes !
neutral	however bed had minor noticeable damage .
neutral	i called the shop who apologised and put me through to customer_services ( cs ) and in turn technical_support ( ts ).
neutral	i received no apology from cs or ts for my faulty product or the inconvenience and no one asked if i was able to use the product in the meantime or if i had an_alternative .
neutral	i have to wait for technician to come but they can only give me a 0 hour time_slot .
neutral	i '_m in a job where i can '_t just take time off so now have had to arrange for someone to come round and deal with them .
neutral	i came off the phone after 00_mins of my time feeling i had inconvenienced them ... i hope they sort this to my satisfaction quickly so they can redeem_themselves .
neutral	very disappointed the item hasn_'_t arrived yet as it is a christmas_present and i am worried i won_'_t have time to exchange if not liked
neutral	reportedly lovely flowers delivered to my daughter in usa . disappointed i couldn_'_t use my £ 0 voucher as apparently on phoning iflorist it '_s not applicable to international orders .
neutral	like other people posting here , i '_m still_waiting for my 0d_tickets for edinburgh next week .
neutral	get me in sent me an_email last_week saying that the tickets would be posted out ' the tuesday after the bank_holiday ', but here we are on wednesday_evening , and still no notification email from them .
neutral	i '_ve sent them a query asking what '_s happening , but it says it takes 0 - 0 working_days to reply , which is a fat lot of good when the concert is on tuesday .
neutral	we live in the highlands , so there '_s no chance of a courier delivery at the weekend , which leaves very little time for the tickets to arrive .
neutral	given how long this concert has_been planned ( we bought our tickets in january ), why on earth do they leave it so late to send the tickets out ?
neutral	i can '_t bear the thought of telling my daughter we can '_t go ... booking_ref .
neutral	000000
neutral	update this is written after the concert , and i have upgraded my rating accordingly .
neutral	the tickets did arrive last friday ( so two working_days before the day of the concert ), which is still way too close for comfort , especially having been told that they were going to be despatched the previous tuesday .
neutral	but to give credit to get me in , they did respond to this post and sent me further emails_confirming exactly where the tickets were , and have since apologised for the delay .
neutral	the concert was amazing , my daughter was over the moon , but still could have done without the stress of worrying whether the tickets were going to arrive or not !
neutral	i was delighted to find my brush_set had been delivered so quickly to my house , they were presented well , safely_packaged and attractive to look at .
neutral	i did find them expensive as i am a student and its hard to keep adding to my kit at such a cost .
neutral	i used my brush_set for the first time , i realised the hairs come away from the brushes and the foundation_brush especially leaves an unattractive scratchy finish rather_than a smooth .
neutral	i was disappointed and felt although i has wasted a lot of money .
neutral	i was then told by other college class mates that they no_longer use the brushes recommended by the college .
neutral	i am feeling slightly let_down and irritated that ill need to add more brushes to my kit so soon as i feel several of the brushes just don_'_t have the finishing quality look i am looking for unfortunately .
neutral	i would love to give the brushes a second chance but i would rather bit risk leaving an unhappy client .
neutral	the above comment .
neutral	the one snag is one the odd_occasion the item as pictured / described does not quite live up to the standard expected regretfully .
neutral	acceptable but not quite as_described and shown in picture .
neutral	however one gets what one pays for i suppose .
neutral	( price_wise that is !)
neutral	it was a very easy on - line quote but i had a ' nil ' quote which when challenged they admit was incorrect and sent a re - quote .
neutral	plus they advise to send anything over_£_00 by special delivery which costs £ 0 , but then the re - quote can be less so you are out of pocket on the post .
neutral	other than that , they send you all the paperwork and the rest was easy
neutral	purchased a ' silver designer_radiator with mirror ' - it came an insipid dull grey , similar to an undercoat paint .
neutral	am returning this item at the cost of £_00 and have ordered the ' anthracite designer_radiator with mirror '......... hopefully this one will not disappoint .
neutral	or it will be a costly experience .
neutral	delivered on correct date .
neutral	most companies now offer time slots for deliveries , pity this is not the case .
neutral	waited from 0am until bed delivered at 0 . 00 .
neutral	disappointed that bed was left on ground_floor of my property .
neutral	don_'_t think this was made clear when ordering .
neutral	although not the fault of the company , two of the runners fell of the drawer of divan when replacing drawers ( drawers removed to make the divan lighter to carry upstairs )
neutral	unsure if i would order again with your company .
neutral	i found it a great easy to use site , however , it was very frustrating to keep being asked to phone a number , when you were trying to shop on the internet .
neutral	it sort of defeats the object !
neutral	then , was completely unable to pay with .
neutral	paypal .
neutral	i tried seven or eight times , even on different days , at which point my onlooker husband wanted to abandon it and go to another site .
neutral	finally , it went through .
neutral	i then got a text and an e_- mail from a lady saying that the order couldn_'_t be sent without a registration_number for the car .
neutral	i had filled that in on every attempt .
neutral	at the same time , i got an e_- mail checking i was happy with the transaction , to which i replied re : the e_- mail saying my orfder would not be posted until they had my reg no .
neutral	i sent the reg no four times to different requests .
neutral	the parcels arrived , and my husband is very pleased with the items , and has fitted them .
neutral	i think it is a pity that such a good , fast site is spoilt after checkout .
neutral	purchased tickets for depeche mode and received an_email the evening before to say tickets were duplicated and void .
neutral	also said i would get full_refund and a £_00 voucher , received email voucher but the email address was incorrect so could not use .
neutral	rebooked tickets and rang to confirm , a ) would get refund and b ) get emailed another voucher .
neutral	week_later and have not heard_anything ?
neutral	animed delayed my order due to the otodex cream being out of stock , they should have refunded me straight_away for this item so that the cimicat kitten milk i also ordered could have been sent straight_away , i had to contact them a week_later to find out why my order still had not arrived , it was only then that they refunded me and sent the milk .
neutral	we took 00 family_members of varying ages and found the villa to be spacious and well_equipped overall .
neutral	the pool was relatively new and well_maintained and the garden had 0 sun_loungers and 0 parasols .
neutral	dining was not an issue as we could all be seated in either the indoor dining_area or outside on the terrace although we did get invaded by the famous canary island flies when eating outside .
neutral	the bbq was old style fire lighters and charcoal but was just adequate for our group .
neutral	the bedrooms were spacious and benefitted from air_conditioning , all were either en_suite or next to a bathroom .
neutral	one criticism is that the villa is quite remote from the town and although a pleasant walk to town the return trip with pushchairs and shopping is a hard uphill walk which will not suit anyone with mobility_issues .
neutral	taxis are readily_available but work out quite_expensive if using them regularly .
neutral	the town area is small with a man made beach .
neutral	all the necessary amenities are there including bars , restaurants , butchers , bakery and a few shops .
neutral	there are also a number of supermarkets but their prices did reflect the touristic nature of the area .
neutral	in summary the villa provided a great base for a memorable family holiday but if i were to return i would hire a car as you need to be mobile to get the best out of the area .
neutral	my mother first used carpet_runners and was extremely impressed with them .
neutral	so i decided to use them too after such a glowing recommendation .
neutral	however , my experience was not the same .
neutral	i was sent an ' order dispatched ' email when in actual fact , this wasn_'_t the case - they were out of stock .
neutral	i ended_up having to chase the order when it didn_'_t arrive 0_days_later thinking that it had been delivered to the wrong_address .
neutral	then when it was dispatched , it was delivered to my billing_address and not the delivery address as i had instructed .
neutral	not impressed with the service and for the money i spent , i expect better .
neutral	shopping with shoetique was quick and easy .
neutral	even returns process was straight_forward .
neutral	however i did have to send back my lovely boots as one of the poppers came off after only wearing for 0 hours .
neutral	got exchange days_later and the same thing happened again so i am returning the second_pair but this time i will get a refund , shame as i liked the boots .
neutral	all went_according to plan , with excellent customer service keeping_me up to date via_text_messages .
neutral	the bouquet was very nice and as the photo on the website .
neutral	unfortunately all the rose_buds had drooped and were discolouring within 00_hours .
neutral	i received a good service but no invoice was included . in my parcel when it arrived ,
neutral	i had no_problems at all with the order and the delivery was quick .
neutral	however , despite choosing to get polished edges they were not very well finished and were still sharp enough to cut hands .
neutral	i had to smooth myself when installing to make them safe .
neutral	i '_ve booked several_times with alpharooms and my only_complaint is with the the shuttlebus service .
neutral	just come_back from benidorm booking with alpharooms .
neutral	landed at 00 . 00 , got cases , 00 . 00 booked in with alpharooms for transfer and arrived at our hotel 0 . 00am , now i think this is unacceptable for what should be a 00_min journey .
neutral	the same thing happended back in may .
neutral	went to benidorm again with alpharooms , booked transfers again , it wasn_'_t too bad on arrival , but our home journey , we were on the coach just over an_hour and passed one street away from our original pick - up point !
neutral	we were picked_up at 0 . 00am and arrived at the airport just before 0 . 00am !
neutral	now i appreciate you have pick - up '_s to make and someone has to be 0st and someone has to be last , this i can accept , but i think being on a coach or hanging_around for over 0 hours on what is in fact a 00min journey is unacceptable , so sorry , having serious thoughts abouth booking again because of this problem , so look into this alpharooms and i will definitely be booking again .
neutral	my album was nice and is a gift for my daughter however i feel the quality of the album was not as good as my other purchases from you .
neutral	my main criticism is that the centre of the pages do not flow into each other as they used to and you can loose some of the picture because of this .
neutral	have you changed the way you print the albums ?
neutral	th product itself is great but won_'_t be ordering any more with the postal charge , sorry !
neutral	i was disappointed with the quality of the paint_brush on the amazing umbrella kit - in fact it fell_apart .
neutral	i had to go out and buy some replacements .
neutral	the umbrella was excellent and so was the flower kit and waxidoodles and kept our grand_daughter amused for ages .
neutral	just improve the paint_brush !
neutral	very surprised when the box arrived - it '_s very small .
neutral	have bought it as a valentine gift so hopefully the tastes will make up for the size ??!
neutral	!
neutral	should have been confused . com
neutral	the online service is great , very efficient .
neutral	however the product i purchased which was a ring is not a very good standard .
neutral	it looks great and sparkles lovely however after wearing the ring 0 times 0 crystals fell out as they are not secured strongly enough to the band .
neutral	i therefore won_'_t recommend this product to anyone and am very worried as i purchased one for a friend at the same time and now i '_m worried i have given her a very poor quality gift .
neutral	i am very disappointed as i have many pairs of tresor earrings and they have been great , this is why i feel very let_down and disappointed by this brand .
neutral	considering a brand survives on word of mouth in a very fast pace and competitive market bad_reviews are not what a company needs .
neutral	i look_forward to a response from your company as i am dis - satisfied
neutral	don_'_t shop there anymore
neutral	slows my computer down
neutral	not quite sure what i '_m getting from this site , but will persevere until i find it ;)
neutral	the bundle of lights arrived after about a week , not the fastest post .
neutral	the lights are working ok .
neutral	another light i ordered was clearly_shown as available but later refunded as out of stock .
neutral	if out of stock it should be clearly_stated on the site .
neutral	it was a lovely apartment for a short_stay , would not choose it for longer as no washing_machine .
neutral	i was disappointed with the cleanliness , this may have been because we arrived the same day we booked , but the mould on the bedroom curtains and window frames had been there for some time .
neutral	blue_chip apartments are usually spotless so we were very surprised .
neutral	unfortunately the bed was very uncomfortable you could feel the springs so much so we had to sleep with the quilt underneath us .
neutral	compared to other lens sites , the price is good , not exceptional , but the delivery time is poor ... 0 to 00 working_days !
neutral	other_sites offer next_day delivery very cheaply so i think i '_d be more inclined to use them in the future .
neutral	in this age of faster_payments and computers dont understand_why payment takes a few_days ?
neutral	budget car_hire , it was really ok but i opted for basic insurance , when it came to pick_up car the desk clerk was very pushy with the fully_comp insurance at £_00 . 00 xtra per day . i declined 0 times . i thought the credit_card deposit of £_000 was a little extreme for coverage of wheels windscreen etc , but thankfully no damage and the deposit was refunded back unto my card the next_day after return .
neutral	i would have liked to speak to a representative regarding our order , as a result we received too many envelopes and although we ordered everything in blue ink , the return address on the envelopes came in black_ink .
neutral	the invitations were a different color than the envelopes ... otherwise everything in the order was as we requested .
neutral	after we placed the order on - line , i wish it was required that every order is discussed with a customer representative .
neutral	i have used hq_hair a couple of times because the product choice is great and the prices are fab with good regular extra discount deals which are always appreciated .
neutral	however the boxes they send the products in by delivery are dreadful .
neutral	the first time an item had fallen out in transit , in fairness customer_services at hq_hair were fabulous and sent a replacement out rapidly and without issue , this time the bo '_s was again gaping open , my shampoo had leaked a little due to being bashed around and the gift box set i ordered was battered , luckily it was for me not a gift !
neutral	i think they really need to review their packaging !
neutral	also i was missing my free_samples for the mother '_s day deal , so wonder_if these had fallen out !
neutral	great reward schemes but some of their produce isn_'_t great quality .
neutral	i dislike the way they don_'_t seem to care how animals have been treated before ending up on the shelves .
neutral	more affordable than other supermarkets though .
neutral	they don_'_t often have what you want in stock but come on , we love argos because most of their stuff is cheap and cheerful .
neutral	some of their staff could do with cheering_up a bit too .
neutral	weren_'_t you always fascinated by the conveyor_belt as a kid ?
neutral	!
neutral	very prompt delivery following ordering after_reading good reviews online .
neutral	once erected however a number of laps bowed and the shed was not weatherproof as a result and also the perspex was so thin it bowed out of the frame at the lightest touch .
neutral	the laps were replaced but this meant having to remove and replace pieces which i was not expecting to do .
neutral	also replaced the perspex with something thicker to ensure it stayed put .
neutral	disappointed overall on balance .
neutral	out of the 0 orders i have placed with them all have had bits_missing / wrong items etc
neutral	the product was as expected and no_issues here , however the packaging used to post it was terrible and had fallen_apart , the delivery company had tried to patch it up with tape .
neutral	i also ordered 0 separate sized blinds and there was no information telling_me which was which .
neutral	arrived very quickly but wrong color not large enough for my shower
neutral	great pricing attracted us and we saved over_£_000 if we had purchased elsewhere .
neutral	placed order online and straightforward with no_problems .
neutral	however , we did have some problems with the delivery company .
neutral	they didn_'_t deliver on the date arranged and sent us a text to say they would deliver on the next_day .
neutral	next_day we received a further text saying it wasn_'_t to be delivered and to ring them to rearrange a further delivery slot .
neutral	it took over 00_mins for call to be answered by the delivery company !
neutral	it was finally delivered on the third scheduled day ...... frustrating given you need to make arrangements for time off work to be in or have an obliging neighbour .
neutral	i bought an orchid and rose bouquet for my daughters_wedding_anniversary .
neutral	the flowers arrived as planned and whilst they were good quality they arrived as two_separate bunches rather_than one bouquet as shown on the website .
neutral	i was disappointed as i could have gone to a florist and bought the flowers myself but i wanted the wow_factor which was definitely missing
neutral	ordering purpose was straightforward and the product was as expected ( i '_ve had one before ) but delivery was a day late and i found the information on the tracking site unhelpful - i didn_'_t know what stages were involved so i didn_'_t know how far the delivery had got so when i could expect it .
neutral	was happy with the product , no damage and arrived quickly .
neutral	slightly annoyed with the courier as they left the parcel outside our door , no attempt made to ring the doorbell or knock on the door .
neutral	no idea how long my package was left there for .
neutral	i thought , great , free_postage and dscount code as a first order .
neutral	in my hurry , as it was late at night , i forgot to check amount debited and was suprised to receive my order the following_morning which was very efficient .
neutral	i bel ; ieve i was charged_£ 0 . 00 for this pleasure which i certainly would not have knowingly paid as i was happy to have standard delivery .
neutral	anyway , it will make me check much more thoroughly in future should i place another order .
neutral	shame as i was happy with price of product but with £ 0 . 00 postage added , it rather defeated the object !
neutral	half the time collected when you say , the other half we have had to chase_up as parcel not collected when you say .
neutral	prices not too bad , website easy enough to use and follow .
neutral	i have been on the diabetic diet for 0 month now .
neutral	sticking to it rigidly , except i don_'_t always eat the snacks in between .
neutral	the weight_loss has_been very slow and not as much as i had hoped .
neutral	i lost 0 - 0 lbs quite quickly and then stuck at the same weight for over two_weeks .
neutral	i nearly gave up .
neutral	then i '_ve been losing 0 lbs a week - a total of 0 lbs in 0_weeks and still have a stone to go !!
neutral	on the positive side my blood_sugar levels have dropped dramatically and i '_m only using a quarter of the amount of insulin i was .
neutral	everyone tells_me slow weight_loss is better_than fast but i am finding it hard to keep going without better results .
neutral	i normally eat a pretty healthy diet and am not a big eater which may account for the slow progress .
neutral	when i asked for an am collection i expected an_email about 0 - 00am , instead i received an_email once i asked & was standing at customer_services , asking why i hadn_'_t had my email to collect the item .
neutral	i doubt very much i will use click & collect service again .
neutral	weldrick '_s are efficient , but i think the postage at £ 0 . 00 for one small lightweight item is far too expensive .
neutral	a bit of a rip_off actually !
neutral	the cost of one first_class stamp would easily have covered the item i ordered .
neutral	tennis_nuts have a great selectin of tennis clothing at good prices .
neutral	i ordered an adidas ladies tennis dress that was advertised as coming complete with bra and under shorts .
neutral	the parcel arrived quickly however i was disappointed to find that the dress was not accompanied_by the underwear .
neutral	a quick phone_call , however , and i received an_apology and the underwear arroved the next_day
neutral	after_spending ages on web looking for item finally ordered from country_attire .
neutral	next_day got an_email_saying item was not available and to choose another .
neutral	i asked for refund which they did do promptly .
neutral	ordered a card_holder as a birthday_present but the wrong_colour was sent .
neutral	bit of a pain as it was a birthday_present so i had to go out and buy a replacement .
neutral	jules_b collected and refunded quite promptly though and customer service was good .
neutral	a discount could have been offered for the inconvenience though as i wouldn_'_t use again now .
neutral	my friend who the flowers was sent to said that they was dying
neutral	on the plus_side it was quick
neutral	very good service , however when i ordered my tyres they were not in stock and ended_up upgradeding to a better tyre but paying an extra £_00 .
neutral	the ticket service at viagogo was efficient with useful on line information before the event .
neutral	we bought tickets to see eric clapton and were very pleased with the allocated_seats with excellent viewing and comfort .
neutral	my reservation is in relation to the mark - up from the actual ticket price - which was almost_double .
neutral	this was a one off occasion and i was pleased to see the show , however the mark - up price made it a very expensive night out especially with all additional_charges and postage .
neutral	i would also have been grateful for some information on the tickets before the actual week of the show as , at one point i doubted whether or not we would receive them .
neutral	very slow , didn_'_t get in touch with me for ages .
neutral	i had to contact them again and again .
neutral	the job was done eventually - but i won_'_t be using them again - sorry !
neutral	web_site & ordering quite straight_forward , delivery prompt .
neutral	however as the steel cap boots had to be returned the postage was over_£_00 .
neutral	beware as this has signifantly dumped up the price as i have had order another pair but this time used another company / website .
neutral	flowers were ordered from australia for my elderly_mother .
neutral	the arrangement was delivered on time and my sister who saw the flowers thought they were very nice and good value for money .
neutral	however , the vase , which i paid_extra for , was too small for the arrangement and the arrangement had no card with it so my mother had no idea who sent the flowers .
neutral	i contacted serenata with a complaint and got an_automated_response saying it had been passed to customer service .
neutral	either customer service has no staff or asleep as i have heard_nothing from them .
neutral	would i use again , quite possibly not which is a pity given what i saw on the website .
neutral	i have ordered 0 or 0 times_now and i find the service very good , however , i have come to realise that i can buy the white rice flour , potato flour and fine semolina flour cheaper at asda or holland and barratt , and without the added postage expence !
neutral	the tapioca_flour i have a harder job finding locally but buying a single item from you is really not a viable option .
neutral	i ordered three_sets of these curtains in various_sizes and not one was the correct_size .
neutral	example , one set were too short i . e .
neutral	00 drop was actually 00 !
neutral	others weren_'_t square ...
neutral	good but not great .
neutral	items were received very quickly but as i ordered over_£_00 worth of goods they said on the website they would need a signature on delivery but when i arrived home from work £_00 worth of goods had been left in a box on my doorstep !
neutral	happy with most of the products i ordered except the purple balloon_weights .
neutral	on the website they look the same colour as the purple balloons but when they have arrived they are more like blue and nowhere_near the same colour as the balloons and i have therefore had to purchase some from elsewhere as they are not even a close match .
neutral	despatched product quickly - kilt good quality for the price .
neutral	i mistakenly_ordered wrong_size and was advised to re - order and return unwanted kilt for refund rather_than exchange .
neutral	replacement was received promptly but after more than 0_weeks am still_waiting for my refund
neutral	there was never a question that we would not be going to see one direction as this was all my daughter wanted for christmas but the tickets were way overpriced for the seats we had ( i paid less last_year and had better seats ) and the booking_fee was ridiculous .
neutral	not sure i would use you again .
neutral	sorry !
neutral	this is the 0rd time i have used tyre_shopper , but the 0st time i have encountered problems .
neutral	the prices on tyre_shopper are extremely good value and the tyres are great quality .
neutral	but when i went to the fitting_centre on the day i had booked in ( monday 00th , am ) i was told that i wasn_'_t on the system and they weren_'_t expecting me .
neutral	as a result they could only fit 0 out of the 0 tyres i '_d ordered .
neutral	i was then told to come_back today ( friday 00th , am ) so i could get the other 0 tyres_fitted .
neutral	i couldn_'_t go so my other half took my car through and when he got there he was told that the other 0 tyres that were waiting for me , had been sold yesterday , so they had to wait for a delivery before they could fit them .. my car is still there waiting to have them fitted .
neutral	so i would have normally have given tyre_shopper 0_stars but due to this week '_s events i have given them 0_stars .
neutral	although website has changed , i '_m not particularly impressed with the search_facility when i searched " yoga " i was told no results , although managed to locate lots of items after quite some time .
neutral	fast delivery though
neutral	i had a very mixed experience with serenata_flowers !
neutral	my first_impression was honestly i would not touch them again with a barge_pole !
neutral	their lack of any phone customer service is hugely frustrating , especially as i had moved and the website would not allow me to change any details , although i tried five times !!
neutral	so my delivery was not delivered on the day i wanted and then i was told there was a mistake and it had gone to the wrong delivery depot .
neutral	i sent three emails and none were replied to .
neutral	however , when they eventually did wake_up to the fact that i was getting desperate , they were efficient and the flowers arrived when they said they would !
neutral	well_done for redeeming yourself serenata .
neutral	had to order 0 can openers in the end as the first 0 were faulty - customer service always good although quite slow in the 0rd replacement - great can opener now i have one that works !!
neutral	!
neutral	flowers delivered on time and as expected .
neutral	. except i had a text saying " your order ## has_been delivered and left_securely at the front of the property .
neutral	".. this actually turned_out to be outside of a small apartment_block not even in the lobby area .. so a public area in central manchester .
neutral	no attempt to use the intercom and the recipients were in .
neutral	fortunately i texted them to make_sure that they had got them before the flowers disappeared .
neutral	.
neutral	additionally i ordered a vase as wasn_'_t sure if they had one but it wasn_'_t big enough for the bouquet .
neutral	it would have been useful if that hsd been flagged_up at checkout
neutral	the toucans are just what i was looking for .
neutral	the tropical birds looked better on the internet .
neutral	wasn_'_t impressed that they where folded in box to post .
neutral	would have flat packed between stiff cardboard .!!
neutral	!
neutral	i was really happy to continue re - ordering this product but , as i '_m now unable to order the minimum to qualify for the 00_%, i '_ll be ordering a different product elsewhere .
neutral	i don_'_t think the price structure took the smaller therapist into_consideration and am quite disappointed in proto col .
neutral	the service i received was acceptable , however , i did had a query with the above mentioned compnay , and it took them exactly a week to come_back to me with a solution .
neutral	0rd time using service .
neutral	had a not great experience last time as paid for max 0 drops to beat package tour_bus to hotel and had more than four drops and driver spent_ages looking for a location .
neutral	this time in tenerife transfer to resort was very speedy but return to airport again was more than 0 and went a strange way that took longer .
neutral	ordered a replacement part for chicken drinker .
neutral	part fine but took about 00 days to arrive !
neutral	did try and call a couple of times but no reply .
neutral	i go off very early , so i stay in the quality hotel and leave my car there - the only_drawback is that breakfast , which is meant to be part of the deal , is not available !
neutral	i would really appreciate a packet of muesli and milk , with other breakfasty type stuff in my room .
neutral	i travel to scandinavian countries and the flights are always early
neutral	other than no one to answer the telephone ... not too bad !
neutral	website crashes / times out often which is a little annoying .
neutral	once order was received , we received a confirmation_email and follow_up which was good .
neutral	delivery was quick and well_packaged although we are missing the ' thank_you ' cards that should have arrived free with the order ( we received the envelopes just not the cards ).
neutral	my only_complaint would be that the finishing fold is not perfect .
neutral	i can appreciate that the card is pretty thick meaning that a crease fold would be difficult but i do feel this could be completed a little better .
neutral	very disappointed with the medications i ordered .
neutral	the tablets have made my pet sick .
neutral	i bought these very expensive shoes as i am a normal size 0 , they are unbearable to walk in i think its the patent , strongly_recomend you try before you buy .
neutral	i was super excited to receive my wonder_woman outfit ( which was brilliantly priced !)
neutral	and it came really quickly so i couldn_'_t_resist trying it on as soon as i could !
neutral	unfortunately , the costume was too_big for me so i put it back in the packet ( folded and sealed again ) and contacted jokers ' straight_away .
neutral	that was a good while ago and still no reply , usually customer_services are reliable and fast , so now i don_'_t know what to do with my item !
neutral	it '_s my 00th_birthday in a few_weeks so i hope i get an exchange by then .
neutral	not impressed at all with the service , despite its fast arrival .
neutral	very disappointed :(
neutral	the sizes are very strange , very long legs on trousers .
neutral	my cardigan had a very short torso and huge arms !
neutral	also , the label was cut out ?...
neutral	( what ' a that all about ?).
neutral	i would recommend buying small clothes and shoes a size larger , the shoe sizes are very strange and it '_s very annoying waiting for something to arrive and for it to not fit at all !
neutral	i '_ve been the same clothes / shoe_size for god_knows_how long , so it '_s definitely their sizes and not a growth spurt lol .
neutral	to sum it up , it '_s just market quality crap .
neutral	not a good start .
neutral	opened an account as had a voucher for get £_00 off if u spend £_00 or more .
neutral	brought a pair of boots which were faulty .
neutral	arranged an exchange but had to call again to bring price of boots back down .
neutral	then had to call again because very sent wrong_size .
neutral	exchanged but had to call again to put voucher back on .
neutral	after the 0rd time my boots were right but cost me around £_00 in phone_calls !
neutral	!
neutral	great website , speedy service , good communication about delivery .
neutral	i just can '_t get the name labels to stick properly .
neutral	either they peel away ( maybe iron not hot enough ?)
neutral	or they melt ( iron too hot ).
neutral	i am persevering and maybe by end of the pack i '_ll have sussed it out .
neutral	in their favour , the name labels are clearer and easier to read than others i have bought .
neutral	what shame you delivered the flowers a day earlier_than the anniversary date .
neutral	flowers lovely just delivered on the wrong day !
neutral	!
neutral	i called lesters before i ordered my item to make_sure it was in stock and how long it would take to get to me .
neutral	i was informed i would have it by the friday , i '_m writing this on the following_monday as i still have not received my item .
neutral	iv called lesters but all they have fine is give me my delivery code ( already had it ) and told me to check on hermes site .
neutral	not a happy_bunny .
neutral	purchase was easy ; delivery timely ; however 0 email were sent to say the flowers had been despatched an 0 to say they had been delivered which was annoying .
neutral	the final bouquet also looked identical to the base flower option not the enhanced option i paid for .
neutral	everything went well except for the pick - up and this dated back to the email sent to me by rentalcar offering an app as a way of checking in at the pickup .
neutral	i did not want an app ans did not download it as i was not intending to use my smart phone in south_africa due to expense of roaming .
neutral	we arrived at europcar with the only documentation you had sent us when we booked .
neutral	this was not sufficient for europcar .
neutral	they needed the voucher .
neutral	they did not have wifi so i had to go to a hotel with my laptop to try and locate the email from 0_weeks previously .
neutral	it was then extremely difficult to find a document to actually print , which was the only_thing that europcar could work with .
neutral	this whole_procedure wasted about 0 hours of our holiday .
neutral	please be aware that not all people or countries have caught up with this phenomenon of apps and need simple paperwork !
neutral	i called 00_minutes prior to my arrival as advised .
neutral	my first call was not answered and just rang out .
neutral	it was 0 . 00am on my way to gatwick , i did panic for a moment but finally got an answer the 0rd time i called !
neutral	i arrived a few_minutes earlier just before 00_minutes so waited fr a few_minutes .
neutral	00_minutes had past making it 00 minues since i originally called and still no one was there to collect my car .
neutral	beong a woman on my own i did not appreciate being kept waiting especially when i had not used the company before .
neutral	finally after a few calls on my side a guy arrived , no appology for being late .
neutral	he merely said sign here , did not even check over the car !
neutral	upon my return i called after i had come through passport_control .
neutral	we had hand_luggage so i thoguht that will allow ample time for me to get to the car seeing as tey took 00_minutes to arrive last time .
neutral	within 00_minutes i am being called rather abruptly to see where i am !
neutral	upon_arrival to the vehicle my husband checked around the car , fairly standard i thought .
neutral	i was then told by the guy there is no need to check we just pay for any damage !
neutral	it was all a bit uncomfortable to be honest .
neutral	it '_s a shame as they were competitive on price and the car was in fine condition upon return .
neutral	just the customer servcie i feel let them down and procedures .
neutral	nevermind :-)
neutral	i thought the service was good .
neutral	delivery was quick and when expected but when it arrived the product was very disappointing .
neutral	it was flimsy and poor quality and did not reflect the online photos .
neutral	there was no returns_slip so i had to ring the call_centre to advise i wished to return the item and was informed returns were not free .
neutral	paid for express delivery yet it took 0_days to arrive .
neutral	envelope just had royal_mail first_class on .
neutral	disappointed in puzzle as it was just made out of cardboard which was not in the description .
neutral	it is good at picking uphair and bits .
neutral	but it is so noisy and sounds rattly . i do not usei t as oft en as i like as of the noise . also wish charger cable was longerlthankyou
neutral	webpage not easy to use .
neutral	products are good .
neutral	ordered 00 april - arrived 0 may .
neutral	review
neutral	good product for the money , i required it for going to appointments instead of getting a taxi , perfect weight and size for travel .
neutral	customer_services were very helpful and excellent delivery .
neutral	the wheelchair is lightweight and easy to assemble and fold_down .
neutral	the wheelchair was delivered on time .
neutral	i was very delighted with the speedy delivery .
neutral	i am delighted with lightweight as i have a bad back myself and i am registered_disabled .
neutral	it is ideal for transporting my elderly friend .
neutral	excellent next_day delivery and i was kept_informed by text as to what time i could expect it .
neutral	i also feel that the voucher you give as a thank_you should not be valid for such a short time .
neutral	if it is to say thank_you there should unlimited time to use it as you don_’_t always have the money to buy something_else straight_away .
neutral	some people have to save up to buy the next item like myself .
neutral	strengths
neutral	the wheelchair is very light_weight , wheelchair is easily set_up from packaging , easy to storable , has handles on seat that you just pull together to close and transport in car boot with room for the shopping as well .
neutral	i can keep the wheelchair in the boot of the car when not in use as it does not take too much room in the boot .
neutral	weakness
neutral	could do with a clip or strap to secure the footrests when folded up , as footrests are very light and fall_off when lifting the wheelchair into the boot of the car .
neutral	the wheelchair is not suitable for rougher ground and going up drop down curbs .
neutral	wheels could do with being a bit larger as i have trouble going up drop down curbs and uneven pavements .
neutral	brakes could do with being on the handles or being_able to use with the foot as i have a bad back and it hurts me to bend to put the brakes on and off .
neutral	i was pushing the wheelchair along the pavement and i had to cross the road so i made for the drop down curb but my friend was jarred forward and i came to a complete stop and i had to have some help to get up the drop down curb , if it was not for the seat_belt my friend would have come out of the wheelchair .
neutral	the seat_belt is very stiff to open and close hopefully with time it will become easier to open and close the seat_belt .
neutral	when you put the footrests up so you can get out of the wheelchair safely they sometimes fall down again and hit my friend ’_s feet luckily they are light but my friend said that it did hurt he feet .
neutral	my grandmother , mother , me and my daughter have been faithful sainsburys shoppers but no more . food is not quality like before , stores are more like horrible tesco , the only good thing is tu clothes , they are excellent .
neutral	i always buy my electrical goods from here , as the quality , knowledge and customer service are second to none . the same however cannot be said of the catering . i would always lunch at the store whilst shopping in the city , but no more , a coffee in the bistro maybe but the food and value for money in the big restaurant is a disgrace . the staff are now all unkempt and unshaven boys dressed in black , and looking like assasins instead of the pleasant and appropriately dressed female staff of the past . it is a nightmare in most of the store to find somewhere to pay or someone to ask advice from . the knitting and sewing dept is no_longer the pleasure that it used to be either . come_back the real john_lewis store please !
neutral	!
neutral	home delivery staff excellent , but instore staff often poorly_trained . some produce is good , but very variable .
neutral	i would choose not to use sky if i could , but it is the best product available if you have no cable access . when anything_goes_wrong it is a nightmare , be prepared to spend evey waking hour on the phone for at_least a week , and then get an visit from a rude and incompetant engineer .
neutral	everything about your company is top_class . i have found my recent orders have not arrived the next_day , in fact one took a week !!!
neutral	will be buying from chemistdirect from now on .
neutral	i ordered 0 items on april 0 and eventually received second item today ( 0 / 00 ).
neutral	this situation caused a lot of inconvenience to my disabled_father .
neutral	the company was very apologetic about the situation and i hope they will improve their customer service .
neutral	the items seems to be of a good quality .
neutral	the car we hired was fine . to hire a car in spain it is a lot_cheaper , we hired a car over the christmas_period for 0 month and it only cost £_000 , we hired a car in sardinia , for 00 days and it cost £_000 .
neutral	i am unable to claim my £_00 discount_code , trying many_times to contact them but received no responses so far .
neutral	however , the first booking was perfect , everything went well .
neutral	hope that someone would help me sort it out !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	decent flowers but poor service from ordering through cashback site
neutral	challenges presented by ' don_'_t rock the boat ' led to family fun but then to cheating !
neutral	!
neutral	so normal reactions at christmastime , i suppose .
neutral	the blinds are fine however , there is too much of a gap at the top of the blind and the last slat doesn_'_t sit very well so as we have a street light outside our house , the blind doesn_'_t block the light very well .
neutral	fortunately this blind is in the spare_bedroom but i '_m disappointed that there the last slat doesn_'_t sit as well as it should when the blind is closed .
neutral	easy application process and set_up .
neutral	prompt receipt of insurance certificate and associated documents :)
neutral	can '_t give a better rating as i don_'_t know how the company perform if a claim is made
neutral	i '_ve been using interparcel for some time and have always had good results until ' my hermes ' was swapped for ' yodel '.
neutral	yodel is useless and i would never use them again .
neutral	they simply failed to show up on the designated collection day the first time i used them .
neutral	also when i called interparcel to report the yodel no show they said they had logged my complaint but had to wait up to three_days for a reply as to when the collection might be rescheduled and they couldn_'_t chase again until then .
neutral	i had to cancel and rebook with city_link , who did show up on time .
neutral	my hermes always showed up on time and i '_m very disappointed their services appear to have been dropped .
neutral	i was not happy at the
neutral	my parcel of sweet pea plants arrived at 00 . 00pm on saturday_morning ; i was not at home . because it was a bank_holiday_weekend i was unable to collect them until tuesday_morning .
neutral	they were somewhat dried out .
neutral	it was unfortunate that they had been dispatched coinciding with the public holiday .
neutral	i ordered flowers for my daughter in brussels , for a specific occasion , and i received an e_- mail in flemish which i did not understand .
neutral	the flowers were delivered later than when requested because the ones i ordered were not available .
neutral	this was disappointing and if the e_- mail had been in english i could have made alternative_arrangements .
neutral	i chose the option to use english when i ordered the flowers , so it must have been obvious that i was an english speaker
neutral	some of the paper was boxed the other were in a plastic_bag which_resulted_in corners being damaged
neutral	i ordered gold envelopes and was surprised to see that they arrived in a very nice gold bubble_wrap envelope only to find that the contents were not gold at all .
neutral	in fact the colour was closer to yellow !
neutral	can '_t be bothered to return them , but wouldn_'_t order again .
neutral	bestilte 0 radiatorer til mit lager .
neutral	modtog bekræftelse på bestilling , og skrev til firmaet , at jeg gerne ville have dem hurtigst muligt .
neutral	ingen reaktion .
neutral	ringede nogle dage_efter , da_jeg kunne_se på_min ordreside , at der_var_en radiator i restordre .
neutral	blev enig med kundeservice om , at den sidste radiator blev annulleret , og at jeg_ville modtage en bekræftelse på_det .
neutral	modtog ingen belræftelse , men i stedet en " anmodning om tilbagebetaling ".
neutral	og endnu en mail fra tjekkiet om , at man skulle bruge mit kontonummer etc .
neutral	for at foretage en tilbagebetaling .
neutral	øh nej !
neutral	udleverer ikke mit kontonummer til_en privatperson i tjekkiet !
neutral	lyder særdeles lyssky i mine ører ...
neutral	og i øvrigt kan jeg_ikke tro , at man har trukket beløbet for en vare , der ikke er afsendt ?
neutral	hvis det_er tilfældet , skal jeg lige have vendt det med mastercard , for det_er bestemt ikke i orden ?
neutral	!
neutral	my experience was okay .
neutral	i didn_'_t have any_problems with the costume i purchased per_se , but the sizes were a bit off .
neutral	the measurements on the website led me to a size m , but i could '_ve easily fit into a size s , as the m was quite loose .
neutral	( note that i had sent my measurements along with my message , to which they replied they couldn_'_t measure the costumes to give me a precise answer ).
neutral	also , i had sent an_email asking if the petticoat was included , which was promptly answered ( it wasn_'_t included ).
neutral	i then purchased one separately , which turned_out to be unnecessary , as the dress skirt was poofy enough .
neutral	wasted money on a petticoat that i '_ll probably never wear ...
neutral	the place was busy , but tyre was replaced , only_complaint was that they didnt put the spare back into to the boot neatly , but service was fine .
neutral	mike broke on our bus so we had to swap buses .
neutral	very busy so we didn_'_t bother .
neutral	would have thought bus would have spare mike .
neutral	also you say tickets valid for 00_hours you don_'_t run over 00_hours .
neutral	add an extra £ 0 . 00 to deliver to inverness , which is mainland_scotland , no need !
neutral	there was an offer online but i didnt get it and customer service didnt reply to my email .
neutral	also there were delivery problems but that is probably not usns fault and more due to the delivery company .
neutral	the delivery was terrible , i paid for next_day delivery but my nicece never recived them they said i that they left them in the porch .
neutral	the porch is an open porch near to the main path so if they did deliverer the flowers anyone could of stolen them . on the postive side they did redeliver some new flowers but a few_days_later and i still paid for next_day delivery .
neutral	the flowers were beauiful .
neutral	buy regularly from simply_supplements and my only_criticism is that on three occasions delivery took 0_days for goods to arrive when it should only take 0_days .
neutral	this is the courier at fault not simply_supplements .
neutral	i was happy with making my purchase as the glasses were a good price .
neutral	unfortunately i did then receive 0 emails_advising me that i had not completed my order and would receive a further 00_%_off if i completed my order !
neutral	this put doubt in my mind as to whether i had actually ordered them or not - concerned as i needed them asap for a birthday_present .
neutral	i did email the sunglasses_shop but didn_'_t hear back for 0_days and was also unhappy that if i had left ordering i would have received 00_%_off my order simply for leaving them in my shopping_basket .
neutral	bought a tv , delivery was quick , cheap and well_packaged but the tv wasn_'_t working :-(
neutral	the actual accommodation was disappointing .
neutral	the five car_parks are not easy to find and when questioned , the landlady said they were full ... this was not so .
neutral	the room was in " the annex " which had a very dreary approach .
neutral	the room was clean but very drab .
neutral	the breakfast however was very good .
neutral	as we were half an_hour early we were asked to " go and have a coffee " my husband was ill and i really needed to get him to lie down somewhere .
neutral	we would have stayed longer if the place had been nicer .
neutral	we found a wonderful place next_day and stayed three_days
neutral	i ordered jardiniere and matching side net_curtains - disappointed to see that jardiniere sides and side net panels do not match ( on curved bottoms and look a bit uneven in my bay_windows .
neutral	previously had 0 years good service pity you spoil it
neutral	cheap looking
neutral	the flowers got to the recipient but were delivered to and left at the wrong_address .
neutral	fortunately it is a small_village so the house finding the flowers on the doorstep knew where they should be - the address given was correct , but delivery had been made to the wrong building .
neutral	this is disappointing as it is not my first order to this address and i very much needed the flowers to arrive on a specific date , so i feel it is only luck that they got there .
neutral	i got a text to say they had been left_securely , but was then surprised not to get a thank_you from the recipient .
neutral	when i got this later in the evening , i understood why this had been !
neutral	a shame as your service previously has always been excellent .
neutral	karen greenwood
neutral	price was good for insinkerator but until i ordered i was given every indiction that delivery would be amost immediate but once you had my order them i was informed that item was a manufactures order and i would have to wait .
neutral	fortunately for you the plumbing was delayed otherwise i would have gone_elsewhere and cancelled my odrer .
neutral	since others had this common item in stock i am surprised that an oganisation as big as yours did not .
neutral	the original date could not be met since it was a bank_holiday but fornately they were able to deliver a day early .
neutral	sort_out with multiple payment with paypal in the end .
neutral	all sorted .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	i ordered a funeral sheath / spray & while it corresponded to the picture on the web , i felt it looked very small for the money so i am disappointed .
neutral	they are good at sorting_out refunds if things are faulty , but can be slow posting things , and if i have a query i always have to email them twice to get an answer and they are very slow to reply to email enquiries for some reason .
neutral	expecting a dog bed , just got a cover , no_doubt the description says that but the picture is misleading .
neutral	the delivery was a pain - having to sign for parcel not clear at check out or i would '_ve_used work address - quite a low value package surprised could not just leave it here .
neutral	i have a lot of problems with delivery as there are 0 very similar addresses .
neutral	i usually explain this in the order as there is generally a delivery instruction box - there is one here but it only allowed a few characters .
neutral	predictably the courier went to the wrong house - i called on receipt of the text but redelivery was not possible .
neutral	i had to wait in next_day but i made it clear i had to leave at noon - delivery sent next door at 0 . 00pm
neutral	the dog bed cover is very nice but overall this was a real pain
neutral	i ordered what i thought a set of battery_operated salt and pepper_mill to find only one arrived ?
neutral	small_print is too small i miss read been back on the site non left !!!!
neutral	annoying now i have an odd set !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	nice though but now need another one ...........
neutral	i have tried 0 varieties and only like one !
neutral	the rwandan is the best and i was disappointed in the quality of the others .
neutral	unfortunately the capsules don_'_t always pierce properly as they aren_'_t the same size as the nespresso_capsules .
neutral	i won_'_t order from here again , although the service was good , i would rather pay a bit more and have nespresso .
neutral	very efficient ordering and speedy processing and dispatch , however , marred_by the fact that the parcel was left_outside where anyone could '_ve picked it up !
neutral	fortunately they didn_'_t but hey .... shame on you royal_mail !
neutral	!
neutral	badges fine but arrived on 0th_april , when i explicitly stated i needed them on 0th_april .
neutral	they were supposedly dispatched on 0nd_april by first_class_post .
neutral	if i had been told i would have to pay for express delivery , i would have done this .
neutral	otherwise proof process and communication was fine .
neutral	the furniture is lovely , solid and well made and you ' re kept up to date with delivery information .
neutral	on the whole an excelllent service but i received numerous phone_calls immediately following the placement of my online order trying to sell me insurance_policies for my furniture .
neutral	they were very pushy and persistant and most unwelcome , in the end i threatened to cancel my order ( over_£ 0000 worth ) if anyone phoned again .
neutral	shame to spoil what would otherwise have been a five_star experience .
neutral	the products are superb , educational and fun .
neutral	however , i find the website extraordinarily slow to navigate , much_easier to telephone and speak to one of the charming staff .
neutral	additionally , since it usually takes a minimum of 00 days and sometimes far longer for toys to arrive , i tend not to use this company for birthday_presents since twice i my son has attended a party empty - handed and the present is eventually handed_over long after the party has_been forgotten .
neutral	that said , the products have been well - received once opened .
neutral	ordered & paid for next_day delivery ( friday ), so stuff could be taken to france on sunday with friends who were driving back .
neutral	idea was to save me carrying it on the plane - save space for other bits on hold luggage .
neutral	after paying & order confirmation coming_back ok , got another email to say - sorry , now monday , then another to say oops , now tuesday !!
neutral	stuff arrived monday but boat went sunday !!
neutral	no offer of extra postage refund either !
neutral	ordered some great looking shoes from ecco - they took_ages to arrive and when they did were too_big - a simple returns system - but from the initial order to the final delivery it took about three_weeks .
neutral	ecco need to learn some lessons from other online_retailers otherwise they will loose out which will be a pity .
neutral	the second pairs of shoes were perfect and didn_'_t need any " wearing in ", so look to your delivery ecco !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	im not happy that i paid over eight_pounds for a chart only .
neutral	when i ordered the item i didnt_realise it was just a chart that i was ordering .
neutral	if i had known it was for a chart only , i wouldn_'_t have paid eight_pounds for that item .
neutral	i know the item was reduced but i thought it was for a full kit including all the items to complete the project .
neutral	i cant even return the item as ive opened the package .
neutral	orders are handled quickly and correctly .
neutral	what i do not appreciate , however , is the fact that price differs depending_on which country you are buying from even if you choose to buy in gbp .
neutral	price is higher in gbp when ordering from sweden than it would be if i was ordering from uk .
neutral	this makes your statement that delivery is free for all countries untrue , since i in fact are paying more than uk customers for the products .
neutral	i do sometimes buy from feelunique . com as well and at that site prices are the same regardless where you are ordering from given of course that you buy using the same currency .
neutral	not very happy i had to pay £_00 . 00 delivery charge for purchasing 0 products !
neutral	0 of which cost £_00 . 00 !
neutral	ok both were fairly heavy but i regard the delivery charge as very expensive !
neutral	annoying that i had to stop booking to email customer for a tel no but otherwise fairly simple .
neutral	collected just within timeframe although i was getting nervous as i paid 00p for text to say it was close to being collected and i have not received that text !
neutral	will see if i receive text when delivered at other end !
neutral	ups driver stated they do not send texts !
neutral	after a rocky start with fonehub i was worried that i chosen the wrong mobile phone recycler .
neutral	i received an_email from fonehub two_days after_posting my mobile off to them via special delivery .
neutral	i was informed that they were processing my order but then i received another email the following_day with a revised_offer of which was no where near my quote online , in fact £_00 less which i found insulting .
neutral	to cut a long_story_short fonehub eventually made contact with me to resolve this matter and they offered a decent price for my working samsung_galaxy 0 .
neutral	same day payment made as promised and they delivered in the end .
neutral	all in all not bad but could have been better .
neutral	booking long_stay parking in_advance is helpful and cheaper but having used the service several_times it is not without fault .
neutral	on every_occasion we have had trouble exiting after our stay .
neutral	the machine reads our ticket and says we have a bit to pay , it has never recognised our booking so we '_ve had to sit and wait in the cold at the intercom trying to sort it .
neutral	last time the automatic license plate reader also read ours wrong so again on exit after our stay it didn_'_t recognise our booking .
neutral	saying that the problem is always fixed quickly and we '_ve never had to pay extras .
neutral	sort_out the booking recognition errors and it would be a great service .
neutral	items received very quickly and packed well .
neutral	one item from the order was missing and was replaced after a couple of e_-_mails and a few_days ' delay .
neutral	happy enough with the service though .
neutral	i was really impressed with the speed of despatch and delivery of my order but not so much with the quality .
neutral	i '_ve ordered the same product , a calendar , from several different companies and in terms of value for money i found photoworld was very average .
neutral	i received a nice product but the print quality wasn_'_t great .
neutral	variety of goods , great present ideas & great prices !
neutral	keep an out for the hidden postage_costs !
neutral	toners have been faulty on 0 occassions .
neutral	acknowledge fast replacement however still an inconvenience .
neutral	the service was good and i got the dress in time but after paying for the dress and postage i also received a customs bill for 00 pounds which i didn_'_t expect
neutral	ordered my shed after looking into prices across the board thoughtn this was a good deal
neutral	the shed is ok but not a quality i was expecting real cheap wood no treatment which i am sure was not mentioned in the advert nails were not hammered in properyl and am sure it will not last the the time it is garenteed for having said that its ok but for a few pound s more could have a got a better quality one from major diy .
neutral	all though the customer service is excellent , and my queries were answers almost_instantly , the flowers are not what i expected .
neutral	i ordered the biggest bunch available & what i got looked like the standard size advertised on the website .
neutral	all though the flowers look nice it was for my mums_00th_birthday so i wanted something big .
neutral	very disappointed & definitely didn_'_t get my money '_s worth .
neutral	the service was great - good software for creating photobook and quick delivery .
neutral	the print quality was lower_than i expected .
neutral	i ordered a printer on 0 / 0 / 00 , received the order acknowledgement and patiently_waited for delivery .
neutral	today , 00 / 0 / 00 , still nothing received so i checked the tracking online and nothing was found so i called up and was told that the order placed last_week did not go through properly at their end and i '_ll need to go back online an re - order .
neutral	ok , a bit of a faff and a shame that no - one followed this up with me for over a week , but i go to the site and select the same printer & it is now 00_% more_expensive .
neutral	boo !
neutral	poor me , so no sale after all that & i '_ll have to go somewhere_else now .
neutral	received only bits and pieces of items ordered at various dates .
neutral	when these items were suppose to be received as one package .
neutral	this happened twice in two different orders .
neutral	i ordered several sample invites from bride_& groom_direct , which arrived promptly .
neutral	i think the invites themselves are excellent ; very good value for money and a great selection of invites to choose from .
neutral	however , i have found the online ordering process a nightmare .
neutral	the process is complicated and unintiuitive , which is a shame because i think this site offers a better and nicer selection of invites than many of its larger rivals .
neutral	everything was great ... except that the picture of iggy ( the moshling that we ordered ) had no mouth , which we liked and the iggy that turned_up did .
neutral	luckily my son didn_'_t mind but the picture should be the same as the product .
neutral	a bit misleading .
neutral	although i was exceptionally pleased with the speedy delivery of the flowers i ordered unfortunately they looked nothing like the ones i had ordered .
neutral	i do realise that some flowers may have been out if stock but most florists have lilies and roses all year .
neutral	the bouquet when it came looked like it had come from a garage_forecourt and was not even displayed very well .
neutral	i would think_twice before using their service again .
neutral	kvaliteten og farver kan variere fra det man ser på_hjemmesiden til det produkt man modtager .
neutral	deres størrelser i både sko og tøj er_ikke til at stole på .

neutral	i ordered this one friday and the following_monday had an_email to say fire had been dispatched .
neutral	it arrived the following_day but unfortunately i was not at home and the delivery man left it with neighbours who are in their 00s who had to bring it over in their car to my house .
neutral	the fire is cast_iron and came in 0 parts and it is very heavy .
neutral	i thought i would have had a phone_call with a date and time_slot .
neutral	watch was delivered in super quick time .
neutral	ordered at 0pm and got it the next_morning !
neutral	however , the pic and description of the watch i ordered said brown_leather , but it was black .
neutral	didn_'_t return as my boyfriend_loves it anyway
neutral	i got my cards very fast as always , my design looks the way i expected it .
neutral	but this time , the background color is already fading away , even_though i having taken the cards from their packaging at all .
neutral	bad color quality i guess ?
neutral	i will need to throw_away some of the cards even before having taken them to anywhere .
neutral	so that '_s a direct print - to - bin .
neutral	i hope the cards i will hand won_'_t get totally unreadable within a few_days , this would not make a good impression .
neutral	prices pretty good
neutral	i didn_'_t have any_problems outbound except that it was difficult to find a place to park .
neutral	some idea of which way to proceed to find a vacant spot would be good .
neutral	coming_back i had flown from australia and was fairly tired , had to wait quite a while for a bus and then had a little difficulty_finding my car .
neutral	the alphabetised blocks are a little vague and not very well sign posted .
neutral	site was easy to use , only issue was that paid for quick delivery & delivery date missed .
neutral	they were a birthday_present .
neutral	didn_'_t arrive till
neutral	00 : 00 .
neutral	far to late .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	item was processed quickly from payment stage .
neutral	but the delivery arrangements with the courier was not as efficient as it could have been and certainly not up to scratch of other delivery companies who give you options by text / email in_advance .
neutral	apart_from the initial email from the supplier confirming dispatch we did not receive any other text / email to let us know when it would be delivered .
neutral	needless to say we received a card through the letter_box informing us of a missed delivery .
neutral	despite inviting us to , we were unable to change the date or give an_alternative delivery address online ... computer kept saying ' system error .'
neutral	a phone_call to tnt in the morning confirmed the item was already out for automatic delivery again which we knew we wouldn_'_t be able to accept .
neutral	couldn_'_t change online again and so this went on a couple of times .
neutral	further phone_calls to tnt confirmed ' sorry we don_'_t know where the item is now .
neutral	we think it '_s lost .
neutral	very can '_t be bothered attitude .
neutral	eventually it turned_up but considering how slick some other operators are with their delivery systems this is behind the times in my opinion .
neutral	i have just had my finances sorted with the help of harrington brookes . although i am satisfied with the outcome i feel as if i have been down a fast flowing river which i could not stop . i cannot always think of questions on the spot and i cannot_afford to make too many calls as i only have a mobile phone .
neutral	face to face discussions are far easier to handle than telephone_conversations . when i did get the paperwork it was quite difficult to understand and after_reading through it i did not think that it had been explained to me in sufficient detail . as stated previously i am satisfied with the outcome but i just hope that harrington_brooks staff remember that they are communicating with a real_person not just a phone number
neutral	ordered door_handles that arrived promptly but the order was not accurate .
neutral	when contacted they have promised to rectify but i now have the inconvenience of returning the handles i did not order .
neutral	im really pleased with the product .
neutral	i have ordered this before from you in a smaller_size and there is no disputing the quality .
neutral	however the carriage was on the steep side .
neutral	it was £ 0 . 00 and turned_up 0 working_days after the date of purchase .
neutral	i would expect next working day delivery for a cost like this .
neutral	i wanted to see if there was a more competitive company online for felimazole tablets for my pet cat .
neutral	animed certainly are cheaper_than the previous company although i did not find communication from the animed side was forthcoming as i had to make the contact on trying to find out re my order at what stage it was at .
neutral	i had made an_error which would have held my order up if it had not been for my contact .
neutral	however on the otherhand once i had spoken to a person at animed the problem was quickly resolved , so all in all at the end i was quite happy with things .
neutral	ordered food for my diabetic_dog so it was important that i received it swiftly as the food is only available online .
neutral	i ordered it on thursday and paid the express delivery which said i would get the food within 0 - 0_days .
neutral	i didn_'_t receive it until monday .
neutral	this is because the couriers used don_'_t deliver on a saturday .
neutral	if this is the case then surely animed should only except express delivery on mondays and tuesdays .
neutral	i ordered a second pallet of food at the same time with free delivery and got them both together .
neutral	i bought a groupon_voucher for an a0 wall calendar using my own photos .
neutral	when i came to upload my photos it became_apparent that the resolution of my photos was not sufficient for the calendar .
neutral	there were no instructions prior to purchasing the voucher regarding this and as i was approaching the " use before " date i had to use photos of a lower resolution than recommended .
neutral	as a result the pictures in the calendar look a bit grainy .
neutral	i think this should have been made clear when buying the voucher , as this was meant to be a christmas_present for my inlaws , but because the pictures are not very good quality , it won_'_t be !
neutral	the bed is lovely , very easy to put_together ( requires 0 people ) and beautiful .
neutral	however i had problems with contacting the company .
neutral	customer_services will not deal with delivery info , however when you call the delivery line , no one ever answers , then no one returns your calls !
neutral	also emailed twice which were both ignored .
neutral	poor customer service and communication
neutral	i ordered a special birthday_gift .
neutral	my card was charged at the time of booking but 0 week_later i was told the item was out of stock .
neutral	cards should not be charged until despatch
neutral	product and packaging great but delivered via citilink who are utterly_useless .
neutral	for this reason , wont_be ordering again
neutral	they delivered the flowers and they were lovely but they delivered them on the wrong date !
neutral	hughes_direct were very good but delivery was appalling .
neutral	firstly , it did not come on the allocated day and when it did arrive the day after , it was left on my doorstep and i live on a main_road .
neutral	no card was put through my door and luckily it was not stolen and because i could of easily said i had not received it and requested another one at £_000 .
neutral	i really feel that hughes_direct need to look at using another courier .
neutral	range and price of products is what attracted me to victoria_plumb and the bath_taps etc were of good quality when delivered .
neutral	i paid_extra for next_day service which i thought was a little_steep .
neutral	one hitch - i called 0 hours_later to amend order and was advised , with a little persuasion from me , they would be able to add and get all items delivered together .
neutral	sadly an integral item was missing and plumber was coming so i had to purchase elsewhere which really let us down and cost us more money .
neutral	refund given , and other items good so overall , would definitely shop again .
neutral	i ordered in the past but i am hesitating to order more because it is difficult for me to see the details for products and that keeps me away from ordering .
neutral	it is easy to order at sunglasses_shop and the freight is paid by the sunglasses .
neutral	however it is very expensive to return the goods again as it has to be shipped to uk .
neutral	the homepage is very nice and easy to use .
neutral	apart_from getting a non valid return which i hadn_'_t booked , there was a £_00 charge for using a visa_debit_card , not maestro .
neutral	i didn ; t see this properly explained in the booking procedure
neutral	i received the item and although it looks nice its a lot smaller_than i thought .
neutral	anyway it does the job .
neutral	even_though i had a long wait for it as well .
neutral	i was waiting for my order to arrive it took over 0_weeks , i emailed got no reply then i rang and was told yes we have your order and yes you have paid for it but we still_haven_'_t sent it because its still pending even_though you have had payment for over 0_weeks .
neutral	i had to send them proof of my payment why when they already had the payment .
neutral	no emails while it was pending but received 0 within 0 hours after i made a phone_call , not happy at all with the service i received .
neutral	ordering was simple , but what i ordered said , shampoo and conditioner .
neutral	that '_s what i thought i '_d ordered .
neutral	in fact 0 shampoo bottles arrived , not one of each which was disappointing as i really wanted a shampoo and the conditioner to go with it .
neutral	spoke with live_chat - promised christmas delivery didn_'_t need to pay extra .
neutral	told i ordered on the last day that xmas delivery was guaranteed now the 00 th dec and items still not received - very disappointing
neutral	received everything thing but one item , which i had to email several_times to get a reply for .
neutral	to be told it was with ups .
neutral	when i checked with ups they informed me not had to order .
neutral	and sent me proof to say was cancelled .
neutral	0 emails later i get informed will look into it .
neutral	now its apparently back with ups .
neutral	so will see if it arrives .
neutral	but other than that good .
neutral	need items for tuesday as it for a birthday_present
neutral	everything was great until delivery .
neutral	the website said the furniture would be placed in the room of my choice , but the two guys who delivered it simply brought my package into the hallway and left it there .
neutral	they refused to take it upstairs claiming it was too heavy ; they didn_'_t even offer to put it into a downstairs room - they just left it on the hall floor and walked out .
neutral	my parcel was delivered very speedily , but after ringing the doorbell on our three - storey house , the delvery driver hardly gave my husband any time to get down the two flights of stairs from the top floor ( which he did immediately on hearing the doorbell ) before he had taken the parcel to a neighbour '_s house .
neutral	my husband then opened the door to find his parcel being handed_over to a neighbour with no wrapping on it , so that everyone could see that it was a sad daylight therapy lamp !!
neutral	as he is unwell , and would not have wanted people to know that this is what was being delivered , he was very upset that the package had no wrapper .
neutral	why did this happen ?
neutral	however the situation was rectified and a new product was sent the following_day .
neutral	we have not any previous bad_experiences and order from kite regularly .
neutral	absoloutly loved my wings when they arrived looked great !, however after an_hour or so of wearing them a wire became loose and was sticking out .
neutral	also a lot of the feathers began coming loose and hanging off , so i do not feel they were of good quality .
neutral	it has_been a while now since i used the site .
neutral	clicked on special_offer flower £_00 . 00 did not see the £ 0 . 00 delivery charge also did not
neutral	see that it had automatically ticked the next size up tab so by the time i had got to the payment it was nearly_£_00 i only wanted to spend £_00 in the end it nearly_£_00 but it was very easy to use lets_hope they deliver on time and of good quality .
neutral	i have already written a review as requested , but wanted to add that although the flowers were disappointing when they arrived after a few_days they looked much_better .
neutral	they now also smell lovely , it is just a shame they were not that nice when they arrived .
neutral	i tried your offer of the improved pods bur they made my machine go very slow and the quality was still not as good as the original nesspreso . so sorry , i shall stickwith them .
neutral	as well as my own package i received an extra one , addressed to me but the photographs inside were not mine .
neutral	i left a telephone message explaining the error and have not had any response from jessops .
neutral	i am , nevertheless very pleased with my own photo_book .
neutral	we have not yet received our order because , although the french post_office can find our home , chronopost france cannot .
neutral	we have contacted medicanimal and dpd uk , because , although we successfully received a letter from chronopost france they do not answer their phone .
neutral	we are hoping to receive our order within the next week .
neutral	the first plugs arrived on time but the second lot arrived a lot later and i was starting to get anxious .
neutral	out of three items ordered , one has not yet arrived .
neutral	i want to post it abroard , so i need it to get to me in the next few_days .
neutral	normally jessops is very reliable .
neutral	i '_ve_used animed several_times and have always been really impressed with how quickly i have received my items on the free delivery option .
neutral	i needed some items quickly on this order and so paid for the express delivery .
neutral	i was sooooo disappointed .
neutral	i placed my order on a sunday lunchtime and received an_email the day after from the couriers regarding tracking my delivery , this made me think that i would be getting the delivery that day maybe as the delivery showed that it was with them .
neutral	despite checking their ' tracking ' website there were no more updates and it was wednesday_lunchtime before my delivery arrived .
neutral	a complete_waste of money , i '_d have probably received the goods in the same amount of time if i '_d have just taken the standard delivery option .
neutral	such a shame that its ruined my experiences with using animed .
neutral	i use interparcel regularly
neutral	i find interparcel easy to use
neutral	city_link have quite lazy drivers tho
neutral	several_occasions i '_ve waited at home and no one shows up to collect parcel and when they do turn_up , my customer has to go to main depot to collect parcel
neutral	not the service i paid for
neutral	but i put it down to lazy drivers tbh
neutral	the flavours , on the whole were very good , but the quantity not so good , certainly not enough for a man and not enough for a woman weighing less_than 0 stone !
neutral	not enough protein and is the sugar necessary .
neutral	won_'_t be bothering again i '_m afraid .
neutral	after receiving a beautiful_bouquet of flowers for my birthday from a friend , i decided to use yourselves to send the same flowers to my mother in law for mothers_day .
neutral	i was really disappointed to see the bouquet , as there wasn_'_t as many flowers and looked nothing !
neutral	they were the same price , only we had the voucher for £ 0 discount .... is this the reason_why we had less flowers ?
neutral	i bought a package from groupon so to be fair it was a cheap deal , they group all the groupon appointments into a couple of days a week and its very much a cattle_market , no sitting going through treatments plans etc just get on the bed , zap you , get off , next one in .
neutral	compared to other clinics such as skin where you get such thorough and almost ott care throughout i actually laughed about my experience at nu cosmetics with my husband , in and out in 0 minutes flat !
neutral	the staff are friendly and the proof will be in the results so we '_ll see , i just hope those paying full price get a little more service and attention !
neutral	i ordered a snakeskin lined wallet which looked fantastic , i just missed a 00_%_off weekend but went_ahead as i liked the product , the next_day there was a 00_%_off day , a few_days_later a 00_% day , it makes you feel_cheated when you '_ve paid full price and undermines the quality products .
neutral	i understand having an offer on one or two weekends up to christmas but not constantly !
neutral	looks as though aspinal must be desperate to generate sales ...
neutral	the concert was amazing .
neutral	the seats were pretty good , although thought the mark up on the actual ticket price was excessive !
neutral	since it was a birthday_gift then i was willing to pay but had i know the massive_difference i probably would not have bought the tickets .
neutral	the tickets came with about 00 days before concert so that was fine .
neutral	i have used iflorist on several_occasions now and on the whole the service is good .
neutral	however at easter i ordered a basket of fruit to be delivered on the thursday before easter and it did not arrive .
neutral	i tried to contact them using the numbers and email addresses on the website and saw that the website was all inactive and there was nobody answering the phone .
neutral	this lead me to assume that the firm had ceased_trading so i contacted my credit_card company to see if the money had gone off my card .
neutral	it had so a search was initiated .
neutral	when i made contact with the company on the tuesday after easter i was informed that they did not work over the bank_holiday .
neutral	this information was no where to be found on the website .
neutral	the fruit was finally delivered a week after the date requested .
neutral	didnt_recieve items on day i was expecting was just sat in depot for few_days ( weather not an excuse ) also did not get any information about products arriving late or when i will be recieving the rest of what i had ordered ??
neutral	the products i did recieve were fine on arrival .
neutral	i ordered some flowers for my mothers_birthday , i was pleased with the selection and price of the flowers but on the day of delivery i had pre warned my father that i had arranged flowers for mum .
neutral	they waited in all day and the flowers didn_'_t arrive until 0 . 00pm which ruined the surprise because my father started ringing me at 0pm to tell me that the flowers hadn_'_t arrived .
neutral	i went online to check delivery times / conditions only to find they can deliver as late as 0pm , the birthday is pretty_much over by that time !!
neutral	it made me look like i had forgotten my mum '_s birthday .
neutral	also pages were obviously cut wonky because there are white sections on the printed page and on the online version the picture goes right up to the edge of the page .
neutral	very sloppy .
neutral	ordered item but was not told it was out of stock until emailed a week_later !
neutral	however , the item was found and sent in time .
neutral	service was good easy to order , but the packaging was dreadful .
neutral	i love this site , however there are many many_times where a page doesn_'_t open and i have to use the sellers own website .
neutral	( no discount for me !)
neutral	this makes me sad .
neutral	please fix this .
neutral	;-)
neutral	we have been buying from dobies for several_years , one year we went to someone cheaper , but they were not such good quality , and went back to dobies the next year .
neutral	this year , owing to the death of my mother , and so not wanting so many plants we cut down our order .
neutral	the impatiens were great , the trailing lobelia not bad , cosmos a little iffy , and as for the cleome , they were awful .
neutral	i forgot , the strawberry plants are going great guns .
neutral	i took some photos of the cleome , and sent it to dobies , but unusual for them , i have not had a reply .
neutral	my husband has thought that we might not bother again , as the plants we bought in the local_diy_store have been really good .
neutral	it is a shame that we might stoop using dobies as they are a national company , belonging to a company with the same name as our surname !
neutral	normally they are quick off the mark with their customer_relations , but this time it has_been poor .
neutral	i placed an order for the first time one evening but didnt_realise i should get confirmation_email with order number until i tried to track it next_day .
neutral	i then checked junk_mail and not there either .
neutral	i checked my bank_account several_times , no payment made , so i then phoned the delivery address , which was a nursing_home , but no flowers had been received .
neutral	so i ordered again .
neutral	i did then get two emails acknowledging both orders , two payments made from bank_account and two lots of flowers sent to nursing_home .
neutral	so i was not impressed .
neutral	however , i do think the overall service is probably very good , and that i experienced an unfortunate hiccup , so one day i '_ll maybe try again !!
neutral	!
neutral	flowers not delivered on the date i had chosen because of yourselves not being_able to confirm with the florist , to a customer that '_s not an acceptable excuse , you emailed them but did you phone them ?
neutral	therefore my daughter received her_birthday flowers 0_days late , due to they cannot be delivered on a sunday .
neutral	this was my first time using this company , probably_wouldn_'_t use again .
neutral	lights are great , but arrived without a ' plug / transformer ' which had to be purchased separately .
neutral	had i know , i would have thought twice about ordering them in the first place .
neutral	the lights and the transformer are both good , as was the delivery .
neutral	only received half my order as an item was unavailable but i did not know this at time of ordering .
neutral	full_amount of order has_been debuted from my account !!
neutral	got note in with my received item to say second item would come 0 week_later - item still not received and i have not received an e_- mail advising it has_been despatched !!
neutral	!
neutral	- i sent my mobile on a wednesday , they recieved it by thursday and i got my payment on the saturday :)
neutral	hostelworld is a great website to use when comparing hostels , prices , reviews plus they have an interesting blog and spend a lot of time on all social_media .
neutral	i just don_'_t understand_why they keep their ( pretty high ) booking_fees !
neutral	it can become very expensive when booking a lot of places , and especially when you ' re booking one night '_s accommodation that '_s possibly only costing you 00_euros , it costs you 00_% again just for the privilege of booking with them .
neutral	there are other_websites that are just as good that don_'_t charge anything , like europe '_s famous hostels and hostelbookers .
neutral	i '_m not really sure what i expected from ready - prepared food .
neutral	its only something i ever use in an_emergency as all meals in our house are home cooked from scratch .
neutral	my husband , who has coeliac_disease , took the opportunity to try one of the chicken dishes while i was away for a couple of days .
neutral	that '_s the best way he said he could describe it - ok but nothing special .
neutral	he felt that it lacked something - a bit bland in fact .
neutral	he has several others to try which i purchased for him , but he is very discerning about food , more so since he has had coeliac_disease .
neutral	i honestly do not think though that he would want me to buy this product for him again .
neutral	getting an_email late the day before planned delivery telling_me that someone had better be in to sign , is not useful .
neutral	so despite the quick delivery , it would be better to have some notice - although as it happened , i caught the courier as he was trying to put it in my secure home delivery cabinet .
neutral	he had knocked on the door briefly ... and was prepared to use the cabinet - so that was a plus .
neutral	ordered two jumpers one had a hole in after only being worn twice .
neutral	the other one was so small couldn_'_t get it over shoulders , even_tho it was the same size as the jumper .
neutral	delivery was excellent and no problem exchanging .
neutral	easy to book and good value .
neutral	when we returned to our car which was quite far away from the meet and greet office we found the door was not properly shut and car was unlocked !
neutral	although good cash_back offers are therein takes_forever to get them .
neutral	i completed a stay in a hotel in december and it has taken 0_months to get my cash_back and that is through constant_emails to see what was happening .
neutral	on the whole , disappointing .
neutral	i have bought items from this site and the quality , fit and availablity leave a lot to be desired .
neutral	the sizing sucks , theres never anything decent for anyone a 00 or over and anything i have managed to get into didn_'_t last long once washed and the shoes have worn out quicker_than the wind changes direction .
neutral	definitely a get what you pay for site ..
neutral	i was impressed and grateful for the loan however the lady_who took me through the process i thought was extremly rude and very aggresive i thinl u need more custmer service training with certain staff_members .
neutral	quick easy to use website .
neutral	great prices .
neutral	item as_described , very pleased .
neutral	only_thing that would stop me using them again is the delivery .
neutral	delivered on a large pallet which the delivery guy wouldn_'_t bring to the house or take away the pallet if i offered to unpacked it .
neutral	it was left on our drive in the rain , and me and my husband had to unload it , when he got home from work !!
neutral	we '_ve had a lot of deliveries , large and small and never had this problem before .
neutral	the same driver delivered 0 pallets to us over 0_weeks and was as unhelpful and unpleasant each time .
neutral	four_stars for the bestbathroom . com , 0_star for the delivery .
neutral	smooth process until waiting for payment .
neutral	takes an excessive amount of time to receive payment .
neutral	i sent a bouquet of flowers for mothers_day , my mum owned a florist shop for many_years , so her opinion of the flowers is very important to me , and of course to get the right company to send them .
neutral	although the flowers were very nice and fresh , many people like myself work very hard for wages , and would prefer more flowers in a bouquet rather_than a huge_amount of fancy packaging - and a huge bow .
neutral	all in all i would use eflorist again - but have a closer look at the type of packaging involved first !
neutral	appartamento spazioso , ben arrredato e riscaldato .
neutral	posizione perfetta per vivere parigi a piedi , ubicato vicino alla metro e con ristoranti bar e supermercati vicini .
neutral	sconsiglio l ' appartamento se siete in più di 0 persone e non avete molta confidenza : infatti il bagno ha l ' entrata nella camera da letto e chi dorme sul divano deve per forza passare da lì .
neutral	ci sono molte infiltrazioni d ' acqua nel giroscale dove piove costantemente dal soffitto in alcuni punti .
neutral	mancano i cucchiaini e una scopa .
neutral	migliorando quasti particolari e le perdite d ' acqua diventerebbe perfetto per una coppia o una famiglia
neutral	my order was sent to milton_keynes rang them up i had to post there order to them and they sent mine to me , not what you want 0_days b0 xmas , thankfully we were honest poeple , not what you pay for ,
neutral	was dissapointed that the toilet_seat was rather on the small side and also no instructions with it but the money it is good value and comfortable .
neutral	please do not order if your in a hurry ..... but price of goods is really good .... excellent value , excellent price ...
neutral	i found it easy to find routes and prices but booking was a bit stressful as i couldn_'_t get what i wanted and had to go for a different destination .
neutral	this was probably due to it being summer and i should have booked earlier .
neutral	i purchased a pair of bogs ranchers as a present for my boyfriend .
neutral	having read some of the other reviews on the site i noticed that often wellies appear to come up large .
neutral	therefore i phoned customer_services and asked about the specific style i want to order .
neutral	my partner is always a size 0 and the woman assured me that this style did not come up large .
neutral	i gave them to them on his_birthday and yes , you guessed it ... they were absolutely massive !!
neutral	( i would say at_least 0 . 0 inches too long in the foot !
neutral	).
neutral	i wouldn_'_t normally mind , but the fact i '_d phoned to ask and was told they were fine clearly shows lack of knowledge .
neutral	not only that but i was taking him away for a few_days with our dog so he couldn_'_t even use his wellies for the weekend trip they were bought for !
neutral	i now have the hassle of returning them ...
neutral	good prices and easy browsing website .
neutral	quick and efficient service to home .
neutral	but the friction in my case was the impossibility to modify or cancel the order once i did and pay it .
neutral	this possibility is available in a lot of webs of shopping .
neutral	after that , i contacted with the customer service , just minutes after the purchase , they decline to make any change .
neutral	in my case just add two orders made with minutes of difference in between them .
neutral	goods arrived over 0_weeks after ordered so although good quality they were in fact much later than_expected .
neutral	other than that all fine .
neutral	everytime we order things are in stock then later told not in stock
neutral	alway fine but needs better picture quality
neutral	overall the villa appeared a little tired .
neutral	there wasn_'_t enough oven trays ect , no grill_pan , and few cooking bowls , fine if you want to eat out all the time but that wasn_'_t an option for us .
neutral	the surrounding_area of the pool was dirty , and even_though reported to the rep we ended_up washing it down ourselves .
neutral	both bathrooms were in need of repair , both towel_rails were broke and one toilet_seat had a crack in it ..
neutral	when the maid came midweek to change the towels and clean we were out but it was evident no cleaning had been done .
neutral	we had great weather which made up for the down falls of the villa .
neutral	the paper is of very good quality and the price is excellent but with the high postage cost it loses its value for money
neutral	shame as i would use you more often if the postage was more competitive
neutral	lovely lady on the phone , not sure if we understood each other , cos i aint got all the bits i was promised ... and not call back .
neutral	i ordered a bottle of drink for my nan for her_birthday and i left it last_minute but luckily they have a next_day delivery service which was great !!
neutral	although i wasn_'_t actually in when the parcel was delivered and my nan was the and box it came in had ' the drink_shop ' printed all over the box so i think she may of guessed what she was getting for her_birthday !!!
neutral	definitely think you should start doing more discreet_packaging !
neutral	:)
neutral	i received the jacket i ordered in a grey bag with brown_tape around it , inside was a plastic sleeve with my barbour_jacket inside , not quite what i was expecting .
neutral	however when i called to ask why it was delivered so shoddily , the lady i spoke to arranged for a authentic barbour bag and packing tissue to be sent to me ( jacket is a xmas_present ), only for her helpfulness will i ever shop there again .
neutral	we waited a hour for collection in auckland after ringing about 0 times - at no time did they say it was a different name of the rental_car that we had booked .
neutral	the pickup van was go rentals and we booked under rental_cars .
neutral	also , i left my good reading_glasses in the car and have not been contacted that they have been found yet .
neutral	easy enough to book .
neutral	clear pricing and transfer times but disappointed that i entered a voucher_code but it did not recalculate the price .
neutral	used this site specifically because of the discount_code .
neutral	i bought a couple of pairs of glasses from glasses_direct , but found that i couldn_'_t see very clearly through them ; while some parts of the lenses gave clear vision , other parts weren_'_t so good , and my vision was a blurry when i moved my head .
neutral	i decided to return them on the back of the 00 day no - quibble policy .
neutral	this all worked_fine and i was refunded without a problem .
neutral	the reason , though , why i wouldn_'_t use glasses_direct again is the returns_label from glasses_direct only covers you if you ' re happy to return your classes by 0st_class mail .
neutral	i didn_'_t feel comfortable sending £_000 worth of glasses without insurance , but that meant i had to pay £ 0 for this cover .
neutral	indeed , i had initially wanted to get the glasses corrected , but i thought £ 0 each time i needed to return them to get them adjusted was too expensive .
neutral	i explained to the people in customer_services that their mistake had cost me money , but they were unable to see this and unwilling to help .
neutral	i have used trushopping several_times in the past & have always found they provided good value for money with good service & delivery . however , i have recently found the website to be very slow & irritating & almost abandoned one order before i got to the basket because it was so slow to respond .
neutral	one part of the order also needed to be chased .
neutral	i trust this is just a blip in otherwise good service from a company i trust .
neutral	i was expecting to see a picture of the jigsaw on the box .
neutral	luckily there was one inside so i stuck this on the box myself .
neutral	also i was not expecting the jigsaw finish to be shinny .
neutral	these were for christmas_presents so will not know yet if they are ok .
neutral	see above i lost my dog before the food arrived so cannot_comment
neutral	i had already had a previous delivery with no problem but this time full address was inside parcel but driver only given part of address and he couldn_'_t find us .
neutral	my telephone contact had also been recorded but no one rang to ask how to find .
neutral	delivered following_day .
neutral	unfortunately although i don_'_t think it was pet_supermarket fault it does tend to impact on their rating
neutral	all in all the service was acceptable but unfortunatly more care should be taken to make_sure the orders are correct before dispatch .
neutral	whisky was a gift so have not drunk it !
neutral	was dismayed that i now have to pay (& not a few_pence !)
neutral	for a gift message rather_than it being part of the service ( which already is q expensive for p_&_p ).
neutral	at christmas it was part of the service .
neutral	plus that the process for writing the gift message was time_consuming as it had ( not obvious ) character number limitations per line .
neutral	great start .
neutral	helium_balloon arrived promptly and as_described , but latex balloons went down very quickly and were not very big .
neutral	two foil numbers still ok after two_days .
neutral	prompt payout but weekly fee more thsn quoted over the phone
neutral	i recently_moved to the uk and got a htc_wildfire android phone with 0 .
neutral	great customer service in the liverpool street store .
neutral	but the reception is horrible .
neutral	i am never able to use the phone becuase i never have enough reception ...
neutral	night flights into nice are a gamble - at midnight precisely everyone goes home .
neutral	it matters not if your flight has_been delayed , they ' re gone !!
neutral	this applies to all car_rentals , the entire terminal was locked up when we arrived .
neutral	tried the 00hr , 0 day week rentalcars helpline to see if they had any ideas .
neutral	got answering_machine , and still_waiting for return call 00 days_later .
neutral	picked_up car following_morning - excellent new car and efficient staff , but confirmed they do not wait after midnight even for confirmed ( and prepaid ) bookings
neutral	i ordered some party invites for my 00th which came & i was absolutely_delighted with them , and even more so when i received a 00_%_discount on my order .
neutral	so , with this in mind , i found a nice design for " thankyou " cards & ordered again ... and again received a 00_%_discount , however when i opened them up i was really dissapointed with the quality of the printed material , they looked a bit cheap .
neutral	it won_'_t stop me ordering from optimal_print again as overall was impressed with the general service but i hope that the quality of the material is in line with what i received when i had my invitations printed .
neutral	i was a bit disapointed with my last order a bag of 00 . 0kg applaws dried_dog_food because when i took it out of the delivery box the bottom of the bag was spilt so it went all over the floor .
neutral	i had to clear the mess up straight_away because the dogs would have eaten it .
neutral	when i emailled this to the company i was asked to send photograghs which i could not do because i had to clear the floor up straight_away i thought this was a strange request under the circumstances
neutral	transfergo did good job but as i realized later tranferwise has better change rate from £ to euros and acctually i have lost 000 £ . if i would know before i wouldnt use transfergo !
neutral	sorry but i would not recommend wowcher because there were more rubbish than good offers
neutral	the flights were on time and the staff excellent .
neutral	we were flying upper class as i am very disabled and unable to sit in an ordinary aircraft seat for longer_than 00_mins .
neutral	however , the cabin was grubby and there was considerable debris down the sides of my bed chair , crisps , sweet wrappers and something unpleasantly sticky .
neutral	goodness only knows when it had had a decent and thorough clean .
neutral	the other downer was that my husband left a very expensive hat in the cabin , and despite letting the staff know very quickly , it was never returned to him .
neutral	as the total_cost of the 0 flights was about £ 0 , 000 , we felt that it could have been a lot better .
neutral	also the ' goodie bag ' was terrible compared to many airlines .
neutral	i ordered a bal hai bouquet of orchids for valentines_day .
neutral	yodel is the delivery company for serenata , which rang alarm_bells when i found out , as i '_ve had nothing but bad_experiences with yodel .
neutral	i saw there was supposed to be an_email sent to me on the day of delivery so i could track the order , but i didn_'_t receive one .
neutral	what '_s more , there was an alert on the yodel website saying they were experiencing delays because of the floods .
neutral	understandable , but without being_able to track the progress of the flowers , and the worrying omission of this notice on the serenata_flowers at the time of ordering them , i was worried they wouldn_'_t arrive .
neutral	when they did ( around 0pm ), there were in a cardboard_box , and the recipient didn_'_t get that typical flower - delivery - surprise at the door .
neutral	maybe because they were orchids , maybe because that '_s usual for serenata , i don_'_t know - but i wouldn_'_t have ordered them if i '_d known .
neutral	flowers themselves were ok - nothing particularly special , but not misrepresented or anything .
neutral	all in all - i probably_wouldn_'_t order from them again , but only because i wasn_'_t filled with confidence .
neutral	it would be just great if it didn_'_t leak
neutral	ordered the top as part of a birthday_present .
neutral	the staff were most helpful and the item had to be delivered from another shop .
neutral	it arrived with a black_mark on the back , pretty obvious and would have thought they would have checked before sending on .
neutral	when we contacted the store they said they did notice it but sent it because they knew it was a present .
neutral	i don_'_t think the original store should have sent a product out though that had a mark on it .
neutral	it did wash off but not really good quality control in my opinion .
neutral	the site was fine - i booked 0 hotels , but i could not get the page to line up to print - on any if them -- basically only half was there .
neutral	copying '& pastiing took_ages due to text boxes - one if them dropped the name if the hotel !
neutral	plus the big black lines use a lot if ink
neutral	i have a love - hate relationship with damart : their goods are excellent quality but the service is really bad .
neutral	in_spite of myself , i keep shopping online with them although i know i will have problems with delivery .
neutral	goods are late or get lost ; damart doesn_'_t tell you whether items are in stock or not ( or the info is wrong ); they don_'_t send a message to tell you that goods or dispatched or when you can expect them .
neutral	in brief , you order and then you wait ... one week , two_weeks , three_weeks , four_weeks ... and the goods might suddenly appear .
neutral	the call_centre cannot answer any_questions about delivery .
neutral	so unfortunately damart really does not meet standards online shoppers expect : tracking , fast delivery , accurate stock info .
neutral	but damart sells good stuff !
neutral	if only they could update their website and improve their distribution !!
neutral	!
neutral	i took delivery of a very tall_fridge_freezer , asked the delivery men if they could
neutral	help men to unwrap it which included lifting to remove cardboard from underneath . their reply was ' oh no love we just deliver !'
neutral	i live on my own so i had to wait a few_days till someone came to visit me .
neutral	otherwise excellent product at very good price .
neutral	i have been with quidco for a couple of years_now , and although i have always been impressed with the rates of cashback they offer , the service just isn_'_t what it could be .
neutral	cashback regularly doesn_'_t track , and if it does , is subject to months of delays .
neutral	amounts often track as less_than those advertised , which means contacting customer_services again .
neutral	don_'_t expect quidco to be an easy route to making extra_cash - it requires a lot of time being spent on chasing up missing / incorrect amounts .
neutral	most companies also don_'_t pay within any less_than approximately 0_months , some up to 0 .
neutral	as above sentance
neutral	i struggled to find answers to outstanding questions and the call_centre was closed .
neutral	i have paid in full now but installation is not until may 0th , will my 00monhs start from today eventhough i have no broadband installed , or does it start from installation ?
neutral	we arrived later than_expected and were quite stressed and was worried to see cars driving round and round trying to find a space .
neutral	we eventually found one on the raised section and then waited for 00_mins for a coach .
neutral	the service otherwise was great and our return bus was waiting for us so all good .
neutral	i would use them again as they were cheap but some system of finding a space would be helpful
neutral	i did not receive a confirmation of delivery until over 00_hours afterwards .
neutral	i had to ask for it .
neutral	the delivery took place without a telephone_call beforehand and was left in front of the door .
neutral	i recently_purchased the tahiti massage_bed .
neutral	i enjoy the rounded edges for myself although a client has already complained of feeling that their shoulders arent supported ?
neutral	( maybe they are just fussy ).
neutral	the 0cm foam is actually 0cm max as the bed designed to look much deeper than it actually is , this was a dissappointment for me as i chose this bed because of its delux feel and that they claim it to be the their top bed .
neutral	the arm_rests are in the wrong place .
neutral	i like the open ends for seated sessions .
neutral	i took the bed overseas , otherwise i would of considered changing it .
neutral	speedy delivery .
neutral	i bought the metal shed about two_weeks_ago , just check against the list of items and found three parts_missing ( gable brace and both side of the angle caps ) and the included anchoring kit too !!!!!
neutral	very annoying as have planed to erect the shed with the help of friends this weekend .
neutral	this is the second time i have used e_- florist and the second time i have been disappointed .
neutral	the flowers i ordered were to be delivered today according to the delivery date scheduled on the delivery note email i received however they have not arrived !
neutral	apparently there is no scheduled delivery date with the flowers selected which was not clearly_stated when ordering this bouquet .
neutral	it now looks as though the flowers going to the recipient is the result of a sheer afterthought rather_than a thoughtful thank_you .
neutral	the problem i had the first time in using e_- florist related to delivery issues and seems to be a recurring problem .
neutral	i have spent most of my morning telling any one who will listen what an efficient delivery service river_island are running .
neutral	so , imagine my surprise when i then hear from my boyfriend who has taken time of work to await the arrival of my parcel that it has not been delivered .
neutral	the first thing i did was check river_islands seemingly uber efficient tracking website which told me that my parcel had not been delivered as the driver could not find my address .
neutral	the only options i was given to proceed via the tracking service was to choose another day or deliver my parcel to a neighbour .
neutral	the nature of my problem meant that both of these options were invalid so i set about negotiating the labyrinth that is , fist dpd ( the couriers ), and then river_islands own customer service lines .
neutral	both of which , surprise_surprise , are dreadful .
neutral	dpds line ( the courier service used by river_island ) has 0 / 0 options which lead to an_automated_message before cutting the caller off .
neutral	the remaining option " 0 " if anyone_else is having this problem finally got me through to a genuine human_being : mark , who , judging_by the sound of his voice , really could not be arsed giving any customer service via his customer service line .
neutral	i was told by the lovely mark that dpd would be unable to change the address on my parcel and that i should contact river_islands own customer service line .
neutral	i did this , not easily i might_add , and found myself , after another wonderfully frustrating automated_voice parade , on the phone to an employee named mike who sounded_like he cared_about as much as mark had before him .
neutral	mike told me , in pure monotone , that river_island were unable to change the address on a package and nor could i cancel my purchase .
neutral	the reason i was given for being unable to change the address was that the website triple checks the address with the customer thrice before purchase is completed on the website .
neutral	i then asked the cheerful chap what river_island therefore suggested i do next and was told to call back dpd .
neutral	now , let_me just stop there for a moment , at this point neither company will allow me to change my address or take_responsibility for my parcel nor am i allowed to return the goods and am unable to change the date or deliver to a neighbour because the courier cannot find the address which i cannot change .
neutral	does any one else see how illogical this whole_thing is ?
neutral	well , luckily for me matthew at dpd did who quickly went above and beyond to help me rectify my , admittedly , own mistake with the original address .
neutral	however , even matthew could not save the day entirely as i will no_longer be shopping at river_island .
neutral	i had spent over_£_000 on this purchase alone and no one i spoke with seemed the slightest bit inclined to help me until i explained the situation in full to matthew at dpd .
neutral	moral of the story ?
neutral	river_island bad , dpd ( their courier service ) bad , matthew of dpd ...
neutral	the silver_lining .
neutral	delivery was fine and within the expected timescale .
neutral	the item was the product that i ordered .
neutral	however i ordered 0 boxes each containing 00 sachets .
neutral	in boxes 0 and 0 one of the sachets in each box contained only air .
neutral	the first one i discarded as i thought that it was just a one - off .
neutral	i still have the second sachet if you wish me to return it to you .
neutral	service can be hit and miss , esp next_day i have had at_least 0 instances when they haven_'_t dispatched stuff and blamed the courier !!
neutral	and i have found stuff cheaper elsewhere .
neutral	however , they do not ' glow ' as much as i thought they would , and the remote_control didn_'_t work .
neutral	i haven_'_t contacted them as yet , i will do today .
neutral	they are nice if you like very subtle lighting .
neutral	inital service was excellent from farnham_cycles and bag was dispatched really quickly .
neutral	unfortunately i was out when the package was delivered and it had to be signed for , so they planned to deliver the following_day but no time given .
neutral	there was no way of talking to the company to find out an approx delivery time - not even a morning or afternoon and i had commitments which_meant i couldn_'_t stay in all day .
neutral	so i had to wait another 0_days until i knew i would be in .
neutral	i could have picked it up from the delivery company '_s depot but that is 00 miles_away from where i live and i do not have a car to go and collect it .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t been able to plan a day at home for delivery then it would have to be sent back to farnham_cycles .
neutral	not a problem with the service from the shop just the delivery company !
neutral	car was fine no problem , but firefly asked for 0 euro per day for zero_excess on insurance which i understood to be included , on returning home i have read the contract and am still under this opinion .
neutral	next time i will double_check before i leave home .
neutral	excellent except when they close your account for security_reasons when there is totally no reason .
neutral	to get back is a nightmare !
neutral	!
neutral	i was drawn to their high thread_count products , but in the end i had to return them .
neutral	unfortunately , the goods shipped were indeed 00_% incorrect .
neutral	the customer service returns was very helpful and hassle_free and the refund was very quick .
neutral	the ship its self was fine although cabins very basic .
neutral	on the first evening we ate at the blue_ribbon restaurant , and the food was excellent , but the waiter tried to sell us wine at £_00 . 00 per bottle and made us feel like paupers for having cheaper bottles .
neutral	the time in amsterdam was a little short as the ship was delayed , and we felt like we had to constantly watch the time in case we missed the return coach .
neutral	as i said in my opening sentence the return_journey was terrible .
neutral	after a really rough night rocking all over the place , we thought when we awoke we would be back in newcastle , but we were told we had another 00_hours !!
neutral	ship still rocking and rolling all over the place with no escape !.
neutral	i do understand that the captain can '_t control the weather but this trip is done all year and has_been for years , we should have been warned that this may happen at booking or at_least the night before .
neutral	found the car_park eventually ...
neutral	so many airparks around the airport that it wasn_'_t very well sign posted as to which one we were actually booked into :(
neutral	the directions given weren_'_t very accurate .
neutral	when we eventually found it [ after a huge fall - out ]...
neutral	it seemed to go well .
neutral	transport to and from airport was fine .
neutral	when we were getting on the bus at the airport - on entering the bus people were standing around with their luggage at their feet on the bus instead of putting it up on the racks then sitting down on the seats provided , thus_making it difficult for other people to get on the bus tripping_over cases , etc .
neutral	some people who could '_ve been on our bus were left at the airport for the bus to come_back !!
neutral	crazy ...
neutral	surely this is a health and safety risk ???
neutral	especially when young_children were also standing !!
neutral	i think that the driver should be taking more responsibility to ensure that his passengers are safe and that all the luggage is securely stacked .
neutral	i have to say that i would ' nt use this airpark again .
neutral	where i cannot_fault the communication by serenata_flowers , the actual delivery of my flowers left a lot to be desired , they did not appear until the evening , which , in my view , was far too late .
neutral	the recipients birthday was nearly over .
neutral	but what a terrible website to upload_photos , awful long time taken to fill in details , takes_ages ( if it works at all ) to add photos .
neutral	other competitors coming into the scene so you have very little time to fix your problems !
neutral	expensive , and some poor quality .
neutral	but not too bad .
neutral	some of the offers on the internet dont work and i ended_up cancelling some of my order .
neutral	they do 0 for 0 on kitten_food and then adult cat_biscuits .
neutral	i have a kitten , so i couldnt take part in the offer .
neutral	me and my friend ordered some goods from here previously , everything was stated to be instock so we paid for the quickest delivery so we got the products the next_day / day after .
neutral	they didnt arrive .
neutral	apparantly everything wasnt in stock , although clearly_stated on the website .
neutral	apart_from that , products are good , service is quick , and nothing gets delivered damaged .
neutral	( well ... mine hasn_'_t been )
neutral	this is a good website , and the customer is sent an invoice very quickly and then informed about despatch .
neutral	my parcel was despatched on 00th_june and arrived on 00nd june , not bad .
neutral	unfortunately the parcel was wrapped in brown_paper and was delivered early on saturday_morning - it had been dropped over a 0ft high gate onto wet concrete and when we found it the brown_paper was wet and the cardboard over the tubes of toothpaste were also wet .
neutral	we are early risers but did not hear the bell or a knock at the door , but were left a card to say they had been .
neutral	the service initially receiving from ultralase was great , however my left eye still has a - 0 . 00 prescription ( treatment august_0000 ) so may need to be re done .
neutral	i had two appointments in a row cancelled by ultralase and when i enquired why was informed that they have been taken over by optimax and the bristol clinic is closing .
neutral	i have not been informed of this is writing and the girl who informed me on the phone was unapologetic of my cancelled appointments and not very polite .
neutral	why does it take so long to get to the payable stage , i purchased home insurance in november 00 and it still has not been cleared for payment
neutral	in een recente transactie had ik eigenlijk een pot rozen bestelt maar wat werd gelevered was een pot orchideen .
neutral	de service van_de_levering was goed_en op_tijd maar ik had eigenlijk een notificatie verwacht dat u misschien mijn gekozen produkt niet meer beschikbar had .
neutral	kunt u misschien eventjes daarop reageeren , en uitleggen hoe het kwam dat_de orchideen werden geleverd in plaats van rozen .
neutral	van harte bedankt
neutral	jenny hully
neutral	this was the first time i had used figleaf . the online ordering system did not work so i rang them and they completed my order over the phone .
neutral	sadly - they delivered my order twice and took 0 lots of money !!!!
neutral	it has taken over a week to get my refund .
neutral	not happy as they took the payments from my bank immediately .
neutral	this has left me short of money !!!!!
neutral	i would not recomend my friends to the site , which is a shame really .
neutral	nota good first experience .
neutral	service good - loved the product - the safe is very sturdy and strong .
neutral	have not tested it in a fire and hopefully t ; hat will not hapen
neutral	we found the website easy to use and the choice of party_decorations vast .
neutral	unfortunately , the large 0ft dracula that was sent was ripped at the back and therefore did not stand properly for the party .
neutral	at over_£_00 we did not feel this was worth the money .
neutral	the 00 feet ghost sign was excellent value and covered a huge barn wall .
neutral	disappointed my order wasn_'_t delivered to my door as three of us were in and waiting .
neutral	it was delivered to a " neighbour " a quarter of a mile_away and i had to go and get it in really foul weather .
neutral	as i '_d paid almost £ 0 for delivery , and arranged to be in to sign for it at the time alloted i think it should have been delivered to me .
neutral	apart_from that i am very pleased with my merino_wool base_layer .
neutral	it does tend to bag and lose its shape a bit after wear , but is blissfully warm and comfortable .
neutral	ordered paint , brushes and masking tape , received brushes and masking tape but it would seem the paint doesn_'_t want to arrive !
neutral	will re review when whole order arrives .
neutral	firstly the flowers were not delivered in the selected day - courier fault apparently .
neutral	though this was followed up the following_day with flowers delivered plus chocolates .
neutral	unfortunately my son advises me the roses quickly drooped and did not last
neutral	polite letter to explain the reason for my refund
neutral	can get some great items but is expensive especially delivery
neutral	i dont like the new timeline as i can not follow the flow of things well but in general i love it
neutral	item took 00 working_days to arrive , i was getting worried so checked with on line tracker , which couldn_'_t find anything listed as going to my address although item was marked as dispatched .
neutral	even more worried now , i rang customer number and was on hold for 00_mins before i gave up , then completed query form online .
neutral	had email_confirmation that i would be contacted shortly , but had received no response to request when item arrived 0_days_later .
neutral	item is great , received well_packed but disappointed in time taken to arrive and company failure to respond to my request '_s for information .
neutral	glad i paid with paypal !!
neutral	!
neutral	i was so pleased to have my teenage_daughter on hand to help me put my photo_book together .
neutral	i am quite it literate but some aspects of the formatting , cropping , downloading and design proved tricky to make my book look as i wanted it to .
neutral	overall i like the product - but the front_cover is not exactly as i had hoped it would look - slightly off centre and some of the photos could look clearer than they do .
neutral	i also found the product quite_pricey for the size and quality .
neutral	it is a wedding present but i feel i need to buy something_else to go with it now as it '_s not_overly impressive .
neutral	order i placed was out of stock - still_waiting for its arrival , mid_january i was told straight_away .
neutral	i was offered a refund but decided my self to wait .
neutral	not sure whose fault this was but after switching to npower through_topcashback at the beginning of nov_0000 , i '_ve only just received my cash !
neutral	it also took npower from november to february this year to switch so i suspect the fault lies with them .
neutral	either way , i '_m not particularly tempted to use topcashback again & wouldn_'_t recommend it .
neutral	able to pick_up purchases really easily , so the shopping_experience is fine .
neutral	however , out of the pack of balloons that i bought i had to throw half of them away as they had holes in before even starting to blow them up .
neutral	i know they were relatively_cheap but you still expect them to work .
neutral	booking the car online was fast and esay ... however picking_up the car was not !!
neutral	!
neutral	rented a car while my own was getting fixed ...
neutral	i live in dublin so got a taxi to the airport to collect my car .
neutral	arrived at dublin_airport , to an empty desk , i had to go couple mins ( drive ) down the road to collect the car .
neutral	on arrival i had all my details with me as instructed by website , such as debit_card i booked with , drivers_license and booking voucher !
neutral	the guy on the desk informed me he could not give me the car , unless ( 0 ) i had another proof of address such as a passport or bill and ( 0 ) a €_000 deposit ... news to me !!
neutral	to cut a long_story_short , i was stranded without a dime , only my debit_card on me at 0pm on the airport road .
neutral	so had to pay for another taxi , home and back again to get what was needed .
neutral	so exhausting having to go through this carry on , while being a single mother , i had to get my child minded while i collect the car &, when the break down in communications was between the rental company and the booking website company , not me !!!
neutral	also it didn_'_t help the situation , that the guy / kid on the desk was not a bit helpful , and was pretty obnoxious !!
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered the door for my belling_cooker and it seems like the right door but now it won_'_t shut properly do not think this is down to the product but cannot be sure .
neutral	waited a long time for collection on arrival on gatwick .
neutral	pick_up timing was perfect .
neutral	a bit disappointed with the lid handle as it is hot when i cook .... and also the color on the pot hand is coming off :-(( bought a baking_tray before which i am absolutely happy with but this is a bit of let_down ...
neutral	it '_s not as nice as nespresso
neutral	when i first booked the car , i booked it from france mainland as we were heading for chamonix .
neutral	my friend told me that i should have booked from the swiss side as that is the easiest_way to get on the motorway to chamonix .
neutral	i thought i had changed the pick_up destination on the website but when we got to geneva , the desk had no record of my booking .
neutral	it took about 00_minutes to sort this out and we had to return to the french side to eventually pick_up the car .
neutral	i '_m not sure why the change wasn_'_t made on their computer and it was quite a
neutral	hassle sorting it all out !
neutral	the car was great once we had it but make_sure you know which side of geneva you need to collect the car from .
neutral	i love happy_puzzle products but their communication about delays in despatch needs to be improved .
neutral	i ordered a full bathroom for over 0k and am happy with the product and the quality .
neutral	we ordered
neutral	- left hand l shaped whirlpool shower bath with 0 jets .
neutral	it '_s wonderful but difficult to get around the screen to clean the bath .
neutral	- cube dual with quadrato head and ceiling arm .
neutral	very pretty
neutral	- quadra waterfall bath filler .
neutral	- quadra waterfall side lever basin mixer_tap .
neutral	everyone love this .
neutral	- prima soft_close toilet_seat .
neutral	does exactly_what it says on the tin !
neutral	my issue , and the reason for only giving three stars was with the lack of knowledge and near rudeness with the numerous sales_reps over the phone .
neutral	it was a more complaicated order as i was paying from overseas but they made no effort to try and find a solution .
neutral	in the end a wonderful sales agent , simon thomas from the wigan_branch provided a solution .
neutral	without him they would have lost the sale to a competitor .
neutral	the iflorist website was very slow and crashed frequently .
neutral	when the flowers arrived the bouquet looked quite sparse , i was expecting a big bouquet filled with flowers , as i was apparently receiving 00_%_off a £_00 bouquet .
neutral	i was disappointed .
neutral	i ordered a variety of miniature sprits and liquors , i paid for next_day delivery , however , they took 0_days to arrive , which was cutting it fine as i needed them for a celebration .
neutral	also when they arrived they were all sticky !
neutral	my item took over 0_weeks to arrive despite_being told at time of order it would be up to 0 working_days .
neutral	payment debited_immediately which concerned me as i '_d never used the company before .
neutral	it took around 0 e_mails to sort .
neutral	replies to my e_mails were prompt and courteous from an employee daniel who did what he could to help .
neutral	item finally arrived yesterday and i am delighted with the quality of it .
neutral	unfortunately , 0_stars deducted for delivery .
neutral	this site does offer a variety of products with good value however the customer service is poor to say the least .
neutral	delivery is shocking do not pay for priority or next_day delivery because every time i have it has come within the same length of time that you would get on the free delivery .
neutral	also when querying the delivery issue to the customer service team they didn_'_t offer much help instead just tried to fob you off .
neutral	better sites with better service is all i can say .
neutral	it all started very well until i asked a question , then it went down_hill as i was asked to hold whilst my contact went to find the answer after which i was passed from one person to the next totally confusing me .
neutral	when i asked to be returned to my original contact i was ignored with no explanation what so ever .
neutral	as i hung_up the phone the person on your end i heard her say that i was one very rude lady .
neutral	my only crime was confusion .
neutral	i ordered a fleece_jacket from sportpursuit on 00th_november for my husband '_s christmas_present its now 00th_december and its still not come .
neutral	the money came out of my bank accound on the 0nd_december .
neutral	i can find no number to ring on the website to chase it .
neutral	i emailed on 0nd_december to find out what was happening only to be told it could take up to 0_weeks .
neutral	-- since complaining i have been rung personally and my present arrived promptly so that i could give it as a christmas_present .
neutral	i am now happy with sportpursuits response to my problems .
neutral	if i '_m honest was a bit disappointed .
neutral	colours matched what i '_d ordered but the bouquet appeared smaller_than i expected so i didn_'_t think it was particularly good value for money .
neutral	on the plus_side it was delivered on time .
neutral	great product and now happy .
neutral	unfortunately , i was disappointed with the delivery arrangements .
neutral	i was emailed that it would arrive on monday , so i stayed in all day , prepared to phone the following_day when it hadn_'_t come .
neutral	tuesday '_s email said it would arrive between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00pm .
neutral	when it hadn_'_t arrived by 0 . 00 , i phoned up .
neutral	i was very disappointed as i had to miss my granddaughter '_s drama show to catch the delivery man .
neutral	at_least it did arrive then , but i wish he could have phoned to say he was going to be later than stated .
neutral	i '_m just glad i hadn_'_t had to take a day off work !
neutral	i have always used booking . com without problems and this was my first experience with hotel_direct .
neutral	i had specifically_requested 0x twin bedded rooms but on arrival at the hotel , found 0x double bedded rooms .
neutral	fortunately the hotel was able to rectify the problem immediately and the stay was superb .
neutral	i saw a copy of the request from hotel_direct to the hotel so they were telling the truth .
neutral	right product delivered but slow and with little / no_indication on dispatch or delivery date .
neutral	my experience with optegra so far .
neutral	had my first eye done on
neutral	0th_april in manchester no_problems in fact i was delighted
neutral	could read in the evening without_any glasses .
neutral	one week_later
neutral	had 0nd eye done eye was a lot more painful this time for a week
neutral	don_'_t know why .
neutral	but op itself no problem over before you know
neutral	it , i '_m on my 0rd week and my distance is not good really it '_s like
neutral	looking through a glass for my distance , and when i '_m driving
neutral	during the day the traffic lights are glowing and any lights
neutral	on cars seem to be doubling up on me thats in the daytime at
neutral	night its even worse and so distracting actually making me feel
neutral	quite sickly to be honest .
neutral	i really hope that its just early days
neutral	and my brain will adjust to the new lenses .
neutral	i go back on
neutral	saturday for a check up and am just hoping there is something
neutral	that can be done to correct my sight .
neutral	at the moment i had better
neutral	vision for distance before .
neutral	i will put another review on when
neutral	my visions better .
neutral	with a more positive_outcome .
neutral	have to say
neutral	that the staff are superb can '_t fault them .
neutral	just want a better
neutral	result .
neutral	only been trying for a week , and the food been lovely really tasty but the portions
neutral	are not big enough for me unfortunately still really hungry oh_dear .
neutral	eating extras
neutral	at the moment to fill myself up and actually putting weight on at moment .
neutral	the
neutral	breakfasts lovely but nowhere_near enough to eat .
neutral	so sorry to have to make
neutral	these comments but l '_m not a big person - so l don_'_t know how big people manage
neutral	even_though l '_ve been adding veg and salad to my meals l '_m still very hungry
neutral	i thought i had paid in full but you are asked to pay further insurance at the pick_up .
neutral	this was not explained when making the booking .
neutral	they also did not fit the machine properly they had to be forced in .
neutral	the coffee was rfar too harsh
neutral	i paid_extra for next_day delivery so the goods should have arrived on friday but they did not arrive until monday
neutral	after ordering a yard of ale and paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery , my item came damaged .
neutral	not sure if it was sent damaged or the delivery company damaged it .
neutral	there was a dint in the cardboard that matched the crease in the yard of ale .
neutral	i ordered it for a party so there wasn_'_t time to complain and send it back .
neutral	i sent off my iphone 0 in working condition to get an_email back saying that they have tested it and rated it in a non working condition as it doesnt work on any networks .
neutral	i emailed back saying it works on o0 as i have just upgarded and used the phone the same day it was sent off , they sent another email back saying they have re - tested it and it does in fact work on o0 , so finally this was then sorted and i received my money 0_days_later
neutral	i was pleased with the items which were nice quality , arrived quickly and at a good price but one of the aprons had a hole about 0 centimetre long in it which looked like it had been made with a sharp implement .
neutral	rather_than send it back i patched the hole , but i was disappointed , this shouldn_'_t have got past quality control .
neutral	i bought a dress and when it arrived it didn_'_t suit me so i package it up as asked with all the correct labels supplied , took it to the post_office and received proof of postage etc .
neutral	0_months on and still no refund .
neutral	the dress was never received by them ?
neutral	and i have posted my proof of purchase and still heard_nothing .
neutral	however everything else with boohoo was brilliant , fast delivery and very reasonable_prices .
neutral	x
neutral	staff always seem helpful but always a wait in this shop !
neutral	everytime i seem to book with wowcher , there '_s a problem .
neutral	now i '_m not sure_whether this is wowcher '_s fault or the company the booking is made with but the communication between both_parties needs to be addressed .
neutral	if the deal i '_ve paid for comes with champagne i expect champagne not sparkling_wine .
neutral	if the deal i '_ve paid for asks for a deposit of £_00 i expect to pay £_00 and no more than that .
neutral	if the holiday i book says flights from gatwick are available and the hotel is available .
neutral	that '_s what i expect , i don_'_t expect to be told otherwise .
neutral	on the other hand wowcher offers some good deals .
neutral	ordered my correct prescription but let eye was not strong_enough .
neutral	was in a rush as i was going travelling so never had time to send them back .
neutral	so just had to deal with one fuzzy eye .
neutral	at_least they were cheap .
neutral	think next time i will just go to a actual store .
neutral	would recommend tho .
neutral	no real hiccups but a few gripes :
neutral	0 .
neutral	holidayautos was based outside of the airport which i didn_'_t know and had to ask another car rep where i could find them and then walk to their office and drive back to airport to pick_up family .
neutral	0 .
neutral	only one member of staff in office , so had to wait_until he was free .
neutral	0 .
neutral	brakes on the car we had were a bit sharp and took quite some getting used to .
neutral	i had some problems and i didn_'_t like how they managed to solve them .. but next time i '_ll keep more attention .
neutral	i found the web_site fine and ordered a gift voucher for my son .
neutral	no problem but unfortunately it was sent straight_away even_though i requested it for a couple of weeks ahead on his_birthday !
neutral	took 0_days to get key
neutral	good telephone advice - easy online ordering - quick delivery - full_marks for these .
neutral	i am not sure about the quality of the product - i ordered polycarbonate anti_- bird spikes in 0 sizes .
neutral	after 0 nights the birds ( rooks ) had managed to break off one of the spikes .
neutral	i shall wait a bit longer to see if they break any more , before_deciding_whether i should have chosen stainless_steel instead .
neutral	furniture is fine , but make_sure ou protect all carpets as boxes and delivere feet are filthy .
neutral	we were advised furniture would de unpacked , it '_s not andy boxes were a nightmare to move
neutral	on the three occasions we have used rentalcars , at each location we have found the vehicle type we booked and paid for ( an suv ) was not available .
neutral	on one occasion in tampa we had to wait an_hour at the desk to find this out .
neutral	then , last_week , as the vehicle we had booked was not available , we were charged an extra $_000 . 00 for another vehicle , as that was all they had left to offer us .
neutral	so the booking_system is not really very reliable , you get what '_s left in the parking lot .
neutral	0 . it is a good website .
neutral	0 . it will be more convenient , if the website can list the fully paid and unrefundble hostels .
neutral	sometimes , the embassy requests the booking list of this kind of hostels .
neutral	the visa may not be the problem to some one .
neutral	however , this is a world wide uesed website .
neutral	0 . i cannot see the payment details .
neutral	i don_`_t know which card i used to pay for it .
neutral	it is really difficult for me to check my bills .
neutral	purchased a product in the wrong_size , rang to change and was advised that it would cost £ 0 . 00 to deliver replacement goods but also would need to pay for a courier to return the incorrect items back to the supplier .
neutral	it was two large rolls of bubble_wrap which would have cost a small_fortune to return - cheaper to keep them and learn from the lesson .
neutral	most companies deliver the revised goods and collect the incorrect items at the same time !
neutral	garden_xl had the best prices both for the products ( dog bed and separate mattress ) and the postage .
neutral	for this i give them 0 / 0 .
neutral	the only problem came when i received the email_notifying dispatch ; the link to track my parcel didn_'_t work and the order number wasn_'_t recognized so i had no idea when it was going to show up .
neutral	after about a week ( and after the review request from trustpilot !)
neutral	i thought it was about time i contacted the company to enquire as to the whereabouts of my order .
neutral	it turned_out , the items come straight from the manufacturer and there had been a delay and , in fact , the goods hadn_'_t even been posted yet .
neutral	i don_'_t mind not receiving my order when i expect it , delays happen , but i do expect to be kept_informed without me having to do the chasing , especially when gxl admitted they knew about the situation already .
neutral	however , i was pleased with the goods when they eventually turned_up , and gxl very quickly sorted_out the exchange for one of the items that was sent to me in error by the manufacturer .
neutral	these keys are shorter_than the one i have and don_'_t quite fit in the window but with a bit of effort they do sometimes work - thanks anyway
neutral	product comes on time , but even_though it has_been packed well , the cans have come through damaged and dented .
neutral	but out of 0 tins of baked_beans only 0 weren_'_t dented and the same for the tomato soup !
neutral	did they get packed in that state ?
neutral	the bottle of sherry survived without damage .
neutral	bizarre because it was all beautifully_wrapped .
neutral	the bouquet chosen was delivered in excellent time and the flowers supplied were of a good quality .
neutral	sadly there were so few flowers in the bouquet - certainly nothing like the quantity shown online , that i was embarassed when i saw them .
neutral	i would have expected better for £_00 . 00 as delivery was free .
neutral	the delivery was good , arrived on time , is exactly_what ollie wanted for his_birthday but another time i '_d get it from amazon as its only £_00 . 00 here instead of £_00 . 00 , i mean that '_s quite a difference in price .
neutral	flowers where lovely but delivery driver was very rude to my 00yr_old nan !
neutral	friendly customer service but they screwed_up with the delivery and sent to the wrong_address .
neutral	they did rectify immediately but i could have done without all the hassle .
neutral	hi you delivered on time , your website is good but the product was much_lower in quality than i thought it would be .
neutral	i found three of the hangers with problems .
neutral	if i had not been in such a rush to finish off a room i would have returned the product .
neutral	they ' re so much_cheaper_than the high_street which is great but i have one issue with them - they '_ve let_me order my product twice_now and took postage for next_day delivery and failed to inform_me the product was out of stock !
neutral	once product didn_'_t arrive i went_onto my account and under orders is where you see stock information .
neutral	i will order again as they ' re so cheap but won_'_t bother paying for next_day delivery because i have had to wait nearly 0_weeks both_times i '_ve ordered .
neutral	wish they '_d make it clear before you place order and in full_view whether product is in stock or not !
neutral	i '_d recommend them to friends though .
neutral	picture nice and clear but , surprised when i got it to find it didn_'_t fit the whole canvas , as it said it was adequate and it is not centred .
neutral	now i will have to have it reduced to fit , as it looks silly as it is .
neutral	furniture nice but quite saggy considering it '_s less_than a year_old
neutral	i was so looking_forward to receiving my order .. oscar , soft and squidgy comfort , looking great .
neutral	oscar looks good , but doesn_'_t feel good .
neutral	too hard , no squidge at all , nothing like the comfort of the showroom model .
neutral	unfortunately , i am v disappointed and would like to know if you can do something about it .
neutral	can you ?
neutral	i am sure you would prefer if your customers are happy .
neutral	the bed i bought from you is wonderful , that '_s why i trusted that the sofa would be great too .
neutral	help !
neutral	i want to love my loaf sofa .
neutral	happy christmas
neutral	sandra serlin
neutral	i think birkenstock make the most comfortable shoes in the world so , even_though the sandles do not fit the description on the rubbersole site i am sure i will still love them .
neutral	the sandles i received were birkenstock " birko - flor " made of a synthetic product for those who choose not to wear leather .
neutral	these are described on site as leather .
neutral	hence my dissatisfaction and three star rate .
neutral	i ordered a sofa , loveseat , and barstools from the website .
neutral	i saved a good amount of money due to the lower prices , no tax , and free shipping .
neutral	i wasn_'_t impressed with the shipping company and for that reason i probably will not order through furniturecart again .
neutral	they gave_me a 0 hour_window to wait for my furniture and showed up an_hour and half after i sat at home all day .
neutral	i tried to contact the company to find out when they were expected to make the delivery and ask them to give me a phone_call 00_minutes before so i could take my kids to their after school activities , spoke to the manager and was told that they did not provide that kind of service .
neutral	i had to take a risk and run my daughter to her dance .
neutral	they showed up when i was headed out to pick her up , which made me 00_minutes late picking her up and 00_minutes late for our dinner plans with friends . the sofas looked great and were in good condition .
neutral	i had to assemble the barstools and wasn_'_t as impressed with the quality of the barstools - the color was a lot darker_than_expected and there were some issues with the chair assembly and the pieces fitting correctly .
neutral	overall , it was a fairly positive_experience but i probably_won_'_t do it again .
neutral	following our stay at the ciltern hotel and restaurant , princes risborough , bucks , we were left with very mixed_feelings .
neutral	upon_arrival we were told that our room was not available as the previous guest hadn_'_t left .
neutral	we were shown to another room , but before our bags hit the ground we were whisked out again as that room wasn_'_t available either .
neutral	we were then offered our original room where we found the previous guest '_s bag awaiting_collection , his toiletries in the uncleaned bathroom and later , his pjs in the bed .
neutral	we were reluctant to open the wardrobe in case the guest was hiding inside !
neutral	the manager bustled about in a way reminiscent of basil himself , rectifying everything as quickly as he could .
neutral	we then had no key to the room and had to be escourted to and from our room until the key was returned by the previous guest .
neutral	as this didn_'_t occur until after we '_d retired for the night , the manager had to put a note on our door asking the guest not to enter .
neutral	i took the additional step of placing a chair under the door_handle too !
neutral	one final warning if you do decide to stay : when leaving your room , hide any newspapers that you are reading , as the housekeeper has a tendency to remove them from the room .
neutral	despite all of the above : great food , lovely staff , and although i don_'_t think a free drink was sufficient recompense , we needed it !
neutral	the product chosen was just what we wanted and it arrived on the date selected during the order process .
neutral	however , the automated confirmation of our order stated that we would be contacted within 00_hours .
neutral	this didn_'_t happen .
neutral	i followed up with 0 emails which were politely answered - but rather too late !
neutral	.
neutral	when i phoned the customer help line on the day the order was expected it was swiftly confirmed that the tiles were on their way .
neutral	all in all satisfactory but i would say - don_'_t make promises that you don_'_t then meet .
neutral	very pleased with order when it arrived .
neutral	delivery very slow even after i had been asked if i would accept substitutes for what was out of stock , which i declined .
neutral	very happy with the speedy delivery .
neutral	most of my products arrived in perfect_condition , except a box of flour which was broken and leaking everywhere , and a box of cereal in which the interior packaging was broken !
neutral	it would have been very helpful to have had the pick_up person give us some details as to how the car worked !
neutral	we had to spend a lot of time working out where things were and how they operated .
neutral	there was also no previous damage list so it was worrying that there was no record of problems ie scratches , blemishes etc on the body of the car .
neutral	not ideal for either the rental company or the customer !
neutral	we took pictures of things before we set off in case of later problems .
neutral	we were also told that there would be a full_tank of petrol but there was not !
neutral	far from it .
neutral	just a quarter full so we had to fill up as soon as we could before setting off .
neutral	food looks great but was delivered but said repackaged by yodel on sticky_label outside
neutral	it was christmas_present for my partner ( who has ibs )
neutral	opening package shortbread / biscuits broken , drinks were leaking over everything :-(
neutral	ilumi replaced everything delivered day after
neutral	great firm
neutral	i was very happy with my purchase apart_from the damage to the stand which had a large chip out of the bottom .
neutral	luckily this cannot be seen as it is against the wall but i would not have been able to give it as a gift due to the damage .
neutral	i contacted pro_cook and included a photo as evidence of the damage but so far have not received a reply - not very good customer_relations in my opinion .
neutral	very impressed with the service and delivery of the clothing and the quality of the superdry products is excellent .
neutral	quick refund on returned items which was fantastic .
neutral	problem was the ' collect +' service did not work as the incorrect label had been sent to me by superdry .
neutral	as it was the christmas_period i needed to return the items to ensure a speedy refund and avoid any delays , so my only option was to send via the post_office - this cost me an additional £_00 !!!!
neutral	not a happy_bunny ....
neutral	easy site to navigate and order but last delivery not as speedy as previous_orders .
neutral	i also opted for ' confirm delivery day / time ' by phone but i never received a text_message of delivery .
neutral	the confirmation of despatch arrived 0_days after delivery .
neutral	the most_recent item i have purchased , a side table , i asked if it could be delivered to the fulham road store .
neutral	i was told by the girl in the store it would be ready for me to pick it up on a particular day when in fact it wouldn_'_t be there until 0_days_later .
neutral	i never received the promised call to tell me the item was ready for collection but had to call a couple of times myself .
neutral	if these sorts of issues could be ironed_out then i would have given a higher rating as i love the products .
neutral	the item received , wall_mounted , solar_powered pir lamp , did not match the image of the item as shown on the website .
neutral	this should have been a great product with a great review but was spoiled by this mis_- match .
neutral	the customer service following my calls regarding this issue was great , but should not have been necessary .
neutral	the website images should be sorted_out !!
neutral	!
neutral	received willy_wonka suit which i was told was for a 0 - 0 year_old ref_: jmt0000000 .
neutral	firstly , photo on package shows a complete suit including black trousers .
neutral	this is misleading as only the coat ( no trousers ) is in the package with the hat separate .
neutral	size ( large ) which i was informed by your customer service was suitable for 0 - 0 year_olds .
neutral	when i phoned to say it was far too_big and would like the medium_size sending i was informed there was no more in stock .. my grandson is 0 and big for his age and the costume would have fitted myself !!!
neutral	joy of joys , i had to cut and sew the costume to fit him as he needed it for school two_days_later .
neutral	sewing is not my best talent !
neutral	overall , very disappointed with the purchase but my grandson was happy enough wearing it on the day .
neutral	have used the one near mine which is handy .
neutral	they '_ve done some work for me over the last few_years which was fine .
neutral	one time i just had a query and the guy was really helpful .
neutral	although , whenever i have a voucher they always try and come up with an excuse as to why i can '_t use it .
neutral	the last time this happened i wouldn_'_t stand for it , and now haven_'_t used them since .
neutral	time_slot for fitting of tyres was between 00 . 00am and 0 . 00pm .
neutral	having waited and waited , thinking they would arrive any minute , i finally phoned customer_services at 00 . 00pm , only to see the van_pull up outside my house .
neutral	i told the driver that i had a hair appointment booked for 0 . 00pm and had been waiting in for the past 0 hours .
neutral	job was completed within the next hour but i had to race off to hair dressers .
neutral	perhaps a courtesy_call to say that the fitter was running_late would have been useful .
neutral	the frames were awful , very plastic looking not nice at all , will_defo buy from a shop in future so i can see what i '_m buying .
neutral	it was irritating to be given a delivery slot of 0000 - 0000 hours on a friday ( might just as well simply say it will be delivered on a particular day ).
neutral	so , after being up , ready for a delivery at 0000 hours , it was particularly irritating to be telephoned about 00 . 00_hours to be told the delivery wouldn_'_t be made that day and we would have to wait_until the monday .
neutral	the irritation was increased when we received another text over the weekend to be given the same time_slot for the monday .
neutral	not good ...
neutral	i was impressed by the speediness of my purchase , however , i ordered the same size jacket that my father already has but in a different colour - but for some reason it came up very small .
neutral	i paid £ 0 . 00 for my first order , £ 0 . 00 to send it back and then another £ 0 . 00 to have a larger_size delivered .
neutral	an expensive present in the end due to postage !!
neutral	!
neutral	bought the larger bouquet , was disappointed with the amount of flowers not as big as photo .
neutral	no_problems with delivery
neutral	glasses came in a couple of weeks which was so much_better_than last time i used them which was months .
neutral	all this nonsense about " lost in the post " " chinese ny " doesn_'_t cut it .
neutral	in summary , products seem fine and cheap .
neutral	delivery is poor .
neutral	i am happy with the servise i got and how fast i got the cash :-)
neutral	the flowers took 00_hours to arrive at my friends house , and the box was battered having been in the van all day .
neutral	the courier arrived at the destination at 0 . 00_pm and was rather off hand with the recipient .
neutral	the item arrived very quickly .
neutral	however , i did have a query as to whether it was the item on the website .
neutral	i contacted customer service but i am afraid i have had no response at all
neutral	this order was easy and straightforward to process .
neutral	i had spoken to an advisor prior to placing this order and had some advice from him which i think made it easier for me to decide what package etc i needed .
neutral	only problem was it asked me for an e_- mail address whilst placing the order and the only one i have is a talk_talk e_- mail address which it said i could not use so have had to use a family_members e_- mail address for now .
neutral	i also wasn_'_t told if i could keep my current telephone_number
neutral	thank_you for the delivery of flowers to mr & mrs webster on saturday but to be honest i was a little disappointed with them .
neutral	i thought the bouquet would have been better_than it was .
neutral	trip ok ships facilities so so
neutral	easy efficent
neutral	although the flowers were very acceptable they weren_'_t what i expected .
neutral	i thought i '_d ordered a funky arrangement in a green vase !!
neutral	!
neutral	bought a samarkand gazebo £_000 . 00 , painting not so great , one of the flowers broken off , one of the flowers bent out of shape , the very top of the dome was also bent .
neutral	delivery was as quick as the money was taken !
neutral	!
neutral	i love rington '_s products and would have given a five
neutral	star_rating had i not received an_email offering free
neutral	delivery .
neutral	i had to make my order £_00 to be able to
neutral	obtain this as i think the delivery charge is very
neutral	expensive .
neutral	i think to offer free delivery the day after
neutral	i receive my goods is very annoying .
neutral	i have bought ilumi products before and i like the food .
neutral	however , i was away for 0_days & instead of yodel leaving my £_00 delivery with either one of my next doors neighbours , it was left_behind bins outside the front of my house on a busy main_road in the city .
neutral	with the terrible_weather over the last 0_days , i today found the cardboard package sodden & falling_apart .
neutral	i am unhappy with the delivery when i paid so much for the products .
neutral	i did not receive the free gloves and masks offered as safety requirements in applying the clusterflies treatment , so contacted the supplier .
neutral	although they were polite and helpful , the said items were received after several days and had a £ 0 excess postage charge as not enough stamps had been put onto the envelope .
neutral	i have contacted them with feedback and am now waiting to see if they will offer a refund for this .
neutral	been a customer for a number of yrs .
neutral	recently had a v bad reaction to vitamin_d supplements - in retrospect i probably overdosed .
neutral	i should have thought more about my actual food intake ( lots of fish = vit_d ).
neutral	if you took all the supps they recommend in their newsletter you '_d have loads of contra indication issues . how many people can_afford to see a nutritionist or dietician every time they self prescribe a supplement .. but i now think that this is necessary .
neutral	supplements are big business .
neutral	why is the walnut - butter so expensive - each tablespoon = £ 0 !
neutral	we found the products to be good value and well made , however we were assured that we would receive emails at various_stages of the despatch process and this never happened which_meant we had to ring up to find out when our order was likely to be delivered .
neutral	apart_from that , we would recommend bride and groom_direct to other couples as there is a wide_range of product to suit all tastes .
neutral	we stayed at villa tomeu in puerta pollensa for the month of april_0000 .
neutral	we had a few problems the first week and villa_plus staff visited frequently during the first week until the problems were resolved to their satisfaction .
neutral	the problems could only be partially resolved as the villa_itself was in need of attention - poor insulation , leaky windows , cockroach repellent in every cupboard - all of which we were told were acceptable to villa_plus staff and was what we could expect in a majorcan home .
neutral	after the initial week and no further visits from villaplus staff , we settled down to our holiday .
neutral	the villa was very spacious . the pool_area was lovely .
neutral	the equipment supplied by villaplus - the table_tennis , pool_table were very good .
neutral	the cleaning and maintenance was carried_out as per the description .
neutral	we were in the villa for one month sheets and towels were changed regularly but duvet_covers were not .
neutral	the villa was in a good location for shops and restaurants , the beach and the town square of puerta pollensa .
neutral	this was a good introduction for us to living and self - catering for one month and let us see what we could expect from this type of holiday .
neutral	i would look for a more modern villa or apartment in future .
neutral	the free_samples of material were great and prompted me to order from blinds_0go .
neutral	the prices also were great .
neutral	however the first time i pulled the roller_blind chord , it snapped , it was repairable but i didn_'_t expect that to happen .
neutral	the plastic knob on the roman_blind fell_apart the first time that i tried to pull it , it split into two .
neutral	i have repaired it but i know it will break again .
neutral	i will probably need to buy something_else or glue the existing knob together .
neutral	i am therefore disappointed with this aspect and would have been prepared to pay a few extra pounds to have decent quality pull chords .
neutral	please take these comments seriously , i will be warning my friends about the poor quality of the chords .
neutral	it is the first time that i have ordered from your company but i am not sure_whether i would do so again .
neutral	shower arrived and i arranged for plumber to fit it .
neutral	he couldn_'_t get it to give hot_water , so paid him for fitting and had to then get mira engineer in , after replacing 0 bits and fiddling around with the workings , engineer eventually got it working , obviously no charge .
neutral	we did discuss returning the faulty shower , but of course i had paid £ for fitting , so couldn_'_t really do that .
neutral	left with a shower , which i don_'_t feel performs any better_than the much_cheaper model it replaced !
neutral	!
neutral	not happy !
neutral	my friend was moving to america so i wanted to make a book of memories for her to take .
neutral	it was hard_work and took me 0 attempts to make .
neutral	hard to chose which photo goes where .
neutral	however when the book came it was great and she loved it .
neutral	however looking at other_sites .. mine was overpriced .
neutral	i could have got the same booker cheaper elsewhere .
neutral	i ordered flowers for a friends 00th as part of a present from her work_mates .
neutral	flowers delivered did not represent the picture of flowers i had ordered .
neutral	i choose an arrangement which did not have lilies as my friend does not like them but the flowers delivered had lilies , the amount of flowers delivered were less_than half of what was in the picture and the quality of some of the roses were not fresh had bad bis on petals .
neutral	i have sent a complaint to customer_services with a picture of arrangement delivered and the reply i got back was that the display met their expectations .
neutral	i have written back to them explaining as a customer the display did not meet my expectations and am waiting on the response .
neutral	i am very embarassed as i had been given the job to order the flowers as a surprise for my friends birthday .
neutral	we used these for our_wedding thank_you cards , really fast delivery however some of them couldn_'_t be used as they had white spots on the front , luckily we ordered more than we needed , all the rest are perfect and looked great !
neutral	i ordered on line easily , one evening but when i realised that delivery could take a few_days and i wanted it earlier , i rang to cancel at 0 . 00 the start of the next working day .
neutral	as my order hadnt been processed there was no problem to cancel the order .
neutral	however , a few_days_later , the item still arrived !
neutral	i didnt have the time or_inclination to bother to have to return it but was disappointed in the disregard of my cancellation .
neutral	saying that , the item is of good quality and the delivery time was quicker_than i expected .
neutral	these glasses are a disapointment ...
neutral	i did buy the cheep ones but they are indeed very clumsy and functional and the lenses smudge so quickly ... much more than any glasses before .
neutral	i have reverted to my old light ones even_tho they are held together with a safety_pin and have lost their nose guard .
neutral	sorry !
neutral	the service was great and concept brilliant .
neutral	i think these are too cheep to be much more than emergency glasses .
neutral	steaks very good not at all tough , but very disappointed that some use buy dates so soon including next_day , ended_up throwing some away so a waste of money ..
neutral	delivery was very good on the expected day and kept very cold in ice and packing .
neutral	the whole buying experience was perfect apart_from quite slow delivery .
neutral	i ordered treats , so it really didn_'_t matter too much , but if someone needed an item quite urgently , this would be an issue .
neutral	purchased the butterfly breeze bouquet as a present from my daughter following an operation ..
neutral	the flowers were excellently_packed and as_described .
neutral	delivered on the specified day , beautiful colourful bouquet however , disappointed that 0 yellow_roses each had a brown petal on delivery and within 0_days 0 germini - banana had died .
neutral	this was not a cheap bouquet so somewhat disappointed
neutral	i am using the online news service .
neutral	the articles are good and ballanced .
neutral	however , some of the news pieces are not replaced flor days and the selection of news items is very short ,
neutral	i have sent my comments to bbc few_times and have never received a reply , even an_automated " thank_you ".
neutral	the trainees were very happy with the concept .
neutral	the only_negative_point is that the bracelet was a bit too large , especially for women so that they didn_'_t dare to wear it .....
neutral	but even for men it could have been a little_bit less large .
neutral	for the quality , we only have 0_weeks experience ... let '_s see if it resists on the longer term .
neutral	unfortunately the product lasted just for one shower and then it split - so sorry , but would not recommend .
neutral	i have ordered here before but this time wasn_'_t happy .
neutral	the delivery man tossed the box in the air !!!
neutral	and i upgraded for more blossoms but they arrived in 0 separate bunches rather_than one large bunch .
neutral	just about to order another bouquet again , fingers_crossed .
neutral	when i purchased my oakley_sunglasses as a present for my husband thought the glasses would of came in a nice glasses case .
neutral	when they came the holder was something you get from primark i wont_be using your site again sorry .
neutral	the deals are good but once you have purchased them they often end very shortly_after purchase .
neutral	this has not worked for me .
neutral	hi ,
neutral	unfortunately my eyes are still not " wet , wet , wet " suffering from dry_eye syndrome from the laser_treatment and despite optical_express optician '_s best effort nothing seems to be working .
neutral	have been suggested to try flax seed oil but someone_else said bilberry supplements are better .
neutral	didn_'_t know whether to try visionace or something along those lines .
neutral	anyone had the same problem and used a supplement that has worked ?
neutral	if so , please let_me know
neutral	by the next_day , the roses were already dying .
neutral	not as much green as the picture .
neutral	bought sage software .
neutral	download and discs arrived after a little delay .
neutral	staff pleasant .
neutral	the helpline answer the phone much_faster_than sage , but do not seem to have any knowledge on accounts and have to look everything up !
neutral	did not phone me back when promised .
neutral	the service of the collection at the airport_terminal , offered when dropping_off the car was great in principle however we did have to stand in the rain for 00_minutes and make another call to check if they were on their way .
neutral	all the staff are friendly and polite , but £_00 to stand in the rain was a little much , everything else excellent .
neutral	i really wish they had another piece of card attached to the back , or the place card was a folded piece of card with design on one side , i will now have to make some kind of stand for the back of each one ;(
neutral	easy to use site .
neutral	used this company as needed fast delivery and because the website showed whether products were in stock or not ..... or so i thought .
neutral	i ordered my envelopes on sat ( which were stated as ' in stock ') and thought that was the process finished .
neutral	picked_up an_email on monday_afternoon advising that the envelopes weren_'_t in stock .
neutral	could have ended_up in a difficult situation as i only picked_up the email by_chance ( and it had gone to junk ).
neutral	was told that they had tried to phone me but no - one had left a message .
neutral	as it was i was able to choose a different envelope and they were delivered quickly .
neutral	but was not as smooth as it should have been and if you are going to give a stock check on the site , please ensure this is updated or else there is no point .
neutral	had i know the item was not in stock i would not have put the order in .
neutral	have been advised by the recipient that the product is good .
neutral	easy to order and arrived quickly .
neutral	i thought the price was competitive but adding the delivery made it expensive .
neutral	not sure i '_d order again for this reason but its for a special_occasion this time .
neutral	easy to find offers and quick offers
neutral	we were disappointed absence of possibility to reduce the payment sum in case of return the car earlier per one day , and we paid already for two_weeks of rent .
neutral	but sale to us of additional navigating system has_been the most unpleasant , because our car has its own navigator .
neutral	the representative of the company on a pick_up place has cancelled an unnecessary option , it was nice .
neutral	but it has occurred only because we have called him and have asked to examine the car .
neutral	if we had drive_away , we should pay for system , unnecessary for us
neutral	i ordered 00 small science badges at 00p_each .
neutral	the p_&_p was almost £ 0 making my order much more_expensive than necessary .
neutral	i won_'_t use this company again as a colleague had same problem with chess club badges , wrote a letter about the high p_&_p costs but heard_nothing back .
neutral	took me ages to order and i had to contact linens_direct as i got so fed_up of it .
neutral	i know it is not my computer either .
neutral	the goods i ordered were in stock and what i wanted , but if you want them quickly you will be disappointed !
neutral	i paid £ 0 . 00 for express delivery ( clue is in the title ) rather_than go with free standard delivery .
neutral	i ordered on 00th_march at 0 . 00pm and only
neutral	received an_email on 00st_march saying that my order had been dispatched .
neutral	i received it on the 00 march .
neutral	any other site i have used and paid express delivery for always deliver within 0_days .
neutral	i wasted 0 . 00 when i could have opted for free delivery and got it the same time !!
neutral	!
neutral	the admin_team answered my complaint as follows_:
neutral	' thank_you for your email .
neutral	the express delivery service that you opted for unfortunately does not
neutral	reduce the amount of time that an order takes to process , it reduces the
neutral	time from point of despatch to delivery .
neutral	we aim to despatch orders within
neutral	0 - 0 working_days after the order is received .
neutral	the £ 0 . 00 charge covers the courier cost for next working day delivery
neutral	from point of despatch which is the service that you will receive .
neutral	i am
neutral	sorry that you thought that the delivery would be faster .'
neutral	i am not too satisfied with this service !
neutral	!
neutral	products great ., prices good , but use of independent delivery company means my last three deliveries have been thrown over my fence into my backgarden , damaging plants , and getting soaked in the rain !
neutral	luckily amazon package products well .
neutral	when i emailed a complaint , i received no response .
neutral	i would like to say i had no_problems with this purchase however that is not the case .
neutral	the tanker turned_up to deliver the oil & start of with he didn_'_t ring the bell .
neutral	it took my dogs to tell me he was standing in the front_garden .
neutral	he then put the oil in & when he finished i was then told he had put to much in as there was a fault with the pump .
neutral	he said that the company would be in touch .
neutral	the company then called me to inform_me that i was going to be charged for the oil they had made the mistake for or they would arrange to collect it .
neutral	the price for the access oil i didn_'_t order was ridiculous compared to what i had just paid so i asked them to collect it , surely the driver knew there was a problem with the pump so it comes across there trying it on .
neutral	i am still currently_waiting for them to arrange_collection of their oil .
neutral	first time i used homebase website to place an order for my mum the website kept playing up , but the order went through i booked a date for the delivery and got my order acknowledgement .
neutral	the date came for the delivery and i couldn_'_t track my order as the homebase website was once again playing up .
neutral	so after a few hours of waiting in - phoned customer_services to be told my order hadn_'_t processed and i wouldn_'_t be getting it in my choosen date .
neutral	they did refund the delivery charge and the order was booked in for another delivery date .
neutral	the order did arrive on that date
neutral	the dress came very quickly in the post but the crown that came with it , the gems had fallen out and i didnt have time to send item back so had to superglue them back on , not really happy considering the price i paid .
neutral	paid_extra for next_day delivery but it didnt arrive next_day didnt bother to complain had to rearrange delivery , got email to advise on new delivery day and order came on that day , very helpful delivery driver no further problems
neutral	i found using the website difficult with some fields not working until other parts of information were completed and the order placement did not flow smoothly .
neutral	just a word of warning if you are shopping around for this blind as it is called different things on different sites but the picture is exactly the same .
neutral	i thought i was ordering silver grey and was disappointed when the pewter blind turned_up .
neutral	my mistake so nothing i can do now but frustrating .
neutral	they didn_'_t get back to me about poor product quality , after i emailed them .
neutral	ordered lenses on 00st_january .
neutral	only arrived today 00th_february .
neutral	other than dat lenses look good an was easy to place the order
neutral	the delivery service was brilliant but i wasn_'_t impressed with the size of the bouquet that i ordered .
neutral	it was very different to the image on the website .
neutral	i think the pictures on the website are very misleading .
neutral	on the website it says next_day delivery 0_days_later it actually arrives !
neutral	fair_enough price is cheap but only_thing going for this company
neutral	the clothes i bought were all excellent but i paid for next_day delivery and did not receive it the next_day !
neutral	very disappointing as usually very good service is provided
neutral	i really liked the range of products on offer and everything came quickly and in good condition .
neutral	my only_concern was that everything seemed to be wrapped in copious_amounts of plastic film and bubblewrap .
neutral	i would like to see recyclable alterantives being used which would fit better with the ethos of healthy , organic and sustainable produce .
neutral	on the whole , the experience wasn_'_t too bad , but i felt like i needed to chase orange a bit , and my phone wasn_'_t worth as much as i was quoted .
neutral	using the website and finding out how much my phone was worth went well , and the bag to send my phone back in was posted to me quickly .
neutral	however , i then realised i had to pay to insure my phone in the post , which cost me £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i checked to see whether my phone had been received and the post_office tracker said it had , however , i then received a text from orange advising me to send my phone in quickly if i still wanted to recycle it .
neutral	i then had to email them to check they '_d received it , which they had .
neutral	an unnecessary hassle !
neutral	then it took them several days to get back to me with a revised_offer .
neutral	the original offer had been £_000 for an iphone 0 .
neutral	they came back with £_000 . 00 , claiming that there were scratches on the screen .
neutral	given that i '_d had the phone for over two years , i would put this down to general wear and tear , but because i '_d already paid £ 0 . 00 to post the thing to them , i wasn_'_t going to refuse their offer to have to pay to post it to someone_else !
neutral	in the end , despite_being quoted £_000 , i really got £_000 . 00 (£_000 . 00 - postage_costs of £ 0 . 00 ).
neutral	a bit_disappointing .
neutral	however , the money went into my account within a couple of days , which was good .
neutral	i must_say i am happy with the quality of the delivery .
neutral	however , way too expensive .
neutral	i rang alpha_rooms to book a holiday and flight to dubrovnik in july .
neutral	all booked and confirmed and paid £_000 for flights and extras with hotel to be paid on arrival .
neutral	was happy with everything until 0 separate emails arrived from monarch and alpha_rooms .
neutral	monarch had only received £_000 . 00 from me but alpha had received £_000 .
neutral	rang for an explanation and was told that the prices has changed since i was quoted .
neutral	was then told that alpha_rooms keep the difference .
neutral	would have been better to book directly with monarch as i usually do .
neutral	the holiday has yet to take place so can '_t comment further just hope my experience is more positive !
neutral	i '_m disappointed with the quality the photo looks fuzzy and small frame for the cost .
neutral	i '_ve_used other photo sites and it tells you if the quality is good , fair or bad !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered quite late on a friday and the flowers were delivered around 00 ish on the saturday which is excellet .
neutral	the reason for 0_stars is purely the bunch of flowers themselves .
neutral	they were pitiful and for the first time from serenta i felt they were most definitely not worth the money i paid for them .
neutral	the flowers looked like a non - professional had thrown them together .
neutral	i was embarrased and disappointed .
neutral	bought a pair of north_face mittens .
neutral	postage was £ 0 . 00 tracked courier guaranteed delivery with an_hour_window .
neutral	was told they would be delivered on 00th_jan but they never turned_up .
neutral	couldn_'_t get any answer by ringing or by email from e_- outdoor .
neutral	got an_email this morning to say the courier would come today which they duly did , but yesterday was a totally wasted day when it needn_'_t have been .
neutral	so a tainted first experience .
neutral	lovely runner rug with a great price but i had problems with the courier when they had changed the address to a wrong addresse such as it was addressed to the village primary_school the invoice from the seller was correct .
neutral	i did not receive the runner another 0_days_later .
neutral	site not always customer friendly .
neutral	i '_m hoping that things improve now the site has_been changed i get e_-_mails offering discounts when buying books , but the site doesn_'_t always accept the discount_codes .
neutral	the prices can change whilst you ' re in the middle of ordering and it '_s rather annoying if you don_'_t pay attention all the time .
neutral	the delivery times can be a bit hit and miss . good varity of books and reasonable_prices saves the day ,
neutral	disappointed that after chasing 0 times nobody had the courtesy to return our call as to why we only had half our order .
neutral	just an_apology for the problem with our delivery would have been fine .
neutral	0 beanbags ordered on 0th_december at a 00_%_discount - immediate payment taken on my credit_card .
neutral	the offer stated delivery in 0 - 0_weeks .
neutral	one turned_up on 00th_december so checked the website to see another one was also posted the same day but still appeared to be in the mail sorting_office .
neutral	as it was christmas allowed until january and checked tracking again .
neutral	beanbag apparently still in sorting_office .
neutral	0rd bean_bag stated it was going to be sent week_commencing 0 - 0 - 00 , emailed infurm on 0th_january to ask for update on my order .
neutral	infurn repsonded 0 - 0 - 00 by phone and left message on my answerphone to say look at tracking they have sent 0 and one will be sent next week , if i need anything further send another email .
neutral	i had checked the tracking so , i emailed again 0 - 0 - 00 to say please can you investigate missing parcel as it hasn_'_t left sorting_office , when checking website the delivery of the 0rd beanbag had been changed to 00 - 00 - 00 , this date had passed and was different to that originally stated on the order tracking website and different to that stated on answerphone_message .
neutral	i have not had a reply to my 0nd email and have not received my other 0 beanbags .
neutral	watch out folks - you may think you are getting 00_%_off the price , but you also may not receive 00_% of your ordered items .
neutral	the bean_bag is great so hope you can deliver the other 0 i ordered soon , if not please can you provide a refund .
neutral	i am not prepared to wait months like the other_reviewers .
neutral	update - thanks valerie for speedy reply to trust_pilot review - pink bean_bag has now arrived , still_awaiting one red beanbag if you can give me any further info on that one it would be much_appreciated .
neutral	update 0 - red bean_bag arrived mid feb after valerie arranged to send another in the post - agreed one lost in postal_system .
neutral	always use ace -_fx for delivery of cash without_any_problems but try ordering a euro card to save taking cash abroad .
neutral	ace could not respond and rejected this request , therefore the account was debited twice for £ 0000 and we are still_awaiting or this money to be returned to the account which was rejected by ace which was their fault because of post codes and house numbers no apologies have been made ,
neutral	do we try next week to order a euro card and hope our money arrives back into our account .
neutral	good value for quality pet products and waa really impressed with how quickly my order was processed and delivered - great
neutral	nice tea but i paid £ 0 for 0st_class delivery and it took about 0_days to arrive .
neutral	my daughter has just informed me that the wrong_size was sent so the item will be sent back
neutral	the tyres i was very happy with they are if a high_standard and the person_who came to fit them was friendly and polite .
neutral	however the member off staff arrived after the given times slot which was between half 0 and 0 .
neutral	he arrived just after one .
neutral	this was an inconvenience because he came to my work and i had to arrive hours earlier for my shift because that was the only times slot available to me .
neutral	once the member of staff finished his job he told me he has not fitted my spare_wheel back under my car because it was too " stiff ".
neutral	although days earlier my spare was taken off by a friendly passenger who helped_me and tightened it using no tools so how come a mechanic could not do this job ?
neutral	i don_'_t know how to fit it so it is still currently sat in my boot .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t have particularly minded but i paid over_£_000 which isn_'_t cheap so i therefore expected the job to be carried_out properly because after all i chose to go to kwickfit because according to your advert " you will be amazed_at what we can do " but this is not how i felt .
neutral	the process started off very well , good communication , calls and emails answered_promptly then it went_downhill after we had paid the £_000 admin_fee .
neutral	we needed a car desperately and chose this site because of the competitive_prices and the stated delivery time of 0 - 00 days .
neutral	it turns_out that this delivery time is misleading as the 00 day cooling_off period and the time it takes for the finance to be completed is not mentioned until you are well into the process .
neutral	i had to chase for my finance paperwork to be completed , once this was done i then had an_email to tell me my car would be delivered to the supplier on a certain_date .
neutral	this date came and went and i heard_nothing .
neutral	i emailed and telephoned my designated sales_advisor and had no reply .
neutral	every time i phoned she was on another call or not at her desk and i had no reply to emails .
neutral	after 0_days i finally got through to her to be told the car would be with the supplier by the end of the week .
neutral	i got an_apology for the delay in delivery of the car but no explanation for not replying to my calls or emails (' the emails must of gone into my junk_folder ') the next_day it got better again , i had a call from the admin_team to tell me my car was ready and will be delivered in 0_days !
neutral	it was delivered on time , just what i ordered and very happy with it .
neutral	it is a shame that the customer service was such a let_down as everything else was perfect , customers should always be kept up to date when going through a purchase such as this
neutral	if it is in stock , great .
neutral	if it is a back order for a kiefer product , then order a size_bigger as your child will have grown in the 0_months it will take to arrive .
neutral	don_'_t_believe the first , second or third delivery date you receive .
neutral	great products unfortunately the choose to use yodel who never seem to find the correct delivery address .
neutral	i have had 0 deliveries in less_than one month and both were delivered to the wrong_address .
neutral	suggest a change of courier .
neutral	this is a good site but not suitable for the non - technical .
neutral	i wanted to be able to update everything myself but still have to employ someone to do the jpegs and links .
neutral	as above good service but poor quality of flowers ( ie not very fresh and overpriced ) arrangement was £_00 and the quantity of flowers in arrangement were very small ie was very small .
neutral	the reicher shoes were lovely , felt hand made as stated and colours were correct .
neutral	but one thing the price - really expensive and i expected them to be cheaper online than in a shoe shop = yet it was cheaper in a little shoe shop in west kirby where many of the ' we won the war for you ' parade live .
neutral	a pity the price not reduced
neutral	there were 0 more styles in this shop and they were all cheaper_than online = and i got to try on styles and several sizes in each ,
neutral	hi it was my first visit to your web_site wasn_'_t quite sure what i was doing didn_'_t understand some of the lingo didn_'_t find it easy to follow .
neutral	when i was sent cewe book to review i could not edit it in any way i then just went a head and ordered it not being entirely_satisfied .
neutral	i am happy with it but it could have been better .
neutral	barbara
neutral	i am very happy with the sales side of this company but not very impressed with the training i had never touched a nail before and was advised to do a sculpting course of which cost 000_pound this was around sep_0000 i have not even sent my first set of nails yet and have been on another nail_course and passed all my exams so i am now fully qualified but no thanks to essential_nails
neutral	wouldn_'_t buy from them cos of the above
neutral	ordering and delivery where very good , but the comments i put about the actual order i '_ve got no idea if they even took any notice or even acknowledgement considering this is the second time i have ordered this particular part , and now they have the cheek to send me a flipping survey , although it is an_independent one !
neutral	0_days_later still not received payments i banks do it in 0 hours why the excessive delay .
neutral	i am very pleased with the quality of my new car_mats - lovely black with red_trim matching my huyundai coupe black_leather seats with red_trim .
neutral	however , the website says these mats are suitable for coupe models 0000 - 0000 ( mine is 0000 ) and the holes in mats to secure them in the footwell are in the wrong place !
neutral	however , they dont move_around and look pretty_damn smart - so not a problem .
neutral	good quality product but not quite right on the fitting side - thanks
neutral	i was buying a jigsaw as a gift and wanted to include a message - who the parcel was from .
neutral	i e_mailed and asked as the website only included space for delivery instructions , i was assured that the message would be included _ it was not .
neutral	my uncle then had to call the company to ask you had sent the parcel_ i suppose 0 more puzzle than_expected , but suggest the on line facility enables gift messages in future .
neutral	i was a little disappointed when i saw the flowers especially as they were to celebrate the birth of a new granddaughter .
neutral	i chose the bundle of joy arrangement but they did not look as nice or have as many flowers as the picture_shown on your site .
neutral	previous post in error , thought it was in relation to airport_parking - travel_insurance was for childs application - on line application is ok if no medical underwriting required .
neutral	disagreed with underwriting decision , extra premium for trivial , inactive medical_condition .
neutral	paid for policy terms and conditions but they did not arrive prior to trip or following trip .
neutral	products are of good quality .
neutral	sometimes difficult to redeem voucher .
neutral	wowcher e_-_mails not always given enough time to redeem .
neutral	( if in hospital or away on holiday / working ).
neutral	e_- mail queries not answered if the above happens and wowcher has lapsed ,
neutral	would have been 0_stars apart_from the courier service woodyatt use .
neutral	very impressive and rare , free sample service was quick and efficient but because of the inflexibility and poor customer service from the courier ( team c aka rdm aka express logistics !)
neutral	a further 0 day delay on receiving my order .
neutral	i have not been able to get nthe squirell light to work it won_'_t light up ?
neutral	but am happy with my other ornament
neutral	quite happy with the main product and speed of delivery , but unfortunately the manufacturer had changed the item : this hadn_'_t been reflected in the product description .
neutral	in essence , we '_d chosen the item because the ' freebie ' it came with made it good value compared to other_sellers .
neutral	unfortunately , the freebie item was no_longer included .
neutral	when i contacted customer_services , they were great , apologised and assured me that they would contact the manufacturer , who would send the ' missing ' item directly .
neutral	this was followed the next_day by another email_confirming that the item would be sent , but then by yet another email the day after , telling us that the product had been changed and no_longer came with the freebie .
neutral	no offer was made of a partial_refund or other recompense , which was disappointing , and i got no further reply when i emailed to complain .
neutral	a shame , as up to that point was happy with the service .
neutral	easy website , competitive_prices & excellent delivery , thank_you
neutral	im still_waiting for my travel documents to be posted .
neutral	booked on the 0th of april still no sign of them .
neutral	paid_extra for them to be posted out to me .
neutral	although goods were really nice , delivery man rang bell but did not wait for door to be opened but left goods on front step in full_view of road .
neutral	the quality is ok , but specifically stated car type and year of manufacture and the do not fit , i have has to force them in which means they are curled up at side
neutral	lovely products but i '_ve found the wait a little excessive .
neutral	if they can speed this up somewhat then i would be much happier with the service .
neutral	on the day i ordered the puzzle there was an advert in the paper giving a discount but as i didn_'_t have the code i paid full price rather_than the offer price .
neutral	i ordered christmas lights from here as they were in stock on site ( and on amazon site ) but then received email_saying they weren_'_t .
neutral	this said they were very quick to refund the money .
neutral	some of the lights didn_'_t work on one set i received but was overall ok .
neutral	not sure i would use these again ... probably just stick to the local supplier .
neutral	easy to book online and good level of cover for quote but i haven_'_t received my insurance pack that i paid_extra for , so now got to arrange to get it printed out somehow as i haven_'_t got a printer at home .
neutral	i found purchasing the course and signing_up very easy through e_- careers .
neutral	i do favour online courses due to the flexible learning option they provide .
neutral	i found prince0 slightly difficult to maneuver especially when required to refer to manuals / learning aides etc .
neutral	i also had a technical_issue where i would sit a test an prior to it recording my score , i would be logged out of the course and therefore required to sit it again .
neutral	from the online forum i found i wasn_'_t the only one experiencing this issue so hopefully it will be resolved soon :-) good intro to project_management .
neutral	i was sent complete wrong_size to what i ordered then was left with no outfit for my daughter to dress up in for book day .
neutral	not happy and won_'_t be using again .
neutral	useful as an_instant credit gainer but somewhat on the dear side when it comes to charges .
neutral	ordering online was easy and prices were great .
neutral	the actual delivery was another matter .
neutral	whilst the labelling was all correct , when i opened the parcel the actual contents were from holland &_barrett .
neutral	i contacted pet_supermarket and , whilst their customer service was very polite and friendly , it took another 0_days before i received my correct order .
neutral	it was my first and - most highly likely - my last purchase from pet_supermarket .
neutral	very easy to register and the decision was really quick , as was the transfer .
neutral	the only thimy i didn_'_t realise was they took the repayment as soon as there '_s money in your account instead of a fixed date .
neutral	left me short again but i will definitely keep them in mind if i need to borrow again .
neutral	after using your online booking i would have the following comments and suggestions :
neutral	i did call your customer_care for some help after booking my ticket online .
neutral	the choice given asked for the telephone_number i used to book .
neutral	this is confusing for someone_who booked online and of course my home telephone_number was not recognised by the system .
neutral	when i finally got through customer_care for assistance i got an_email with a temporary password , but the font was too small for mature customers .
neutral	i also suggest that cost difference are highlighted against baggage allowances .
neutral	this may have bearing for the customers to change the ticket class at start of booking .
neutral	both , final cabin and plane baggage_allowance as well as airport arrival time should be highlighted at the end of the booking .
neutral	your customer service staff was very patient and polite .
neutral	i hope the above comments and suggestions will be of assistance to your service improvement .
neutral	regards ,

neutral	i have used beauty_bay for quite a few orders and have always had quick correct orders , until this last one !
neutral	ordered shampoo , conidtioner and hairspray and was delivered the wrong hairspray , when contacting customer_services i got a quick email_saying they were dealing_with it and haven_'_t heard_anything for over 00 days now !
neutral	i required the order for my holidays and will now have to go without it !
neutral	very disappointed
neutral	i never received a confirmation_email , despite_emailing directly to ask for one , making it difficult to know if the order was definitely arriving .
neutral	my friend said they were lovely and she was very happy with them but i needed some confirmation that they were going to arrive .
neutral	i was very pleased with how quick it was to order the flowers on the website for my mam '_s birthday , however when the flowers came two of the carnations were quite brown around the egdes and looked a little withered , also some of the leaves were very brown and damaged , therefore i was very disappointed with the quality , the flowers weren_'_t very expensive but i still wouldn_'_t of expected them to be of this quality , it has slightly put me off from ordering again .
neutral	shoes arrived late due to mis_- delivery by parcel_force .
neutral	shoes described as white are in fact light cream and are narrower in width than usually made by ecco .
neutral	however i have decided to keep them for a light summer shoe .
neutral	the process was fairly straightforward if a little longwinded .
neutral	you get e_mails saying your goods have arrived , then they ` re being checked ( and if any are not acceptable - they don_`_t return them or let you know , you have to check yourself !).
neutral	the prices they pay are not mega but if you want to get_rid of stuff and actually earn some money for it then it `_s ok .
neutral	as usual the viovet price was the best for the dog_food i ordered .
neutral	unfortunately the delivery service was rubbish and i ended_up arranging for someone to be at home for three_days in a row .
neutral	the viovet email informed me that the delivery would be the day after dispatch , the citylink tracking_link informed me it would be the day after that and when it didn_'_t arrive that day the tracking_information told me the same as the day before .
neutral	eventually it arrived but i won_'_t be ordering again .
neutral	access to my house is through a doorway from the street and there is nowhere_else to leave packages .
neutral	had i missed the delivery twice i would have had to pay an extra £ 0 + for another attempt so i will regrettably go to another_supplier who use a delivery service where i can collect the parcel myself if i am not at home .
neutral	me and my partner absolutely loved the villa - we had few problems with the holiday overall .
neutral	the maid service was poor , we couldn_'_t use the kitchen as the smell was so bad and thousands of ants !
neutral	we where informed bed sheets would be changed twice a week , however they where not changed at all when the maid visited .
neutral	considering only one bedroom out of the four , and one bathroom out of the three had been used i expected a little more from the maid .
neutral	we had to check out at 00am and our flight wasn_'_t until 00 : 00 , i spoke to the rep who stated we could go to a hotel which villa_plus had teamed up with and use their pool and toilet facilities but no way to get a shower etc , she told us to ring around local apartments but said " she couldn_'_t suggest anywhere for us "
neutral	so we ended_up paying an extra €_000 for a day in a hotel - it '_s a lot of money to be pulling out at the end of a holiday when we had already paid over_£ 0000 for the two of us for the week .
neutral	also the cost of taxi from the villa to the hotel just added stress .
neutral	i think to improve the service villa_plus should check the flight times and give an option of paying to stay past the check out time .
neutral	also do not pay the £_00 for the welcome_pack , we got a loaf of bread , bottle of water , little packs of butter , a bag of pasta and a small jar of tomato_sauce for the pasta and a very cheap bottle of red_wine .
neutral	other than that the villa was lovely , and our holiday overall was fab !!
neutral	:)
neutral	i was thrilled to finally find some suitable fit_flops but although ordering on line was fast and easy the website kept breaking_down .
neutral	i called the office the next_day but i had no apology and was more or less told i '_d made the payment incorrectly which i know was not the case .. had i not wanted the product quickly i would have cancelled my order .
neutral	i '_ve ordered from here before and as far as i '_m a where there was no_problems with the flowers , i was notified when they were out for delivery and delivered .
neutral	however my most_recent order meant that the flowers arrived on saturday and they are already dead and i wasn_'_t notified that they had arrived until the next_day !
neutral	!
neutral	we ordered by post as we have moved_house and no broadband available .
neutral	quoted new address on order but ss sent items to old address
neutral	called to talk about a holiday i had seen online the member of staff was very rude saying that offer is unavailiable ' shock ' they never are he then said you either want it or you don_'_t simple as .
neutral	i then put the phone down as this was so rude .
neutral	i checked online all that week the same deal was coming up .
neutral	i call again the man on the phone was very nice but yet again that offer isn_'_t available .
neutral	it wasn_'_t because it hadn_'_t been updated as i '_d seen the same details of that holiday for 0_weeks .
neutral	i did eventually book a holiday .
neutral	i was told i would be able to or book my flight seats once i had been emailed my info .
neutral	i got this went to book my seats and guess_what you can '_t do it .
neutral	i have ordered several_times and always been very pleased .
neutral	on this occasion the picture on the website compared to the delivered item was disappointing .
neutral	the recipient was pleased but i thought it was not worth the monies_paid .
neutral	i am sorry as i always recommend and have been delighted in the past .
neutral	i '_ve been kept waiting 00_minutes + the last three follow_up appointments i '_ve been to - not good when you ' re on a lunch_break !
neutral	the last appointment i had to abandon after being kept waiting over half an_hour .
neutral	convinient appointments are very hard to come by - there are no evening or weekend timeslots and i often have to wait weeks ( only to then be kept waiting half an_hour in the waiting room !).
neutral	to make an_appointment you have to contact the central call_centre - not the local office - such a pain as they don_'_t have access to the same number of appointments as the branch .
neutral	all that said , the staff and service are fantastic - as long as you don_'_t have a 0 - 0 job to go to !
neutral	sometimes good other times bad their baggage_allowance is crap and they charge alot for extra baggage .
neutral	flight prices are good and basic just what you need fro a short flight
neutral	my first order with this company , spent nearly_£_00 , prices good and order delivered promptly .
neutral	unfortunately the cap had come open on a bottle of shampoo , due to insufficient packing , most of the bottle was in the box .
neutral	naturally i disposed of the box and emailed customer service to advise what had happened .
neutral	they emailed back saying they wanted a photo , i replied and said the box had been disposed of .
neutral	they then said they wanted a picture of the bottle so they could see how much shampoo was left , i explained you couldn_'_t see through the bottle .
neutral	after few more emails , one if which i said i wouldn_'_t buy from them again if they didn_'_t replace the shampoo .
neutral	i finally got a replacement , i think it was the tone of the emails that got to me more than anything .
neutral	i will buy form them again , but won_'_t deal again if anything_goes_wrong and i have to deal with ' customer service '.
neutral	delivery was when stated and as_described however i orders an exhaust that was informed 0_days_later it was out of stock
neutral	lovely fresh good quality flowers delivered as requested .
neutral	i was informed_throughout on the progress of my order which was excellent .
neutral	my only_criticism was that the bouquet was perhaps a little smaller_than i was expecting and if i had realised this i would have upgraded my order .
neutral	good communication , poor attention to detail , got them wrong twice , third time lucky ?
neutral	the website is a pleasure to order off and the products i ordered , i was thrilled with when they arrived .
neutral	i ordered a buggy and matching change bag at the same time and was thrilled when i recieved an_email of dispatch .
neutral	delivery day came i had the buggy but no change bag ???
neutral	when i finally found a number to ring i was then told the bag had not actually been dispatched and that the email i recieved was wrong and the bag would follow in a few_days .
neutral	a week_later i had the bag and even_though was thrilled with product i couldn_'_t feeling alet down by the customer service .
neutral	0 i shouldn_'_t have been sent a dispatch email for the item , only then to be followed_by not the politist of staff to have a conversation with and then an extra wait for the actual product .
neutral	it did feel a little as they had the money so my purchase will arrive when it arrives .
neutral	absoloutely thrilled with the products though .
neutral	the customer service i received from lloyd was very good and helpful although the fact i had to contact him because the courier didn_'_t pick_up my parcel when requested was bad !
neutral	i '_ve also just had to put a claim in for broken items as it seems the box was very heavy handled during delivery !!
neutral	i think the couriers are getting disrespectful towards people parcels !
neutral	!
neutral	ordering and delivery were very good .
neutral	the actual flowers weren_'_t anywhere_near as good as the picture .
neutral	the picture had lots of stunning vibrant_colours whereas the reality there was a lot of greenery and not so much colour .
neutral	the ordering and receipt of flowers was very good but unfortunately the flowers were nothing like the ones i ordered .
neutral	the picture and description said pink and white_roses , freesias and spray carnations .
neutral	there were no freesias or carnations and not one pink flower - it was quite a pretty blue and white display but generally i was disappointed .
neutral	if i had paid full price would have been very unhappy , there were more leaves than flowers !
neutral	the delivery was on time though and they kept me updated at all times .
neutral	my initial dealings with trueshopping were fine , although i did get cut_off after a very long wait in a call queue .
neutral	the guy processing the order was helpful .
neutral	hovever , when the item failed to arrive on the scheduled monday , i tried again to call , and after forever waiting on the phone , i finally got through to a representative , only to be ' cut_off ' again .
neutral	instead of enduring the call queue again , i emailed .
neutral	within 0 working day i was supposed to get a response .
neutral	in fact , the email reply didn_'_t come until after the goods arrived .
neutral	the sink is nice !
neutral	i received two dozen_red_roses last saturday from serenata_flowers - not ordered by me - but if this was a sales promotion it was very inspired and and made one aware of the quality provided from serenata ..
neutral	however - as an octogenarian i would just say that the worry of whether this was a complimentary bouquet or not does not make one easy - and i have asked serenata to confirm that i will not be charged for this - but so far no reply - which is not what i expected . as i say beautiful flowers - but they must realise that some promotions worry the elderly !
neutral	thankyou penelope tevose - clowe .
neutral	recently ordered a print , which came out fine but disappointingly was just packages in a paper and flimsy_plastic back .
neutral	it was a windy day , and also just for a viewing the work perspective i really thought there would have been a hard back envelope or a piece of card behind the image .
neutral	i will use this site again but only if i am not able to buy elswere , for such a very small item eye_drops 00mls i feel that to pay the same for the postage as you do for the drops is a bit_steep , it is a shame as i would used the site more . apart_from that it was good
neutral	can be a bit_confusing
neutral	a department_store online
neutral	my grand_daughter '_s old_iphone stopped_working .
neutral	diagnosis cost £_00 , 0 repairs cost a further £_00 , so £_00 in all - a lot !
neutral	however , all quickly and efficiently done and the phone is now operable again .
neutral	i ordered a beautiful organge bunch for my dear_friend in hospital as orange is her favourite colour and i wanted her to see them when she came round from her operation .
neutral	however when they arrived they looked absolutely nothing like the picture .
neutral	there were only 0 orange flowers and mostly green vegetation .
neutral	i was very disappointed as my weekly income is only £_000 for 0 children so £_00 was a huge_amount .
neutral	but thought that it would be worth if for my friend .
neutral	i emailed and told them and they apologised and agreed and offered me £_00 off my next bunch .
neutral	fat lot of good that did .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	yes i did get the phone ~ eventually after 0 chase_up calls .
neutral	they said phone was in stock when i ordered it and quite clearly it was not in stock which i discovered when i made my first chase_up call as her reason for me not having the phone yet was completely_different i . e .
neutral	stock issues !
neutral	it wasn_'_t in stock oh_yes it is in stock but not been unpacked yet !
neutral	that old chestnut !
neutral	when i had not heard_anything by a week i rang again and was told they were waiting for them to come in !
neutral	so i was a bit_miffed and said i did not appreciate being lied to and treated like a twot !
neutral	the phone arrived two_days_later !
neutral	so phones 0 u tell the customer the truth or get your stories straight when you tell the customer a porkie .
neutral	on a positive the people were nice who i spoke to .
neutral	whilst their prices are brilliant i feel that their customer service leaves a lot to be desired as i bought an iron from them 0 month_ago and it broke .
neutral	when i tried to return it they tried to make out that i had dropped it !!
neutral	won_'_t buy from them again .
neutral	the booking service and follow information cannot be_faulted , i was kept_informed about the progress of my order , however , the delivery driver was very rude and obstructive towards me on the phone as the postcode i supplied which was correct apparently sent him to a different address ?
neutral	he was very rude to me on the phone and also to the recipient of my delivery .
neutral	regards
neutral	the cooker arrived in good time and the parts that are working are good ... shame that the main oven has a thermostat fault which means that all the electrics cut out when it reaches the desired temperature !
neutral	after reporting the fault a local repair man visited within two_days - but three_weeks_later we are still_waiting for the necessary part to be sent from stoves ... not impressed .
neutral	i absolutely hate the format , so much so that i don_'_t use facebook much now .
neutral	make_sure you read the small_print , when they say you can change your site as you see fit they only mean the word content .
neutral	if you want to change the colour it will be an extra_charge .
neutral	in the beginning they are great , a little_slow but try to help .
neutral	after the site is done you are on your_own with it .
neutral	in response to your reply .....
neutral	i was left on my own !
neutral	why would i write that if it was not my experience ?
neutral	i have email evidence of what i have written in this review .
neutral	perhaps an_apology would have been more appropriate rather_than telling_me i am wrong ? this is a good example of my experience !
neutral	i had ordered a new phone and they were not able to find me in my workplace so took it back rather_than leave it with the receptionist , which was a little frustrating as i knew her but i totally understand_why ... they were protecting the delivery .
neutral	when i called them back they were more than helpful , and i could tell they were busy and second time lucky they left it with my receptionist , as i instructed ... really nice people on the phone !
neutral	i have been a customer for some years_now and yet still i find they say stuff or things appear on my bill randomly ... very confusing .
neutral	contract is up in june / july ... have not decided if i stay or go ...
neutral	got the job_done , as best as i can tell .
neutral	the advisor was very good & helpful - liam .
neutral	and , he took the time to explain things carefully
neutral	cheaper tickets often available at or near venues , especially in london .
neutral	good for vouchers .
neutral	good for keeping track of people but bad for the endless inane rubbish about peoples lives they somehow think you might want to know .
neutral	i place the same order every few_weeks , i have only been able to use paypal once because there was a problem once and when i called i was told " oh paypal have done it again " and as i waited two_weeks for that reply have been hesitant but even when i pay by card it can take a couple if days for my order to be processed i waited almost a week again this time for the tablets .
neutral	i carry in using the service because i have an account and can use the re - order button .
neutral	provides a great service but it took_ages to figure_out how to put the starter_kit together ( there were no instructions ) it looked like a lethal weapon in reality and not something i want to bring out in my handbag .
neutral	mixing was also a problem as there were not clear_instructions .
neutral	i was lucky to enlist the help of someone_who knew how to , otherwise it was money badly spent and would have been stuck in a drawer .
neutral	afterwards i went o a local e_cig shop where i purchased another for a quarter of the price , a lovely small glitzy device , i was given clear and hands on instruction which was a much_better experience .
neutral	a lovely arrangement of flowers but not very good value for money
neutral	there were very little flowers in the bunch
neutral	however the delivery and service side was excellent
neutral	we were happy with the drop_off arrangement .
neutral	unfortunately on our return_journey to collect the car ffs car_park had us coming_back at the wrong time .
neutral	our booking indicated arriving on the 00th of may to pick_up car at 00 . 00_hours .
neutral	when we arrived the information on their computer had us picking the car up at 00 . 00_hours .
neutral	we were not impressed as they had to locate our car which took approximately 00_minutes and this meant we did ' nt arrive home until 0 am .
neutral	i would ' nt use them again .
neutral	my only_complaint is they were ' nt delivered to the correct_address , when i completed the order i requested they were delivered to my work address , when i received my email_telling when they were being delivered you sent them to my home address and could not change this when i requested it .
neutral	fortunately i was able to sort_out with my neighbour to take the delivery in .
neutral	ordering online is easy if you don_'_t need prescription_medicine .
neutral	ordering something that needs a prescription needs time so be prepared to wait .
neutral	i ordered for my dog '_s medicine and every_month i get the same computer_generated email asking for the prescription , which of course they already have .
neutral	email back saying this and most months i get an_email back saying they can '_t find !
neutral	not great service .
neutral	eventually it gets sorted_out but at the expensive of my dog who needs her tablets .
neutral	things seemed ok last month but as i have not yet received my order things still need improving .
neutral	bit much being asked to rate a companies performance yet still_haven_'_t received my order ( over a week now ).
neutral	it was easy to order and potentially an quick and effective dispatch .
neutral	however , the delivery was hampered by the postman trying to deliver and leaving a card at my next door neighbour '_s .
neutral	i was in all day waiting .
neutral	i foundout from tracking service that it had been returned to depot , good job i checked in time to collect from sorting_office before weekend closure .
neutral	some hours_later my neighbour delivered card -
neutral	although the ' deliver by ' date was a long way in the future the dog_food actually arrived within a week .
neutral	other_websites were misleading quoting a cheap price then suddenly adding vat just when you were about to confirm payment .
neutral	pet_supermarket gave the correct price right at the beginning and kept to it .
neutral	i would definately use pet_supermarket again .
neutral	i ordered some vitamin_tablets , the order went through , that was on the 0th of this month .
neutral	i had not received this order and today i phoned pharmacy0u to find out what had happened .
neutral	i was told the product had been_discontinued and was no_longer in stock .
neutral	i was told i had been emailed this information but i didn_'_t receive any emails .
neutral	it was suggested that they had gone into my spam box .
neutral	not sure why these vitamins were still on the website when they are no_longer available .
neutral	i '_m_sure my other half will enjoy this pistol of rum , the only_thing i was disappointed about was that it didn_'_t come in a box , which it was pictured with !
neutral	having looked through all the options , this one was the one that suited our timings best and i decided that in a one and a half hour crossing there was a limit to inconvenience that could be caused .
neutral	most complaints seemed to refer to the overnight ferry_crossings where a boat had been changed and the newer one was smaller so that there was no_longer enough room for all bookings .
neutral	the company hd not been very clever in the way they '_d handled it but so far we have had no_problems .
neutral	i had ordered quite a large number of glasses - £_00 worth in total so they arrived in a very large box with lots of excess space .
neutral	due to the amount of space in there most of the glasses were damaged in some way , half of them totally smashed .
neutral	however , i emailed customer support and after proving photographic_evidence of the breakages they replaced the broken stock straight_away .
neutral	a good service and i dont see why you would have any_problems if you a making a minimal order but the bigger the order the bigger the chance of breakages just because of the way they are packaged .
neutral	hasn_'_t worked for me so although delivery prompt , i '_m disappointed
neutral	this isn_'_t the first time i '_ve_used your company but this time it '_s on a recorded delivery and needs a signature .
neutral	the courier does not deliver on a weekend .
neutral	so i have to travel 00 miles to the depot to collect it .
neutral	not good .
neutral	won_'_t use again .
neutral	i purchased these flowers for my nan '_s 00rd birthday .
neutral	from her feed_back the flowers were lovely .
neutral	no_complaints .
neutral	but i must_say that the delivery wasn_'_t great .
neutral	i requested a day for delivery and they were delivered on the requested day , but not til_0pm !!!.
neutral	after dark my nan wont answer the front_door ( neither would i to be honest ) and i had requested the delivery be left with a neighbor if there was no response .
neutral	i received a text_message_saying my flowers had been delivered and left_securely at the front of the property .
neutral	the delivery was not secured anywhere .
neutral	it was exposed at the front of the house .
neutral	basically if i hadn_'_t called my nan to go check out side , they would have been gone by morning .
neutral	i don_'_t think this is acceptable customer service .
neutral	i believe i should have been contacted by phone or the flowers not be delivered at all .
neutral	it seemed a task for staff to serve at the various bars .
neutral	shortage of staff made queuing inevitable .
neutral	the coffee_machine_broke_down on the return_journey forcing me and my family to go to other areas to obtain drinks .
neutral	parts of the boat were in disrepair and a large part of the boat was sealed off .
neutral	the restaurant on our return crossing didnt have enough food and the offers were not told to us regarding the sweets .
neutral	the flowers arrived in the morning of the appointed day , which was good .
neutral	but there was a bit too much " filler " as_opposed to flowers .
neutral	i was really pleased to find a craft shop with a wide_range of products as i was looking for an interesting christmas_present .
neutral	the jewellery_making kit i saw on the website looked like just what i wanted , so i decided to make the trip in to manchester and have a look at the different_colours available .
neutral	disappointingly it turned_out this was an internet only product ( i didn_'_t spot anything which said that ) and the assistant i spoke to was quite offhand about it (" we don_'_t have the room to stock everything ") even_though i '_d made the trip specially .
neutral	i was mollified by the fact that when i returned home and looked at the website again there was a special_offer which partly compensated for the train_fare !
neutral	the product when it arrived was a little_disappointing as i had expected it to be in some sort of box ( once again i had got that impression from the website ) but the contents looked fine .
neutral	i '_m pleased that there is an_independent shop catering for a fairly specialist market so close to me and will probably use it again - just need a little_bit more info on the website
neutral	a great product but no instructions , invoice or return details if the product was faulty or not suitable was enclosed with the product , so very poor customer service .
neutral	i was a little unhappy about being charged 00 pounds for ammending my ticket only the day after and only to add another person and pay the difference , i think it would be better if you could do this yourself online exactly the same way as you can book it .
neutral	the parrot seeds are excellent quality , though the package is paper based , this means the seeds could then get damp while been transported and this would mean problems .
neutral	delivery : when i spoke to them on the telephone i asked when it would be delivered and i was told ' tomorrow ' i was surprised but trusted what i was told , unfortunately it came 0_days_later .
neutral	website : no link button to the basket means one has to add a fictious product to check out and pay ....
neutral	however the quality of the seeds are very good .
neutral	no_problems this time - booking was easy to do and good value .
neutral	i ordered these flowers for valentines_day they were good value got on time for the extra money i paid only for some of the roses to be wilted and slightly dead apart_from that i would use this service again if they sort_out that issue .
neutral	some of my bonaparte purchases are amongst my favourites - unusual items , good durability and quality .
neutral	however returns mean an unacceptably_long wait and no immediate_confirmation of receipt so only 0_* because of that .
neutral	cost and compatibility good compared to original nespresso .
neutral	ordered strengths of 0 , 0 , 0 not knowing they were under strength compared to nespresso .
neutral	the difference in strength is also noticeable unfortunately .
neutral	i found the items i had been looking for .
neutral	placed an order but my concern was that i was given no ' at the point of purchase ' information that 0 items were not in stock e . g .
neutral	0 - 0 week delay etc
neutral	good with delivery except for wrong items sent .
neutral	after sending 0 e_mails and one phone_call i have had no response about replacement of the items or refund
neutral	website easy to use , great selection of product at great prices , quick to purchase and fast delivery times after purchase .
neutral	delivery service they use was terrible , they were late , didn_'_t turn_up and took over 00_minutes on hold just to speak to someone .
neutral	unhelpful delivery service .
neutral	shame as easy wells great site .
neutral	order took 0_weeks to arrive ( in france ) and their own packaging was a let_down : dirty cardboard without_any kind of bubble_wrap / tissue_paper inside .
neutral	a bit poor considering i ordered products for personal_hygiene .
neutral	i paid £_00 delivery charges for about £_00 worth of goods so i was expecting a better delivery service .
neutral	otherwise there was an issue with one of the products i received but they refunded the faulty product without problems .
neutral	this flight was very well priced , but i felt like i was a farm animal cooped up in such a tiny seat with no room what so ever .
neutral	i also got charged a stupid amount for luggage and also to use the toilet !!!
neutral	the flight was also late , but i guess for the low_cost , this is to be expected
neutral	ordered sofa_bed on the basis of a uk made , reasonably_priced and quick delivery .
neutral	this almost didn_'_t transpire , as the delivery company , on receipt of a response text from me , return texted that my choice had expired .
neutral	i received this on a saturday .
neutral	there was no - one available on any of the numbers i found online ( including calling denmark and scotland ), which for a home decor and home delivery service is pretty rubbish .
neutral	delivery company solved this on the monday .
neutral	fine .
neutral	sofa arrived , and shortly_afterwards discovered a fault .
neutral	duly attended by technician , the results of which * i * had to chase a couple of weeks_later , after finding other faults .
neutral	i was finally offered a replacement sofa , the exchange of which was marvellously and surprisingly simple .
neutral	not used the sofa much yet , so can '_t comment much on that .
neutral	i '_m amazed to get a ' please rate us ' after a telephone_call .
neutral	getting a bit fed_up of that , oh marketing departments .
neutral	wait_until after you '_ve actually done something , rather_than just talked .
neutral	so , pretty dreadful , but saved by simple exchange , which actually shouldn_'_t have been required in the first place .
neutral	we havent received the order yet
neutral	the rugs didn_'_t cost very much but they ' re soft to stand on barefoot , so pretty good value for money .
neutral	very poor 00 hour express delivery service from parcelforce though - rugs were ordered & collected from rug_house on tuesday 00nd_april & finally arrived on monday 00th_april .
neutral	i rang to ask about identifying a part on my t00 .
neutral	the representative was not interested in being friendly , identified the part bundle , i later found that i could buy the single part as an individual item
neutral	he was negative about vw `_s in general which i though was odd working for jk .
neutral	left not knowing if that part will suffice or not , so back to the mechanic .
neutral	not really that helpful and it was a bit like pulling_teeth .
neutral	have had more pleasant shop experiences .
neutral	*****************
neutral	i received my order as promised , only to find that the same item was available online for £_00 less .
neutral	i highlighted this to jules_b , and asked that they refund me the difference to save me sending the dress back however apparently this us against policy and they '_d rather receive the dress back .
neutral	subsequently i sent the dress back and have ordered it again from the competitor site .
neutral	shame really , the service was great otherwise and they '_ve lost themselves a sale .
neutral	well , it does a good job , but the stitching is coming_undone on the velcro to which the strap is attached .
neutral	this seems to be a bit too soon , as i haven_'_t had it for very long ?
neutral	unless the tracking_system is improved i will use another_supplier
neutral	called to order and was told i would be called back re a query - did not happen .
neutral	when i spoke again i did not have an_apology and they were out of stock of what i needed .
neutral	girl was trying to be helpful though .
neutral	... but delay in delivery from manufacturer to marks_electrical was bordering on unacceptable .. perhaps online stores should only offer what is in stock ?
neutral	these were sent to my mum as a thank_you , and she was surprised and pleased as anyone to receive flowers , although she thought they were a very small bunch and hoped i hadn_'_t spent too much on them !
neutral	having received and sent a few of serenata_flowers , i was really disappointed to hear this feedback and also that my mum wasn_'_t very impressed , with something that was supposed to be special for her .
neutral	i was happy with the delivery time but the product itself wasn_'_t as good as some other_companies .
neutral	i asked for all the photos to be 0x0 and they turned_up in three different_sizes , therefore not all of the photos fit in my album .
neutral	some of the pictures that had appeared perfectly crystal_clear on my computer ( and when i had printed them out at home ) came back very dark and slightly blurred .
neutral	the pictures that were delivered that were the right size and werent blurred were very good however .
neutral	i had hundreds of books and entered many many isbn '_s but only a very small number of the books were accepted .
neutral	it was extremely frustrating and quite hard_work to keep trying .
neutral	in the end a few books were accepted and i received just under_£_00 for books worth about £_000 -£_000 .
neutral	the cheque did come quite quickly though so that was good .
neutral	i am still_waiting to make_sure that it actually clears the bank .
neutral	slight_hiccup at the start of our holiday which_resulted_in me making a complaint , as the complaint was handled_professionally and efficiently i would consider_using their services again .
neutral	we asked for a gps system to be found on the car , but it was not available apparently because the italian agency had not forwarded our request .
neutral	this was annoying , since there was no solution and we had to travel in the cornish countriside !
neutral	the staff at the pickup spot were very heplful but this was still very annoying .
neutral	from my first experience of specsavers i will be returning to my previous opticians !
neutral	the only_reason i tried them out was because i had a free eye_test voucher .
neutral	the optician said i had a very slight prescription and didn_'_t need glasses , but proceeded to try to sell me reading_glasses .
neutral	the whole atmosphere seemed more of a sales place and out of about 00 to 00 other people in there at the time , i was the only one to walk out without purchasing anything .
neutral	nice quick delivery for my mums_birthday , but unfortunately flowers arrived slightly droopy after water leaked out .
neutral	i haven_'_t seem them myself but my mum seems to think now she has them in water they should perk up .
neutral	i hope so as would expect a bit more from the money i spent .
neutral	all services i place with interparcel are great , excellent customer service , and overall all third part companies are great .
neutral	however , every_single time i book a courier with tnt i do seem to experience some kind of trouble .
neutral	i would recommend to interparcel to remove this company from their list .
neutral	really pleased to get my order so quickly , though it was just left on the doorstep and not around the back as requested when i completed the delivery instructions .
neutral	disapppointed that the tree was pretty pot bound - it was difficult to remove it from the pot .
neutral	this was my first experience of ordering tyres online the reason i did it was to save some money .
neutral	the ordering process was brilliant and chosing when i wanted them fitted was i thought great .
neutral	i received confirmation of my order and appointment immediately and it was only 0_days after i ordered the tyres and this fitted in with the rest of my week .
neutral	i arrived for my appointment left my car and keys with the office and walked_into elgin whilst my tyres are fitted .
neutral	when i arrived in elgin i received a call from national_tyres to say that tyres had not arrived and they could not do the job .
neutral	i was not best pleased as it is a 00 mile_round_trip from where i live and this cost me around £_00 in petrol costs for a wasted_journey .
neutral	why i was not informed when i left my car at the garage that my tyres had no arrived or even a callbefore my appointment enabling_me to postpone my journey would have been good .
neutral	i was very upset that the coat i bought was left_outside for over a week in all of the rain in a place that it could of been pinched , there was no note to say where it was left .
neutral	i panicked because it was for my daughters christmas , its a lot of money and you would think that you would have to sign for such an expensive item
neutral	the car was great and the price was good but we waited in a queue for an_hour and a half to get the car .
neutral	this made us late for a dinner reservation and was very annoying .
neutral	simply_supplements have always provided an excellent service
neutral	and quality products , but delivery by post can be hit and miss .
neutral	usually i end up having to collect my parcel when i have been out
neutral	at the time of delivery .
neutral	some providers now use ' letterbox friendly '
neutral	packaging so this is no_longer a problem and i am sure would be a
neutral	' hit ' with other customers .
neutral	we ordered a set of invites , only to find on chasing the status of our order that they were out of stock .
neutral	upon reordering we received 000 evening_invites and no day invites .
neutral	eventually we received the correct quantities nearly 0_weeks after the original order .
neutral	saying that the interaction with their customer service advisors and manager was of a decent standard and they handled our issues fairly quickly .
neutral	our suggestions for improving the service would be to keep website current and proactively contact customers if there is a delay .
neutral	the products i ordered - pagan bodywash , pagan perfume and perfume bodyspray arrived in good time , but the perfume bottle was not full .
neutral	this was a very small bottle of perfume and it was really obvious that there was less_than 0 / 0 in the bottle , so i could not give this as a gift , as i had intended .
neutral	therefore i was disappointed .
neutral	hostel_world is very usefull , the reviews never lie and you can choose the best option for you .
neutral	you know you are backed_up by hostelworld so you are not afraid of the hostel beeing a fraud .
neutral	i used alpha_rooms for the first time to book a hotel in puerto rico - my first booking didnt go through even_tho i paid the deposit of €_00 , i also recevied an_email that was for a mr . brown .
neutral	after the first booking didnt work , i tried again this time paying a €_00 deposit and this was acccepted and confirmed .
neutral	all in all i had no_complaints just them intial issues .
neutral	will use alpha_rooms agian as they offer the best price .
neutral	flowers were well_wrapped and appreciated as a get - well gift , but delivery was poor .
neutral	despite instructions to leave flowrs at the back of the house , they were dumped , upside_down , at the beginning of the driveway .
neutral	my sick_friend could not even see the package and would not have known about it , if a visitor had not brought it up to the house .
neutral	i really like the edit of clothes - with designers you don_'_t see on other_websites .
neutral	.
neutral	customer service is very friendly and willing but a bit amateurish .
neutral	the returns and exchange process is clunky .
neutral	i first phoned up to see if i couldlexchange a dress .
neutral	a friendly girl answered but didn_'_t know the process and asked if i could phone back later when her colleague would be back !
neutral	in the end i dealt_with the matter by email but it took several emails to get all the information i needed .. with the bigger websites such as net a porter or matches , the returns / exchange process is seamless .
neutral	i would like a bit more detail on size and fit too .
neutral	i bought a length of ball chain to replace a broken on a window blind .
neutral	unfortunately , the size of the balls are rather too small to work smoothly .
neutral	there was no_indication of size on the website so i knew i was taking a chance .
neutral	i have used the software to unzip , worked well .
neutral	i had a bit of a problem with the download as something_else came with it .
neutral	i quickly removed it .
neutral	they told me when booking a renault_clio or similar was very disapointted with the tiny car as only two bags fitted in boot with force plus when we returned car to car_park nobody there to tell you where to go with keys of car and not a sgin to say return to desk in aerport
neutral	we have so far only ordered samples but they arrived in a reasonable time and look good quality .
neutral	however , 0 tiles were packaged in a very large box filled with polystyrene packaging ( s shapes ) - a bit of a pain for us to dispose of but more_importantly not good for the environment .
neutral	i wasn_'_t sure about ordering from power direct as there as some awful reviews but they are honestly not that bad .
neutral	it took a week for me to receive my items and i only got a delivery date the day before but power direct did answer all my emails and were very helpful on the phone but my problem was delivery was coming direct from manufacturer so difficult to find out when i could expect delivery .
neutral	i would use them again .
neutral	bought the combined travel pack of no - water shampoo and conditioner .
neutral	sadly only the shampoo was delivered ( but works really well !)
neutral	along with a bottle of body_wash instead of the conditioner .
neutral	despite customer_services telling_me that a bottle of conditioner would be sent to me ( and to keep the body_wash , which was a nice_touch ), nothing '_s been received .
neutral	so well_done on product but more attention is needed on what they ' re packing in the parcel !
neutral	had loads of problems with my box sky is very unhelpful .
neutral	repeat the same programs far too often and even_tho there are hundreds of channels there is often nothing to watch
neutral	i am not happy that insurance always offered in such a way , that you are made to believe wax_polish is free .
neutral	it is not free its a way of selling the insurance to make it look free .
neutral	as we are pensioners the salesperson makes you believe such a good deal speaking so fast its difficult to understand .
neutral	no problem with furniture sales as it sells itself .
neutral	i booked this evening and forgot to add one of the passengers .
neutral	i went to add the 0rd passenger 00_minutes after the original booking was made only to find out directferries wanted to charge me an extra £_00 to make this simple change .
neutral	i would expect at_least a 00 - 00 hour grace period for changes without charge .
neutral	this isn_'_t the first time i have been disappointed by this extortionate charge .
neutral	please make these changes to your fees .
neutral	nicole s .
neutral	product good and good price but packaging poor and delivery driver left package with next door despite the fact that i was in and did not leave a card to let_me now .
neutral	we '_ve just returned from a hen_weekend in liverpool and while the weekend was fab the week leading up to it was fairly stressful !!
neutral	i work full time and had decided that booking via chilli_sauce would make things fairly easy and hassle_free for me as the weekend organiser .
neutral	however , cracks started to appear the week before we went when a member of the group called the hotel to make an enquiry , only to be told that they didn_'_t have our booking !
neutral	needless to say this was more than concerning so when i decided to call the spa to make_sure they had our booking , surprise_surprise , they didn_'_t either !
neutral	after emailing vanessa ( our " manager ") she assured me that everything was booked and when we did arrive on friday , thankfully there were no_problems .
neutral	the spa however were calling me all day friday to make_sure we definitely wanted our appointment for the following_day ( as i later found out that vanessa had called them on the friday_morning to cancel our appointments - even_though i had asked her to do anything of the sort )!
neutral	long_story_short , chilli_sauce are great for the online payment system and we did feel that we got great value for money with everything that was included in our " package " but for peace of mind ask for someone a little more competent to manage your booking !
neutral	when you are selling an item that will always be a winner , you really should not be able to go_wrong .
neutral	the shard is an excellent venue and providing the weather is ok it will be a good visit .
neutral	your staff were helpful , courteous and some very knowledgable .
neutral	the only_downside was the price of the ubiquitous photographs that are taken at the start of the visit and very hard to avoid ( without being rude ).
neutral	but the cost was way beyond ridiculous , especially as everyone comes armed with a camera of their own .
neutral	not worth the original price_tag as unable to justify , no change to my complexion / skin and glad didn_'_t pay top_whack for this cream
neutral	booking was easy , anpr worked great on arrival at barrier , sadly did not work on way out at end of visit , so had to waste time phoning for help to raise barrier .
neutral	see you next year !!
neutral	!
neutral	good service accept for an issue with delivery - made two orders on line within 00_minutes of each other and asked via phone_call to have them linked together and have only one delivery charge - all goods came in a single delivery but charged_twice for it
neutral	the flowers you sent on my behalf to my daughter and son - in - law for their 00th_wedding_anniversary were beautiful , but they did not match the picture of the flowers that appear on your web - site , some were the same , but others were not .
neutral	so full_marks for flower quality , but less for content .
neutral	very pleased with the sideboard i pic hazed , lovely looking and very solid , i was however quite taken a - back when the item was delivered in a card board box and left on its side .
neutral	i have 0 young_children and needed the sideboard in place when they came back from nursery so had to remove from the packaging and manoeuvre onto its feet on my own !
neutral	i '_m a small lady and this was not easy to do and quite dangerous ... would expect the 0 men that delivered to un pack and check the item was not damaged etc ... would put me off ordering again
neutral	well , the product ( now we have the correct one ) looks good but ;
neutral	delivery of the both the initial incorrect radiator and its replacement arrived outside the 00 - 00 slot .
neutral	we were waiting to take the correct one to norfolk - literally with car packed having phoned the delivery company - 00 . 00 is not 00 - 00 . 00 and i had someone waiting here at the correct time ...
neutral	your rep that phoned about the incorrect delivery did not know i had already e_- mailed the alex e_- mail address , likewise i wanted written confirmation that i was to give the delivery man back the incorrect rad but did not receive a response to my e_- mail ...
neutral	however , all the staff i spoke to seemed most efficient and courteous , and even the late delivery driver couldn_'_t have been more helpful ... just unfortunate that by the second delivery date ( after waiting for the item to be in stock ) time was crucial and so particularly marred my opinion - shame this is the first of 00 radiators needed !
neutral	i order every few_months from child '_s play , maybe more ..
neutral	but twice in the space of two_weeks it '_s let_me order things online for me then to be contacted to tell me there are out of stock , i don_'_t think the website should allow you to purchase if it doesn_'_t have your item in stock .
neutral	very frustrating and i find it poor customer service .
neutral	tiles not received yet as rearranging delivery now i know who to contact !
neutral	i thought the way that o0 handled the whole upgrade for this latest iphone was pathetic .
neutral	they kept me waiting for over 0 0 / 0 hrs in the rain with no updates about stock etc .
neutral	it then turned_out there was none left and no one in any of the shops in glasgow , in particular theo r i q at the fort were the worst .
neutral	they treated the customers like a piece of sh & t , treating them with utter contempt .
neutral	the amount of custom o0 lost out to that day should be noted , around 00 plus people walked_away disgusted .
neutral	it '_s the first and the last time l ever q for a phone .
neutral	current iphone customers who have fed o0 '_s profits for 00mths at over_£_00 a month should have had the priority of first refusal on the new phone , that would have been the decent thing to do .
neutral	everyone who was an o0 customer is now jumping on our bandwagon , now that they want an iphone .
neutral	it was just a cheap marketing ploy to feed o0 '_s pathetic ego , keeping ppl hanging about with false hopes .
neutral	never had a problem with the delivery before but after nearly a month the dog was wasting away without his food .
neutral	apparently it came out for delivery , went on a journey and returned without getting to me !
neutral	hastily rectified though when i rang the customer_services team and it was delivered next_day !
neutral	i have ordered similar labels from another company before and i was happy to try yours as you ship quickly to france .
neutral	but i was disappointed with the quality of the stickers -- they are very thin so the corners tend to roll under or fold over when we are applying them .
neutral	the clothing labels should have a " no iron " option for those times when we need a quick application .
neutral	and your options for personalization are too limited .
neutral	when i first decided on wren after looking at masses of kitchen and suppliers it was because of the good value and quality of the product .
neutral	however the first bad_experience i had with wren was with a really pushy member of staff who was so focused on the sale she wasn_'_t listening to what i wanted and then got snappy with my mum !
neutral	i asked to be dealt_with by another member of staff as at that point i was willing to go elsewhere .
neutral	then we were dealt_with by a fantastic member of staff who couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
neutral	we were really pleased with the service and advice given and the kitchen looks_fab .... aside from some of the doors / panels were damaged and it has taken over 0_months of new panels being ordered and sent back before we have got a full undamaged kitchen .
neutral	what should have been completed in january has taken until may to do .
neutral	a big drawback and really undid any good work the salesman put in .
neutral	a shame but would now hesitate to recommend on the two negatives alone .
neutral	a big plus was the sale on the cooker and got a bargain on a neff oven so all in all not terrible but not great either .
neutral	the flowers were for my granddaughter to let her know how proud we were in her gaining a 0st in her university degree course ........... she loved them .... thanks
neutral	no dior & no chanel !
neutral	flowers were beautiful but such a shame as she thought we had forgotten her on her special birthday . she went out for the evening and they were delivered at 0 . pm at night .
neutral	better late than never !
neutral	! but rather ridiculous almost as an after thought , not quite the service i expected . had i known such late delivery i wouldnt have booked them . did use them once before and same happened although i thought it was because the first recipient lived in the middle of countryside . this was on outskirts of london .
neutral	happy with delivery & online service , but the flowers don_'_t look much like the picture on the website and my mum said some of them weren_'_t fresh & died within a couple of days .
neutral	great concert but overshadowed by the fact that we paid over double the original ticket price !
neutral	great website , easy to order but unfortnately didn_'_t deliver on the requested day which was very disappointing .
neutral	the hotel was easy to find and would be ideal for anyone arriving by train although there was also ample free car_parking .
neutral	there was not as much noise from other rooms as we have experienced in other budget hotels which was good .
neutral	the bed was comfortable but a bit short and there were hard and soft pillows .
neutral	the room was very clean but the general areas were shabby .
neutral	the worst part was that the smoking area was right outside the entrance so we had to run the gauntlet of smokers to get in / out - not what you want in your best clothes .
neutral	there is a nice little seating_area by the river but this too was colonised by smokers so not pleasant for non - smokers .
neutral	there is also a little garden just for residents that we liked .
neutral	the staff seemed keen that we did not use the restaurant for dinner or breakfast which was odd .
neutral	presumably they get overly busy .
neutral	there is a tesco express near by so we got supplies from there instead .
neutral	although there are a lot of night clubs in the area it was well policed so we felt safe .
neutral	the product is meant to last 00 weeks , my cat is already messing right next to the product .
neutral	parking was difficult to find .
neutral	as soon as i booked i received text with post_code ... but it get me to different place ... not far from that parking but it was a bit stressful .
neutral	i called to them and that man explained me where to go .
neutral	another surprise was when we arrived ... i couldn_'_t find anybody for few_minutes ... and when i finally found the lady ( she was very nice ) she asked me for a keys and we have to leave the car and she was parking it in .
neutral	my biggest issue is that they didn_'_t have right size car seats for my 00 months old twins .
neutral	i could use mine ( which are very difficult to fix in ) or use booster_seats they provided .
neutral	fast delivery but only fairly satisfied with products delivered , not all the wooden cabinet handles were the same .
neutral	the order was made up of 0 slightly_different handles .
neutral	nice but couldn_'_t wait to have diet of freshly_cooked food .
neutral	even adding fresh greens to the ilumi_meals didn_'_t help the enjoyment of somewhat sloppy sauce filled food .
neutral	useful as emergency standby .
neutral	it wasn_'_t made clear that the phone had to be free from any minor cracks or chips for it to be classed_as ' working '.
neutral	deducted £_00 for a tiny crack on the back of my iphone .
neutral	used it online .
neutral	found it fairly simple to do .
neutral	i did try tesco first but it kept on crashing .
neutral	tesco was a lot_cheaper !
neutral	received the photo_book fairly quick .
neutral	however .
neutral	i have a very good dslr_camera and the print quality in the book is very pixelated .
neutral	it '_s far from sharp !!
neutral	not happy at all and would definitely not use the site again .
neutral	very expensive for what you get !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered the oriental_breeze and they looked lovely online , but the packaging ( cardboard_box ) was ruined - soaked and falling_apart , which made the flowers squished and some of the buds fell_off :( i was able to salvage them in the end and make it presentable but overall i was quite disappointed .
neutral	late to meet and late to greet !
neutral	!
neutral	easy to deal with but recipient wasn_'_t impressed with the way flowers were delivered !!
neutral	flowers were put in a box and needed to be arranged by the recipient !!
neutral	don_'_t arrive as pictured therefore bot the best way to receive flowers !!
neutral	would recommend paying a couple of pounds more for a local_florist .
neutral	don_'_t like the online service - it always takes too long !
neutral	but i do like the fact you can design your on pizzas !
neutral	!
neutral	i '_ve been sick from the last 0 pizza rounds from my local domino '_s , so i want be ordering from them for a looooong time :(
neutral	cab be poor compared to other nerworks
neutral	i had to phone the office yesterday as wanted to cancel the insurance due to the non response to my emails and non receipt of my insurance_policy that had been paid for .
neutral	fortunately , the person i spoke to sorted it out for me straight_away and sent the policy whilst i was still on the phone which gave_me back some confidence in your company .
neutral	the cards are very nice and look good .
neutral	however i am very disappointed with the overall quality as the message inside the card is very faint and hard to read - just hope people manage to attend my function .
neutral	i was warned with age_related deterioration of my sight that the initial results would be temporary .
neutral	i would say i had fantastic vision the first 0_months after laser_treatment but now 00 months later my sight has deteriorated quite dramatically & i need to use glasses for reading & food preparation , i also have difficulty in low level light .
neutral	good service
neutral	the lack of intervention from ebay is very frustrating when things go_wrong .
neutral	when it goes well it is average .
neutral	the package was exactly_what i expected apart_from there was no powder when it stated there would be 0g !
neutral	the powder puff box was completely empty !
neutral	this wasn_'_t such a big deal as i put my own powder in anyway !
neutral	quick delivery and well_wrapped .
neutral	prices are are well and reliable_source ,
neutral	the service from serenata is amazing & cannot be_faulted .
neutral	my mum was pleased with the flowers but felt very embarrassed to tell me that some of them were already drooping & ready to die ...
neutral	i was then very apologetic that they had arrived like that on mother '_s day !
neutral	it is with regret that i will not return to serenata :(
neutral	the part has not turned_up yet !!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	the salesperson was very friendly and helpful and helped to make feel_confident that i was purchasing the correct products .
neutral	we discussed payment and she said i could pay over 00 months which made my experience even better .
neutral	she said i would be contacted by the payment team and they would need bank details to set_up a direct_debit .
neutral	i had my details at hand when i was contacted by the payment team just to be told that i had been given the wrong information and only the telephone support could be paid over 00 months which was only around £_00 !!
neutral	i was deflated at this point and very disappointed as cashflow is a bit of an problem at the moment and it would have helped immensely .
neutral	i don_'_t blame the salesperson as she should be given this information to pass on to the customer rather_than get their hopes up that they can spread the payment
neutral	the drop - off was a little frought as i had arrived ½ hour earlier_than advised and rang as i wanted to have the car taken as soon as possible .
neutral	in fact collection from me was 00_minutes later than my booked time and it was somewhat stressful getting through to catch my plane .
neutral	i had tried to change my drop - off time the day before but this does not appear possible on line .
neutral	on return everything worked very smoothly and promptly .
neutral	i usually receive my orders from animed without_any trouble but this time the order arrived 0_days after i was advised it would .
neutral	this may be down to carrier used but i have gotten used to better service !
neutral	i was please with my order from physioroom . com until i experienced a problem on the first day with one of the items i had ordered .
neutral	i posted a message on their site and was asked to send a photo in .
neutral	there was no way a photo would be able to show the problem that i had had and i would have no idea how to do this myself , i do not take photos so for some coutomers like myself this might be a problem . my husband sent the photo for me but i feel some cutomers may not be able to do this .
neutral	i have since not had a reply so am now unsure what is happening with my problem and my replacement .
neutral	i would like a contact number and be able to ring them and speak to someone .
neutral	i '_ve never used music_magpie before but had so many cd '_s that i don_'_t play anymore , i thought it would be a great way to get_rid of them & earn a bit of extra money .
neutral	it '_s really easy to scan them with the app & i dropped them off at my local shop for collection .
neutral	you only get about 00p for a cd though , even for titles which i would consider to be hard to find .
neutral	if you have the time & patience i would say selling them on ebay is definitely the way to go , you '_ll get a lot more for your items in the long run .
neutral	the only real downside is the length of time they take to pay you .
neutral	i sent my items off about 0_weeks_ago and they emailed me two_weeks_ago asking me to verify my bank details , which i did , but i still_haven_'_t been paid as yet .
neutral	i really don_'_t understand_why the whole_process is so slow .
neutral	in a nutshell if you have loads of unwanted cds , dvds & games but like me are to lazy to sell them individually on ebay then it '_s a good & easy way to make a couple of extra quid , just don_'_t expect to get your hands on the cash anytime_soon .
neutral	i really enjoy using pet_supermarket , i find that there website is easy to use and that there products are of a good quality and also competitevly priced .
neutral	this product especially my cat just loves it .
neutral	however i got home to find that the box it came in was left_outside my house , where anyone who passed could have taken it . i find this unacceptable and has made me doubt whether i will purchase from them again , which is a shame considering that the rest of my experience was good .
neutral	shopping was easy to do - great pictures and user_friendly but i placed an order which stated delivery in 0 - 0_days .
neutral	ordered on the monday so assumed i would receive my goods by friday / saturday but my order wasn_'_t actually processed until the thursday .
neutral	goods delivered on the following_tuesday meaning 0_days from order to delivery .
neutral	i know it is the busiest_time of year , but if a message had been put on stating that there may be a delay in processing orders that would have been fine - it '_s all about the communication !
neutral	considering the distribution_centre is in my home town , i could have gone and picked my own order quicker_than it was processed !
neutral	at first it was good it gave_me an updated amount for phone and i accepted then got an_email_saying payment would be in by end of day and still_waiting 0days on .
neutral	and i keep getting emails about having 0_days before price ends they seem unorganised .
neutral	i have then received payment 0_days_later but got a phone same day explaining still wasnt impressed with thecwait .
neutral	just returned from a good week in alpe d ; where we rented 0 pairs of skiis and two_pairs of boots from olivier sports via snobrainer .
neutral	apart_from a few remarks from the shop assistant about daughter # 0s slim feet ( after trying several_pairs of boots ) ie why did she not have her own boots ?
neutral	we got our stuff together as the shop was closing .
neutral	daughter # 0s skiis had bent springs and would not hold together but she would not go back to change them .
neutral	all in all the equipment was ok and no trouble on return .
neutral	would we use oliver sports again ?
neutral	possibly not as we like twinner and sport 0000 both of which were nearer to our accommodation - but hey_ho with 0 price often dictates a small schlep !
neutral	!
neutral	i asked for a 0 / 0_ft tree and the one delivered was a lot taller therefore wider and too_big for my lounge .
neutral	we had to trim it to fit .
neutral	i have used longacres for several_years and this is the first year i have been disappointed
neutral	from deciding on a car to actually getting the car took a few_months .
neutral	the help from sales before actually ordering was not great .
neutral	they directed me to their website a lot and did not seem to have the time to deal with my enquiries .
neutral	they also did not follow_up any enquiries for many days or wouldn_'_t ring you back from an online enquiry .
neutral	this part of the service really put me off and if it wasn_'_t for another company not being_able to match the deal i wanted i would have gone_elsewhere !
neutral	however when i did order the car then sales appeared to be more helpful .
neutral	there were a number of hiccups_along the way however which made the process long and tedious !
neutral	you have to print everything out yourself which isn_'_t always feasible at home which then delays the process .
neutral	they claimed not to have received documents they needed but then apologised when they found them the following_day .
neutral	they had problems with the documents i sent !
neutral	the staff were always pleasant and the problems did not lie with just one person it was more the process that appeared to have flaws !
neutral	i do not think that after my lease is up that i will deal with them again !
neutral	my kids wanted to get their dad his fav crisps for father '_s day .
neutral	chose your site , verified they would arrive on time , ordered .
neutral	was then advised of the delay so was not delivered for father '_s day - very sad kids .
neutral	solicitor had to go through the changes to no win no fee and the upfront costs i could incur which was completely_different to your agent who said i had absolutely nothing to fund .
neutral	i thought the puzzle didn_'_t really have enough scope as my 0 year_old granddaughter did it straight_away and once it had been solved it '_s use was over .
neutral	it would have been better if the squares could have been arranged differently for different solutions .
neutral	it was very frustrating that the pen didn_'_t work as my granddaughter was keen to use it and it was completely dry .
neutral	i would not recommend it any of my friends .
neutral	quick & easy online service , however my 0nd order didnt go smoothly ....
neutral	i recieved an_email from yourselves requesting i call you to confirm , but it didnt give a contact telephone_number to call .
neutral	so i replied by email and then you guys sent another email asking me to input a response to your questions in a particular place ...
neutral	i kept inputting the questions and then you guys kept emailing back to say it was blank !!
neutral	!
neutral	at some point maybe you should have just called me !
neutral	instead of expecting the customer to constantly repeat information on a reply email system that doesnt seem to work .
neutral	other than that i worked_fine ....
neutral	customer service fine , prompt .
neutral	then took 0_weeks to post cheque .
neutral	unacceptable when rival_companies do bank transfers within 0_days
neutral	disappointing that my friend did not know who had sent the flowers .
neutral	the prices are very good , items always well_packed but delivery time a bit_slow .
neutral	if they could rectify this then it would be perfect
neutral	it was easy to put my order through bt not impressed how long it '_s takeing for it to arrive because it '_s a birthday_present n she may not get it in time
neutral	i contacted them about my insurance_policy and they didn_'_t even have me registered as their customer .
neutral	my overall experience was that the service was good , the sales_executive was friendly not too pushy and made the purchase of a our qashqai run very smoothly .
neutral	however , there were a couple of issues that i came_across after the sale that left me a bit disappointed .
neutral	although i ’_m not suggesting that i was mislead , initially i was under the impression that the forecourt selling of £ 0000 was the value of the car and that the 0_months rfl was given as an incentive to purchase the car .
neutral	also there was absolutely no mention of £_00 for petrol at the time of purchase .
neutral	when i received the invoice the value of the car was £ 0000 + £_00 rfl + £_00 petrol .
neutral	personally i would have like to have been told the selling of the car and the add - ons up front .
neutral	i would advise anyone buying a car on finance to check this out otherwise you may be paying for 0 years interest on £_00 rfl and £_00 worth of petrol .
neutral	also when i examined multi point check list on the car it showed that the tread on both rear_tyres was at 0mm .
neutral	although the check list shows the minimum tread_depth being 00mm , most manufactures and reputable garages including nissan recommend for safety_reasons , changing tyres at 0mm .
neutral	this was not highlighted on the through and vigorous multi point check .
neutral	i feel that i should have been made aware of this before i purchased the car .
neutral	so my question would be , if i take my car which as a tyre tread_depth of 0mm into a nissan_chorley garage for a annual service or mot would i be advised that the tyres would need changing or not ?
neutral	or is there double standards when it comes to selling used cars ?
neutral	although i must_admit that i am naive when it comes to buying cars or treads on tyres and therefore i should take some responsibility for not being through enough when buying the car .
neutral	however you live and learn .
neutral	i would suggest that if you are buying a car don_’_t make the mistake i did , examine and check everything , if_necessary pay for a professional inspection .
neutral	trip_advisor is extremely easy to use and the best place to quickly find reviews on places to stay .
neutral	i have never been unable to find the place i am searching for , and have stumbled_across some great places by_accident .
neutral	the thing to remember when reading people '_s reviews , is that a lot of it comes down to personal_taste .
neutral	i have had fabulous times at hotels that have had very bad_reviews .
neutral	there is always someone with something to complain_about no matter_how great the hotel or restaurant .
neutral	i ordered from missguided for the first time , as i wanted a onsie and they were doing a special free next_day delivery , however , the day the postman came to deliver , noone was in so i had to get it redelivered , but due to all the snow , it didn_'_t get delivered for another 0_days , and even then when he tried to delivery it , noone was in .
neutral	so , i arranged re - delivery again for a day someone was going to be in , and i found out he couldn_'_t even leave it with the neighbour because it required a signature .
neutral	and by then , i '_d already gone back to uni , so i had to get my mum to post it up to me .
neutral	so really next_day is really 0 and a half weeks for me .
neutral	most of the problems weren_'_t missguided '_s fault , but if i '_d of known a signature was required , i wouldn_'_t of gone with next_day delivery , as it could of been left with the neighbour then .
neutral	quite straight_forward
neutral	too many unnecessary changes that are not for the better .
neutral	good website for information about products particularly_liked the video .
neutral	felt i knew what i was getting .
neutral	i opted for next_day delivery and was kept i formed of delivery time .
neutral	the fridge_freezer was as expected good for the price there are only 0 of us so big enough .
neutral	for me there is a design flaw as there is a gap across front between top and bottom doors and this shows white , ok if it was a white model but doesn_'_t look good on the silver , would look better if doors were flush .
neutral	overall it was a good experience apart fr the morose delivery drivers no smiles or hello goodbyes just " where do you want it " !!
neutral	not good enough !
neutral	!
neutral	i '_ve_used p0g several_times , never having had a problem .
neutral	their prices are good and online customer service has always been excellent .
neutral	that said , the last time i used them , my parcel arrived damaged at its end destination .
neutral	for once i '_d taken out the insurance and thought it wouldn_'_t be too complicated a process to claim .
neutral	wrong .
neutral	i had to jump_through hoops - the process is incredibly_frustrating .
neutral	everything has to be done online with photographic_evidence .
neutral	" simple " i hear you say and indeed it is my preferred option of doing things , however ...
neutral	only one photograph per required section was permitted at a time , with a limited explanation as to what it shows - there are 0 sections in total .
neutral	i then had a painstaking wait to find out whether my evidence for each section had been accepted .
neutral	when evidence wasn_'_t accepted , there was no thorough explanantion as to why , just something along the lines of " refused , please resubmit ".
neutral	the timescales for submissions and getting it " right " are tight and with absolutely no human_being at p0g to discuss the matter with ( unless i dialled 0000 - err no thanks ), i found the process incredibly_frustrating and certainly not customer friendly .
neutral	you have to keep an eye on the site for updates to your claim , e_- mail reminders were inconsistent and timed ( in my mind ) to gloat and wind me up .
neutral	i repsonded to one of these e_-_mails with every_single photo of the damage that i had , explaining that there weren_'_t sufficient fields online .
neutral	the email was ignored .
neutral	every time they refused a submitted photo , it wasn_'_t made clear exactly_what they needed from me , nor did they seem to take into account previous photos submitted to tie all of the evidence together despite my asking them to in the comments field .
neutral	i had prepeared a very detrimental review to go on here , when amazingly at the midnight hour , my final photograph was accepted .
neutral	how did i finally get it through ?
neutral	at the end of my tether with them and clueless as to what they wanted , i went_onto photobucket and created a collage of 0 photos showing the damage .
neutral	each photo had an explanation of what was in it .
neutral	this was accepted within hours .
neutral	the most frustrating part was that all 0 of these photos had been submitted and refused on separate_occasions .
neutral	the claim went through and a cheque received within 0_days which i was astounded by .
neutral	this really was one the most frustrating experiences of customer service that i have received , which is such a shame because the live_chat has always been excellent .
neutral	will i use them again ?
neutral	not for now .
neutral	will i use yodel again .
neutral	no .
neutral	i '_ve since found a cheaper alternative who i will use .
neutral	i have no_doubt that none of the companies are perfect and think it '_s one of those where things are great unless something_goes_wrong .
neutral	they would of got 0_stars for quality and speed .
neutral	0 for price but because they sent wrong_colour boxes they get demoted to a 0 !
neutral	bouquet of flowers did not look very fresh , for amount of £_00 pound it can be a little_bit bigger , no any food flowers on bouqet
neutral	received 0 tablets in a cardboard_box about 00x00x00cm with loads of paper packaging .
neutral	ridiculous waste , and i paid for it too with high p_+_p_charges .
neutral	surely a graded p_+_p system could be introduced , rather_than a blanket cost ?
neutral	just a 0 tier system , say under 000g or over ?
neutral	one of the 0 white coats i purchased has a brown stain on the inside .
neutral	i decided to try a stain devil on it & it seems to have lifted , which has saved me all the bother of returning it !
neutral	l put order in just for ink not for quality photo_paper did not no l was getting that l got a bill for the paper and one for ink it was the same price that l payed , l would of got ink a bit cheaper seeing you charge me for the photo_paper which l did not order never used it before in my life l also spent over 00 pounds l should of got it free
neutral	not used it yet
neutral	the website was lovely and easy to use .
neutral	the acknowledgement of order came and they kept you informed , again all good .
neutral	they were drliuvered mid_morning on the saturday which was perfect but i have to say i was very disappointed with the flowers .
neutral	the strawberry_sundae bouquet looked nothing like on the website and to be honest looked like a hand picked bunch .
neutral	i have actually seen nicer bouquets in m & s for a fraction of the price .
neutral	i would usually use an interflora florist but thought i would try this company for a change .
neutral	i am afraid in the future i will be going back to ken fraser interflora as you get more flowers for your money and arranged far more professionally .
neutral	dissapointed .
neutral	check in for our villa was 0pm ( but you are warned the cleaners may be about until_0pm ... and they were !).
neutral	villa was fine , a little tired , marks and staining on some of the furniture but overall it looked the same as the photos on the villa_plus website .
neutral	cleaning was ok during our stay but not really to our standards .
neutral	in fact , the owner visited the villa during our stay and he changed out the mop himself as it was filthy .
neutral	cleaning with a filthy mop obviously hadn_'_t helped ... but that was down to the cleaners !
neutral	facilities within the villa were top_notch - everything supplied that you need and / or have at home .
neutral	pool and garden area lovely and very well_maintained .
neutral	only " issue " with villa_plus was that we booked well in_advance but when we logged on to their website again a few_months before travel , we noticed that a 0 - bed villa right next door was on the website for approx .
neutral	£_000 cheaper_than we had paid for a 0 - bed !
neutral	so , although we would use again , we certainly wouldn_'_t rush to book , especially for this location and especially when making an out of peak season booking .
neutral	mirror received was damaged , even after sending pictures i '_m not entitled to a refund until the damaged product is picked_up and then checked .
neutral	bought the hoodie for my husband for xmas , 0 washes on 00 and the stitching is coming apart so not_overly_impressed ...
neutral	i also ordered from zleeps and read on the website that my mattress_topper would be dispatched within 00_hours , however , after more than a week with no delivery i sent them a message via the website - the only way i could find of contacting them .
neutral	after_reading some of the reviews on here i was very nervous that i had been ' done ', and didn_'_t expect to receive either a reply or my topper .
neutral	however , i had a ' shipping confirmation ' reply the next_day , and my topper arrived the day after .
neutral	the topper itself seems to be good quality ( although it hasn_'_t been slept on yet ), and although the service was slower_than promised , i am now happy with my purchase .
neutral	so don_'_t give up yet if you '_ve ordered something .
neutral	perhaps i '_ve been lucky , but i suspect this company is fairly small and can '_t cope with the demand .
neutral	they need to change their website to be more honest about their delivery times , and make themselves more easily_contactable so that they can answer queries ( preferably by telephone ).
neutral	being hard to contact suggests to customers that there is something dishonest going on .
neutral	thank_you for my topper zleeps , and good luck to everyone else who has ordered - you may just need to be patient !
neutral	the jigsaw it self was ok , but the box it came in didn_'_t have my picture on the front !
neutral	!
neutral	ive used this company twice and have really enjyed it .
neutral	ordered mattress and pillows .
neutral	pillows arrived very promptly and we are very satisfied with them , when i contacted customer service they never answer the telephone but did respond to an_email to confirm the delivery for the mattress would be 0 - 0_weeks .
neutral	it '_s now 0_weeks and my order is still shown as dispatched .....
neutral	by sheer_luck i have managed to log_onto the delivery company website which in almost_impossible to access to find out that the mattress was being delivered that day !
neutral	leaving me the stress of rearranging a number of appointments .
neutral	or face paying for delivery !
neutral	the delivery company used are very poor , the man delivering was very polite and friendly but there is no notification when to expect the item and access the website is almost_impossible .
neutral	the product itself is very good and we are really pleased with the mattress .
neutral	i '_d even consider purchasing again but the only_thing that puts me off is the delivery arrangements .
neutral	if your a stay at home mum or dad and aren_'_t worried_about a four week wait then go for it .
neutral	the new check - in is a great idea if only it worked !
neutral	there are many_times when i try to check - in when in a store only for the dialogue box to come up " you must be in the store to check - in " but i am !
neutral	it also states " try going outside the store to check - in " - make up your mind please !
neutral	it takes_ages to connect and quite_frankly i don_'_t have the time to stand about or going in and out of the store trying again and again to check - in .
neutral	otherwise i like quidco very much - getting paid for doing your usual shopping , it '_s win , win .
neutral	i love amazon , however i recently ordered two wedding planners from two_separate trading partner through them .
neutral	first one in november , when the delivery was changed on a few occasions then when delivery went to end of jan , i had no choice but to cancel the order - after all was meant for a xmas_present !.
neutral	second one i ordered in december , delivery was also changed and then received a email from amazon cancelling the order !
neutral	so was very disappointed and had no choice but to go elsewhere !
neutral	i placed my order immediately and all went through fine .
neutral	i knew it would be delivered quickly as i '_d ordered through living_social .
neutral	the delivery was quicker_than i thought but the service around that was shocking .
neutral	i asked on 0 occasions what my delivery date would be and was given wrong days each time as the details weren_'_t supplied on the internet as they said it would be ( i had to wait in on these days ).
neutral	after a 0th phone_call the mattress was delivered with the box ripped_open and the mattress marked .
neutral	each time i called the person ( i think was the delivery manager ) on the end of the phone was being as helpful as possible and listened when i voiced how unhappy i was .
neutral	i think it was just a breakdown in systems .
neutral	i would order from them again - but insist on the 0st phone_call rather_than the 0th ....
neutral	la cartouche jaune ne marche pas .
neutral	je vous ai renseigné mais aucune réponse .
neutral	excellent service from yourselves regarding the invoicing and response , but having amended my delivery day with dpd - as i thought successfully - then having been promised delivery on a specific day , i was neither emailed an_hour delivery slot , nor did i receive the parcel .
neutral	i still do not know when to expect delivery as i now cannot enter a delivery day .
neutral	i am normally very happy with red_hot sunglasses in my previous_orders , but this time i am still_awaiting my item i placed the order 0 week_ago and haven_'_t had a dispatch email yet .
neutral	i have contacted customer_services but had no response , considering they are a birthday_present i '_m not very happy .
neutral	great products arrived on time .
neutral	however only bought from wiggle because of the £ 0 offer brought them in cheaper_than merlin but the offer did not materialise .
neutral	complained nicely but got nowhere .
neutral	guess i will stick with lbs and merlin !
neutral	the delivery was excellent good communication and on time ... full_marks but it was delivered in a box weighing 00_kg and they placed the desk the wrong way round ... as a single person i had to devise a way of getting the desk out of the very small room and out if all it '_s packaging ...
neutral	ridiculous ...
neutral	i managed it but it would have been so much_better if they had done it for me
neutral	i am quite prepared to believe that i made the wrong choice of coffee although i did try 0 different_varieties .
neutral	i really didn_'_t like any of them much and they are certainly not up to nespresso standard .
neutral	i '_m afraid i shan '_t be re - ordering in_spite of the good price .
neutral	no soya_milk or milk free items available ( am lactose_intolerant this ihas been medically diagnosed and disclosed .
neutral	was not advised i was at high risk of pvd due 0 my level of myopia and this condition arose within a few_weeks of surgery to both eyes .
neutral	this is the second time i have had to make contact with healthexpress in order to get the free international_shipping as its now not available as an option when you place your order online .
neutral	when i contacted them this time around i was told that they don_'_t like to use the royal_mail as items don_'_t turn_up .
neutral	i was welcome to use it if i like at my own_risk .
neutral	hmmm offer free international_shipping or if not don_'_t !
neutral	i hate to be guilt tripped into the extra £_00 needed for courier .
neutral	just for info , once again i went royal_mail and there were no_problems .
neutral	not sure if it last as long as my old bottle but to be fair its an old brand and only cost me £_00 .
neutral	this is the first time i have used alpha and the website was very user - friendly .
neutral	hoping the customer service will be too .
neutral	i was looking for nougat body_butter everywhere and was very happy to find it on this web - site .
neutral	i made a purchase and in less_than few hours got an_email_saying that this item is not available .
neutral	why was the item displayed if it is not available ?
neutral	it is very disappointing .
neutral	i wanted to rent a car , and purchase insurance .... i rented a car ( no_issues there ) and purchased the extra excess_insurance offered .....
neutral	when i rocked up to collect the car , i was told that if i wanted real insurance it would cost an additional 00 euro a day and that what i had purchased was some kinda insurance against the excess ( whatever that means ) .... the rental_car company then blocked off 0000_euro of my credit_card ( apparently this is the excess ).. i '_ve rented lots of cars in dublin and normally they block off between 000 - 000_euro .
neutral	0000_euro is a lot of money to block off on ones credit_card ( especially before a holiday !).
neutral	i cant_fault the car company ( triffity .. they were great , car was brand_new , staff very nice etc ) but i felt like i had been ripped_off by this excess_insurance because i didnt get the insurance i wanted , and i had a very large_amount blocked on my credit_card which was the main_reason i wanted the extra insurance .
neutral	they need to make it clearer on this web_site what you are and arent getting .
neutral	all i wanted was a car and enough insurance that if the car blew up , was robbed , burnt out or driven off the side of a cliff i wouldnt have to pay for it .... anyways nothing bad happened to the car but it pissed me off ....
neutral	lavender cottage weymouth -
neutral	firstly i have to say this is a beautiful house and should be loved much more than it is .
neutral	wi_-_fi - despite asking in_advance and it being advertised as having wi_-_fi the cottage itself doesn_'_t have a hub , it piggy backs off the wifi of the owners next door .
neutral	several comments were made about the wi_-_fi in the guest_book , yet the owners had done nothing .
neutral	we had to skype our relatives in australia at christmas and due to signal being non_existent we had to call blue_chip and contact the owners about the quality .
neutral	blue_chip offered to pay for a dongle ( although they never called back to confirm this despite saying they would ) but the owners eventually replied the next_day and put a booster in the property which did enhance the signal and enabled_us to have contact with our family at christmas .
neutral	kitchen_equipment - this cottage had one of the worst equipped kitchens i have ever stayed in .
neutral	two pans and one roasting dish to cook christmas_dinner , we had to contact the owner to ask for more !!!
neutral	once again this had been highlighted in the guest_book , yet the owners had chosen to ignore the comments and not fix the problem .
neutral	also no knife_block , only five large dinner_plates when the cottage sleeps six and to be honest the crockery looked cheap and not really fitting with a so called platinum house .
neutral	through no one '_s fault we had quite a lot of leaks in the storms , four windows leaked so we asked for old towels to put to mop up the water , a day later someone bought one towel , i pointed_out that we need four and he said he '_d be back , he never arrived .
neutral	perhaps the owner could concentrate more on the cottage business rather_than worrying_about promoting their other interest s aka the local village pub , you '_ll find the pub is the first place the on site book recommends you to eat at and it also has vouchers to promote it .
neutral	we felt we just didn_'_t matter in the cottage .
neutral	the radiator was also broken in our elderly_parents room and perhaps if the heating had been switched on ready for the guests ( a nice_touch in december to welcome your guests who have paid a lot of money ) this could have been spotted .
neutral	as it was we arrived in a cold house which had previously been empty for a while which_meant that heating it back up took overnight , very unpleasant for our parents at the age of 00 and 00 .
neutral	we were allowed to arrive an_hour early but arriving at the stated time would not have made any difference as the heating would still not have been on until the time of 0 pm .
neutral	it would have been more welcoming if maybe it had of been switched on that morning .
neutral	we must acknowledge that the next_day a portable heater was provided by the owners for our parents room .
neutral	the christmas_tree was a lovely touch but the room in which we ate dinner had nothing at all , as it also did not have much natural light due to a wall near to the window so it made christmas_dinner very uneventful and sad .
neutral	the mulled_wine and mince_pies which had been promised by the blue_chip website had become a standard bottle of wine and some biscuits , once again no festive touch at all and to be honest disappointing , id rather not be promised anything .
neutral	oh and don_'_t drink the coffee sachets left in the house they went out of date in september !
neutral	and be careful with the snug fireplace , the smoke comes back into the room , the chimney may need cleaning .
neutral	the carpets are cream in the main living_area downstairs and stained in places and a huge worry for any dog owner staying due to dog hair and dog_walks , the bathroom is carpeted too which isn_'_t ideal or hygienic when its the main toilet area for all .
neutral	i found myself hoovering a lot as i was concerned .
neutral	the house was lovely in most ways apart for the dining and kitchen experience and the lack of customer_care and thought by the owners .
neutral	we paid for a platinum cottage due to coming with our elderly_parents one with dementia and for us to have no_worries and stresses , as we were caring for them , it was sad that we did not have the service we were expecting .
neutral	i hope the owners read this and get the house sorted and begin to start caring for house and its guests , its such a waste otherwise .
neutral	blue_chip please don_'_t put your standard comments on the reply to this post , its not great customer service and frankly its insulting , it isn_'_t personal to the customer and its just marketing .
neutral	you can always actually contact us to talk this through if the feedback actually means anything to you at all .
neutral	at the end of the day its your advertising we book on and its your responsibility to check that what we are seeing is in fact in place and that your clients are looked after .
neutral	i work in customer service myself and your feedback on other comments is nothing short of well written rehearsed standard responses which mean nothing .
neutral	remember under the buying and selling of goods_act , it is your company that needs to make_sure the products you are selling are correct and that facilities that are stated are in place , as you are accountable .
neutral	picture quality not great .
neutral	and the large calendar i ordered had the imprint of the smaller calendar '_s metal binding on the first couple of pages due to there being no protective_packaging round the smaller one .
neutral	unfortunately the service is only as good as the courier used and my first bouquet went_astray !
neutral	the customer service from serenataflowers was great as they instantly agreed that the situation was not acceptable and offered a refund or a second_attempt the next_day .
neutral	the second bouquet arrived ( heaven only knows what happened to the first one !)
neutral	and was much_appreciated by my daughter .
neutral	from the photo she sent me , i '_m_glad i ' upgraded ' to the deluxe_bouquet as anything less would have been rather underwhelming and i '_m still quite sad that i lost the element of surprise as i had to ask my daughter about the first lot of flowers that didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	have to say that the situation was well handled by serenata though - well_done .
neutral	there are a number of companies i regularly use via_topcashback and every time i have to chase and chase for the payment , some of them i now choose to get avios points from instead of using topcashback , via the british_airways site which is a shame .
neutral	one is tescos wine which never ever automatically shows up , drives me mad .
neutral	however , the bacs_payment system is very efficient and i will_continue to use topcashback a lot .
neutral	no complaint with the delivery .
neutral	products were all good , but exchanges are a real pain .
neutral	you have to buy a new product before you return the old one , so you pay twice , unless you want to wait for your refund and then order again the preferred product .
neutral	v annoying .
neutral	my biggest complaint is the packaging of an ipad_air costing_£_000 . 00 .
neutral	this was delivered in a thin grey regular plastic_bag without bubble_wrap or any other protection , i was disgusted .
neutral	the item is a christmas gift and could easily have got bashed , squashed or internally damaged especially with all the extra christmas parcels on the van .
neutral	the corners are slightly scuffed but it could have been much worse .
neutral	it will not be opened until christmas day and i am hoping it will be working ok .
neutral	i would not trust them again for ordering anything such as this , for such an expensive item costing more than a lot of their tumble driers and washers they should take more care and have more respect for the customers by giving it the best chance of getting to them undamaged and in good condition by using protective_packaging .
neutral	in big comparison , i ordered an ipad_air smart case £_00 from a different store as the co op did not have it , this was delivered today .
neutral	it arrived inside a box with lots of protective semi rigid paper packing around it so that it didn_'_t move and was well_protected , result is that it arrived undamaged in good condition and nicely presentable for a christmas gift .
neutral	what a shame .
neutral	decent website , reasonable_prices , good discount_codes , free delivery , delivered quickly within time_slot .
neutral	just let_down by packaging .
neutral	please co - op improve your packaging for smaller items !
neutral	package was delivered to wrong depot so not sent to recipient on required day .
neutral	would have preferred to call customer service rather_than having to use email to correspond .
neutral	was offerer refund but as i still wanted the product delivered accepted the offer if a box of chocolates as compensation .
neutral	however if i '_d realised how small the box was going to be would have accepted the refund !!
neutral	!
neutral	it was a shame to have this relative experience as i have used the company several_times before and have always been more than happy with the service .
neutral	however this experience has left me feeling less_than satisfied as a customer and leads me to question as to whether or not i '_d used them again .
neutral	maybe something slightly better in the way of compensation would have been appreciated !
neutral	!
neutral	good initiative for a great cause !
neutral	i was irritated by how many emails were sent out .
neutral	i would have prefered just to make the order and trust it would be delivered .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t use again if i thought that they were going to just dump them in the doorstep .
neutral	i spent far too much money for that to happen - would would have happened if they were stolen ?
neutral	would i get my money back ?
neutral	or a replacement bouquet ?
neutral	the deposit was in my account within the 0 hours specified , however they take the money back at a not so good time and then when it says you can deposit another 000_pound it doesn_'_t let you add anything which is not very good if you specify an amount that a customer can borrow they should be able to have that amount not say available amount then when u process it not let you take anything out .
neutral	you have to call an 0000 number which costs you more money on top of what you are going to borrow , not very good .
neutral	the deals are good , but only the odd one comes up that i '_m actually interested in .
neutral	maybe show new products / deals only and not stuff that '_s been done before .
neutral	emails twice a day is too much !
neutral	bought honeypot bramble playhouse for my granddaughters - thought it sounded really good - not so .
neutral	the upstairs is fine but it is very small downstairs and my granddaughters age 0 and 0 have to bend down on all fours to access this area - not good at all .
neutral	the balcony is very flimsy only a couple of screws holding it in place - dangerous really .
neutral	the gap round the door is excessive and the place will be waterlogged when it rains and the hinge has already broken so the door is hanging off - only got it today .
neutral	.
neutral	it was supposed to come with a bucket of wood treatment free but have not received it and i paid for it putting up and only one man came to erect it and so my son - in - law had to help - very disappointed and will complain .
neutral	the outer_wrapping of the parcel was damaged , whether this was due to rough treatment or bad wrapping on my part is unknown .
neutral	the furniture i ordered is beautiful but on inspection two of the handles had been fitted incorrectly and were broken .
neutral	the delivery guys noted it on the delivery invoice and assured me that replacements would be posted out to me that was on 00 march and i am still_waiting .
neutral	i have called the company on two more occasions and both_times i have been promised that the handles would be sent out .
neutral	i paid a lot of money for my mirrorred bedroom_furniture and the broken handles spoil the whole effect .
neutral	i am disappointed with the company as they have never rang me to apologise for the delay .
neutral	looks like i will have to ring them again .
neutral	the tickets on viagogo are something like 0 times face value which is an unacceptable profit for them .
neutral	they are taking_advantage of fans and ripping them off .
neutral	viagogo and companies like them are allowed to buy large bulk amounts of tickets for venues which prevents normal fans getting tickets themselves .
neutral	we are then obliged to buy through these massive agencies at an_enormous mark - up or go without .
neutral	my ticket for one direction at barcelona had a face value of €_00 (£_00 ).
neutral	i had to buy through viagogo at the unbelievable price of €_000 and then there was a booking_fee on top of €_000 !!!!!
neutral	outrageous .
neutral	unfair .
neutral	criminal .
neutral	should not be allowed .
neutral	great tasting_coffee !
neutral	x the only minus_point is that you have to really push hard to close the machine in order to pierce the pods .
neutral	i must_say it worries me a bit that its ruining the machine x
neutral	i was very pleased to find the product arrived so fast .
neutral	was disappointed once i opened the package .
neutral	the casing is not dry with beads falling_off and the pink shimmering powder stained my pants and hands .
neutral	can '_t even use it .
neutral	this is the third order i have made the internet sight is excellent , easy to use and order from .
neutral	choice of tiles as good as i found .
neutral	delivery cost was much too high because my address is west of scotland although not remote or island yet i pay over_£_00 . 00 for a delivery whatever the size .
neutral	as it is delivery took 0 more day than_predicted which was not a problem living where we do we are used to this but object to paying extra on top of this .
neutral	my last order was small and aprox .
neutral	00 of the tiles had chips or worse in one corner my builder used them for cutting to put at the edge , i have a couple left should you want to see the damage .
neutral	love your sight and tiles but too expensive to use all the time because of delivery .
neutral	a mcarthur
neutral	the flowers arrived on time and my mum was very happy , my only critisum is that i specifically_asked the flowers to be left by the back as the front isn_'_t secure at all , this was ignored , so when i got the message to say the flowers where left at the front i had to ring my mum up to make_sure she got them before someone_else , therefore runig the surprise somewhat .
neutral	overall service was ok , i ordered the bespoke wedding_invites that you can mix and match .
neutral	the invites were good quality , although a couple did have slight marks on them , and i also thought they came with a boarder on them ( not sure if that was my mistake or theirs ).
neutral	however they did arrive after about 0_days and and overall i was pleased with them .
neutral	i would use the service again and have recommended them to friends and family .
neutral	th service can not be_faulted .
neutral	however the latest parcel arrived sealed on three sides only .
neutral	the parcel looked as if it had not been sealed before transit .. luckily nothing was lost .
neutral	i had to pull everything out on the doorstep before the delivery driver could leave .
neutral	i also find it difficult to access animed via an apple ipad .
neutral	ordered 0 baci harley davidson mugs which took weeks to be delivered .
neutral	on delivery they were damaged due to not being packed properly ( they are china mugs ).
neutral	after a quick email to go_electrical they were very good and this time i had prompt delivery with a replacement which was wrapped in another box with packaging !
neutral	i was directed to a firm with the understanding that they would handle my case .
neutral	this did not happen .
neutral	i had no problem booking on line as a foot_passenger everything went perfectly .
neutral	the day itself though was a great disappointment with 0 young_children i was totally abandoned in france when we got off ferry .. our sailing was with p_& o .
neutral	would never go as a foot_passenger again .
neutral	it was very unnerving .
neutral	my first item was great , hose_pipe , but then i had issues , the telephone head set from time0 was rubbish and i got my money back but no refund on p_&_p so out of pocket .
neutral	the i ordered the bra and pants set , it arrived - bra is lovely but pants are not pants but a thong , complianed to wowcher but herd nothing yet .
neutral	i have also ordered the leggings they are ok but quaity a bit rubbish , but ok for the price .
neutral	finally i have chosen the moisture mittens and socks and despite chasing them have still not recieved them !!
neutral	so wowocher deals are good but often the supplier does nto deleiver what it promises :(
neutral	ordered a gopro silver edition , i rang initially and was told it was out of stock , they double_checked and rang me back to advise they should be able to order from the supplier .
neutral	i asked if the package could be delivered to another address as the camera was a present for christmas and i didn_'_t want my boyfriend to intercept it , i was told for security_reasons as a new customer they could only deliver to the address of the credit_card ; bit_annoying but ok .
neutral	ordered the camera and then the day before delivery was due i rang them to check as i needed to take a day off work , only to be told the delivery address didn_'_t match the credit_card address exactly and i needed to send proof of address in the form of a credit_card bill etc .
neutral	it took another few_days and a day off work to finally get the camera .
neutral	i got there in the end but it was a bit of a hassle , customer service were reasonable good although if i hadn_'_t have rung to check the first time i may have wasted a day '_s holiday sitting at home for a parcel that was never going to arrive .
neutral	oh and they won_'_t give you the tracking_number of your parcel , again for security_reasons ?!
neutral	so you can '_t track your parcel .
neutral	i was a bit disappointed with our_wedding book as some photos are blurry and grainy ( almost pixelated ) which make some look like they have been put through a filter or effect .
neutral	they are professional photos and very large files so this should not have happened .
neutral	i was going to return the book but realise that i should not have had such high expectations for a book that cost me £_00 .
neutral	i would like to suggest that if a picture is going to be blown up over a double page spread or if the quality isn_'_t perhaps up to scratch , that jessops and cewe warn you , either by a pop - up or by contacting you directly as i would have then been warned and my expectations would not have been so high .
neutral	i would also like to suggest another warning that indicates using a photo on the cover of the book alters the clarity of the photo and also the colours in the photo , as i am very disappointed by the cover of ours .
neutral	i compare my wedding book to a jessops and cewe book we got last month on our travelling photos and that one is so much_better , we were over the moon with it and that is why we ' took the risk ' and made our_wedding book with jessops .
neutral	i don_'_t understand_why a book with professional photos and not our own came out not as well .
neutral	there are only 0 photos in our book with photos that we are not happy with and that is why i '_ve rated it a 0 .
neutral	we took_advantage of a brilliant cheap 00 hour return deal to see some of the countryside and beaches near calais .
neutral	the ferry was a little late going out but we didn_'_t mind that .
neutral	with a crossing of only an_hour and a half we were happy to sit and read until land was in sight .
neutral	driving off the ferry and onto the road south was easy .
neutral	we had a real problem on the way back though with finding our ferry boarding point in the huge calais terminal .
neutral	we missed it completely , eventually realised we had gone too far and had to turn round and drive back .
neutral	we only found it in the nick of time .
neutral	apart_from that slightly unnerving experience it was a great trip and terrific value for money .
neutral	i received the cricket_bat very promptly but it looked as if it had been used before - part of the sticker was missing and it was marked .
neutral	i e_mailed the company asking about the returns_procedure and got a standard e_mail by return telling_me to visit the website .
neutral	it still wasnt clear if the company would pay for the return postage so i re - emailed asking the question - again i got a standardised response .
neutral	i have returned the bat and await to see if my postage is refunded !
neutral	!
neutral	i received the roman_blinds which are good enough quality but i asked for a pattern match ( for a bay_window ) and it doesn_'_t exactly match .
neutral	i did contact customer service who asked for a photograph but i just don_'_t have the time to deal with the hassle of waiting another 0_weeks for a replacement blind so will be adjusting them when hanging them instead .
neutral	i am pretty disappointed at this after_spending over_£_000 but as i have my daughter '_s christening at our home this weekend , i can '_t wait for a new one to be made .
neutral	i bought a fridge_freezer for my dad who is 00 .
neutral	i did most of the communication but there was a call the day before delivery which was originally meant for him .
neutral	the caller proceeded to outline some kind of breakdown insurance that i never buy .
neutral	she was quite insistent and if it had been my 00_yr_old dad on the phone he would have been made to feel that he should take this .
neutral	for this i am not sure i would use them again despite_being very impressed in every other way .
neutral	please change your system .
neutral	it doesn_'_t account for 00_yr olds who are easily confused and easily led .
neutral	i recently bought a vivienne_westwood jacket with which i was and continue to be delighted , however two_days after my purchase and within time for me to return the item , i saw that it had been reduced by £_00 .
neutral	i requested that i should be reimbursed with the difference , given that i could have returned the item and bought the cheaper one .
neutral	my request was refused .
neutral	other prestigious retailers do this as normal and good practice .
neutral	until this i was very pleased with the service .
neutral	i remain very disappointed , moreover i was promised a discount in the future as a sop to my request but i am still_waiting for that .
neutral	easy to order on line but we were surprised that when we collected the , quite heavy , items they were left for my elderly husband to lift into the car .
neutral	i cannot understand as to why we are being asked to write a review when all we have done is booked a holiday on - line for later this year - what is the point ?
neutral	blue_chip haven_'_t had to do anything for us to rate them on yet as on - line booking is as it says on - line .
neutral	if however we had reached our destination then we could rate blue_chip on the condition of the property , whether the location was as stated , was it clean , was there sufficient linens etc and how the process of getting the key went .
neutral	i suppose the on - line process we went through is what they are after but the correspondence doesn_'_t state that !
neutral	so lets go then : the looking for properties to rent was easy and straightforward as all you had to do was put in your preferences and a list came out .
neutral	we selected a property and paid a deposit on - line - simples !
neutral	what more can we say ?
neutral	good site , my only small complaint is that i sent an enquiry about delivery , which was important to me as i needed the product to take on holiday 0_days_later , and they didn_'_t reply .
neutral	the product arrived after i had left the country .
neutral	the prices were good and the parcel was well_wrapped .
neutral	i have only ever ordered items through other_companies but apparently you can buy things direct ?
neutral	i ordered a lot of things before christmas and most of it arrived without_any problem , the jewellery i ordered took quite a while and i was really disappointed with the quality , i feel some some companies are making up the retail prices .
neutral	i also am still fighting to get a refund for an item i have not received , it was ordered 0_weeks_ago and i thought it would be the highlight of my boyfriends christmas , but sugarush love have been slow and difficult , not to mention unapologetic !
neutral	i have now given up and just trying to get a refund .
neutral	on a positive_note your complaints team have been quick and efficient , i just think you should be more selective with who you chose to work with .
neutral	it was quite fast and easy to order , but i found difficulties with products that were out of stock , already when there is a small variety of products
neutral	i was offered a choice of three distributors that had the part that i needed for my daughters car .
neutral	i chose spares 0 your car ltd because it had the most stars and the best reviews , also it was a couple of pounds_cheaper_than the other two .
neutral	i was told that it was going to be delivered the very next_day on wednesday 00 / 00 and here we are two_weeks_later and my daughter still_hasn_'_t received it .
neutral	i have left various messages and spoken to the operator on a couple of occasions but still we wait .
neutral	i paid £ 0 . 00 for 0st_class postage so i '_m obviously very unhappy .
neutral	the reason i '_ve given parts_gateway only 0_stars is because i trusted their reviews and i was let_down_badly .
neutral	loved the crown website and really liked all my brushes ( badger hair powder brush , bullet brush and slanted blusher brush ).
neutral	just found that the online purchasing experiance was not that great .
neutral	there was no follow_up email and no delivery info .
neutral	when i selected to track my order it constantly said that i had been despatched ( even after delivery ) which was unhelpful .
neutral	also the time it took was quite lenghty and without a more detailed delivery summary i can see how it would put people off .
neutral	however they failed to mention that next_day delivery to such a place as the oil capital of europe was not a next_day delivery .......
neutral	i order numerous_times a year with printzone and have always been impressed with their competitive_prices and super_fast delivery ( sometimes next_day delivery ).
neutral	however this time , our package ( photo_paper and ink ), took almost a week to arrive and some of the packaging of the ink was knocked about and damaged .
neutral	disappointed this time round but will_continue to use printzone and hope to receive the excellent service previously experienced .
neutral	on arriving at the airport we had been told there would be someone thee with an a0b clipboard with our name on it . there wasn_'_t , after asking everybody we finally found the rep and was herded to the side with a lot of other people and told to wait . we were took to the other side of the car_park and then had to wait for a car to come for us . on arriving at the hotel we were told we did not have a booking , they would give us a room for the night but we had to sign to say we would pay if the agent didn_'_t come up with the money .
neutral	we had to contact alpha_rooms who in turn had to contact someone_else and then get back to me .
neutral	all in all not a very good start to the holiday , in a foreign_country with potentially no booking .
neutral	not very happy people at all .
neutral	it was eventually sorted but not an experience i wish to have again .
neutral	unlike tesco they know they don_'_t rule the world so do shop there
neutral	sometimes hit or miss
neutral	need to look at their customer service and re - train some of their staff
neutral	tiles arrived later than_expected , when i phoned to ask why , i unfortunately dealt_with what must be the rudest assistant they have .
neutral	i was told it must be my fault and she constantly interrupted me .
neutral	when i politely asked her to please stop interrupting me she said i was being rude to her !
neutral	when my tiles finally arrived they were all smashed and unusable .
neutral	i telephoned again and thankfully dealt_with a much more reasonable person_who was polite , apologetic and placed a replacement order for me .
neutral	my faith is restored but it still lost me three_days , i have emailed walls and floors to complain but they haven_'_t replied yet .
neutral	i went on the website and asked for a call back to renew my policy but did not receive a call . i then e_mailed and asked for a call but still did not receive a call .
neutral	so i had to call and hold the line for a while which cost me money .
neutral	the person i spoke to was efficient and my policy was renewed . she apologised for the fact i got no call back but could not explain_why .
neutral	i have no idea how long my delivery took to arrive as several days afterwards i discovered it ( completely by_accident ) outside the house on the doorstep of a door that we never use !
neutral	no card had been posted through to tell me that the delivery had been left_outside .
neutral	not very impressed as it could quite easily have been stolen and i imagine that would have been a complicated and difficult situation to resolve .
neutral	good shopping_experience , too bad they dont have some of the more popular choices for people my age .
neutral	good service anyway
neutral	sales service was good but found that although the drivers mat was a perfect_fit for terios automatic , the rest of the mats weren_'_t the same shape as the old ones .
neutral	so although adequate and will probably do the job ok i was disappointed with the fit .
neutral	cupboard didn_'_t arrive when it should have and when it did come two_days_later not only was the box damaged but so was the cupboard .
neutral	the shoe storage struggled to occomodate size eight shoes and some wouldn_'_t fit at all unless placed at an angle on the shelf , if put straight the door doesn_'_t close properly .
neutral	if you have a man in the house wearing size eight or above shoes i wouldn_'_t recommend this cupboard even_though it looked quite nice when eventually built .
neutral	the corner of the top of the cupboard was chiped as was one of the doors .
neutral	i ordered insulin on sunday - i realise that this is not a working day so was expecting the product to turn_up on tuesday , because of its nature the website said it would be on " next_day delivery " by courier .
neutral	nothing appeared on tuesday or wednesday so on thursday i contacted the courier to find out what was happening .
neutral	i was informed that the driver had been taken ill the day before and had missed the trunking deadline so it never got to the local_depot for delivery to me .
neutral	the product did turn_up on thursday and it was well_packaged and still cold due to the ice_packs included so i can '_t fault animed on this score .
neutral	it would have just been nice to have been informed by the courier of the delay .
neutral	this was vital medicine afterall .
neutral	delivery is by parcel_force , who failed to deliver or leave a note that it had to be collected at the post_office , as i had paid £ 0 . 00 for delivery although it was post fairly fast , i still did not get it delivered as expected
neutral	car was very nice and what was expected .
neutral	disagreed with the diesel policy .
neutral	we were charged 00 pounds for a full_tank , however we only used a quarter and we were unable to get a refund .
neutral	what we thought was a good price turned_out to be expensive .
neutral	i have used your company about 0 times before and you have always been excellent , very polite and always here very quickly but sadly this time that was not the case as i was initially not given the emergency_number and told that there would not be an apt for about 0_days as you wanted someone to be at home from 0 - 0 and as i work i had to wait but when i was given the emergency_number i thought that i would phone them and was told i could have an apt in 0_days instead having been told there were none available a few mins before .
neutral	i then took the day off work on monday and at 0 . 00 i got a call saying that they could not get_hold of the driver and as i was an_hour away from the previous apt they thought that he would not make it .
neutral	so having taken a day off work no one came .
neutral	they made another apt for wed_morning which someone did come and mend the leak , when i spoke to them about what had happened he said that they can always get_hold of the drivers so thought that it sounded very odd .
neutral	so i feel very let_down which is such a shame as i am always telling people what a good company you are but now i worry if i need to use you again .
neutral	look_forward to your response .
neutral	i had booked in munich airport a vw_golf or similar and i was given a huge chevrolait .
neutral	i was very disappointed that i would have to drive that car .
neutral	after driving towards salzburg i got a flat_tyre on the car in the middle of nowhere at around 00pm .
neutral	on my paperwork where 0 numbers .
neutral	one was not answering and the other was unobtainable .
neutral	i found one number on the windscreen which was the same than on my paper and not able to get through .
neutral	i waited_till the morning after 0 am and was hoping someone would answer the phone .
neutral	unfortunately no one answered it .
neutral	i had to ring my daughter in london , she got in touch with the original company i had booked in the uk .
neutral	she was given a number in hamburg .
neutral	finally i spoke to someone in salzburg .
neutral	they where very helpful and came to pick me up .
neutral	i was then given a golf and went on my way .
neutral	i got to my destination 00_hours_later than i should have .
neutral	the staff in salzburg where very professional but i think a 00 hour brake down number would have been appropriate to have on my paperwork .
neutral	as i found one number on the wind screen i did not continue to look for other numbers in the car .
neutral	i later realized there was a further number on the sun_visor .
neutral	a spare_tyre would have solved the problem all together .
neutral	i was unfortunate to have had a puncture .
neutral	yours_sincerely
neutral	rita patel
neutral	the lights came covered in fragile_tape but the ends of the package was insecure , thankfully still working .
neutral	not dispatched quick enough !
neutral	i recently_purchased the superdry cagoule in large and it came up too small and am a size 00 top .
neutral	shame you don_'_t do xl in this jacket as love the colour .
neutral	i ordered a curtain_pole , 0 dormer rods and some dormer rod supports .
neutral	the curtain_pole and dormer rod supports turned_up very promptly 0_days before delivery was expected , however the dormer rods were absent , with no_indication of a follow_up order being on the way .
neutral	i sent an_email to customer_services , who responded that day with an_apology and explanation that they had been out of stock ( perhaps their stock control system could do with some attention ?).
neutral	the dormer rods duly_arrived the next_day .
neutral	overall i was pleased to have received my order promptly , but if i had taken time off work to receive the delivery it wouldn_'_t have worked smoothly at all .
neutral	fortunately i happened to be in when the deliveries arrived .
neutral	the poles themselves are good , so no_worries_about products .
neutral	the dressing_table is good value for money .
neutral	however , the delivery left something to be desired .
neutral	i stayed in all day monday and it didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	i rang at 0 . 00 p . m . as advised , but didn_'_t get an explanation .
neutral	it arrived on the tuesday with no apology .
neutral	as the literature had said that if i wasn_'_t in to sign for delivery there would be a charge to re - deliver , i emailed the store to ask if i could make a charge for non - delivery , and got no reply .
neutral	so - not great customer service .
neutral	took my car in for its mot , it passed but a load of advisory '_s were mentioned so i asked if they could be done the next_day and they said that it could .
neutral	i took my car in the next_day at 0am and was told to pick it up at 0pm .
neutral	the work was carried_out , and i was charged almost £_000 in total .
neutral	i was then told by another mechanic at my local that i could have got the same things done for half the price , and that the work probably didn_'_t need doing that urgently in any case .
neutral	next time i will get a second opinion before rushing to get the advisory '_s done
neutral	top rooms is quick and easy to use but i booked a balcony room in lynton , devon and chose a particular guest_house because of the balcony and views .
neutral	i paid in full .
neutral	a few hours_later the owners rang to say they were sorry but their balcony room had been booked up and i should not have been able to book it .
neutral	they only had a standard double at the back of the house .
neutral	i was disappointed .
neutral	perhaps it was a computer blip but i would double_check in future .
neutral	tuesday july 0 my mums_birthday - got my request in good time for the deadline for a same day delivery and thrilled to know it would get to my mum on her special after what has_been a very very difficult few_months ney years actually - when i chose the bouquet i was over the moon to note that bramble the bear was available to accessorise .
neutral	my mother is just potty about all animals and i judged bramble would prompt a squeal and the flowers would be a pleasant and welcome second best .
neutral	later in the day i was informed that the delivery could not be made as requested but that it would be in good faith the next_day and the offer of an upgrade was made .
neutral	the flowers selected were in my option perfect and sometimes less is more and so instead i asked that chocolates be added .
neutral	registered my disappointment but as a positive soul for the most part i regarded the matter to be well resolved .
neutral	thankfully no mention of bramble '_s imminent_arrival was forcast but i know for sure that had she arrived squeals of delight would have be heard for many miles .
neutral	bramble was not available and you must ensure in future that disappointed be avoided and only promise if indeed availability is guaranteed .
neutral	if in doubt then say so on the web_site .
neutral	i '_ve worked in the service sector for years and honesty is the best policy .
neutral	perhaps invest a little in the transparency of availability re stock .
neutral	you see my father this year has_been poorly and so unable to gift her in the usual way even purchase of a card would have been impossible for him .
neutral	well there we go and thanks for the chance to tell my little story
neutral	lots of choice in store but website was cluttered and difficult to browse which put me off initially .
neutral	the store was well staffed although all staff were downstairs so we had to go and find someone when we were ready to purchase .
neutral	staff were polite and friendly .
neutral	i couldn_'_t_believe that when we sat down to arrange a delivery we were told that the furniture may split as it acclimatises to this country and being in a home because the wood is from abroad !
neutral	we were then encouraged to buy overpriced furniture wax and a longer guarantee at an additional_cost of £_00 , the sales_guy looked embarrassed when i called him on it and we actually got both for £ 0 .
neutral	really felt that we were being_ripped_off !
neutral	why isn_'_t it offered at this price to all customers and not just when risking a sale .
neutral	i would definitely warn_others about this before recommending shopping here .
neutral	our arrival at the port , parking , checking in , boarding were all good experiences with friendly helpful staff .
neutral	the problems started for us the following_morning when we were informed we would be arriving in holland late .
neutral	this seriously ate into our short amsterdam break and we were not even offered a cup of coffee to compensate .
neutral	the experience of disembarking was awful .
neutral	it felt like like we were in a cattle_market being herded very slowly without_any information .
neutral	it took such a long time and i was watching our precious time in amsterdam ticking away .
neutral	lucky for us we had booked to stay a night otherwise our mini_cruise would have consisted of an_hour and a half in amsterdam which would have been a complete_waste of money .
neutral	i don_'_t think i would use dfds for a mini_cruise again .
neutral	a very expensive way to spend a very short time in amsterdam .

neutral	won_'_t use them again .
neutral	i am unsure how to review our furniture .
neutral	we received it yesterday and from the order through to delivery it was seamless .
neutral	however , whilst i like it i am really not sure about the quality .
neutral	we ordered two chest of drawers and two bedside_cabinets .
neutral	a couple of the handles do not fit properly and are loose .
neutral	one of the drawers hardly opens and feels_like it '_s going to break any moment .
neutral	what is more concerning though is the wood itself .
neutral	one of the cabinets , well it just does not look like wood !
neutral	it appears to have a layer of laminate .
neutral	i have waxed all of it as advised , and again it '_s like waxing plastic .
neutral	i cannot hand on heart say it is laminate but am not convinced it '_s not !
neutral	yes , it '_s good value if it '_s wood but if not ?
neutral	i will stick to john_lewis in future !
neutral	!
neutral	i spent a while pricing made - to - measure_blinds and blinds 0 go beat the competition_hands_down on price .
neutral	i checked the reviews to make_sure that there wasn_'_t a reason for the comparatively low_prices ( they are still not cheap ) so i felt_confident that i was buying a decent product .
neutral	first my blinds came without_any of the fittings needed to hang them .
neutral	i got in touch with the customer service team and they placed an order for the fittings to be sent to me straight_away .
neutral	these things_happen , the issue was dealt_with and so far as i could tell from taking the blinds out of the box but not opening them out ( in case the whole lot had to go back ), the blinds looked exactly_what i wanted .
neutral	when i opened the envelope containing the fittings , there were just two brackets .
neutral	they are not the colour of the blind ( they are dirty white and the blind is stone coloured ) and they were full of dust and scratched .
neutral	the instructions suggest that i should have also received some fitments to hold the cover for the top of the blind and i was certainly going to need to fit the cover to hide the worn looking brackets .
neutral	i decided that i had some screws i could use and i '_m_sure i can improvise with some double_sided velcro to hold the cover on - anything to get the blinds up .
neutral	unfortunately , they hadn_'_t been strung properly and the left sided string quickly shot up through the slats as i pulled the control strings to test the rising mechanism .
neutral	i figured i could thread the string back through and secure it so spent 0 - 00_minutes doing this .
neutral	then the tilt mechanism didn_'_t work .
neutral	i took the blind down and it looked like it hadn_'_t been fitted properly .
neutral	i have jiggled about with it and managed to get it working but it is still incredibly stiff and the strings are thin - i wont_be surprised if the strings snap .
neutral	i am yet to test my theory on double_sided velcro because i need to find some first .
neutral	i could have been really unlucky with my first purchase but i '_m not sure if i '_m feeling brave or charitable enough to give blinds 0 go a second chance .
neutral	order and delivery process was good , the only down_side was having to pay for delivery and returns and the upfront £ 0 . 00 discounted returns_label .
neutral	bearing in mind the price of the good sold this should all be free as with other quality retailers .
neutral	bought a nest of tables that did not match the photo .
neutral	asked for them to be collected and a refund given .
neutral	collection by city_link was not arranged when promised so i used up a day '_s leave for nothing .
neutral	then there was much confusion between the two companies .
neutral	eventually the tables were collected .
neutral	since then - no refund , no replies to my phone_calls and emails .
neutral	i have been promised the refund 0 times_now but they still have my money .
neutral	they took the payment immediately and then emailed to say that the product would not be sent for over a month .
neutral	avoid this company at all costs .
neutral	update - i finally got a refund from them with the delivery costs refunded as well but it took quiet a few phone_calls .
neutral	i think that jessops produce a quality product but the software used to produce the photobooks is , in my experience , not user - friendly .
neutral	i initially had trouble logging - in .
neutral	then difficulty in uploading_photos .
neutral	then how to save my work was not obvious .
neutral	the help i received by phone necessitated my going through a rigmarole at_least twice to reset passwords , etc .
neutral	i have now made three different purchases with photoworld and to summarize the experience - their product is excellent and the service is awful .
neutral	i have ordered albums , separate prints and cards through photoworld .
neutral	the software was user_friendly and easy to learn .
neutral	the album contained my wedding photos and i ordered and paid for the best quality available .
neutral	having now received the product , i can tell you that it was worth it .
neutral	pricey , but still worth it for those special_occasions .
neutral	later on , i ordered separate prints and thank - you cards ; they were of " regular " quality and the difference was obvious .
neutral	images were fuzzy and the paper was lighter .
neutral	i would recommend that if you are thinking of using this printer and can_afford it , order the highest_quality products available .
neutral	the higher the quality , the better the paper , the sharper the images .
neutral	on the flip side , i had to deal with the photoworld customer service and it was awful .
neutral	totally clueless , unfriendly and even abrasive and rude .
neutral	they take zero responsibility for the service they provide .
neutral	my order was lost and they had no clue_where to look for it .
neutral	worse , they didn_'_t care .
neutral	one customer service representative told me that photoworld received thousands of orders and cannot be expected to trace every one of them .
neutral	nice guy .
neutral	not helpful at all .
neutral	i don_'_t know why they are there in the first place .
neutral	every time i called , i was greeted with a negative attitude and zero willingness to help .
neutral	if you are thinking of using this printer , think_twice .
neutral	if you can wait a month for your order , don_'_t care about customer service and can_afford it , then it '_s worth it .
neutral	otherwise , i would look for another , more friendly alternative .
neutral	got the deal online .
neutral	unfortunately had a problem setting_up and had to ring talk_talk
neutral	could not get through to customer_services just got pushy_sales people who wanted to set the deal up all over again , they couldnt understand_why i wanted to do it online although i explanined several_times i was in a hurry and had one small problem they just wouldnt transfer me , then when they finally connected me to customer_services it was just another sales_person !
neutral	wasted half an_hour on what should have been a simple query answered .
neutral	very frustrating !
neutral	communication about delivery was great .
neutral	but they were dispatched at 0 . 00 am and didn_'_t get to the destination until just before 0 so tje recipient didn_'_t get them on the day intended
neutral	i was very disappointed in the time it was taking to despatch my order .
neutral	i emailed to query this , and was told that they had cancelled my order on an instruction by email from myself .
neutral	i had never sent this instruction .
neutral	it transpired_that another customer had emailed to cancel their order , and complete_care shop cancelled my order instead by mistake .
neutral	hopefully this has now all be rectified .
neutral	very disappointing experience
neutral	tracked the delivery of this item on line as the postage stated next_day delivery .
neutral	as i '_d ordered it late on the monday didn_'_t expect it the tuesday but thought it would have been here on the wednesday especially as i saw it had left scunthorpe early in the morning which is only 00_minutes down the road but no it didn_'_t turn_up until the afternoon of the thursday .
neutral	hi recently bought two ink_cartridges ( 0 black and 0 tri - colour for my hp officejet 0000 , which were delivered promptly , however , whilst the black one was fine , the colour one did not fit , when i compared it to the one i had taken out , there was a difference in the shape , the message on my printer kept telling_me it was incorrect .
neutral	unfortunately i had already thrown_away the envelope and paperwork and could not return it .
neutral	i have used your service before and found you to be competatively_priced and good delivery service .
neutral	feel a bit_cheated this time , i '_ve had to put the old one back in which has practicaly run_out and colour is distorted .
neutral	i was impressed by the speed and efficiency with the delivery , but unfortunately , the capsules did not work in my nespresso_machine .
neutral	they were slightly too small and , being plastic , the machine was not able to pierce them .
neutral	i tried them in my daughter '_s older nespresso_machine , but they didn_'_t work in that either .
neutral	sorry !
neutral	part of my order was out of stock , so the whole package had to wait to be delivered .
neutral	the goods arrived two_weeks after expected stock due date .
neutral	no communication from procook to advise of extended delivery date .
neutral	pleased with goods , when arrived .
neutral	i ordered the flowers really easily and got same day delivery - at a price .
neutral	delievery was fast and i got a pleasant thank_you call from my friend .
neutral	when i visited my friend the next_day , the flowers were not as i had hoped and not the same as the pictures .
neutral	paying almost £_00 for flowers i hadn_'_t ordered was disappointing .
neutral	very speedy at sending samples out but didnt_realise i would have to buy full sheet to get sizes i wanted cut out
neutral	my sister mrs linda llewellyn , was very pleased with the flowers you delivered in cambridge road bexhill , on friday .
neutral	her only_gripe was she had to retrieve them from a house further up the road as you had delivered them to the wrong house .
neutral	her address is 00 cambridge road , about half way up the road on the left .. luckily the neighbours up the hill notified her so she was able to collect them ..
neutral	was expecting delivery on a monday however goods arrived on the thursday which was to late for me as i wanted the coat for the tuesday .
neutral	i ordered a samsung camera as a gift for christmas and it arrived within the specified lead time ( shipped direct from hong_kong ) but with the wrong plug on the battery_charger - it had a european_plug instead of the uk one .
neutral	after several emails , a travel adapter was sent out which is not the perfect_solution but does not mean that my husband can use his camera !
neutral	beautiful flowers which were obviously very fresh , just not enough of them .
neutral	i upgraded to the middle price bracket and still only received 0 flowers .
neutral	£ 0 each flower
neutral	it was a good way to get the wides market for my property .
neutral	the only draw_back was i needed to ask friends to do the viewings , as i was unable to . the one thing i did find difficult was not having a named person / persons who i could talk to with out repeating myself .
neutral	i felt the communications " let the side down " however i have told people this is a good way to sell . thank_you
neutral	i ordered a feline prescription before easter .
neutral	was slightly_concerned as when i kept checking the website it kept saying waiting for vet to authorise ............. but not time frame given as to when that might happen .
neutral	in the event it took 0_days from ordering to receiving medicine but easter happened in the middle so delivery time was ok - just lack of info as to what was happening having submitted signed prescription and not possible to get through by phone as lines always busy .
neutral	it would be helpful to be given more info in the first_instance - eg when the vet would check / approve the prescription and when and how it was likely to be sent .
neutral	was left in limbo for 0_days .
neutral	i cant find my phone model specification after 0 years later ...
neutral	i wanted to say thank_you to my mil for looking after our dogs and doing a lot of diy and gardening round our house while we were on holiday in france .
neutral	she_loves tulips and after a google_search serenata had a lovely bouquet .
neutral	they were due to be delivered on sat but apparently yodal are completely_incompetent and can '_t find an estate that '_s been there for 0 years and despite always seeing their vans on our estate .
neutral	so the tulips festered in a van for 0_days - finally delivered monday_afternoon .
neutral	my mil was so disappointed - they had already started dieing with crispy petals and yellow leaves .
neutral	a lot of emails incurring roaming charges layer - this matter was sorted thanks to steph .
neutral	however that process was initially painful .
neutral	replacement flowers arrived and they are fantastic with a note to my mil too apologising .
neutral	you have redeemed yourselves .
neutral	i will use again and give more detailed_instructions re an address so your courier has no excuses .
neutral	i bought this towel bale from living_social and when i looked at the ad , there were white towels showing .
neutral	after i bought the deal , and went almost_immediately to select what i wanted , the white towels did not appear .
neutral	i called living_social and they said the white had run_out .
neutral	hence i bought the ivory towels which is not the end of the world but the reason i bought them was for the white bundle !
neutral	good quality towels though so will buy things in future - am_currently looking at the memory_foam_mattress , i missed the gel memory_foam_mattress deal !
neutral	initially sent without fittings or instructions .
neutral	fitting_instructions poor , one a0 sheet of paper which only a fitter would be able to decipher .
neutral	bought tuin grande gazebo , oringinally quoted £_000 fitting by the company which fitter increased to £_000 ( price confirmed in text ) when it was identified that the gazebo needed concreting into the ground .
neutral	however , this rose to £_000 on the day .
neutral	i challenged the fitter on this and he mumbled something about some other item purchased but which he had no receipt for .
neutral	this price was not including the £_00 cost of sand and cement that i had to provide .
neutral	beware of fitting costs when buying one of these products as it bumps up the price of your purchase .
neutral	if i had known cost of fitting initially , i would have had second_thoughts so be warned .
neutral	i '_ve been a buyer and seller on ebay since 0000 .
neutral	i love the ebay concept and making pocket money from the site is always great .
neutral	unfortunately , they suffer in terms of customer service .
neutral	if you have any_problems with ebay ( or paypal ) you '_ll have a very frustrating experience trying to get things sorted .
neutral	great website , and i still buy from there regularly , but selling is something i find myself doing a lot less lately .
neutral	web_site a bit difficult to get around .
neutral	disappointed that your system cannot automatically determine whether a prescription is held by you or not .
neutral	long conversations with customer service to establish that there was a repeat_prescription from me in your system .
neutral	however , once it was established that you held a repeat_prescription on my behalf , the order was despatched quickly and arrived in good order .
neutral	the flowers are beautiful but they were left on the doorstep for anyone to take .
neutral	could have been left under a hedge and the receiver could have seen them easily .
neutral	great flowers delivery to be improved .
neutral	i used castlegate_lights as they had a good choice of lights available at competitive_prices .
neutral	the lights were delivered promptly and on good order .
neutral	my only issue is the 0 day return_policy - i had bought the lights while decorating and when the room was finished i decided that they didn_'_t suit the room .
neutral	i am now left with the lights as i am outside the 0 day limit .
neutral	flowers were delivered on time and fresh but paid_extra for a larger bouquet and it so wasn_'_t worth it , although i '_d be worried how small the bunch would have been i '_d gone for the regular one !
neutral	the picture on the website included roses and lilies but none were included in the bouquet which was made up of chrysanthemums , 0 carnations and some stock .
neutral	pretty but definitely not worth the money .
neutral	we bought the £_00 . 00 twilight bunch which were very unimpressive and small !
neutral	i wish i '_d have known at the time as i would have selected the largest option , but as the one we chosen was featured in the image we thought it would be okay .
neutral	very tiny amount , could have got more in tesco for a fiver !
neutral	would not recommend getting the smallest_size at all !
neutral	!
neutral	never really used this site .
neutral	not really into htc
neutral	the items came quickly and are obviously fine .
neutral	but although i gave strict_instructions on the order about delivery , my neighbours weren_'_t contacted and the parcel was taken to my nearest post_office .
neutral	i had to collect a huge bulky parcel on foot - luckily it wasn_'_t heavy but the size of the box was huge .
neutral	also the packaging of what appeared to be polystyrene_chips really concerned me as i '_m assuming this wasn_'_t recyclable or biodegradable .
neutral	if it is please let_me know as it will make my think_twice about whether i wish to order from you again - even_though your range of items and speed of delivery is superb .
neutral	i ordered my daughters halloween_outfit paid £ 0 . 00 to get next_day delivery and it didn_'_t turn_up !
neutral	i received it the day after but unfortunately to late for our party !
neutral	shouldn_'_t advertise next_day if its not possible !
neutral	!
neutral	over the years purchased many things from oka .
neutral	they are expensive but i like their designs albeit finishing on some furniture has_been disapointing .
neutral	in the past things have arrived damaged but have always been replaced without_question .
neutral	having tried tracking my parcel with no success , i contacted adriana as requested by e_- mail to ask if they could help and let_me know a rough day of delivery .
neutral	no reply .
neutral	there was no reply to my other e_-_mails either .
neutral	i therefore find spartoo discourteous and a disappointment in their attitude to customer service .
neutral	slate_tiles were rather tatty and scratched etc ...
neutral	the quality varied enormously ...
neutral	much greener than i '_d thought ...
neutral	guess u get what you pay for ( stating blinking obvious !)
neutral	the item was good and just what i needed .
neutral	i paid for next_day am delivery so i could arrange my working day .
neutral	however i didnt receive any tracking at all for my item until 00_hours after it had been delivered .
neutral	very incovenient and not what i paid for .
neutral	you get free delivery but i selected to pay for 0st_class delivery as i needed the products urgently .
neutral	despite this , my order still took over one week to arrive .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	the order and delivery system are quite slow compared to on - line stores such as amazon , but that may be down to prescription items .
neutral	i have found the people on the end of the phone when i have a query to be a bit stern and unfriendly to say the least , but you can '_t knock the prices and the stuff does always turn_up even if it takes a while .
neutral	my boyfriend mother recevied her flowers & was very happy with them thank_you so much for making her birthdays .
neutral	xx
neutral	lots of frustration using the website on an ipad which is where i do all my communication .
neutral	need to recommend the nearest companies first before you '_ve_used your quota of 0 for the day .
neutral	the locations are a bit skewwiff - some postcodes generate a non_existent place .
neutral	overall ok but separate companies for 0 men needed as we can '_t all help to lift clobber and i keep having to ask them if there '_s one man or two .
neutral	the rating should also be separate for different_areas - bit like ebay : value for money / communication / reliability / politeness / care with goods .
neutral	etc .
neutral	i found this very difficult to give to one of my cats .
neutral	the paste went everywhere but in the mouth !
neutral	she clearly hated the taste and was just not having it anywhere_near her .
neutral	my other cat was much_easier as i mixed the paste in with his traets and he ate them all up , no problem .
neutral	still not sure if it has worked though .
neutral	the one that hated it is still really thin and is off her food , this is now 0_days_later , not sure how long it takes to be effective but i think i should take her to the vets as it may even be something_else .
neutral	i got a text to say the recipient was unreachable , so said it was ok to try another day and would try and find another number .
neutral	i then heard_nothing more , so tried to contact her via another colleague .
neutral	she had received them ( lovely flowers ) but all she knew was that they were from the usa !!!!
neutral	there should have been a message_saying they were from her friends at london office .
neutral	she was about to thank the wrong person .
neutral	i had nothing to say they had been delivered .
neutral	it started off well ...
neutral	having arranged a bouquet for my mother '_s birthday it was received on time but unfortunately the box was badly_damaged , together with the flowers inside .
neutral	it '_s disappointing as these were sent as l was unable to be there on the day but feel that she wouldn_'_t complain in these circumstances as most receivers of gifts because of the initial gesture in sending them
neutral	unfortunately the first flowers i ordered died within a day but after a complaint another bunch was sent which were much_better
neutral	great website for products i want and i '_d shop there more if it were a little less costly
neutral	beautiful flowers delivered quickly and packaged beautifully i assumed the vase which your web_site showed as an added optional_extra when placing my order was sadly not big enough to accommodate my chosen flowers for my mums_birthday , a little disappointed with that .
neutral	visited my friend two_days after she received her flowers .
neutral	the roses were all bent_over and sad .
neutral	:( good service but not great if the end_result is a bit_disappointing .
neutral	phoned up , asked if my details were still on their system .
neutral	answer was yes .
neutral	was put on hold for 0 minutes .
neutral	was told that the last address would be where the new tyre would be put on .
neutral	said i had a discount_code .
neutral	harassed customer service person was rushing me .
neutral	got my discount .
neutral	turns_out that it wasn_'_t the last address where the replacement would be done , it was the other address and i wasn_'_t there .
neutral	phoned the tyre replacement technician who had kept in touch throughout .
neutral	worked it out between us that i would get the tyre done at my home address ( which the call_centre said i was out of the postcode zone ).
neutral	more time is needed at the call_centre for the customer '_s preferences to be given priority .
neutral	i used to use easyjet alot when their prices were good and you could get the prices they advertised , not so much now .
neutral	the cabin staff can come_across quite moody and flights are hardly_ever on time , not what you need when you are going on holiday !
neutral	pricing wise you can definately get your dvds and cds cheaper elswhere online but pretty good pricing during their sales .
neutral	delivery has never been a problem and have always arrived on time .
neutral	tescos used to be where we shopped all the time but recently we have found the pricing and deals not as appealing as they used to be .
neutral	the upside is that there are so many around !
neutral	waiting on the arrival of our purchases which we plan on using on an extended trip with anticipated rainy weather
neutral	the goods fine as far as sell by dates were concerned .
neutral	all cakes were squashed and spoiled .
neutral	unfortunately i had to send back the parasol i ordered , as the website stated it was off white but the parasol i received was white .
neutral	disappointing that i had to arrange the return - and pay for it , as this was ' unsuitable '.
neutral	if the website was advertising the correct product , i wouldn_'_t have ordered it in the first place .
neutral	this is a fine way to see the city .
neutral	but really only if you are able to find a seat on the top section .
neutral	we were disappointed with the personal tour_guide as his commentary was not very informative or knowledgeable - we were hoping to hear about the history of the buildings , etc - instead he spoke about purse snatching and relatives living in the states .
neutral	the recorded tour was more informative , but i could not get the volume to adjust so it was extremely loud and i spent more time messing with my headphones than i would like .
neutral	disappointed we did not go close enough to buckingham_palace to see it .
neutral	it would have been nice to be tipped off at a good point to get off and walk over to it .
neutral	we were way passed it before we realized it had gone by and too far to walk back .
neutral	still , a good way to get your bearings in the city .
neutral	although i wanted to purchase the table , chairs , display_cabinet and table ( for my lamp ) i did not require a mirror but was informed that i could not have the table for my lamp ( which was cheaper ) instead of the mirror .
neutral	this is disappointing when i had spent 0 , 000_pounds
neutral	i ordered the silver collar stiffeners as a gift for my husband .
neutral	they were beautifully_wrapped , but fortunately i decided to open the box to check them .
neutral	on doing so , i found that one of the stiffeners was scratched quite badly .
neutral	i decided to take them back to the covent_garden store to replace them .
neutral	unfortulately they didn_'_t have any replacements in the store so they ordered some to be sent to my home .
neutral	the replacements were received 0_days_later and were in better condition , although not packaged as nicely as the first ones .
neutral	the stiffeners themselves though are lovely - light , beautifully_engraved and a nice little stocking_filler for my husband .
neutral	i recieved my order pretty quickly ( 0_days ) and am pretty happy with the product .
neutral	the only draw_back was that the quality of the goods wasn_'_t as good as i would have expected for the price i payed .
neutral	the item was made of good quality material however wasn_'_t manufactured very well so the seams look quite messy .
neutral	the table was fine as expected . delivery was a little_confusing . thought it was arriving between 0 - 0am but that is when it leaves the depot . as though i needed to know that . i would have liked click and collect from store not to pay delivery charge .
neutral	i can '_t comment on how good this insurer is if in need of a claim but it was straight_forward to get cover for my mobile phone .
neutral	i have had emails with supporting documentation since which is reassuring and no_problems so far .
neutral	on the morning my mattress was due to be delivered i had an_emergency , my daughter was taken ill and i needed to go to my grandchildren .
neutral	i contacted the customer_services to see if they could contact the driver to determine what time he would arrive .
neutral	i ws told this was not possible as they had no way of contacting the driver . no other help was forthcoming .
neutral	fortuneatly as i was about to leave the mattress was delivered .
neutral	what a diference ,, the driver was so polite and helpful he is a good person to be in your company .
neutral	s j woodhouse
neutral	brilliant at start but lately lots of problems encountered re some orders , too much to be described in full here .
neutral	have neither the time nor inclination to at present , but suffice to say am quite disillusioned with late arrival of some orders etc ; of late
neutral	i ordered the luxury posy to be placed at the cremitorium for my mum '_s first mothers_day in heaven .
neutral	i picked this posy as carnations were mums favourite .
neutral	what was delivered were a few carnations , roses and packed with white foliage .
neutral	instead of gerberas , a spray of carnations and greenery .
neutral	i know the comments on the website stated there might be a few subsitutes due to which flowers are in season and availability .
neutral	the posy was still beautiful but i am very dissapointed especially for my reasons behind selecting this one .
neutral	good price .
neutral	posted next_day .
neutral	[_external_reference_] failed to deliver parcel or leave message that it had been delivered to local post_office .
neutral	i '_m not psychic couldn_'_t guess if delivered or where .
neutral	called tennis_nuts too help find the parcel .
neutral	- too accepting of the [_external_reference_] position . "
neutral	it '_s happened before ".
neutral	need to change your post services rather_than let your customers down .
neutral	!
neutral	!
neutral	ordering was easy , waiting was horrendous !!!
neutral	contact tried her best to chase_up the suppliers but still had to wait over 0_months :-(
neutral	love the earplugs but service could be better !!
neutral	me and my partner have used the same ear_plugs for years - we received a batch that were hurtin out ears so complained about them and received a refund - we wud have bn happy with a replacement but this was not an option !
neutral	my partner then tried a number of different times to reorder but you kept cancelling the order !!
neutral	so i had to then order - we did look else where but cudnt find the same ones or we wud have went else where
neutral	the
neutral	end
neutral	the flowers i ordered were beautiful just what i wanted for my partner .
neutral	the only_thing i have to complain_about is the flowers never arrived until 0000 on thursday 00 / 00 / 00 which i had to keep telling my partner that i was getting something deleiverd to her address so she had to get her daughter to stay in when she nipped out so my surprise wasn_'_t a surprise cause she new something was coming to the house .
neutral	so that '_s the only_complaint i have was the delivery wasn_'_t great .
neutral	as a bog_standard delivery company i think they are fantastic and would be my courier of choice .
neutral	use them on a more or less weekly_basis and never had a problem , even_though i live in a flat ( read how some in flats seem to have problems ).
neutral	my gripe is with the additional service they provide were you can request a different delivery option before your item is delivered .
neutral	i tried this , i requested that my item was delivered the next_day when i would be home ( and had a message_saying request was accepted ) but instead they delivered it anyway and left it with a neighbour .
neutral	now the reason i wanted to be home was because i was due 0 items , one of which i tried to cancel but was told by amazon it was too late and just to refuse delivery .
neutral	simple enough but obviously have to be home to do that .
neutral	i now have an item i don_'_t want and have to go through returns procedures and pay postage .
neutral	slightly_annoying but when i emailed dpd there wasn_'_t even any acknowledgement of failure , nothing .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t advise against using , just don_'_t rely_on their customer service .
neutral	the furniture is excellent and the delivery men were enthusiastic and helpful .
neutral	i would definitely buy furniture from them again and be able to recommend them .
neutral	the process was however let_down by the suppliers who were a week late delivering furniture and i was only informed late the day before the expected delivery day after i had dismantled and emptied the office of the temporary furniture .
neutral	some of the confusion was down to the designer being overseas but i was seriously inconvenienced by the delay and to have been informed a couple of hours earlier would have saved me a lot of time etc
neutral	kept_informed of process but was concerned when delivery left in morning but had not arrived by 0 pm weather was bad so was relieved when they were eventually delivered .
neutral	response to queries was quick
neutral	seemed to take loads longer_than it should have done , but got my money in the end .
neutral	the only problem i have is delivery take too long
neutral	equipmwent arrived ok was expecting a little more advice on best use and exercise on it felt not enough help given and no batteries for remote_control was a bit bad
neutral	i found it very poor quality cords easy came out of cheap plastic grip , bottom of blind didn_'_t have a slat in the frame . very tinny and flimsy
neutral	i '_m enjoying my order of the four ' basic ' types of coffee with the transparent covered capsules , although water does tend to leak out more than with genuine nespresso_capsules , leaving a puddle around the machine .
neutral	i received the free trial_pack of each of the new capsules , i loved the ideas , i really liked the new range of strengths and types , along with the sheet with the descriptions of each coffee .
neutral	however , in practice i had great difficulty actually making the coffee , as it took at_least two attempts to insert the capsules correctly in my nespresso_machine .
neutral	they either drop through , or they don_'_t stay in place well enough to be pierced when i press the lever_down , meaning pure water comes through into the cup .
neutral	the problem with water leaking , creating a puddle seems worse as well .
neutral	so i am not sure i have actually tasted the coffee properly , as i am not convinced that even on the second or third attempts the capsules were properly pierced through .
neutral	overall , nice coffee , great ideas , but the new design still needs ' tweaking ' before i '_ll purchase any more ...
neutral	click and collect service worked really well and i was very happy with the level of service .
neutral	my husband was very pleased with his coat but i was disappointed with the quality of it .
neutral	the material creases very easily .
neutral	for the price i paid , i would have expected better quality from this brand .
neutral	while i realise that coffee is a personal_taste , i thought i would try this alternative to the nespresso_pods .
neutral	the service from the company was excellent and the delivery was swift .
neutral	however i found the packaging cumbersome for storage .
neutral	the pods worked well with the machine , but i found all of the types were bitter and not to my liking .
neutral	i gave all three a reasonable trial , but am returning the unopened_boxes .
neutral	had a card from moonpig , poor quality card , almost paper - like .
neutral	i am seriosuly considering funky_pigeon .
neutral	i '_ve just bought a walnut and cherry wood backgammon_set as a 00st_birthday_present to my son .
neutral	looked fantastic on website with walnut veneer .
neutral	when i got the set no walnut veneer - just what looks like bog_standard wood .
neutral	well - made yes , but not the special present , in terms of looks , that i wanted .
neutral	disappointed .
neutral	delighted with the product but delivery was incredibly slow despite reassurance from the sales_dept .
neutral	that it was on its way .
neutral	it arrived a few_days after the date promised .
neutral	for the first time , i decided to treat_myself to a corset ( which i have been dying to do for years )... well i should have restrain_myself .
neutral	ordering was easy , no complication whatsoever , but from then onward ... that '_s another story !
neutral	no communication at all , not even an_email to tell me when to expect delivery or when item had been dispatched .
neutral	i found my " parcel " ( corset just in a bag ) stuffed through my letter_box ( knowing that i was there all morning , i was disappointed ).
neutral	when i opened it , good grief !, " corset " was in poor state !
neutral	some thread was coming off at different places , and i am a size 00 - 00 so to be sure to get it to fit nicely i bought a 00 - 00 ( i have a large bust but a smaller waist ), well it is good for a size 00 size as a plank , i mean no boobs bigger_than an a and a man '_s waist !!!
neutral	would definitely not hold my breasts , and does not hold in anything as it just hang at the waist with a good 0 " between my tummy and the corset adjusted at the tightest at the bottom .
neutral	well , when it seems to good to be true , it '_s usually because it is !
neutral	coming_back to update my review after a polite and genuinely_concerned reply to my poor experience .
neutral	i sent back the parcel on tuesday and will await for a response on the refund .
neutral	i checked my email again but no email was found .
neutral	i must add that the is not the first time that royal_mail take shortcuts on their parcel delivery !
neutral	i didn_'_t experience any difference from using the product .
neutral	we order phospherone for our dog and find it very usefull when she is left at home on her own .
neutral	we do find that to order online is quite difficult to complete the order once you have put in all your payment details and then try to send order there is no box to click on to send order .
neutral	we did set_up a monthly order and when this ran_out have never been able to re - activate the monthly order on the website as there appears to be no instruction how to do this
neutral	my mum is in her 00 '_s and not strong .
neutral	the delivery driver , yodel i beleive , just left the flowers on the step without_knocking on the door .
neutral	fortunately my father saw the van and collected the flowers but if he had not they could have been there all day as my parents tend to use the backdoor when coming and going .
neutral	however my mum_loved the flowers and they arrived in excellent condition so thankyou .
neutral	it '_s complicated to change schedule of the flight .
neutral	i have had some bargains off the site . 0 lovely swing dresses for christmas and a couple of t shirt dresses for my hols , but the last delivery was really disappointing . quality was pretty crap ! one dress was so cheap looking i '_d have struggled selling it on a car boot . not sure if i '_ll use the site again as although missguided keep in touch , it takes a while getting your money credited back
neutral	not the best as quite complicated - but good to see my bill online
neutral	i found the communication rather er , well non_existent .
neutral	i had an_email when i first sold the phone saying my envelope was on its way and to send the phone by a certain_date to ensure my price bla_bla_bla .
neutral	i sent it straight_away and the next email i had was a week and a bit later saying my payment had been processed .
neutral	( however as a frequent user of paypal , it had already been in my paypal_account for 0_days !)
neutral	i didnt get an_email to say they had recieved the phone , or to say it had passed_testing , when i logged_into my envirofone account i did see all of this but i think as a busy person you should email these things just as peace of mind really !
neutral	but i got my money with no_hiccups so i cant really complain , just communicate a bit more !
neutral	good product with a speedy delivery .
neutral	however the limbo - sacral support was far too small .
neutral	even_though i had correctly measured .
neutral	the small stated up to 00 " waist and my client was only a 00 " waist .
neutral	it was far too tight .
neutral	the postage to return was over_£ 0 ,
neutral	the medium fitted correctly .
neutral	make_sure you order up a size .
neutral	the book itself is really good and i am happy with the product however i paid £_00 for this book one picture is printed wrong and a couple are blury i no when blurly they came up with the explanation marker however on these they didn_'_t and have printed blury hear however are not blury on my computer therefor i '_m nt sure what to think i just think that have my number they should call if any doubt !
neutral	i ordered a pair of boots , these where delivered promptly . i didn_'_t like the colour and would have liked to exchange them for another pair in the same style but in black , unfortunately this was not possible according to website and delivery info . i decided therefore to return the boots so followed instructions on delivery receipt which was to attach returns_label and take to a post_office . these instuctions where different to website returns advice . the post_office took the parcel , confirmed it was prepaid and scanned the post_code which didnt exist , they therfore where not able to take the package . i spoke to customer_services who sent me a different label by email an dsaid i should phone ups and that the return would be at my expense ,£ 0 . 00 approx . i did as instructed and received an_email about a week_later to confirm refund and a few_days_later the refund was made to my credit_card account . in the meantime i bought the black boots from another online shop with no_problems . on the plus_side i have the boots in_spite of the ecco online shop , they are great boots as ecco products always are . on the minus side you need to sort_out your returns advice . i think free_postage over say £_00 spend and free easy returns are essential in an online shop , a lot of other_businesses offer this . collect_+ is a great service used by amazon and lots of other online_retailers where you take your parcel to a local shop having first downloaded and afixed a label . some offer this as a free service other don_'_t and the cost is about £ 0 . 00 for a box_containing shoes . also your customer_services worker magdalena szczepaniak was helpful and professional and sent me the new label by email promptly as promised . i wouldn_'_t use the online ecco_shop again as online purchases often need to be returned and i would be put off by the cost of returns .
neutral	ordered red_rose boquet which arrived on time .
neutral	flowers were a little_disappointing as some were in full_bloom and others in tight bud - not sure if they will ever open up !
neutral	i did quite a lot of research on different airport car_parks and found this to offer the best prices - though i did use an 00 priority moment discount .
neutral	i wasn_'_t happy that the process to book via mobile phone app was quite troublesome and i had to try about 0 times before it accepted my payment ( it didn_'_t like paypal ) and since i was using a small screen ( i was unable to apply the discount_code on my laptop ) i didn_'_t notice some of the ' optional_extras ' that got automatically_added before confirming payment .
neutral	bit annoyed by that but at the end of the day the price was still cheaper .
neutral	i don_'_t think ill use this company as my mother was not happy with the bouquet . i used it as they were the only company who would deliver next_day
neutral	good when the system_works but some cashback claims ( esp .
neutral	insurance ) can be long and protracted .
neutral	go for the best deal on price and if you get the cashback then it '_s a bonus but don_'_t base your purchase decision on cashback alone as you may never get it .
neutral	i like the idea of quality natural_wood products and this is why i purchased from oakfurnitureland .
neutral	i was impressed at the showroom , however now that i have had a few_weeks to really look at the furniture i notice that one of the doors on the sideboard is wonky and the dining_table has a very light streak along the centre .
neutral	if you are offered a seat mii , ask for something_else .
neutral	uncomfortable beyond_belief and very inconvenient boot .
neutral	ordered tickets from this website even_though i had found them £ 0 cheaper elsewhere , but i wanted to pay with paypal and this website offered this service .
neutral	wish i had waited the very next_day they had a flash_sale that would have saved me £_00 . 00 .
neutral	i understand that they had no_obligation to advise me if i waited 00_hours i could have taken_advantage of the sale , but it would have been good customer_relations .
neutral	beware if you buy tickets from this company as they may be cheaper 00_hours_later .
neutral	having ordered before with next_day delivery thought it would be quick but not this time ordered last thursday has just turned_up today tuesday
neutral	when i placed my order it was quick and easy .
neutral	great !
neutral	when i received my order it wasn_'_t the correct batteries .
neutral	the paper_work and order history was correct but obviously the product was pick incorrectly .
neutral	i have sent this back but i haven_'_t had a reply as yet !
neutral	( its been 0_days )
neutral	im_hoping this will go smoothly and have no_problems .
neutral	i will post again to tell you of the next step .
neutral	purchased rose_bush in a pink bucket - looks very poor with only three flowers in bloom not worth £_00 paid .
neutral	we sold 0 phones on envirofine they got 0 bk to us straight_away great but the other 0 we had problems .... the 0 found so we couldn_'_t sell which wasn_'_t a problem but the other phone never got mentioned and iv emailed asking about it but never got replied and now its like its getting swept under the rug :/ not good
neutral	when the flowers arrived i was expecting more than what arrived .
neutral	the box was huge , however the flowers inside were tiny , for £_00 i would expect more .
neutral	i could have bought a bunch bigger in a supermarket for a £ 0 !
neutral	i don_’_t know how long they had been out of water for and with the current weather ; they were desperate for a drink !
neutral	the only positive_comments i can add - they smelt nice and they arrived on time !
neutral	i always find it difficult to speak to someone on the phone - there are so many different orange departments and addresses you never know which is the correct on .
neutral	a good product , but did my get the next_day delivery i had paid for .
neutral	can '_t complain_about the price of the arran jumper i bought for my husband , but the website said that it was 000_% wool and the label in the jumper says 00_% wool 00_% nylon .
neutral	woolovers tell me that this is why it was a ' second ' but that '_s not what the website says !
neutral	makes me wonder what the fabric content actually is ?
neutral	the beer glasses were strurdy and good value - but the wine_glasses were smaller_than i ordered and many of them were broken - the ones at the bottom of the stack .
neutral	the platters in the picture were round and oval ones arrived !
neutral	!
neutral	have now used animed_direct twice and although the first delivery did arrive a day after advised via_email it did arrive the following_morning .
neutral	will use again as long as they have the best price at that time .
neutral	experience over phone and collection was faultless , however a child '_s army outfit lasted one day of wearing before it ripped apart at the sems .
neutral	poor quality for a lot of money .
neutral	have not called for a refund yet so no experience on the customer service that side .
neutral	was able to order courier the next_day and good price in comparsion of searching .
neutral	would be better if could tell you am or pm as hours were between 0 - 0 . 00 and they arrived at 0 . 00pm so spend the whole day waiting for it to be collected .
neutral	gammeldags hjemmeside , lidt bøvlet bestillingsside , men især for lang leveringstid : jeg måtte vente over en uge på 0 meter stof .
neutral	det_er for lang tid , især når_man tager i betragtning , at stof er_en vare , der_er utrolig nem at pakke og sende , fordi det_ikke kan gå i stykker og derfor bare kan kommes i en kuvert .
neutral	never had a problem with bestpet previously , items always sent out in a timely_manner .
neutral	i had ordered wormers for my puppy and thought i had done it in plenty of time .
neutral	items still hadn_'_t arrived in over a week so had to chase_up , they hadn_'_t been sent but the query was dealt_with promptly and items sent out same day , although i had to go to the vets and buy expensive wormers due to the non - arrival .
neutral	i ordered the flowers & they arrived on the date requested .
neutral	the flowers are absolutely_beautiful .
neutral	the aroma is delicious .
neutral	unfortunately , the six large dusky_pink_roses , outer leaves were tinged with brown .
neutral	all the other flowers are healthy and vibrant .
neutral	they arrived in a large cardboard_box , adequately ventilated .
neutral	i advised customer service of this on the day they arrived .
neutral	i stressed i was not looking for a refund or replacement flowers .
neutral	the quality control just had to be notified of the defect .
neutral	customer service stated that they did not know how this could_possibly happen as the flowers had to be checked five times before arriving at destination .
neutral	kind_regards ,
neutral	janet a .
neutral	strain .
neutral	i was told my order would take some while so i am not complaining that it hasn_'_t arrived - business seems a bit un - joined - up with you asking me this question !
neutral	ordered two lots of communion cards 0st lot was misprinted .
neutral	error in the writing .
neutral	couldn_'_t find contact detail for customer_services to complain & ask for reprint .
neutral	ordered 0nd lot of cards which were printed to my specifications .
neutral	hence i have ended_up paying for both lots of cards .
neutral	costly !
neutral	i can '_t fault the service i received but was disappointed not to be able to buy the easter_eggs i wanted - i . e .
neutral	the lindt ones .
neutral	the furniture arrived an_hour later than the time_slot given and the cleaning packs that i had paid for were missing and a week_later still have not arrived , even_though the delivery people phoned it in right away .
neutral	i am also waiting for a customer_services visit as one of the screws on one of the legs could not screw in properly .
neutral	which was booked in for a month from delivery , i would have thought a company like dfs would follow_up minor problems like this far quicker_than a month
neutral	i need a new filter for my tumble_drier that is an old model .
neutral	partmaster twice queried the model_number i entered that delayed dispatch of the goods .
neutral	when it arrived it was the wrong type of filter and when i looked at the partmaster website again the one i need is no_longer available .
neutral	i don_'_t know where i am supposed to get one now .
neutral	i returned the original filter to partmaster using a label provided by them to pay the postage myself and obtain a full_refund .
neutral	i paid the postage .
neutral	the parcel had a postage_stamp on it .
neutral	i have proof of postage .
neutral	i received an_email from partmaster to say i had used the prepaid_label and £ 0 . 00 has_been deducted from my refund .
neutral	i have replied .
neutral	not good !
neutral	at one stage i found i had reserved reclining seats and a cabin - it didn_'_t tell me till much later that i had reserved accommodation for 00 people when we were only two .
neutral	then we came to ' nationality '.
neutral	now , that was really confusing .
neutral	how does one tell anything from a long list of double letters ?
neutral	i hope that by indicating br it meant that i was british - no way of telling though .
neutral	right .
neutral	next comes the ' enter phone number '.
neutral	it takes a while to realise that one can '_t put this on the line where it says uk (+ 00 ) and by the time one has got the idea the whole booking process has thrown a wobbler ... then it says it is advisable to enter a mobile number so that one can be contacted whilst_travelling .
neutral	fine .
neutral	so , logically , i put both land line and mobile numbers in .
neutral	no , it didn_'_t like that - and i had to resort to the phoning a human_being , to be told that both numbers cannot be entered in the box and the mobile only should be entered .
neutral	that '_s great , but what_happens if one lives in an area where there is no mobile reception , and any message wouldn_'_t be picked_up for , probably , three_months , by which time it would be too late .
neutral	it was agreed that the landline only should be entered - and that brittany_ferries would like to know the mobile number nearer the time ....
neutral	now , in the past , though tickets were not refundable they could be carried forward , as long as they were used within the year .
neutral	don_'_t know if this is still the case .
neutral	also it used to be the case that only a deposit was taken at this stage - or have i done this through a different web_site ?
neutral	i '_m still confused .....!
neutral	!
neutral	even_though we advised our opening_hours of 0am - 0pm , the delivery was made at 0am and left with an adjoining building - no card put through our door , it was left up to that company to come and advise us of our delivery .
neutral	when we went to collect we could see all the parcels had been through very muddy water !
neutral	!
neutral	be careful when you order from this firm .
neutral	the day said item was delivered , the price had been reduced by £_00 . 00 .
neutral	when i contacted this firm they explained that prices fluctuate due to stock_levels , and the price was adjusted shortly_after my order .
neutral	must have been quick as the reduced price was showing on my delivery day .
neutral	a poor show in my opinion .
neutral	customer service really is 0_star , all the staff are very helpful and courteous , however i have only given it 0_star due to the problems i had with my order and it being out of stock and the amount of money i have spent on hone calls £_00 which i am very annoyed about .
neutral	customer service is bend_over_backwards to help , and finally resolved the stock problem and then the delivery problem , however they need to sort_out the phone waiting times , i was on numerous_times over an_hour , hence the £_00 on phone_calls and they refused to phone me back .
neutral	the delivery was quick and presentation was nice but there was minimal flowers which i paid £_00 for and could of bought for £ 0 elsewhere or paid the same for alot more flowers and foliage .
neutral	the flowers when put in a vase did look pathetic .
neutral	i dont_think i would use this service again , i have had better flowers from other similar_sites .
neutral	the prices are reasonable and the blinids are great .
neutral	the only_downfall on one of the blinds that we ordered was that a part / piece on the side was broken when we received it so the blinds would always roll down even if we just want it rolled half way .
neutral	we badly needed it at the time so we couldn_'_t send it back .
neutral	i don_'_t know if we can still return it .
neutral	good and punctual service , the only_thing i would say is the delivery man didn_'_t have the comments i had written so he didn_'_t know that my mum couldn_'_t sign for the package as she has not the use of her hands .
neutral	also i phoned up as i wanted a sample of the item i wanted to order and the guy on the phone said that he couldn_'_t give me a sample of that particular item .
neutral	i had to wait a few_days for the order to be processed .
neutral	when it did arrive i was away and my builder had to sign for it .
neutral	he was worried because the packaging was really bad and the camera was rattling_around in a large box .
neutral	when i was told of their concerns i texted to say that i had not had a chance to examine the camera because i was away from home but was concerned_about packaging .
neutral	actually it all seems to be functioning ok but would have been preferable to be better protected in transit .
neutral	i ordered yasmin online to be sent to upton park pharmacy and it all seemed very straight_forward .
neutral	however after arriving more than 0 hours after ordering i had to wait for over an_hour for the pharmacy to download my prescription , as there was some sort of error with the computer .
neutral	after this long wait they then discovered that there was no yasmin in stock anyway .
neutral	i had to come_back the next_day and collected without problems .
neutral	it '_s clear that there are some teething_problems with this service .
neutral	the staff were polite and helpful throughout .
neutral	my boyfriend is a big_fan of the superset clothing range so as a gift i bought him a jumper on - line which he_loves !!
neutral	the delivery was very quick and was impressed by this however the major letdown was having to unroll it out of the ball it had been screwed_up into and flung in a bag - having to iron it before i could even consider letting him see it - a product of this quality i would have expected that the time could have at_least been taken to fold it overall good product but i will try and buy i store from now on
neutral	i ordered the " this works " travel set on the 00th_april and chose the uk saver premium delivery and it did not turn_up in time for my holiday on 00nd .
neutral	i was very disappointed as i am addicted to the this works products and find their cleanser the best i have ever used .
neutral	still i have my little bag of goodies for my next trip .
neutral	i will change my delivery instructions next time .
neutral	i sent my phone to sell took them nearly 0_weeks for them to get in touch with
neutral	booked through travelodge , dropped_off cases then went to park car .
neutral	got on bus from carpark asking driver to drop us back at travelodge , his answer no could only take us to airport even_though he was passing it .
neutral	once we were at the airport we would of had to phone the travelodge to send a bus to pick us up , i ` ve heard it all now .
neutral	too much hassel , so instead he let 0 women in the dark at night walk back to travelodge on road as no pavements
neutral	while kandco is handy when you don_'_t have the cash there and then , things are more_expensive than going and buying on the high_street ,
neutral	the interest_rate for buy now pay later is quite_expensive
neutral	as most people get paid calender monthly , it is difficult to pay by direct_debit as the payments are expected 0 weekly ,
neutral	some items description '_s are lacking in detail and you have to google them for more info ,
neutral	also to call to the call_center is expensive and no alternative geographic no , is given , they do offer to call you back , but when you '_ve waited for 00_mins listening to " your call is important to us " you want an answer there and then as it has already cost you 00pence as it is
neutral	although the order arrived within the delivery timescale i think the delivery options are too long .
neutral	in this day and age things should be despatched the next_day if not the same .
neutral	i didn_'_t pay for delivery but even if i had delivery would still be a week .
neutral	this is no good when you have 0 dogs to feed .
neutral	no_problems at all with the website and products .
neutral	i ordered some perfume for my sister '_s birthday .
neutral	ordered in plenty of time for it to arrive , but it took nearly two_weeks from dispatch to arrival of my order .
neutral	i had to order elsewhere for her gift .
neutral	so , buy from them - but order well in_advance , or prepare for disappointment .
neutral	we '_ve had a couple of good deals - and we '_ve also had our fingers burnt a bit - including a recent disasterous stay at the malvern conveyorbelt ( i mean spa .)
neutral	i '_ve_used for restaurants and hotels and my advise is the same for both .
neutral	great site , never a problem with bookings - but the quality varies hugely from one to another .
neutral	i never book without checking tripadvisor and therefore have only gone wrong once - bath central - hideous .
neutral	having booked and paid in_advance online for a better deal we yet again were held up on leaving by the ticket machine requesting we pay full price .
neutral	yes , it was quickly dealt_with by a call to the operators who opened the barriers for us but having been through the same scenario last_year is it not about time some sort of online booking identification code is given so the ticket can be swiped , recognised as paid and exit achieved seamlessly ?
neutral	just a thought !
neutral	shirley murray
neutral	simple to apply , clear and concise information .
neutral	quick payout .
neutral	parts of my order were missing when the box was delivered , i sent an_email but had no reply as yet .
neutral	which is a shame because they seemed nice when i placed the order .
neutral	haven_'_t received product and apparently the product i ordered can '_t be honoured and i am to receive a subsistute !!!!!
neutral	whatever i do eventually receive has not been delivered with the timescale of the price paid for delivery
neutral	very disappointed that i did not receive my order until 00th_december !
neutral	i placed the order and paid for it on the 00st_december .
neutral	i even paid a delivery charge to ensure i would receive it on the 00th_december as i wanted it in time for christmas but this did not happen !
neutral	hello ,
neutral	i recently_purchased two kat tikkler toys ( product id_: 00 ( 000000 ).
neutral	i have found that the sticks are not as strong as they were previously .
neutral	when playing with my cat the sticks snaps and breaks in my hand .
neutral	i feel as though the material the manufacturer uses in this product has changed as this has never happened before when i previously purchased this toy .
neutral	i have returned the jacket to you because it was not the kind of material or style i desired .
neutral	i have no complaint with the actual garment .
neutral	i was impressed with the promptness of delivery .
neutral	i am afraid i have had to send the product back because we ordered a uk size 0 , we received a us 0 which turned_out to be too_big .
neutral	we returned them - surprised by the prepaid_postage which is great - today .
neutral	we will be ordering a smaller_size once a refund is received !
neutral	i received my item just before christmas break , they said they would accept return after christmas as they were closed for 0_weeks .
neutral	when i emailed them for their address they did not respond .
neutral	0 further emails later still no response so has to ask ebay to intervene .
neutral	i was finally given an address and sent item back .
neutral	got item fast not happy game case was in bits
neutral	i guess they are what i ordered - no better , no worse .
neutral	annoyingly they didn_'_t have quite the right size that i was looking for - they ' re a little too_big and i also don_'_t think it was made obvious that sticky_labels were sold separately - that would have been helpful to know , but i '_ll make do i suppose .
neutral	i haven_'_t had any_problems before but with this order one of my items was out of stock .
neutral	no one contacted me and they held my order awaiting the item without telling_me .
neutral	as a result i didn_'_t get my order until over 0_weeks after i placed it and had to buy my rabbit_food from my local_pet shop while waiting for it .
neutral	an e_- mail about my order being held would have been nice .
neutral	the items did finally arrive and were in good condition and as i ordered .
neutral	i have spent a lot of my quality time chasing up orders that have not arrived .
neutral	i do not feel as there is support out there from the organisations wowcher are involved with .
neutral	wowcher does it '_s job , others do not .
neutral	can be a bit too pricey .
neutral	spacious_villa in a great location , but for money expected greater levels of comfort , hard beds , noisy air_con and uncomfortable garden_furniture .
neutral	really needs to be upgraded .
neutral	i expected my very small order of 0 packets of seeds to arrive quickly but they only just made the deadline given .
neutral	i have had much_better service with other_firms .
neutral	however the arms of the glasses were loose and fingerprints on lenses .
neutral	i had to tighten the arms and clean before i could wear them .
neutral	bit grubby but good value .
neutral	i have used silver_shuttle twice and my experiences could not have been more different .
neutral	the first time , the driver arrived early , was friendly and courteous , knew the route - all in all stress_free and great service .
neutral	the second time was very different - the driver collected me from the airport and first of all could not remember where he left his car ( not ideal after a 00 hour flight ), then had no idea where he was going ( despite having a sat_nav ) and tried to take the wrong road a number of times .
neutral	when i told him he was going the wrong way the driver became aggressive and shouted at me to tell him where to go .
neutral	in the end my journey took twice as long as it should have and i arrived home feeling stressed and upset - awful end to my holiday .
neutral	i would probably use silver_shuttle again , in the hope that my second experience was exceptional , but i would not get back in the car with that same driver .
neutral	i gave 0_stars because i had ordered 0 small steak and kidney pies and received steak and kidney pudding instead .
neutral	upon sending an_email complaint the cost of the pies were credited back to my credit_card and i received a response indicating that they were out of the pies and substituted the puddings ; however , the main_reason i placed the order was for the pies and had i known they were out i would have asked them to hold my order until the pies were back in stock .
neutral	had it not been for this issue i would rate the site between a 0 and 0 .
neutral	the shipping is quite_expensive but that is to be expected with international_shipping .
neutral	everything was great from consultation to operation , but my only_concern was the lack of after care comunication , i had to call for checkups , my husband had to take time of work to travel from fife to dundee for my 00 minute appointments when there is an optical_express within 0 miles from my home and a bus journey i could have taken on my own .
neutral	on the first time i '_ve_used the eflorist , it was perfect !
neutral	i was really grateful that my order came on the same day as i wanted it to be delivered .
neutral	i used it again , hoping that same thing happens but unfortunately , my order was being delivered the next_day early morning .
neutral	well , maybe there is a reason_why my order wasn_'_t being delivered on the date that i wanted but then i was really disappointed .
neutral	but looking at the photo of the flower being delivered , it was beautiful !
neutral	and so , i don_'_t know if i should complain but i '_ll try to order again soon & give them another chance .
neutral	but if its happens again well , i might not order anymore .
neutral	hello , except not responding to my email when you say on your website you respond in an_hour ( you probably felt it was ' a silly ' question , but i haven_'_t ordered any flowers to deliver for somebody_else before !
neutral	); so i had spent a day waiting for your respond .
neutral	finally i went through and found the way to order the flowers .
neutral	but your delivery service worked a brilliant way .
neutral	the service was quick and efficient and delivered on time however the helium_gas_cylinder ran_out before all the balloons that came in the pack were filled and the latex balloons didn_'_t float very well despite following all the instructions with regards to size etc .
neutral	a good time save but no cheaper_than high_street stores .
neutral	the large foil number ballons were excellent .
neutral	i ordered the flowers to be sent to my son & his partner in celebration of the birth of my first_grandchild , i ordered them friday_lunchtime and asked for them to be delivered saturday_morning as they had not come home from the hospital .
neutral	my son arrived home about 0 pm friday to find the flowers outside the front_door of their flat , whilst i am amazed_at the speed of the delivery i did not request same day delivery and was rather cross that a £_00 arrangement was left unattended on the doorstep .
neutral	the flowers could have quite easily been taken and my son would have never known .
neutral	luckily this did not happen so no_harm done .
neutral	everything i have bought from pro_cook i have been absolutely_delighted with , the quality , value for money the look , all really pleasing .
neutral	sadly my last order which was of a value of £_000 was delivered by_fedex to the house next door to a workman .
neutral	no card was left in the door to tell me what had happened to my goods .
neutral	my neighbor finally gave them to me and explained that the man working on her garden had signed and taken them in .
neutral	whilst i am happy i did get my goods i was ' nt too happy they were given to a workman , who could have easily put them in his van never to be seen again .
neutral	i contacted customer_services explaining what had happened saying i did not think this should have happened when i had left instructions for them to be delivered into my porch that was left open for this purpose .
neutral	i got really short changed by stephanie , who basically said in her email that it was not pro_cooks responsibility and if i wanted to complain was given fedex telephone no .
neutral	i replied that pro_cook were the ones who had contracted fedex to carry their goods and therefore it was for them to review the practices .
neutral	stephanie failed to reply .
neutral	i have kept her terse emails , and vowed as a result not to use pro_cook again .
neutral	shame because i love the goods but feel the customer service was so poor , on principal i won_'_t .
neutral	all she need to do was apologise and assure me that it would be looked into .
neutral	it seems to me that stephanie has completely missed the point .
neutral	yes the item was signed for , by a workman who i do not know .
neutral	the tracking also showed that the parcel was delivered to 00 buckwood avenue , which was untrue , it was delivered into the hands of a workman , who i have never met , to no 00 buckwood avenue .
neutral	if i had checked the tracking i would have seen it was signed for by a person i did not know had never met .
neutral	how would that have helped anyone .
neutral	delivery good , missing glass in display_unit , greasy marks on 0 leather_chairs .
neutral	other than that pleased with the furniture .
neutral	now that my hampers have arrived i can heave a sigh of relief but there were times i never thought i would ever see them .
neutral	please bring back the telephone_operators as just sometimes a human is required to assist with technical problems .
neutral	product looks nice , smaller_than i expected just hope the recipients will be happy .
neutral	at the time i ordered the flowers the order had trouble going through but there was no notification on the screen so i thought the order had gone_through .
neutral	i only thought to check my email_confirmations the day the flowers were to be delivered , to find out the order had not gone_through .
neutral	although i am happy with flowers they were a day late which is a shame when it was for my grandma '_s birthday and she had waited in all day for them to be delivered .
neutral	i called up to rectify the problem and there was no explanation for what had gone wrong or any apologies or discount .
neutral	i would go back to tsilivi tomorrow but not in that hotel there was so many small things wrong but over all the hotel was good small things easy to put right but trasfers were poor going and they were also poor on our last holiday to tenerife
neutral	items were delivered quickly but not very well_packaged .
neutral	cosmetic_damage to the table and cups ( which were not the ones ordered - different handles from those shown ) were lose in box rather_than being wrapped .
neutral	we have had 0 orders from blinds0go , and although the blinds look very smart we have found that they are not very robust .
neutral	the first time we pulled the blind up on the first order it broke and we had to ask for spare_parts to mend it .
neutral	the second order looked fine until we tried to put it up on the wall and found there was a faulty fixing point which_meant we had to re - thread the cord and put on a replacement fixing point , which was time_consuming and frustrating .
neutral	i don_'_t think that the fittings are robust_enough for the size and weight of the blinds .
neutral	it will be interesting to see how long they last , they are b no means cheap .
neutral	this was our 0th time with villa_plus and we were a little dissapointed this time .
neutral	the instructions to find the place were awful and the name of the road was not recognised by google_maps .
neutral	the villa and pool were lovely and as_described .
neutral	although we did feel that the villa was sparsley equipped and not enough cutlery etc for more than four people .
neutral	it is not near estepona as the description says , estepona is 0kms away .
neutral	you can walk to the beach and the supermarket .
neutral	however apart_from two beach bars all the resturants are along the main dual carriageway , which you can hear from the villa .
neutral	nice villa shame about the location !
neutral	dissappointed jn the vase as it was not as nice as the 0 i choose and paid for ?
neutral	i joined zoosk in jan_0000 as it was on facebook and seemed to be one of the cheaper dating websites .
neutral	was really looking to make friends and see where it went .
neutral	chatted to 0 or 0 guys and met a lovely guy and we are now in a relationship so it does work !
neutral	the thing i think they need to change is the carasoul thing where it asks if you would like to meet so and so and if you both say yes it notifies you but then you have to pay to be able to see that persons profile !!
neutral	this is so wrong as you have already paid - its just luck if you can find this persons profile yourself and arrange to meet - a few of the guys i spoke to also complained about this . shame really as apart_from this i would recommend zoosk !!
neutral	but overall i am happy as met my lovely man so thank_you zoosk .
neutral	i ordered my product online , i paid using their secure_payment system and my products where delivered 0_days_later .
neutral	they came in good packaging and it was exactly_what i had ordered .
neutral	i '_d definitely recommend this company and i would buy from them again .
neutral	my only_moan is the cost of the products , i was shocked if i '_m honest that they were so expensive .
neutral	i think companies should maybe review their prices as with free from foods it would seem that they can charge so much for so longer knowing that people have to buy them .
neutral	i was rather disappointed that i had to pay so much money for so little !
neutral	!
neutral	hi
neutral	i had an excelent servcie when teplephoned but no - one replied to my original email 00 days earlier
neutral	reasonable_price , efficient delivery .. then 0 or 0 follow_ups by email ?
neutral	what '_s that all about ?
neutral	this company is becoming such a nuisance i recommend put it through the internet spam filter .
neutral	totally enjoyed the actual tour and enjoyed the cheerful banter of the first tour rep .
neutral	this however was totally_ruined by the change over of tour_guides when we decided to stay on to continue our journey to our destination for a restaurant we had booked .
neutral	the guide was very rude and abrupt when he got on the bus .
neutral	having just been on the bus for a full tour with no_problems_whatsoever having our children sat next to us , as did many other families .
neutral	the 0nd tour_guide was not prepared to let the bus leave like this .
neutral	he insisted on all children_aged under 0 must be sat on parents laps .
neutral	being parents with twins ( 0 ) and daughter ( 0 ) we agreed however i could not understand_why we could not sit them next to us as we did with the first tour_guide .
neutral	the 0nd guide even made one family leave the bus as they had 0 children under 0 and the mother could not physically sit in her seat with two children on her lap .
neutral	the whole_experience was ruined by a rude and obnoxious guide who even claimed to having owned the company !
neutral	if these are the rules then they should of be made clearer before getting on the bus and abided by by all tour_guides .
neutral	personally it seemed more dangerous to me perching children on my lap than having them sat safely in a seat .
neutral	finally received my wedge_wellies which i am very pleased with .
neutral	unfortunately , the delivery was a bit of a trauma .
neutral	yodel brought them whilst my husband & i were out at work & unlike every other carrier didn_'_t leave the parcel at the local post_office .
neutral	i rang to re - arrange the delivery & was told between 00 - 0 pm the next_day which was another work day so no - one at home .
neutral	eventually agreed i would wait in on the saturday as would deliver again between 00 - 0 pm - i even gave my mobile number to the delivery man .
neutral	when he hadn_'_t arrived by 0 : 00_pm i rang him & he said he had finished work for the day & i politely pointed_out that he hadn_'_t & i wanted my parcel which he did bring about teatime .
neutral	i feel this has soured my experience with rubbersole .
neutral	very confusing , ordered a bbq & bbq_cover .
neutral	delivery of bbq being made by argos , bbq_cover sent under separate cover .
neutral	on the email_confirmation it doesn_'_t say they are being sent separately , and it says delivery within 0 working_days ... called homebase / argos to arrange delivery , to be offered the 0rd_april ( it '_s the 00th mar today ).
neutral	i then receive a text_message_saying delivery will be made within 00_hours , call homebase / argos again to double_check , to be told it must be the bbq_cover being delivered within 00_hours .
neutral	all calls to an 0000 number , not cheap when you have to keep calling !
neutral	ordered 0 rolls of paper from a sample , total £_000 .
neutral	not cheap !
neutral	waited and waited for it , no show so after a while i called wallpaper_direct .
neutral	it had not been sent to me because the manufacturers stopped printing it .
neutral	no email , no call to notify_me .
neutral	picking_up the car at the end of the holiday was good , they were there waiting , however dropping the car off was a nightmare .
neutral	the wrong instructions were printed on the email so we went to the wrong place , after a quick call we went to the correct place but had to keep driving around & around as you can '_t stop and park to wait for them to collect the car , as you keep getting moved on .
neutral	not lookingforparking fault but maybe think of a new place to pick people '_s car '_s up from & could wear uniform to identify yourself easier so customers can see you when driving past .
neutral	overall cheap and did the job so would book with them again dispite the drop_off hiccups
neutral	we had a few problems to start with , however these were sorted_out by the rep .
neutral	the villa over all was great , but a car would be helpful as shops were to far with a small child .
neutral	will be booking next year with
neutral	villa_plus .
neutral	i have been ordering razor baldes from this supplier for some time .
neutral	on previous occassions the package has_been delivered within a couple of working_days .
neutral	this time the items have taken 0_days to dispatch and a further 0_days to ship - overall 0_days from order .
neutral	to date ( 00 days_later ) they have still not arrived .
neutral	very disappoining .
neutral	my husband could have grown a beard in that time !.
neutral	i probably_won_'_t order again if it is going to take such a long time to deliver .
neutral	the local_solicitor contacted me but to date i have not heard any more he was sceptical as to whether a claim could be made but it would have been helpful if he could have finally said it was not possible and not keep me waiting .
neutral	the initial response was excellent and the telephone interviewer was very helpful .
neutral	good pre and during care but lacking in follow_up .
neutral	the poly_bags i purchased this time , i had a job with the plastic strip that you take of before sticking down .
neutral	the little_blighters just did not want to come off .
neutral	i placed an order and expected the delivery the next_day as i payed for next_day delivery .
neutral	and my stuff wasn_'_t delivered until 0days_later .
neutral	they had my car waiting at the airport on time as they said they would
neutral	we bought our corner settee unit and oak television_unit from colwick , nottingham , and was promised a wall clock .
neutral	both settee and television_unit were delivered on the 00rd october_0000 , the delivery men brought all items in to my conservatory and then left , i personally expected them to unpack the suite and set_up , no they didn_'_t , fortunately i am a relative young 00 year_old with a similar aged husband what would have happened if i was on my own .
neutral	( incidentally dfs unpack setup and take the packing away )
neutral	i am still_waiting for the wall clock
neutral	quite_expensive for what you actually get , although there is a good range to choose from .
neutral	the office staff were great and efficient with the order and special instructions for delivery and notification to a neighbour .
neutral	ups delivered on the wrong day and didn_'_t ring ahead as they said they would .
neutral	emailed their office with feedback but no response as yet .
neutral	everything was fine with ordering carnt_fault it . my only_complaint was i would have liked an_email or phone_call to let_me know goods had been despatched then i would have known they were at_least on their way so therefor i missed the delivery and had to make other arrangements for them to try and deliver again .
neutral	the balloon packs were a competitive price .
neutral	the delivery options were good and prices were fair .
neutral	deliveries were made as promised .
neutral	however , i had 00 orders to make to 00 different sites .
neutral	i had to do each order separately .
neutral	each time i had to re - enter the same lengthy details over and over again .
neutral	it took more than 0 . 0 hours to do all of them .
neutral	i contacted them first to see if i could do one big order but they couldn_'_t do it for me so i had to sit & plough thru it for myself .
neutral	if i could have set_up an account or registered my details instead , it would have been much_easier .
neutral	the website was easy to navigate and the prices were competitive .
neutral	i liked the fact that p_&_p was free .
neutral	my ordered arrived within a few_days but i thought i had ordered one thing and had recieved the wrong item - i emailed the customer service address and got a reply within_00hrs .
neutral	they explained that the right item had been sent and that i had ordered the wrong thing .
neutral	i was told i could return the items and a refund would be made , it was not possible to exchange an item and a new order would have to be placed .
neutral	had the item description been a little clearer or the customer service just a little better i would have given 0_stars .
neutral	i would place an order with animed again in the future .
neutral	the flowers i ordered on - line were of good quality and were fresh and they were delivered promptly , but i had specifically chosen an all white sheath and the flowers , when delivered , were all unmistakedly bright_yellow !
neutral	although i appreciate that there may be some discrepancies in colour and choice of flowers due to seasonal changes , i would never have chosen an all yellow sheath for a funeral .
neutral	i would not use this service again for that very reason .
neutral	received a cast_iron pot which i was really pleased with until i inspected it and found the lid had a small manufacturing defect .
neutral	disappointed it was shipped out however , emailed procook requesting a replacement lid suggesting i return the current lid and no response as yet ....
neutral	generally procook products are excellent and great value for money so this will not stop me from purchasing from them again !
neutral	:-)
neutral	when searching for a particular item type i have discovered that it won_'_t find the full range as it is dependent on a very basic description .
neutral	you need to add common tag - names to items of the same or similar type .
neutral	also a ' more like this ' option common on many other sales sites would be useful .
neutral	you also need to be aware that not everyone_knows what you normally call things .
neutral	the term ' clasp ' may mean something different to you and me - and it '_s me that is trying to find something for which i am willing to pay money .
neutral	the searching facility needs work .
neutral	customer service excellent from a guy called steve .
neutral	ordered one cheap pair of glasses with great success , the second_pair for 00 . 00 pounds took absolutely weeks to arrive and when they did the prescription was wrong , steve was great and told me to choose another style and my first choice was out of stock , initially there was a ten_pound difference which they asked me to pay , l wrote and said considering they made the mistake this was a bit much asking me to pay and they accepted that and waivered the difference .
neutral	0nd_pair arrived and they frames ( calvin_klein ) are so huge they fall_off my head when l look down and then one lence fell out .
neutral	contacted steve again and reordered another style calvin_klein which are unfortunately again huge , but now l just give up and l am going to have the original frame l liked with the wrong prescription changed at boots for a cost of 00 pounds .
neutral	would l do it again maybe !
neutral	if like me it is just reading_glasses anything more serious no , would not take the chance
neutral	website is excellent and easy to order but once you have pressed that button to pay and ship you get very little information .
neutral	ordered food and wormers on 0th_january .
neutral	wormers arrived promptly 0_days_later but after chasing 0 times the food turned_up 00 days_later !
neutral	i did not mind the delay but i had to chase - nobody sent me a holding email explaining that their warehouse was up to capacity and they would be some time in shipping my goods .
neutral	it wasn_'_t easy to place this order on line .
neutral	however , when i phoned to discuss this this was resolved .
neutral	to be honest this was easier than on line .
neutral	my friend was delighted with her flowers .
neutral	although i found loads of cheap products on there and the delivery speed is relatively good , the quality of products is not great .
neutral	alot of the things i have ordered have been damaged or opened .
neutral	on one recent order , the majority of my products were replacements so i ended_up with a package of things i did not want or need .
neutral	freebies that come with spending over a specified amount are good and bad .
neutral	the occasional lipgloss hasnt been too bad , but i recieved a completely broken watch recently and ended_up getting a replacement with the brand themselves .
neutral	however , i have never had any_problems with payment , although seeing negative_reviews online of ' sagepay ' the payment_method i have seemed to be fine with that .
neutral	i would use lens_store if you have left it too late to order your lenses from your usual_supplier as order usually_arrives next_day .
neutral	my normal_supplier takes 0_days and you must order and pay in person but it is only £_00 for 0_months_supply which is considerably_cheaper_than this company .
neutral	i ordered a 0 month_supply of hay_fever tablets for £ 0 which was amazing value .
neutral	it was an easy transaction on the website and i only had to pay a small delivery fee .
neutral	the only_negative_point was that the tablets took about 0_weeks to be delivered and i had to send an_email to get in touch about then which nobody replied to .
neutral	i have used this park for years but on my recent visit i found it too dark and the road uneven .
neutral	i could not even see where to swipe my card as it was so dark .
neutral	neither did in appreciate sitting on an almost full bus for 00_minutes as the bus only runs every 00_minutes .
neutral	very impressed that we could order for same day delivery .
neutral	but they flowers chosen by my granddaughters for their mother ( the recipient ) were specially picked for their bright_colours because she_loves them .
neutral	we loved the vivid gerbera contrasting with the zingy green of the chrysanthemums .
neutral	we were , therefore , very disappointed to find one very small gerbera and white_lilies , pale_pink flowers and other white ones substituted .
neutral	whilst quite pretty if we had wanted pastel colours we could have got them from several other_firms eg interflora .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t use this firm again because of the substitutions .
neutral	i have replied to ur response to my first enquiry regading not being happy with the book i received ...
neutral	i want to take your offer of a voucher to redo the order but need to know how to get it and how to send book back ... also address in which to send it ...
neutral	thanking you for your time ...
neutral	mrs . v barnes
neutral	ordered my items , and after waiting nearly 0_weeks i then rang john_anthony and turns_out after recently moving my items were delivered to my billing_address not my delivery address which was clearly_stated differently , luckily they got sent back to john_anthony i '_m bristol , they said they were resenting my items out which they did .
neutral	although 0_days before christmas was not what i was hoping for !
neutral	i ordered a 0 0 / 0 and got a 0 , two_days before leaving on a holiday .
neutral	no time to return the boots , i have been forced to wear them with two_pairs of socks .
neutral	it '_s really a shame because they are gorgeous .
neutral	i bought my furniture in livingston .
neutral	it cost £ 0000 yet was asked to pay £_00 for delivery although oak_furnitureland advertise free delivery .
neutral	when i said this the lady said but £_00 is cheap for delivery and you would get a quicker delivery within a 0 hour_slot , which is what happened anyway without paying and on the day she said .
neutral	not so happy with service but delivery and packing and the furniture were excellent .
neutral	got my costume within a week , sadly had to send it back , was of very poor quality for the price :(
neutral	i thought the website was very straight_forward except for two things - it doesn_'_t specify anywhere that if your car fails an mot there is a free retest .
neutral	i then rang the freephone_number to check before i booked and was put through to the margate branch , which don_'_t do mots and had no answer to give me .
neutral	they gave_me the wrong number for the folkestone branch i was trying to use , so i had to ring them back , and get the real number again .
neutral	unnecessary hassle .
neutral	however the man i spoke to at the folkestone branch was very nice , pleasant and efficient .
neutral	good quality wood but on opening my sideboard we found a chip on the corner which was very disappointing
neutral	when i order the flowers i thought they would be in some form of bouquet or arrangement , but they were delivered individually in a cardboard_box - as they were delivered to a hotel , my mother had to get a vase and arrange herself - not idea when away from home .
neutral	flowers were lovely though and i can not fault the service or communication .
neutral	the costume was ok , ( robin_hood ) it was for world_book day , so was disappointed to have to pay almost £_00 to guarantee next_day delivery .
neutral	i also bought the ' deluxe ' bow and arrow set , it looked vey good , but was rather useless - you couldn_'_t actually use it !
neutral	!
neutral	flowers arrive on wrong day and late in evening , i as for a morning deliver
neutral	the website was easy and very simple to use , it has a lot of info on the products etc .
neutral	except when my order came , one of lenses was damaged
neutral	flowers were nice but delivery let the company down .
neutral	i think ebay is great for all its bargains you can get and you ca also make a bit of money for yourself if you have anything to sell .
neutral	if i '_m spending > £_000 i don_'_t expect to have to pay p_&_p - i would have gone to the store to avoid the charge but the local_stores only had 0 apiece and i needed 0 ...
neutral	the décor of this villa really let it down .
neutral	from the ill_fitting curtains to the poor quality fixtures and fittings .
neutral	it was quite disappointing .
neutral	the pool_table was in poor condition .
neutral	the microwave did not work and the air_conditioning leaked .
neutral	also not much point in having tv '_s in the bedrooms as there were no channels available .
neutral	the only saving_grace was the pool which was spotless and really well looked after .
neutral	a very average experience i definitely would not recommend .
neutral	the price was good for the the car and the staff at the airport were very friendly and quick to process our booking .
neutral	however , the outside of the car was in terrible condition .
neutral	also , the child_seat we had for our 0 . 0 year_old was of extremely poor condition .
neutral	i ordered m fireproof / waterproof box on the basis of next_day delivery and paid the fee accordingly .
neutral	i waited in the whole of the next_day but by 0 . 00pm i was rather fed_up with the wait so i telephoned to simply be told the carrier had made a mistake and my box would not be delivered until the next working day .
neutral	i explained i wasn_'_t very happy at the situation particularly as i had changed plans to be available to receive the box and maybe it would be a good idea if the they could let the customer know about the delay earlier .
neutral	however , that was a friday and the box was duly delivered the following_monday .
neutral	i am very pleased with the product , and i requested the refund of the next_day delivery cost which i am assured has_been dealt_with .
neutral	i '_ve been waiting 00 days so far .
neutral	item has_been dispatched , but still not received .
neutral	the bouquet was disappointing .
neutral	whilst i appreciate that the lilies will last longer when closed it was a smaller display than in the photo than i was expecting
neutral	there was no need to pack in such a large box and trying to unpack it was a task in itself , it took 00_minutes to get into packaging and a few broken nails !!
neutral	you surely are not doing anything for the planet by using such excessive_packaging .
neutral	if you had used the right amount of packaging the parcel could have been posted through the letter_box , therefore you could charge less postage to your customers !
neutral	i would like to receive a refund for the postage please ..
neutral	i have not had any_problems with any of my purchases before , however i was unable to purchase my lasts order as the wowcher_code did not work that was sent to me for the heated eye lash curlers .
neutral	so the £ 0 has_been taken from my account by paypal and i have no item and have been unable to find a number to contact you .
neutral	i am buying this tool for my son so hope it is the right thing , but the description was clear and precise .
neutral	i received a voucher for my birthday as i wanted a particular pair of glasses and the sunglasses_shop claim to price match .
neutral	went online and checked my pair and yep , said it price matched them .
neutral	called to order and i was told no price match on chanel and they had made a mistake .
neutral	emailed them and advised that trading_standards don_'_t like this sort of thing and a manager emailed to say on this occasion they would allow it .
neutral	the manager was pleasant and polite on the phone and gave them to me on the price match but i suspect anyone without good knowledge on this sort of thing would be left without .
neutral	shame ...
neutral	very clear and easy to use site with a good selection of personalised goods .
neutral	unfortunately i was really disappointed in the quality of the sash i ordered .
neutral	the " hot pink " was more a peachy salmon and the black writing was dark_grey so it didn_'_t stand_out or look the same as the mock_up on the website .
neutral	there was also a blue mark in the writing and the 0 ends of the sash were just cut_off and not sewn together , which_meant i had to sew them together my self .
neutral	i ordered late on sunday_night and paid_extra for a 0 day delivery .
neutral	the sash arrived on the wednesday , which was 0 working_days after the order so that was fine .
neutral	if i had left more time before the event i would definitely have returned the sash for either a replacement or refund .
neutral	even_though i have had a bad_experience i would still have another try and order from the site again leaving plenty of time to return the goods if_necessary !
neutral	incredibly pleased with how quick the order was put_together .
neutral	was just disappointed with where were left as they were put at the front_door rather_than in a secluded space as anyone could '_ve taken them .
neutral	the bunch was smaller_than pictured but were pretty none the less .
neutral	overall fairly pleased with the result to cheer_up a friend in need , thank_you
neutral	ordered a northface top , received a northface top but a different style .
neutral	returned it for super_fast refund of full_amount & both postages .
neutral	sorry i didn_'_t get my top but really happy with their response times .
neutral	found site on internet , head_office arranged for engineer to contact me via_email within 0_days , after 0_days phoned head_office to be told engineer would phone me that afternoon , still_waiting , also told at that point lead time for servicing was probably 00 days , this was not made clear at time of booking or payment .
neutral	i ordered some vogue glasses frames as they were half the price i had to pay here in the uk . said they were in stock but clearly weren_'_t .
neutral	got a few emails_telling_me they were then waiting for the frames so was delayed a month .
neutral	finally received and are lovely frames but disappointed i paid for something that said in stock and then had a prolonged wait .
neutral	i was emailed to keep me informed though .
neutral	i ordered and paid for three genie head massagers .
neutral	i received just one .
neutral	i immediately e_- mailed gadget_grotto informing them that two genie head massagers are missing but i '_ve not received a response .
neutral	the head massager i received is in a broken carton , making it unfit to give as a gift .
neutral	00th_january
neutral	the two missing genie head massagers arrived today , in good condition and packed well so i '_ve decided to upgrade my review .
neutral	second time with you , first very good , second fine apart_from a weeks delay as the tiles were out of stock .
neutral	i wasn_'_t told this until after i '_d paid and ordered them .
neutral	fortunately the delay didn_'_t hinder my tiler but i should have been told at time of order .
neutral	although the flowers when they did arrive were amazing and of a beautiful quality .
neutral	one they were delivered a day late and the chocolates i ordered to go along with the flowers were not delivered .
neutral	ordered a number of items online .
neutral	bike locks , bike_rack etc ; unfortunately they called to say that none of the main items were in stock and that i ought to go straight to the shop and buy / order them from there .
neutral	which didn_'_t really impress upon me the idea that they were a serious online_retailer .
neutral	maybe they should just have an online enquiry service instead ?
neutral	items ordered were a bit_tricky , they sent out everything i requested ; but it dribs and drabs .
neutral	can '_t remember if site said that all was in stock or not , but crucial item turned_up too late and all had to be returned .
neutral	i wasn_'_t a dream customer and this was somewhat balanced at their end too ... hence 0_stars .
neutral	the bombing and spray helped , i made sure to follow the instructions and advice i found on this website .
neutral	when i came back inside , however , a lot of the fleas seemed to have congregated around the bombs , and were still_alive .
neutral	i think we will have to bomb again , which is very expensive .
neutral	the spray , however is ace , i really recommend it .
neutral	been trying to find freshlook everywhere , finally i can buy now every_month .
neutral	the show_room was lovely , and buying the furniture was very easy .
neutral	we received a phonecall to say we could have our furniture delivered on the 0th , so arranged for my dad to be at our house .
neutral	unfortunately , we received another phone_call trying to rearrange for another date , when we explained that we already had been given a delivery date and had made arrangements , they denied that they had even called .
neutral	however , after my partner had explained firmly their mistake , they did manage to ' squeeze it on the van '.
neutral	they were not able to phone my dad , even_though the number was given to them , so this caused more difficulties on the morning .
neutral	however , they did deliver within the allotted_time and the furniture was fine .
neutral	we liked the design of the wedding thank_you card as it fitted in with our_wedding theme .
neutral	the card is a good quality however the three pictures we uploaded to go on the card came out really dark , which is a really shame as it spoilt the card a little .
neutral	i would think in this day and age that returns would be foc .
neutral	this is the only site where i have to pay to return goods .
neutral	i have to say this does put me off ordering online .
neutral	ordering is fine but i paid for postage and delivery and gave instructions shoudl we be away , which were completely_ignored and the box was left in front of the house in full_view .
neutral	by luck my mother called at the house the next_day and the found the box and was able to take it in had she not the box wpuld have been left there for a fortnight .
neutral	good website , good prices .
neutral	but ....
neutral	i ordered 0 separate bouquets for 0 separate people .
neutral	only got one delivered on the proper day , the other 0 didn_'_t get delivered until the following g day , one without a card ( the recipient had to email to see who they were from !!!).
neutral	i got plenty of emails and texts_letting_me know were and when my orders would be delivered , but they were all mixed up .... getting a text saying that the recipient have received their flowers and then an_email_saying they would be sent the next_day .
neutral	first time using them , don_'_t think i will use again !!
neutral	!
neutral	j ' ai_été livré assez rapidement .
neutral	mon chien s ' est raffolé de_l ' os et a assez aimé les petits os au gout de poulet , mais il_n ' apprécie pas du_tout la contenu du coffret " i love my pet " surtout composé de biscuits .
neutral	finally received my order today , nine days after ordering .
neutral	have used this company several_times in past and usually delivered within 0 working_days so surprised this order took so long .
neutral	other than that the items were correct and a good price .
neutral	the trophies where great but like i said the sticker kept_falling out the middle .
neutral	other than that nice looking trophies
neutral	delivery took over a week which , compared to other_websites and especially amazin , is just too long .
neutral	the holding email about stock being delivered in mondays didn_'_t make a huge_difference .
neutral	all in all , just too slow .
neutral	the booking was wasy , but i think i paid a little to much , but i guess it '_ll do .
neutral	i never had a problem with this insurance company but i was taken_aback when told this time if i had to cancel a family_member was diagnosed with a terminal disease my insurance would not cover . i hope and pray that this does not happen but i will check out other_companies next year before renewing .
neutral	i ordered on line on the sunglasses page .
neutral	thought i had ordered two_pairs of sunglasses but when they came they were ordinary glasses .
neutral	the lady i spoke to was very helpful and said a coating could be added but not in time for my holiday .
neutral	i think the web_site could be a little more user_friendly .
neutral	you are giving me a full_refund which i am grateful for but it '_s a shame that this is not made clearer on the web .
neutral	ordered the glasses , there was a query and then i had to go through to them to ' jog ' their memory that i had ordered .
neutral	0_stars because then they came through very quick ;_y nut not the service i expected after previous good expereinces .
neutral	item not used yet so cannot_comment on suitability .
neutral	just moved and the shower only has one bottom roller .
neutral	have been in contact with stuart who has_been helpful but wrong parts sent to me so have to go to all the bother of sending them back at my expense then hope the photos i '_ve sent can be paired up with the correct ones .
neutral	i have suggested i send the roller i have to you if it makes it easier to pair up but still_waiting for a reply .
neutral	i '_m very anxious and want this cleared up .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	so with a title like that , why only 0_stars ?
neutral	the main_reason is the packing .
neutral	i ordered two canvas bags and a mug .
neutral	no_problems with the mug - it was wrapped in a ' jiffy ' bag and well_protected .
neutral	the only protection for the two bags was the box everything came in and a load of ' cross - cut ' shredded_paper to fill in the cracks .
neutral	this stuck to the canvas fibres of the bags and i first of all tried to brush them down to remove the bits of paper , but the fibres were getting in my throat , nose and mouth - as well as paper everywhere .
neutral	i tried to vacuum them off and thought i had succeeded until i presented one to a friend today and still bits of paper were in the nooks and crannies .
neutral	kiltmakers , when i contacted them about this , tell me they use this method to be ecological and meet targets - well with electricity used at this end , not to mention time and effort , coughing and tissues used i can_assure them that there has_been no savings here !
neutral	i have bought several items from kiltmakers in the past - i will think_twice before doing so again .
neutral	one of the orders i placed a month_ago never arrived , i was requested to wait 00 working_days before filing a lost report ( which is exceptionally time_consuming because normally other stores will open a case when the order is 0 or 0_days late ).
neutral	and then i was given a claim_form to fill out and email back , but it has already been a week and i did not receive any reply of when my replacement will be posted , or whether they '_ve even processed my form yet .
neutral	the price is good and the customer service staff are polite , but the processing speed is much below standard .
neutral	update_: called them after_submitting the review , the staff who answered my call picked_up quickly , went through basic confirmation , and said he '_ll process my replacement right away and have it dispatched either today or latest by tomorrow .
neutral	from what it appears , beautybay only has 0 staff replying emails but 00 staff answering phone_calls .
neutral	advice to fellow shoppers : this is a site where you can order online , but everything else afterwards needs to be done by phone .
neutral	if you can or are available to contact them by phone , problems can be solved quickly .
neutral	if you live_overseas and can only contact them by email , this is not a site you should use .
neutral	the selection of products was brilliant , and site navigation and the shopping_experience were really easy , then the products arrived quite quickly ( though a bit later than initially stated ).
neutral	the sizes were a little large and the quality of the products wasn_'_t brilliant , but it was good enough for the price .
neutral	i '_d shop there again .
neutral	not too bad .
neutral	easy enough to use but some information hard to find .
neutral	this website does not accept visa_debit_card which is a huge inconvenience for a young person like myself who does not have a credit_card , so i had to scramble to use somebody_else '_s .
neutral	i will tell you when i have travelled using alpha insurance - that will be at the beginning of november !
neutral	!
neutral	since changing couriers the delivery has_been a nightmare , i am promised delivery but they just dont turn_up .
neutral	affordable_supplements to their credit do then act quickly by either refunding or using another courier .
neutral	bottom line is they need to change the courier they use or will loose a lot of business mine included .
neutral	was pleased with the service .
neutral	my bag was picked_up on time and i could track it online easily .
neutral	paid for the 00_hours service to take my things back up to university but it didn_'_t arrive on the day it should have - instead , on the following_day .
neutral	this was annoying because i did pay extra for the 00 hour service .
neutral	ordering the costume was easy and delivery was quick even_though i only paid the standard .
neutral	the costume colours were a nice_surprise as the cape and arms glisten purple and teal but in the picture look green .
neutral	there '_s a bit of velcro used on the costume which unavoidably catches the sleeves so has ruined the material and i '_ve not even worn it to my party yet .
neutral	also it has cost more as i have had to pay a dressmaker to add wire to the collar as it '_s floppy and doesn_'_t stay up .
neutral	the what is meant to be an under bust corset has no structure so when you pull the ribbon it just bunches up and the bottom curls up so the dressmaker is fixing the for me too .
neutral	i would never normally complain but for nearly_£_00 in total i expected better but it is the best looking costume of maleficent i could find .
neutral	good service , delivery very quick , but the item ordered is awful ... looks nothing like the wig in the picture ... poor quality .
neutral	had kwik_fit out to my place of work to replace two tyres that had caused mot failure .
neutral	service in ordering the tyres online & booking date were great and although i booked these at 0pm one night , i got a call first thing the next_morning to confirm the date and details , brilliant !
neutral	day of fitting arrives , technician was a nice guy had both tyres done within half an_hour but said due to wear & tear the wheel_locking nut device had ceased with a locking nut on .
neutral	made out this was perfectly normal & would be a small cost to replace .
neutral	emphasis on how he '_d made sure he '_d got the tyre fitted to help me out .
neutral	queue visit to garage next_day to put car through re - test .
neutral	to be told that the technician should never have forced the wheel off and that i would need a replacement of all wheel_locking nuts which could be quite_costly ,
neutral	this left me quite irate and when i called kwik_fit they admitted the technician should have stopped immediately when he realised he couldnt get the wheel off to replace the tyre and should have consulted me first before_proceeding .
neutral	they then paid the garage direct the costs to replace the wheel_locking nuts and also cost of labour incurred as the garage had to sort replacement for me and carry out some work to ensure the tyre was fitted correctly .
neutral	( in mechanics words the tyre was only fitted ' finger tight ')
neutral	great service to start with , ok service resolving the problem .
neutral	if only the technician hadnt openly lied to me to cover his mistake i would have rated higher .
neutral	its a shame that in 0000 this profession still treats women like idiots !!!
neutral	!
neutral	hfe were able to provide exactly_what i requested .
neutral	they were prompt and helpful .
neutral	however i found the written instructions about attaching lettering to a banner very unclear .
neutral	i had to ring hfe and ask rachel to explain what i had to do .
neutral	the enclosed instructions should be simplified .
neutral	perhaps a diagram ?
neutral	my first order was delivered very promptly .
neutral	my second order took four days , despite the order confirmation_email_saying one or two_days .
neutral	my second order came to over_£_00 . 00 , and i was charged_£ 0 . 00 p_&_p .
neutral	i noticed later on the website that orders over_£_00 . 00 are delivered free .
neutral	there are circumstances where the delivery is not free - this should be notified on the order so that the customer is aware .
neutral	i keep receiving emails from pharmacy0u on matters that are of no interest to me ( losing_weight , stopping_smoking , migraines , to name but three ).
neutral	i unsubscribed from receiving emails , but i am still getting them .
neutral	i tried to unsubscribe again but the web_page told me i was already unsubscribed .
neutral	so why am i still getting these emails ?
neutral	ordered 0 items from the company .
neutral	first item arrived but am still_waiting for the second .
neutral	would have appreciated something from the company on why it has_been delayed , especially when the money was taken out very promptly over a month_ago .
neutral	took our order and money gave_us a fitting time and then later phoned to say the wouldn_'_t have the tyres and we would need to book / agree to a later date . this has i '_m afraid put a black_mark on our experience .
neutral	i live in aberdeen .
neutral	i kept getting offers for all over scotland , mainly glasgow .
neutral	the few i could use were filled very quickly .
neutral	my first order was delivered in time for christmas .
neutral	unfortunately , not the company '_s fault , one of the jumpers although large was smaller_than the other large sized jumpers that i bought in a different style .
neutral	i returned the jumper and didn_'_t hear_anything for a few_weeks .
neutral	then i was told it would be a couple of weeks because the larger_size was out of stock .
neutral	i then received an e_- mail some several days past the date that it was supposed to be delivered giving me another due date .
neutral	it still didn_'_t arrive by that date but has now .
neutral	i am completely_satisfied with the jumper .
neutral	the service leaves much to be desired .
neutral	quick and easy to order .
neutral	the metal ones rub on the nose bridge a little but to be expected for the price .
neutral	received a damaged parcel .
neutral	when contacted , they said they '_ll get back to me in 0 business days .
neutral	been more than a week , nothing !
neutral	contacted them .
neutral	customer service didnt sound professional enough .
neutral	rest must be good but then this was my first opinion
neutral	i order from animed all the time but lately my order takes_longer to arrive dont no if this is the royal_mail or animed i no it saiz a werk but mine is taking longer
neutral	i ordered 0 port sipper glasses from the site for a christmas_present for my partner .
neutral	the payments process was easy and convenient and delivery was fast , however the item was not packed up very well and could have easily gotten broken in transit as the glasses were in a not very well padded cardboard_box .
neutral	the cardboard_box itself was inside a semi transparent plastic mail bag which had a large hole torn in in when i received it ( so easy to see what '_s inside ), and the bag had large drinkstuff branding all over it .
neutral	i really would appreciate discreet_packaging ensuring the if the recipient see '_s the package that they won_'_t know anything about what '_s in it !
neutral	flowers were fine , and delivered on time .
neutral	my only_complaint is with yodel leaving the flowers at the front of the house , ignoring my instructions to leave them with a neighbour .
neutral	after much research , i ordered my black american_walnut_worktop from worktop_express because they were the only company who offered the width of i wanted ( 000mm ) combined with the length ( 0m ).
neutral	i placed the order weeks in_advance of when i needed it delivering .
neutral	however , a few_days before the delivery was due ( and once the builders were already booked in and on site ) i was informed that the long pieces were out of stock , and there was a week '_s delay , which affected my builders and consequently my relationship with them .
neutral	however , the quality of wood , and the communications otherwise were very good .
neutral	i just wish i '_d been told earlier about the delay so that i could have rescheduled the builder .
neutral	i was really pleased with how the dresses i ordered looked when they arrived .
neutral	the only downfalls were the less_than generous_sizing ( not good for the ego !)
neutral	and the intense musty factory smell they gave off !!
neutral	after w a wash they were fine and i received a few compliments when i wore them for the first time so . it was worth it in the end !
neutral	!
neutral	easy to follow_instructions to send your phones in but postage and packing is all up to you to pay for and i didn_'_t receive to full_amount i was quoted even_though my phones were in perfect_condition .
neutral	ok , parcel was delayed .
neutral	microphone is surprisingly good and in working order but the packaging was damaged with large puncture holes around it .
neutral	the cd that came with it , that includes tips on how to record with the rode nt0a was completely damaged and is unplayable .
neutral	i would recommend although u get what u pay for .
neutral	doesn_'_t seem useful to me and when i had an account there i had troubles writing those short messages .
neutral	not useful to me , sorry , but i like the logo alot .
neutral	:-)
neutral	the front page looks very spammy , i can not even check my emails or use the search without reading about the latest robert pattinson trash .
neutral	too bad , as i made my very first email account with yahoo :-(
neutral	somehow i don_'_t seem to have luck with internet providers .
neutral	always having problems with the connection and customer service .
neutral	same with 0 & 0 , sometimes i have people on the phone that are trying very hard , and sometimes they are just rude .
neutral	the company should really check who they are putting on the phone because this gives me a bad image of the company that really doesn_'_t have to be .
neutral	i flew with lufthansa 0 times already , two times short and two times long_distance .
neutral	the long_distance flight was awesome : excellent service , nice & experienced staff , great media centre with lots of movies to pick .
neutral	the short_distance flights were both delayed and the boarding was very weird , at first i thought wow this is superquick but then everybody was cramped in the dark tunnel in front of the plane and standing around for at_least 00_minutes instead of still staying in the boarding hall and doing it properly , with back seats first and so on .
neutral	i have mixed_feelings about this airline , i would need to fly with it again to see in which direction it is going .
neutral	but unfortunately most of the times its a very pricey option , although they land at the most convenient airports .
neutral	let '_s see !
neutral	i think the fees on ebay are way too high ( 0 %!!!
neutral	), while prices go up for the sellers , it '_s good for buyers .
neutral	i sell alot of my clothes on ebay ( or at_least try to ) and most of them go away for a way too cheap price .
neutral	somehow people seem to have lost interest on bidding and ebaying .
neutral	it '_s really not the same as it used to be , i dont enjoy it as much as i did before and i am looking for other_sites to sell my perfectly new clothes now .
neutral	:(
neutral	when getting an estimate price of £_000 for my iphone_0s 00gb white which was only 00 months old i thought hmm cheap price but quick and easy when i needed the cash for my daughters_birthday .
neutral	however it then cost me £ 0 to send the phone and upon orange receiving it they gave_me a price of £_000 therefore £_00 less_than the original price .
neutral	this upset me as phone was in perfect_condition and if i '_d of had time to sell on ebay i '_d of got around £_000 -£_000 for my phone .
neutral	being desperate and the fact id spent £ 0 ; delivery plus would have to wait for them to return my phone , i accepted the offer .
neutral	other than their low_prices and false potential with offers it was a very quick and easy sale .
neutral	great delivery time .
neutral	unfortunately shoes did not fit and were too tight .
neutral	i did not see any warning that ,
neutral	a ) the shoes were coming sweden , and
neutral	b ) i would be responsible for the postage unless there was a " fault "
neutral	in the product .
neutral	cost me over_£ 0 to return them so not a happy_bunny .
neutral	after much frustration i '_m finally sitting here with the angry_birds game i ordered as a present almost a month_ago just in time for christmas .
neutral	when i ordered the game at the end of november i pretty confident their 0 working_days delivery would leave me with plenty of time to get it wrapped up and sorted_out and when i didn_'_t receive the email to confirm it had been despatched after two_days as they said i would , i didn_'_t think any of it .
neutral	however , after two_weeks of not hearing_anything , i got a bit annoyed .
neutral	there was no reply to my first email .
neutral	or my phone_call to the office listed on the website .
neutral	after another week i complained on trustpilot because i didn_'_t want people to experience the same thing .
neutral	however , after another email to nicecans , they replied_saying they were very sorry and that they '_d been overwhelmed with how many orders they '_d got and they were really sorry that they hadn_'_t got in touch before .
neutral	as i am a firm believer in second chances , i told them to either make_sure my item arrived by the 00nd or give me a refund .
neutral	they told me they '_d post it to me the next_day ( as they '_d run_out of stock and were getting a new load delivered ).
neutral	i accepted that and received an update email_saying my item had been dispatched the day after .
neutral	today , the 00nd , my angry_birds game arrived in the post .
neutral	i doubt i '_d recommend nicecans to a friend or even use it again for something with a deadline , but i might try it at a less busy time ( with something cheap ) to see if they can offer better service when it '_s not christmas .
neutral	i created a photobook with cewe_photoworld .
neutral	the software was ok if you were happy to use their display templates but if i wanted to arrange the photos in any other way it was difficult .
neutral	plus some of the photos were printed with light grey borders and some weren_'_t - i have no idea why as i didn_'_t consciously choose this as a feature .
neutral	the print quality was fine .
neutral	items arrived promptly , its a pity that the nicely_boxed item came in a bag which was not enough protection , and it reached me squashed flat .
neutral	have returned it and am awaiting news !
neutral	great to see all the other positive_feedback posts but wasn_'_t such a good experience for me .
neutral	order arrived incomplete and poorly packed with a broken item .
neutral	a replacement was sent and delivered to the house next door ( despite someone being home ) and with no name on .
neutral	the missing items were out of stock but wasn_'_t advised at the time of order which would have given me the option to shop elsewhere - only found out they were out of stock as i phoned up to ask where they were .
neutral	i now have the complete order ( but overall it was a bit of a headache and can '_t say i '_ll be in any great hurry to order anything_else .
neutral	i completed most of the info the website information requested to send a bouquet of flowers to my niece to celebrate the birth of their child .
neutral	they moved recently so needed a postcode for the delivery address .
neutral	acquired this a few hours_later and sent in my order .
neutral	i realised it was a tight_deadline for next_day delivery but i received an_email_saying my order had been received and thought no more about it .... until amazon_local emailed to say i had only a few_days to redeem my voucher - this was over a week after i had ordered the bouquet originally for a special_occasion .
neutral	however , when i contacted serenata_flowers they replied quickly and asked if i wanted a refund .
neutral	asked for a new delivery plus some chocolates added .
neutral	they did this ( a few chocolates anyway ) and my niece was very pleased .
neutral	so a 00 / 00 experience but what would have happened if i hadn_'_t used a voucher - i was beginning to think my niece very rude !
neutral	amazing roller_coaster arrived promptly and well_packaged .
neutral	however the product was virtually_impossible to construct even when we spent a lot of time on it ( 0 adult and 0 0 year_old ).
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	it seems the basic design of the product is poor .
neutral	i ordered the lenses online which was easy and straightforward even better that i could use my paypal_account .
neutral	after waiting over a week my lenses still hadn_'_t arrived i contacted lenstore and spoke to a very helpful lady_who advised she would resend my lenses by recorded mail .
neutral	i am awaiting their arrival .
neutral	gut gut gut gut
neutral	not sure i understand_why price on ticket is different to what you pay would be wary next time on using you .
neutral	i have bought some excellent items from wowcher which were delivered speedily and of good quality .
neutral	however i have had a problem with one supplier - the beauty challenge who initially failed to deliver any of the 0 items i ordered as xmas_gifts for my 0 kids - then after much chasing delivered three ( which i can '_t use as i need one for each ) - but is now not responding to emails or answering phone_calls about the missing two - i have called repeatedly every day for 00 days .
neutral	i have emailed wowcher twice - just had an acknowledgement but no action .
neutral	i then called wowcher on the phone and was told to wait for the other two to arrive as they had been redeemed on different dates - they weren_'_t !
neutral	am now fed_up waiting - and am thinking i should contact my credit_card company and paypal to dispute the charges unless i get a response .
neutral	i have not opened the products - but although they are advertised as original selling pice £_00 . 00 - sale price £_00 . 00 they look cheap - and are much smaller_than they appear as advertised .
neutral	i also suspect they are not mains operated as_described , but won_'_t know until i open .
neutral	in addition i have spent an exorbitant £_00 . 00 on postage for three featherlight boxes crammed in one a0 envelope .
neutral	( max £ 0 postage ).
neutral	update - i received an_immediate_response from wowcher after my review asking me to contact them - which i did .
neutral	i then received a copy email wowcher sent to the beautychallenge a day or so later - which asked the beauty challenge to contact me .
neutral	needless to say beautychallenge have not done so - nor have the missing items appeared .
neutral	i would now like a full_refund - can wowcher confirm how they would like me to do this - given that their merchant does not respond ?
neutral	i would also like wowcher to say what they propose to do about merchants who fail to honour their commitments and then fail to respond to either the customer or wowcher .
neutral	i cannot be the only one fleeced in this way - the beauty challenge customer service department answered no phone_calls from any of the various numbers i called from in the 00 days prior to christmas - why was that ?
neutral	nor did they reply to emails .
neutral	update
neutral	heard from wowcher who have now processed my complaint and given me a refund .
neutral	thank_you to kerry who responded to my last email within 00_hours - i have given three stars because of problem with merchant - but would have given more for wowcher if just rating them - as they did do the decent thing once it became_clear merchant was not going to respond .
neutral	ordered , received email notification that it would be delivered on 00th , waited all day , not delivered , received another email would now be monday 00th , not impressed
neutral	it '_s alright , takes a while to get your cashback but you get it , and that '_s what matters i guess !
neutral	the service very good , updates on delivery , would have preferred more buds on the flowers , rather_than open , as would last longer .
neutral	beautiful flowers , but bit_pricey for ten stems .
neutral	i may stick to physically choosing flowers from a store , so i know what i get for my money .
neutral	good experience though .
neutral	we love homebase and have never had an issue .
neutral	this time the reservation service was great and the item was ready when we got there .
neutral	however the bird table we ordered is not good .
neutral	smaller_than the dimensions on the internet and the top is wobbly so now we have to return it :( sure it will be fine but a little annoying !
neutral	hello i am disappointed you have not told me if the flowers have been delivered with your same day service .
neutral	there may be distressing family circumstances for the recipient meaning they cannot let the sender know themselves immediately .
neutral	why not send confirmation when order is delivered ?
neutral	well i really enjoyed the ship , the experience was spot_on .
neutral	first time since i was a child being on a ship and i was fine .
neutral	the food when you don_'_t pre book is very very expensive for what you get but it was our first time , we went all out because why not ?
neutral	the cinema screen was great , nice and quiet and the popcorn and nachos were delicious !
neutral	had a few drinks but not big drinkers anyway but still enjoyed the boat experience !
neutral	the rooms were fine , small but workable - apart_from the shower !
neutral	tiny shower_head over the toilet_seat isn_'_t very practicable ... slept fine couldn_'_t hear a thing , very comfy beds but could do with another pillow .
neutral	amsterdam was so so , didn_'_t live up to what we thought but we made the most of it anyway , icebar was a let_down but it was a lovely sunny day had plenty time to do things , we said we will go all out as won_'_t do it again , have been saying it since but now do want to do it again as it '_s a nice 0 day getaway !
neutral	cheap for the room but we will prebook meals next time , and plan what sites to hit in amsterdam .
neutral	overall a decent experience , weren_'_t lovers of it at the time but now we do fancy it again !
neutral	good little first getaway with boyfriends / girlfriends , we managed well !
neutral	nice item but arranged delivery and it never turned_up , took a day off and it arrived 0 week_later when i was on holiday .
neutral	good job my neighbour took it in for me .
neutral	have purchased a very large item before from them and charges were minimal , but they wanted 00_quid to deliver a fairly small item to me , it was only 0 . 00 to get it delivered to glasgow .... i do not live in a remote or island location !
neutral	!
neutral	would never pay that price again for one direction_tickets again £_000 . 00 in total , what with booking_fees and other add on , but people say once you get " stung " so from now on , i will be looking more closey to what i '_m actually paying for .
neutral	so i '_m afraid it '_s bye_bye viagogo
neutral	i was sent the wrong item by chemistdirect which is frustrating .
neutral	when i called they quickly arranged for a courier to pick it up and delivered a replacement , but no apology was offered .
neutral	the pricing is very competitive though .
neutral	said it would be with me in one to day it took a week .
neutral	so not very happy
neutral	purchasing shoes from rubbersole was like buying them from a robot .
neutral	had i not needed to exchange this i might not have minded but as i did ( and experienced severe days - rubbersole don_'_t seem to have correctly linked up with the connect_+ service so make_sure you keep your proof of posting !)
neutral	it was a real pain .
neutral	add to this that all their emails end up in your bulk folder i won_'_t be buying from them again !
neutral	products are a very good price but the service lets it down .
neutral	the item was late to arrive and the ' free gifts ' were not included in the delivery due to being sold out .
neutral	also , the satisfaction survey was sent before the items arrived .
neutral	i would probably try somewhere_else .
neutral	sorry .
neutral	recently bought a couple of outfits .
neutral	sumo wrestler and gi soldier .
neutral	service was great but was disappointed with soldier_outfit as the seams had been sewn very quickly and it fell_apart as i was wearing it which was very embarrassing .
neutral	the seams just pulled through the material , even_though it was plenty big enough , and someone had to keep sewing them up for me throughout the night .
neutral	booking a parking_space , finding and getting into the car_park all worked well .
neutral	the problem was trying to find a parking_space - we drove round and round and round , thankful that we had left plenty of time .
neutral	after a very frustrating time we eventually found a space .
neutral	it would have been helpful to have had car_park staff to direct us .. we waited 00_mins for a bus , so in total it proved to be a time_consuming and rather anxiety provoking experience .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t choose to use this particular car_park again .
neutral	thought the bottle would be bigger and thought they would of filled the perfume right up !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a pure radio through go - electrical as they seem to be an_independent and at the same price as john_lewis i decided to support a small business .
neutral	their website indicated the item was in stock and so i ordered .
neutral	upon chasing a delivery date i was informed that they were awaiting the item to arrive in stock .
neutral	i did not receive a response to my subsequent email .
neutral	bit_disappointing considering the great feedback given through the trust_pilot site .
neutral	i am a regular user and very happy with the actual online side of the site .
neutral	the site is great , easy to use and i normally use the collection option for my orders which is free .
neutral	i have collected from a variety of their stores and i have to say that the whole collection process is really painful .
neutral	a lot of the stores don_'_t have a dedicated collection desk so you end up having to queue at a normal till only to be told that they are too busy and you should go to a different department .
neutral	they really need to look into ways of streamlining this collection process at all of their collection stores to encourage people to use this method .
neutral	i can '_t_believe that when you ' re spending close to £ 0000 on a suite , they add delivery on top .
neutral	then they want you to buy a leather treatment pack and then protection cover .
neutral	good choice of suites but be prepared to pay more than what '_s on the price_tag .
neutral	requested and paid for next_day delivery and didnt get it .
neutral	when delivery recieved its done in way far inferior to other_companies that deliver for free leaving you with a pallet to dispose of .
neutral	sink and toilet and cabinet of just about acceptable standard re money paid .
neutral	shower cabin instructions very unhelpful , item described as easy to assemble and made in a way to eliminate need to channel in pipe work both statements wholly inaccurate , instruction refer to a " skirt " which is not supplied plumber had to make a base for tray to sit on as it is far too shallow , basically quite dissapointed with the whole_thing .
neutral	i have made quite a few photo_books before , but with a different company .
neutral	i bought this as it was a good deal on a voucher site .
neutral	i downloaded the software as instructed , which was easy to do .
neutral	the choice of layouts , background_colours etc was good and you can really personalise your book .
neutral	however , when i got into placing the photos on the page and scrolling_through the available photos in my folders , the software would crash .
neutral	the whole program would shut_down and i would have to recover the file and then continue .
neutral	this could happen every time i scrolled_through my photos - very annoying and made the process so much longer_than it could have been .
neutral	when i had eventually finished my book i then placed the order and waited for the book to be uploaded - this i had to attempt 0 times as it kept freezing after only 0 minutes or so .
neutral	i do now own a lovely photo_book of our travels , however the whole_experience was arduous and annoying to say the least .
neutral	i was tempted to not bother with photoworld and pay full price with the company i normally use , but the discount kept me going !
neutral	having found the bar_stool i liked on tesco '_s website cheaper , ( although actually supplied by lakeland ), i called to find out if you would price match if i were to place the order direct with yourselves .
neutral	the girl on the phone was not the most helpful and told me i would have to email my question instead .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t received a reply , so i placed my order with tesco it was quicker and cheaper .
neutral	despite the order status being acknowledged via_email there was no tracking option , so i did not know exactly_what day my package was going to arrive .
neutral	when the 0 packages did arrive , one was intact and the other had opened and a pole was sticking out the side of the box .
neutral	i remarked to the delivery man about the state of the parcel thinking it had not been packaged very well .
neutral	he informed me that the packages were intact when he picked them up from his depot that morning .
neutral	however whilst placing one package in his van it ' exploded ' and nearly hit him on the head and took him by complete surprise .
neutral	it was one of the gas_lift poles from the bar_stool that was protruding from the box and had caused it to rip open .
neutral	( the pole was now fully extended - unlike the other 0 packaged in the box and half the size ).
neutral	unfortunately this caused come additional damage to the base , which i am now going to have to return .
neutral	i have not contacted lakeland , yet but i '_m certainly wanting a quick and smooth returns process .
neutral	my recommendation would be that the box should be marked with a warning , as this could have been dangerous .
neutral	it would have been nice if the flowers had been delivered a little earlier_than 0 . 00pm birthday almost over by then .
neutral	the tracking history shows it was received in depot at 00 . 00 and loaded_onto the van at 00 . 00 so it took a long time for flowers to arrive at destination only 00 miles_away .
neutral	most of the time , quidco is excellent , but the it is spoilt be a dispute over a payment .
neutral	i know quidco only acts as a portal , but when a company disputes a purchase , and the order details are supplied , surely , as quidco always pops_up a window to say the visit has_been recorded , it would be easy to verify .
neutral	it is very frustrating to have claims disputed , apparently at random .
neutral	on the plus_side , the small_amount of money i have earned has_been lovely .
neutral	the sunglasses were dispatched very quickly after_placing the order and were really competitively_priced .
neutral	the glasses themselves were perfect !
neutral	the delivery service was unfortunately poor and would discourage me from shopping again .
neutral	the glasses were delivered whilst i was out , no card was left and the only reference was the name of the person_who signed for them ( which i didn_'_t recognise ) found on the tracking website .
neutral	several calls / days_later i found our that that they had been delivered to a neighbour 0 doors away , rather inconvenient all in all .
neutral	the product was good value .
neutral	the case is great for carrying it around and the product perfect for what we use it for ( exhibitions and smaller scale events ).
neutral	the website was clear and the order process itself was good , i was even given free kit kats .
neutral	however , the delivery let the company down .
neutral	it was next_day delivery and i didn_'_t recieve it next_day so i rang them two_days_later to chase .
neutral	i was told that the delivery van had broken down and that it would be delivered that day ( friday ).
neutral	it still didn_'_t arrive and consequently i had to wait_until the monday .
neutral	i would have appreciated a courtesy_call to let_me know that the delivery would not happen on the day it was meant to rather_than me having to take time out to chase .
neutral	perfume is genuine .
neutral	cheap_smells used to have a better service when used to ship to malta directly .
neutral	now i need to ship to uk then ship to malta therefore more_expensive to ship and takes_longer to arrive .
neutral	i don_'_t purchase so much any more since it is not worth it any longer .
neutral	the lenses i ordered arrived very quickly and were as_described but what i received were two lenses and nothing else .
neutral	the prescription was stated on each one but there was no information as to how to use / care for the lenses .
neutral	i am a regular contact_lens user but i felt there should have been some information on that front !
neutral	i '_m often seduced by the products offered but invariably disappointed .
neutral	delivery is often slow and items not always of the best quality .
neutral	it was written " we will issue the ticket ( s ), and send a " travel document " e_- mail including trip details and ticket number ( s ) within 00_hours .".
neutral	i '_m still_waiting for my travel documents . please send it as soon as possible .
neutral	best regards
neutral	i like playing at tombola do feel there is a lot of same names win most games and same jackpot winners .
neutral	also there are some people in chat rooms who are allowed to take over rooms and there is alot of bullying betwwen these people and other players .
neutral	the chat moderators always favour them who feel they own a room to the person_who is being bullied .
neutral	i would love to have a change of luck in the site but dont see that ever happening .
neutral	used this service for a number of years .
neutral	previously very good product and service excellent .
neutral	this time however glasses took_ages to arrive , not sure if i will use again .
neutral	the apartment is in a really nice building in a great area .
neutral	easy to get to the metro and lots of great places to eat nearby .
neutral	however the interior is little tired and could do with some attention - it didn_'_t feel very luxurious and there was quite a lot of clutter in cupboards and drawers ( exactly_what we wanted to escape from on holiday !)
neutral	beautiful ideas about gifts and decorations on the site .
neutral	titmuss are usally great , i always use them for my dog products and they have always been great .
neutral	i was diappointed this time , the delivery was in batches and because i am not always as on the ball as i could be - i need everything on the due delivery date .
neutral	this time my order came in batches and the main food delivery was a day late .
neutral	i was most concerned because i was not informed there would be a delay .
neutral	i could have made contingency measures if i had known .
neutral	flowers were a thank_you to someone_who had done us a good turn .
neutral	later found out that the flowers were a small bunch and not worth the money we paid .
neutral	the three bud roses failed to open and withered quite quickly .
neutral	the whole bunch didn_'_t last the week .
neutral	would definitely not recommend and certainly would not use again .
neutral	i bought an item as a gift , although the product itself was great the packaging supplied to gift_wrap it was disappointing .
neutral	the pandora bag was too large for the small item and the branded ribbon supplied to tie the bag was not long enough to create a a bow at all .
neutral	i tried three_times to use my credit_card to pay with and each time the screen crashed .
neutral	fortunately my details were saved .
neutral	there was plenty of credit on it so no poblem with cash shortage .
neutral	i paid in the end with my debit_card and that was accepted - so it wasn_'_t my browser after all .
neutral	the credit_card refusal was a bit of a mystery .
neutral	otherwise , the times of trains and connections were clearly_stated .
neutral	great products overall no_problems love the items , i like to order online as you can get better offers sometimes , its just easy to order and receive your item without going to find an actual store sometimes when you don_'_t have time to go out shopping .
neutral	my only problem with superdry is if the item doesn_'_t fit and you want to return for a refund or another size is needed .
neutral	great that you can get a full_refund by returning to superdry if bought online ( unlike in the stores you can only get a credit_note or exchange ) the only_drawback with posting back to get your refund / exchange being the cost to return your items as they are usually quite bulky / heavy expensive items and it can become expensive to return if you order a couple of sizes to try .
neutral	also the exchange wasn_'_t quick enough as the item had sold out by the time superdry had gotten round to sorting the return / exchange out ( down to superdry returns processing times ) , if refunds were an option in store i could have exchanged the one size and got a refund on the other size i ordered .
neutral	in the end i had nothing just the refund and a £_00 . 00 postage fee for nothing which was slightly_disappointing so if anything to improve would be allow refunds in store , find a way to have free postal returns and quicker in processing exchanges .
neutral	thanks
neutral	this website offers lots of great american products that i am missing .
neutral	ordering was easy and delivery was quick .
neutral	the prices are high as at all sources of american food in france , but that is to be expected .
neutral	my biggest complaint is that while some items seemed to have been well - protected , others were just shoved or thrown in the box .
neutral	0 item ( a present for my daughter ) was broken in 0 .
neutral	another was smashed and leaking all over the box .
neutral	this was very disappointing .
neutral	i '_ve ordered from other online sources of american products , and this order was the least well - packed of those i have received .
neutral	due to this problem , i '_m not sure i will use this site again .
neutral	fast speedy service when i purchased , but when it came to the delivery it was a joke !!
neutral	i had to wait for the computer to generate a time , no human_being could over ride the computer apparently - it took 0 attempts to get a convenient delivery slot !!
neutral	hard_work .
neutral	order 0 tyres , dropped_off car , paid a taxi to get to work only to be told later that day that the tyres never arrived .
neutral	canceled order but out of pocket taxi_fare to and from garage !
neutral	update_: customer service rang and offered me an ten_percent discount on next order for my troubles so am changing one star_rating to three
neutral	i ordered a second drill and was informed that the drill was discontinued but another one would be available at the end of feb and they would send out to me . this did not happen so i contracted them and they said they would ring back with information , but as previously happened they failed again . i feel the staff employed at ray_grahams are very poor when customers are promised some action to rectify specific problems and will cost the business future return business .
neutral	good booking_system , efficient check in and out at reception .
neutral	excellent room and bathroom .
neutral	really pleased with the bar and restaurant areas , enjoyed a good evening_meal and a few drinks .
neutral	just a shame the beds were so uncomfortable .
neutral	this company offers a very good selection of products at good prices .
neutral	i waited three_weeks for delivery but hope thats just a one off .
neutral	if you are running_low order well in_advance taking into account you might not receive in time .
neutral	would like to see a better service where you are advised without asking that your order has_been delayed_due to stock .
neutral	would use again though .
neutral	good product , quick delivery , poor customer service .
neutral	unclear how to claim free_postage when spending over a certain_amount .
neutral	then extremely unhelpful service via_email .
neutral	no apologies or attemp to correct .
neutral	having found a good range of tiles at very good prices and an easy to use website i chose a delivery date when i knew i would be in , when i returned from the christmas break on 00th_dec i found 0 delivery cards from 00th and 00th_dec , so then had to contact interlink for redelivery on my chosen date again , the box was in a very bad state when it arrived , it may be good sometimes to get things early but if you are asked for a specified date and no one contacts you to say any different ?
neutral	was very disapointed in service .
neutral	for £ 0 . 00 i expected a bigger box of chocolates considering thorntons do a massive box for £ 0 .
neutral	there were 00 chocolates in the box which were very nice but duplicated so 0 of each .
neutral	overall very nice chocolates but due to size , once shared within the family , not enough left for the person_who recieved them to enjoy .
neutral	i would have said they were worth half the price .
neutral	you '_d be better off with an ordinary box of chocolates .
neutral	it '_s a lovely coat .
neutral	the three zips are very annoying , it '_s very time_consuming to get coat on and off .
neutral	had to wait ages for size to be in stock .
neutral	when i rang customer service they weren_'_t very helpful as to when it would be in stock just told to keep looking
neutral	they are quite_expensive
neutral	i wasn_'_t happy with the quality of 0 of the products i had purchased from british_corner_shop and so requested a refund .
neutral	my request was dealt_with quickly and i wasn_'_t asked to return the items .
neutral	i was disappointed that i didn_'_t receive the quality that i expected but very impressed with how well they responded to my request .
neutral	i have used_serenta_flowers several_times before , but this time i was let_down .
neutral	the flowers were for my best friend of 00 years birthday and they failed to arrive on the date requested .
neutral	she_lives many miles from me and this was my way if showing i cared and she was remembered .
neutral	when they did arrive apparently they were lovely .
neutral	on all three blinds , we are having trouble with the pulleys putting the blinds up and down .
neutral	i placed my order on the tuesday .
neutral	i paid_extra for express delivery .
neutral	did not receive my item until the following_tuesday .
neutral	i ordered a protec riot helmet for my sons_birthday ( 0_weeks prior ) - after 0_days i heard_nothing on dispatch so when i chased i heard it was still coming from a store - nothing on my order said it wasn_'_t in stock .
neutral	it arrived 0 week after ordering - the box was all smashed up as it was delivered in a bag .
neutral	so couldn_'_t keep in box to wrap it up
neutral	maybe it would have been easier just to go to the next town and buy one from the store .
neutral	i thought i was saving time and money :)
neutral	on a plus - he_loves_his present !
neutral	!
neutral	i have travelled with dfds over the last 00 years on many occasions , visting scandanavia and many other placed so i was very excited to be taking this trip for valentines_day .
neutral	we took the 0 hour trip up to newcastle and found that our departure was delayed for 0 hours due to bad_weather but the return would be delayed so we would still have out allotted_time in amsterdam .
neutral	when we were on board we enjoyed the facilities but quite soon the journey became quite rocky .
neutral	the motion in the ocean was very bad in the night but we had been used to rocky crossings in the past .
neutral	we fortunately were not sick but heard many of the residents around us in other cabins being ill . we had sleep disturbed due to the unstable journey .
neutral	there was an annoucement to say we were delayed further but would have to wait for the marine pilot to land to escort us into the harbour but a free lunch would be provided .
neutral	we should have arrived around 00am in amsterdam .
neutral	lunch was served at 00pm .
neutral	we then were informed at 0pm that the pilot could not land on the ship but we were to kept_informed .
neutral	the boat was not travelling and so by the time the pilot landed and we finally embarked we arrived at the drop_off point in amsterdam at 0 . 00pm meaning we only had 0 hour in amsterdam - in the dark !
neutral	our return was delayed and we eventually left the ship - after another rocky return trip at 0 . 00pm .
neutral	this is an awfully long time to spend on the ship .
neutral	my partner had never been to amsterdam and we had a full couple of hours planned but this was not to be .
neutral	personally , i am disappointed to say after all these years that i doubt i will be travelling with dfds again .
neutral	i know the weather cannot be controlled but i feel under the circumstances the trip may have been cancelled or at_least a refund offered at the time .
neutral	booked on ebookers because they were the best price , but there is always a catch ..... you can buy a ticket but cannot buy cancelation insurance nor travel_insurance but you can get a hotel or car !
neutral	i called later to ask for a insurance but after a very long security_check and explaining i want insurance the operator actualy asked if i wanted to be put through to a insurance company !
neutral	the insurance company asked several questions , they said i could buy travel and cancelation insurance but they would not sell me any due to the fact that i am not a resident of the uk !
neutral	so you can buy with ebookers but thats it .
neutral	am i the only one out there who has difficulty with the size of the capsule .
neutral	i can still work the machine but i have to manually press the lever_down and hold it there .
neutral	the lever cannot close as it ought to .
neutral	have never had this difficulty with other capsules .
neutral	but as i say , my husband ( the coffee drinker ) loves the coffee itself , just a pain to make it .
neutral	delivery was good .
neutral	ordering was easy .
neutral	everything excellent except tweaking the capsule size .
neutral	the ordering process was easy on - line , but there was no after care service via_e_- mail .
neutral	i had to ring twice for updates as to the progress of the order .
neutral	bought tickets for bastille in london only realising that they where over 00 '_s only when i read the actual ticket .
neutral	i couldn_'_t find it on viagogo .
neutral	would be helpful to mention this when selling the tickets .
neutral	the service was good , the website is easy to order from , the coat arrived quickly , but unfortunately there was a security_tag attached under the arm and trying to contact your customer service wasn_'_t easy as the phones do not get answered , this would have caused a major_issue had it not been that my son works in a clothes shop with the same style of tags and was able to take the coat into work and remove it for me .
neutral	the coat being from superdry is good quality as expected
neutral	my dressing_table was easy to order but the original delivery date wasn_'_t honoured .
neutral	i was supposed to get part of it by end of november but was told it had been delayed and would be january .
neutral	i then got an_email a couple if days before christmas and when i called it turned_out it had already arrived and they were just waiting for a non essential part .
neutral	this was very annoying as i '_d already said i would pay 0 delivery charges .
neutral	once i had a delivery date it was hassle_free .
neutral	the dressing_table looks great and is very solid .
neutral	the drawers aren_'_t finished brilliantly and are very heavy ( i needed silicon spray to make them run ) but all in all i '_m pleased with it .
neutral	not sure if this is a point for rentalcars or for europcar , but having looked on the website , we noted that the rental office was closed on sundays , which is when we wanted to return the car . therefore we decided to drop_off a day earlier .
neutral	however , when we arrived at the pick - up point , we discovered , only through a sign on the door , that it was possible to return the car outside office hours via key drop - off at a local hotel .
neutral	when we asked europcar if we could therefore extend by a day , they said it had to be done through rentalcars , or else pay a large_amount to them to do a separate contract .
neutral	they advised i phone rentalcars , but did not want me to use their office phone to do so .
neutral	i phoned using my mobile , but after a lengthy call they said it couldn_'_t be done .
neutral	it would therefore be helpful if information on drop - off outside office hours could be included in rentalcar website .
neutral	excellent hotel , well_worth the money !
neutral	handy having someone_else sort_out money .
neutral	spa day sounded great so we booked it , it was in a grubby hotel that wasn_'_t a spa it had tiny changing rooms which were dirty and smelly , pool was old and run down , jacuzzi was small and old , not big enough to hold a hen_party as only 0 broken un loungers !!!
neutral	food was expensive and not discounted as advertised , i was really embarrassed that people had paid for this !!!
neutral	party bus well this was something_else words can '_t describe what a rip_off it was .
neutral	first bar we were taken too was disgusting in everyday , you could almost hear the tumble weed as we walked in !
neutral	we literally paid £_00 for nothing !!
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered party boxes and table_decorations for my daughters 0th_birthday .
neutral	the merchandise arrived in plenty of time however the carton that was pictured with the pirate galleon was not included .
neutral	i asked customer_services if they could send these to me and i got a " computer says no " answer .
neutral	very frustrating and a little common_sense would have been nice however i was told to reorder the cartons and pay another fast track shipping charge .
neutral	i have my other daughters party in june and won_'_t be ordering from partyrama !
neutral	see above please .
neutral	good price but disappointed at short expiry_date .
neutral	the payment for postage should be met by mazuma not the seller .
neutral	my profit was hardly worth the effort of sealing the parcel , queuing at the post_office to pay and wait for payment to me .
neutral	only bonus is that someone somewhere may get a recycled phone .
neutral	next time i may just bin it !
neutral	racking seems ok but :-
neutral	first lot of shelves - some the wrong depth and all damaged by courier .
neutral	second lot of shelves - not damaged but still some wrong_size .
neutral	had to get my carpenter to cut down .
neutral	cheaper_than getting him to come_back yet another day .
neutral	big_dug gave_us a small credit towards this inconvenience .
neutral	the matchbooks were beautiful unfortunately the party was on saturday and they didnt arrive until monday !
neutral	very disappointing
neutral	i still_haven_'_t received my goods , it '_s been 0_weeks .
neutral	it timed me out in like 00_minutes of me trying to figure_out if the ticket was good for me .
neutral	i went to pay for it and it said my session had timed out and then when i searched it again , surprise it was more_expensive !
neutral	although staff were friendly and helpful on the phone i had to chase_up the order which was delivered the day after we had originally agreed .
neutral	the quality of the printed logo on some of the usb_sticks did not meet the standard as displayed on the mock - ups .
neutral	some were not suitable to pass on to clients including one that had black paint splashes on the back .
neutral	overall , a friendly service but a little disappointed in the final_result .
neutral	collection and garage service all good ... i had an mot and full service & kept my full 0 year kia warranty .
neutral	very happy with the garage & worth_checking when they tell you which garage it is going too ..
neutral	i asked the guy_who picked_up my car ( who was from the garage ) how much for tracking - he said about £_00 & i told him to do it ..
neutral	the call back from servicing_stop was the big surprise as they firstly told me the tracking cost was £_00 ..!!
neutral	( added £_00 ) & then went on to say that the brake oil required flushing and replacing at a cost of £_00 .
neutral	i called a local_garage about this and they advised that this was over - priced and it would not have needed the oil change based against the mileage the car done .
neutral	i paid neither ..!!
neutral	- be strong with the sales_person from servicing_stop and go and check the validity of what they are saying - you can say no !.
neutral	the website states next_day delivery but mine took a week .
neutral	they look pretty but not what we expected .
neutral	disappointing and not sure we will use this site again .
neutral	shame as have another 0 people to send flowers too
neutral	i was disappointed with my purchase .
neutral	the bouquet was quite small and the flowers were not packed in a way which either helped them to stay fresh - they were looking quite limp after waiting a few hours to be presented as part of a leaving gift , or attractive - brown_paper inside plastic doesn_'_t look very nice .
neutral	the impression given by the pictures on the website is misleading in my view .
neutral	to be honest , i only went back to kwikfit for the sake of convenience , because they offered a home service .
neutral	on previous_occasions the staff in my local_branch have been rude as well as unhelpful - i never did get a proper explanation as to why i had ended_up on the hard shoulder of the m0 in heavy_rain , with my newly_fitted windscreen_wipers wrapped round each other .
neutral	the mechanic who came out to fit my tyres this time was friendly , polite and efficient .
neutral	i '_ve never seen him at my local_branch , and i suspect he doesn_'_t work there , but he has restored my faith in the company .
neutral	i have had numerous books from you now and this lat one seemed very expensive i am wanting to do more but to be honest will look elsewhere if i don t see a change in price .
neutral	i was pleased to order my offroad lite sandals before they were available locally but the toe strap nubuck leather had some small dirty marks on both shoes .
neutral	as i had a nubuck cleaning block i was able to remove them ( 00_%) & decided not to return as i need them next week .
neutral	however the quality checks could be improved !
neutral	i have tried diet_chef before and found the meals convenient & acceptable , but now don_'_t seem to be experiencing any weight_loss as it seems i am committed to 0_months i am not looking_forward to the experience
neutral	i have always thought raja pack too expensive , but i love their silver kraft_paper it is excellent quality so i always buy it .
neutral	i also wanted some boxes to put products in that needed gift_wrapping , very hard to find , but rajapack had some so i thought i would give it a go .
neutral	wrapping aper is great , box are ok , but they have their logo on so not very gifty .
neutral	arrived in a massive oversized box ( you would think a packing compnay would have the right sized box !)
neutral	so it was all squashed and split_open .
neutral	luckily product was undamaged .
neutral	i ordered some flowers for my sister that were delivered on the day but left on the doorstep because they weren_'_t in .
neutral	the flowers didn_'_t have water so started to sag a bit .
neutral	serenata replaced them as soon as i got in touch with them though , sending a fresh bunch on a day of my choosing .
neutral	transaction was very simple and easy but it didn_'_t give me an option to write a personalized message .
neutral	i emailed customer service immediately after purchasing the flowers , they never responsed to me .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	it was my friends birthday , she didn_'_t even know who the flowers were from ...
neutral	sent arrangement to the usa .
neutral	arrived on time but quite cheap considering what i paid
neutral	ordered online on the 00th_december for delivery to a collect_plus location the next_day .
neutral	received email with tracking_number stating goods had been despatched .
neutral	tracked parcel the next_day ( 00th_dec ) which was the delivery due day and delivery site just said goods in transit !
neutral	tracked parcel the day after ( 00th_dec ) to find that the goods had been refused by addressee and returned to sender !!
neutral	checked with my collect_plus store to find out why goods had been refused to find out that no deliveries had been attempted in my name !
neutral	i have a lot of parcels go to this collect_plus store and the owner said he would not have refused a parcel in my name as he knows me !
neutral	emailed superdry customer service to let them know ( 00th_dec ) and request a replacement immediately as this was required for an xmas_present , and to date i have received no goods and had no reply !!
neutral	i am not impressed !
neutral	never_experienced that cs_team is closed for lunch , this is most bizarre since other customers can call only during these times .
neutral	managed to speak to cs representative who quickly helped to respond to one part of my enquiry to my satisfactory .
neutral	partyrama advertises free delivery over_£_00 , but it doesn_'_t work automatically and is not clear on the store delivery or checkout pages .
neutral	i have missed it and only wanted to suggest some improvements but have faced negative side of cs_team .
neutral	site requires improvement and cs_team could be more helpful when people provide suggestions .
neutral	i called customer service to amend my order five_minutes after_placing it .
neutral	the person over the phone - although was able to help me 000_% - sound very dull and bored .
neutral	i initially was not sure_whether she was listening to me at all .
neutral	0_stars for wae competitive_prices and ability to solve my problem though .
neutral	the delivery was quick and so was getting a refund apon returning my items but boo . hoo needs to have bigger_sizes available , i '_m generally a size 00 - 00 but boo . hoo '_s 00 came up like a size 00 and the 00 came up like a 00 so was very dissapointed with this
neutral	i have always been happy with topcashback , but recently i have been thinking_about leaving them , because i signed_up to a one month trial for cashbackplus and surprise , surprise , i forgot to cancel it .
neutral	i have earned less_than £ 0 in extra cashbackplus and have had £ 0 taken , as a fee for this service , so my £_00 pay - out has_been reduced to £_00 .
neutral	when i logged in to cancel the " plus " scheme , i found i cannot cancel until the next fee is due to be taken in september , when i will be away on hols .
neutral	not good enough !
neutral	drop_off was good there on arrival even_though we were later than our written time .
neutral	on return sadly a different_story as we had to wait 00_minutes for pick_up in wet cold and windy_weather .
neutral	driver was apologetic and explained why delayed .
neutral	would use again if price was right .
neutral	the crewebook i ordered was made with the help of a designer and when asked for feedback and editing , i found i couldn_'_t access it properly , i sent an_email and advised what changes i wanted and they were brilliantly done .
neutral	requires tarmacing throughout .
neutral	arrived when raining - horrible underfoot .
neutral	lots of puddles - could not drag cases through this - almost ripped wheels off so not good start - first bus did not pick us up , even_though looked quite empty .
neutral	driver mumbled something about having two buggies on board , which_meant nothing to us and then drove_off .
neutral	will have to consider whether will use again after this bad_experience .
neutral	i have already phoned re this matter , spoke to a very helpful customer service member of staff jake .
neutral	i wanted to hire the vehicle for 0_days but an_error was made and it was only allocated for 0_days !
neutral	i did not check the paperwork so i accept some responsibility .
neutral	my problem however is ;
neutral	upon realising the problem i phoned the garage from where i picked the vehicle , telling them i would return the vehicle later today where i obviously would pay what i owed , however i was not expecting to pay an additional_insurance of £_00 which i did not ask or sign for ?
neutral	i have therefore requested this be refunded .... jake was going to relay a ref_number re this but i had to hang up , bus arrived .
neutral	plus : the hand over of the vehicle took 00_mins to sort has the details had not correctly been relayed to the garage , hence there was not a vehicle for me .
neutral	plus : the return of the vehicle again took a long time , not enough staff and i had to get to a garage to collect my own vehicle , due to this delay the garage was closed .... hence more haste for myself tomorrow .
neutral	i would appreciate your findings in respect to ths matter .
neutral	yours_faithfully
neutral	georgina king
neutral	actual ordering experience online was fine .
neutral	i chose to collect from store but even_though the order confirmation_email stated the store would ring / contact when it '_s ready , no one did .
neutral	i called customer_services to be told it had been delivered to the store a week_ago - day after i ordered !!!
neutral	the store informed me thy never contact for collection .
neutral	i had tried a couple of times to check order status online but the website was down .
neutral	a simple text or email was all that was needed - onus shouldn_'_t be on the customer to have to keep checking .
neutral	given i '_d already tried to reserve and collect and had a poor experience there , can '_t say i '_m overly_impressed .... would warn friends if they ' re planning to order or reserve ...
neutral	the product however is great : 0 )
neutral	ok if you cannot get out and about or if you are short of time but i think they send too much spam emails and the payout is not as good as bet fred
neutral	the villa was amazing and fitted out to a very high_standard . the pool was brilliant and the gardens well_maintained .
neutral	the villa was also in quite a convenient position , quiet but only a short_walk from the shops and restaurants .
neutral	however i feel the owners let villa_plus down terribly .
neutral	they had removed all the inside keys so we could not lock the door between the pool room and the house which concerned me .
neutral	plus one bathroom door had been locked and the key removed .
neutral	we complained to " steve " when he came on day one and he claimed all the keys had been in place when he checked the property earlier . but we did not see or hear from steve again .
neutral	the sheets were thin and grubby looking and pillows were cheap and poor quality .
neutral	the maid was possibly the most miserable person in the algarve .
neutral	thankfully she only came once .
neutral	we were 0 adults and one baby in a villa with 0 double bedrooms sleeping at_least 0 people but were given 0 large and 0 small towels for the week ( we did not get a rent reduction for only being 0 adults so i do not see why we should have received less of anything - they even took away all the spare sunbed matresses leaving us with only 0 ) not even a towel for the baby , and no change of bed_linen or towels all week .
neutral	we had a baby with us and were only given one sheet for the travel_cot ( which was well past its sell by date and certainly not worth the £_00 extra i had to pay for it ).
neutral	the final insult came on the last day when the owners came and tried to bully their way into the villa early to clean , well before 00 . 00am when we were required to leave .
neutral	i made them wait outside .
neutral	this was our 0th visit to the algarve but our first with villa_plus , and sadly probably our last .
neutral	i bought magnetic tape which i thought would help me with a problem i was having , but it turned_out the tape was ' nt very magnetic at all and was ' nt up to the job . it could ' nt even attach a hair slide to it .
neutral	the flowers were delivered as requested , but the company send one too many emails , reporting imminent delivery , actual delivering , and then nagging one for feedback .
neutral	i will not be using them again for this reason .
neutral	great product , great website , " so - so " ordering experience , disappointing delivery options .
neutral	after i ordered ( over_£_000 order with free delivery ) i was told that if i wanted my order delivered to northern_ireland i had to pay an extra £_00 or else cancel order .
neutral	ni is officially in the uk and when i post something to " the mainland " it costs the same as posting to an address a few doors away from me ; so very frustrating when companies charge more .
neutral	would really like to use this site to order again however the delivery charge will stop me doing this .
neutral	almost every other shopping site in the uk offers free delivery , regardless of where in the uk you live .
neutral	the order did arrive quickly and in excellent condition .
neutral	feline y / d cat_food .
neutral	delivery a little_slow but service ok .
neutral	only just had experience of this company , but i am impressed so far .
neutral	love the website , and love ecco_shoes , but what you fail to understand is that people in general do not have ' standard ' feet .
neutral	it should be much_cheaper or free , to return items bought , if they don_'_t fit properly .
neutral	you are selling online you cannot try on before you buy !
neutral	!
neutral	glasses took 0_weeks to arrive , not 0 - 0_days as stated on web_site .
neutral	after 0_days wear the left lens was wabbling about due to loose fixing .
neutral	i percevered till the weekend and after a few emails , instructing me to mend them myself if i could , i sent them back to be repaired professionally .
neutral	purchased quite a lot of sparklers for halloween / bonfire weekend .
neutral	they where terrible !
neutral	they didn_'_t sparkle , was just like a coloured glow on the end of the stick !
neutral	!
neutral	won_'_t be buying from you again .
neutral	no_problems with item bought and excellent value for money although disappointed that wasn_'_t posted for 0_days when in stock and felt that my enquiry probably prompted that postage or may have been longer !
neutral	order not yet recieved
neutral	products and delivery system were great - i was able to change the delivery day to a convenient time which was useful .
neutral	i was informed on ordering that two items were out of stock and expected within 0_weeks .
neutral	one was delivered within this time .
neutral	i chased up the final item six_weeks_later and received a quick and friendly apology and assurance it was still on order and would be delivered soon .
neutral	the item was finally delivered 0_months after ordering date with no proactive communication from normans about this extremely long delay .
neutral	thankfully there was no hurry to get this item but i am surprised i was not kept_informed about the long wait and given an opportunity to cancel the order .
neutral	though other aspects of the service were good , this lack of communication could be improved considerably and would make me think_twice about ordering in future , especially if i needed an item quickly .
neutral	very prompt and efficient service at start staff we ' re attentive if a little fake and scripted .
neutral	after mortgage went through various people were ringing me daily leaving messages trying to sell me insurance when clearly i was ignoring them , after couple of months i had to call and say stop calling i am clearly not interested and even then the girl said shall i call again in few_weeks i just thought is this robot even listening .
neutral	i did actually i call your office to compliment the staff who dealt_with me in the beginning as i was impressed with their customer service but the girl who answered the phone asked a little tartly why do you want to know when i asked for the managers name ..... oh_dear what a shame i hung_up
neutral	i was given an upgrade code for delivery to arrive valentines_day , i used the code as per the advert but after chasing my delivery on valentines afternoon i was informed i was supposed to have ' checked ' a box that wasn_'_t there !
neutral	my valentines delivery did not turn_up !
neutral	very disappointed and not even an offer to refund the delivery i did pay for !
neutral	bravissimo all the way now !
neutral	nice but the item was not packaged as expected in a nice presentation_box .
neutral	it would have been nice considering the expense of the item .
neutral	my eminem tickets still_haven_'_t arrived and everybody else seems to have got theirs !
neutral	and it '_s still saying waiting for ticket availability :(
neutral	i placed an order total value £_000 . 00on 0 september , received 0 of 0 products on 00 september - all good ; but still_awaiting rest of order and receive random email advice of delay for just one of the items only ?!
neutral	- so will wait and see when receive rest .
neutral	as this is my first order not particularly impressed at the moment !
neutral	only down_side was that on completion date they couldn_'_t guarantee that someone would be in their office for the buyers to collect the keys .
neutral	on the up side they sold my house in months , which had been on the market with another estate_agent for 0 years .
neutral	i would recommend hatched .
neutral	£ 0 for postage for a small item and not even next_day delivery .
neutral	most other online shops offer free_postage over a certain_amount but not here .
neutral	it actually goes up with higher price items regardless of size .
neutral	item was fine but not what i was looking for so i took it back to the store - on their website it says its an easy way to return items .
neutral	i was told at the store it would have to be sent back to head_office to be processed and a refund would take 0 - 00 days !
neutral	never had this before !
neutral	they are quick to take your money but don_'_t like giving it back .
neutral	won_'_t be buying again from this website !
neutral	the toilet_seat was delivered very promptly and was easy to fit , however it was described as luxury which it isn_'_t .
neutral	the box was stamped as standard , which it obviously is .
neutral	disappointing !
neutral	i ordered my items from kiddicare on 00 december_0000 .
neutral	i received an_email_advising that my order would be delivered on thursday 0rd_january between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00 so stayed home all day .
neutral	nothing arrived so checked the website tracking for citylink where it had changed to delivery on the friday between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00 .
neutral	i again stayed home and again nothing delivered and no one contacted me and the website was updated at 0pm to say delivery on monday 0th between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00 .
neutral	on the monday at 00am nothing had arrived so i called citylink and was on hold for 00_minutes before being told that the package would definitely be delivered to me that day and that the driver would call me 00_minutes before delivery .
neutral	surprise , surprise nothing was delivered and nobody called me - checked the website and it had been updated to say delivery on tuesday 0th between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00 .
neutral	by 0 pm nothing had arrived so i called citylink again and was on the telephone for nearly 0 hour .
neutral	i was told that the parcel would definitely be delivered to me that night as the driver was staying on to deliver .
neutral	finally my parcel arrived at 0 . 00_pm on that night but i believe that if i hadn_'_t called them it would not have arrived .
neutral	it is absolutely_appalling that i had to stay in for 0 whole days to get this parcel delivered .
neutral	with a child , a dog and a job this was really not easy for me and not acceptable .
neutral	i ordered an item from another company on sunday 0th and this was delivered by citylink on tuesday_morning as agreed so totally_unacceptable that this happened with this parcel and very inconvenient .
neutral	will unfortunately make me reconsider using preciouslittleone again as this service is unacceptable .
neutral	we have had pills from you for a long time now but are very dissapointed in the glugosomine and crondroiton , they are always broken now and the powder is in the bottom of the tub , we are always throwing away the broken shells , if they dont improve in the next batch sorry we will have to find a new supplier .
neutral	yours june scott and husband .
neutral	i thought the preview section worked really well and liked the fact we could play with fonts and phrasing .
neutral	however , i received an_email on the 00st_january stating that my invitations had been dispatched and would be with me shortly .
neutral	a week has passed and i still have not received them .
neutral	how long does a parcel take from lancashire !
neutral	?
neutral	i have sent two emails and heard_nothing back .
neutral	at this rate the rsvp date printed will have passed !
neutral	becky
neutral	promises much .
neutral	delivers ... eventually .
neutral	usually after a lot of nagging !
neutral	time estmates for payout tend to be somewhat over - optimistic .
neutral	excuses for delay are ... creative , to say the least !
neutral	and a 00 week wait for a payout of £ 0 ?
neutral	i ask you !
neutral	as above when i have used the site i will look_forward to seeing the changes if there is any
neutral	i '_ve still to receive this order so on that basis i think it '_s very bad service !
neutral	bearing in mind i ordered this last thursday and we are now on wednesday_night !
neutral	not happy at all , hoping it will be here tomorrow but i only got an_email yesterday saying it had been dispatched that day on 0nd_class postage im not holding my breath ....
neutral	the products i purchased were good but i '_m afraid they were poorly packaged and two items never made it through the rigours of postage
neutral	i then couldn_'_t get any response to my email and the phone number was unvavailable , still_waiting for a response so not sure if ths will be resolved leaving me a bit disappointed
neutral	not keen on your delivery company [ signed for ] really who '_s in all day had to go and collect it .
neutral	loads of company '_s leave hidden in recycle boxes or over side gates .
neutral	just a thought .
neutral	i '_ve_used ocado probably about 00 times .
neutral	0 times they were way way out of time for their delivery slot .
neutral	once delivering at 0am !
neutral	!
neutral	it '_s really not cool .
neutral	when i complained to ocado , they didn_'_t apologise - merely said they can '_t always deliver in the allocated time_slot .
neutral	that '_s pretty_much it .
neutral	so why_bother choosing one ?
neutral	other than that , food is well_packaged and 00_% of the time they had everything i ordered .
neutral	indicaton times for payment are not accurate .
neutral	also , " faster paying " is not so !
neutral	!
neutral	as stated above difficult to find validation point but friendly service
neutral	i bought the wrong_size , emailed physioroom and got a reply within 00_hours .
neutral	re - ordered the belt and it arrived the next_day - wow .
neutral	so well_done physioroom for the service .
neutral	especially when i was in pain .
neutral	however i wouldnt recommend the belt because it smells - no it stinks - it smells of rubber but so strong that it makes my skin smell and my clothes smell ( i dont wear it next to my skin ) and when i hang it up at night it makes the room smell .
neutral	it is really antisocial - couldnt wear it to work - what would my clients think .
neutral	so i had to buy another type .
neutral	the belt per_se is brilliant but the smell is just unacceptable .
neutral	i put a review on here about our paris trip .
neutral	it was all good except for the transfers .
neutral	i had a reply from aiden to say that if i gave my booking_reference he would contact me to tell me how to get in touch to claim my money back .
neutral	i have heard_nothing .
neutral	aiden - my reference_number is 0000000

neutral	i arranged flowers to two recipients .
neutral	one was delivered as promised .
neutral	the other was delayed a day due to the weather and was supposed to be delivered today ( christmas_eve ).
neutral	i have not received an_email or a text to say the flowers were delivered so can only_assume they were not .
neutral	the status of my account still reads " routed to wrong depot / the parcel is in transit ".
neutral	please can someone let_me know what has happened ?
neutral	order no : q0000000
neutral	also , i was emailed yesterday to say there was a problem with delivering my flowers and the link took me to an_email to another person and showed that person '_s response !
neutral	excellent service from viovet on placing order and delivery of 0 item out of 0 .
neutral	emails from courier suggesting order delivered and in mail box ..... 00kg dog_food in mail box ?
neutral	viovet notified 0 times on friday needed food before weekend .
neutral	viovet failed to call me back each time .
neutral	finally informed food would be with me monday !
neutral	will use again on price if have to but not delivery methods ...
neutral	been to florida loads of times so know how system_works , sales_staff said we had to purchase a licence plate pass for the toll roads at $ 0 a day !!
neutral	as we cannot pay manually at toll booth ?
neutral	did ' nt purchase pass went outside asked a local police officer and he did ' nt mince his words , he advised they were trying to rip us off !!
neutral	the car and the staff at the parking lot however were great !
neutral	!
neutral	the parcel took a long time to arrive .
neutral	when trying to track the parcel the system said it had arrived at all_sorts of places that i didn_'_t understand , when it was still in transit .
neutral	it also said they had tried to deliver it at 0am on the day it did arrive - this was not correct .
neutral	ok but had hoped to receive £_00 discount as purposefully spent over_£_00 .
neutral	no option in checkout though .
neutral	someone is trying too hard to impress , the advice emails and / or texts are just over the top .
neutral	the most customers would like is confirmation of order , delivery date and confirmed delivery - and with out the flooral language .
neutral	it is not appropriate to advise how a good recepiant is feeling - particularly if a brerievment .
neutral	i don wish to know your order is received / the flowers are being arranged / we will be despatching on - / we have despatch by special courier / the courier may get stuck in traffic , the flowers are delivered - - and did you leave a card if left in the say - porch ?
neutral	the planting arragement , i am told by the recipient , is not effective quality .
neutral	and no cookies please .
neutral	i have ordered from beauty_bay before , but would think hard about ordering through them in the future .
neutral	reason being , i was short despatched on an item and the length of time it took to resolve the replacement of the missing item along with poor communication means that my confidence to order with them again has_gone .
neutral	good products and prices , just a shame about the service .
neutral	i placed an order on 00st_december and only when i received the confirmation_email was it clear that the order wouldn_'_t be processed until 0th_january despite my card being charged .
neutral	this should have been signalled upfront particularly as i was considering paying more for next_day delivery ( i '_m_glad i didn_'_t as that would have been money wasted ).
neutral	apart_from that the order was fine and i would buy from the website again .
neutral	my delivery arrived in reasonable time but i realised that i needed the bigger glass and seen they were on pre order so i tried to order it wouldn_'_t let_me so i rang and was told that it was only in the uk and as i was in n . ireland they couldn_'_t pre order for me even if i paid_extra postage there was no way round this silly rule so i won_'_t be using again
neutral	i live in the united_states and was referred to serenata by someone living in london .
neutral	i was ordering flowers and wine to be delivered before my friend , who also lives in the united_states , arrived at her rental in london .
neutral	ordering was a breeze , but obtaining help from serenata to contact the property_owner ( who did not live on site ) to have the delivery in the rental before my friend arrived to surprise her was met with negativity .
neutral	many emails back and forth with serenata explaining the situation , but serenata said they would not help by contacting the property_owner .
neutral	in the end , the flowers and wine were delivered and my friend said they were beautiful .
neutral	two different taxi firms - both 00_mins late for pick_up ...
neutral	i booked a 0 door corsa or similar what you get i what is available most times is a 0 door smaller car ?
neutral	however on insisting on a 0 door the staff magically produce a 0 four door polo .
neutral	not the same or similar to a corsa , but politly done .
neutral	i will book direct in future , the staff can only deal with what they have got , the rental_car website needs to be sorted !,,
neutral	the book has the potential to be lovely but the quality of the images was very poor for some reason .
neutral	i would be very cautious_about using again for that reason as only the small size images looked any good .
neutral	easy to use website and helpful staff over the phone .
neutral	competitive_pricing .
neutral	only_slight_problem was that , following booking on the internet , email_confirmation did not come through .
neutral	on telephoning ulookubook , it transpired_that the easyjet flight booked as part of our package had increased in price and we had to pay slightly more to continue the booking .
neutral	better links to easyjet would assist with this issue .
neutral	would use ulookubook again .
neutral	i like facebook as a social_network , not much good if you want a private conversation though !!

neutral	i have used panache by yardley eau_de parfum spray for many_years , i love the classic fragrance .
neutral	i was disappointed with the last batch i ordered , the scent had changed - has this been reformulated , can only smell the aldehydes ?
neutral	can taylor please stick to the original version by yardley ?
neutral	i am not sure i will be ordering this again as there is no guarantee that i will not be disappointed yet again ..
neutral	i was initially very pleased with the service .
neutral	i ordered my item paid for it and received confirmation emails to reflect this , i also received an_email to say the order had been dispatched .
neutral	on the same day i also received a phone_call to say the item was out of stock and therefore the money would be refunded to my account ,
neutral	if the item was out of stock then pozzani should not have accepted the order and it should have shown as out of stock on the web_site .
neutral	all in all a very disappointing service .
neutral	always impressed with the products and service from kite_packaging but always seems to be an issue with delivery .
neutral	i placed an order and got charged_£ 0 . 00 for next_day delivery only to get it the day after next !
neutral	not impressed nor was it clear that it would take longer if you placed the order after a certain time .
neutral	i ordered at lunchtime so really feel this was wrong , they did however offer me to cancel my order and get a full_refund , which i did not do as i needed the bits i ordered .
neutral	i was happy with the product , however i ordered it on friday , expecting with first_class it would be sent monday and recieved tues or at the latest wednesday .
neutral	however i didnt recive the product until friday after i had to email .
neutral	all about posting the items through the letter_box .
neutral	i would shop non_stop it '_s not fun when you order items that you know fit through the letter_box and they are put in a massive box and you then have to wit 0_days to collect
neutral	costume arrived on time and the quality was not good but what i have come to expect of fancy_dress stuff .
neutral	the mask had become squashed in transit and wont go back into shape fully , but overall it was as expected .
neutral	when the tickets arrived i was shocked to find i had paid double what the ticket stated
neutral	received my order the following_day which was excellent i am a little_worried that the bow_tie is a bit small it is his_birthday this sunday so he wil see it and i will know if the size is right if not can i return the tie and get a larger one .
neutral	good website , but sales people in their shops are really bad and rude .
neutral	very unhelpful .
neutral	i shopped with them for years , putting up with the awful staff until i found the same products with other people at half the price
neutral	limited website and sales teams are a total pain in the backside .
neutral	once enquired_about advertising and now they won_'_t leave me alone
neutral	used to love this site , but does anyone use it anymore ?!
neutral	shame they couldn_'_t keep_up with facebook .. wonder where it went wrong ?
neutral	!
neutral	they never have codes i want , when they do they ' re out of date
neutral	easy to use , i booked with them and then found the room £_00 cheaper elsewhere ... luckily the hotel refunded the difference .
neutral	it '_s a great concept .. but , a few_years_ago they offered really good discounts on rooms .
neutral	which is why they set_up and their whole marketing_campaign .
neutral	now they don_'_t really offer any discount .
neutral	i use it to search hotels in the area ...
neutral	i have found better discounts on other_sites ...
neutral	it also has limited hotels and b_& b '_s ... considering i tried to register my bandb and they said i was out of their limit , even_though the place down the road is on the site only 0 miles_away !
neutral	they should accept everyone and go back to offering discounted rooms .
neutral	they ' re ok , but i enquired_about ' anytime upgrade ' and was sent an_email_saying i was able to have it , but ring the phoneline to sort .... rang phone line ... they said i wasn_'_t entitled ... someone , somewhere isn_'_t very familiar with their products and services !
neutral	very disappointing
neutral	good company and customer service ... but don_'_t always add on your voucher from previous 00_% shop guarantee
neutral	i have to say the instructions that came with my purchase were very confusing .
neutral	alot of it didn_'_t seem to relate to the item .
neutral	there were also parts_missing albeit small but had to pruchase these from a d . i . y .
neutral	store , for quickness on installing the item .
neutral	came quickly but box badly_damaged .
neutral	luckily items were ok .
neutral	i was so excited to receive my canvas as it was of my son at just a few hours old , but was left_feeling a little disappointed .
neutral	the canvas itself was sturdy and great quality however the picture looks very dark .
neutral	i has left the option on for jessops to do there ' in house ' touch up and was surprised they had not lightened it .
neutral	i ordered two_bunches of flowers to be delivered on the 00th_may .
neutral	one arrived on the 00th_may , one hasn_'_t yet arrived .
neutral	the one that was delivered to tournay road did not look like it did in the photo !
neutral	the communication was fantastic and i was notified of my hour delivery slot in good time ( i paid for delivery before 00am ) but i was disappointed that a number of the flowers were already dead or dying on delivery .
neutral	the majority were lovely but for the price i paid , i would expect all of the flowers to at_least be alive !
neutral	overall was good but made me go for full - empty fuel_policy which i dont like .
neutral	said that when renting in usa and you get dollar as the rental company they make you go with fuel - empty policy which always you pay more than fueling yourself so please be noticed about it .
neutral	i dont like when the company force a policy on me .
neutral	i preffer to choose !!
neutral	!
neutral	i could not book the flowers on a bank_holiday monday for my parents wedding_anniversary so booked for them to be delivered on the saturday same day delivery , i had a phone_call to say that all florists in area either closed or run_out of flowers so could not make delivery that day , the assistant was very apologetic and we arranged to have them delivered on the tuesday .
neutral	i was out and about when i received the call from the florists so was a little difficult to have a long conversation but no refund was given for same day delivery and also the delivery on the tuesday was very late after 0pm , which i would have thought the florist would have tried to make it one of the first due to being so long after the saturday , i also paid_extra for a medium bouquet and it was not very big , my husband got me flowers for my birthday locally at £_00 and it was much larger , i was at my parents when the bouquet arrived so would have been cheaper for me to buy them locally and take them myself .
neutral	straight_forward and cheaper_than quick fit !
neutral	the chap that came was a bit gruff but other than that .........
neutral	booked the premier_inn for 00 of my friends to stay overnight .
neutral	booking was a nightmare , wanted the meal deal but could not book that at the same time as the rooms .
neutral	the hotel number did not work so had to call another department who messed_up my booking and i had to call back a further 0 times to sort it out .
neutral	when finally i was able to sort_out the meal deal the hotel was supposed to email me with a menu , another 0 calls and an_email later and i finally received it .
neutral	several emails back and forth ensued , mainly_because the hotel expected me to give them information they never asked me for .
neutral	i am not a hotel agent so i only gave the information they wanted when they asked .
neutral	to pay for everything it had to be done via a fax on headed_paper .
neutral	who uses a fax_machine nowadays ?
neutral	but it could only be paid that way and not over the phone or anything which i thought was so wrong .
neutral	finally , because we took a coach there , no one told us there was no where for the coach to park , there is a car_park but has limited headroom , so no coaches could enter .
neutral	the hotel staff did manage to allow us to park the coach nearby though .
neutral	finally one of my couples had a shower that did not work so reception said they would refund myself the cost of the room and email me about it .
neutral	so far i have not heard or received anything .
neutral	after all the aggravation associated with this particular premier_inn in richmond , all my friends absolutely loved the place .
neutral	the rooms were spotless , food excellent and the staff catered well for the amount of people all entering the restaurant at the same time .
neutral	the price of the meal deal and what was involved is definitely worth considering if staying there and will use that facility again .
neutral	although it is situated on a main_road , the traffic could hardly be heard so a good nights_sleep was definitely not disturbed .
neutral	0 / 00 for booking it but 00 / 00 for the stay and 00 / 00 for the price .
neutral	better packaging but not as good ad nespresso for flavour
neutral	one of my parcels arrived with no bubble_wrap , the boxes of stronghold / frontline were crushed inside , the second order can fully wrapped but after a telephone_conversation with them they said i could have more advantix / stronghold [ which i was told was left on my perscription ],, then viovet telephoned to say ther was a mistake and i couldnt have anymore perscription order , i had a lengthy conversation with them , viovet need to shake themselves up or they might loose customers .
neutral	wrong order received .
neutral	luckily my husband was on holiday to be able to return it .
neutral	as we both work full time it '_s a bit of a hassle to return anything during a normal working week .
neutral	i got a prompt response by email and the right order arrived 0_days_later .
neutral	i had a parcel delivered to greece it went from birmingham then gatwick and went to austria and budapest then athens then kavala , thought it went the long way around_europe
neutral	the actual product is good ... i '_ve been using it to help treat an achilles problem and it '_s amazing stuff , but i needed it urgently in preparation for a race so decided to pay for the named delivery day .
neutral	the order was placed in the thursday_night for delivery the following_tuesday .
neutral	unfortunately on the day it was due to be delivered , the courier contacted me and said they had not received it for delivery .
neutral	i contacted physioroom , and received an_email back advising me it would not be delivered until the next_day ... no apology was offered which i found to be quite rude .
neutral	product : agv visor city 0 for helmet bali ii tinted anti_- scratch ref :( kv0h0n0 - 000
neutral	review : slow shipping by dhl and took almost 0_weeks plus to ship to singapore , but overall item is accurate no need for any returns
neutral	i do think this is a great service but it is frustrating when so many books are not accepted .
neutral	this can then be a long_drawn_out process for little reward .
neutral	i gave up scanning my books in the end as they kept being rejected .
neutral	i still have a loft full of books but feel that they would be better on a car boot to save me time .
neutral	the service is really good after you have found books that will be accepted but 00p a book is a very low price .
neutral	the receptionist where my sister works received a box and emailed my sister to say she had a parcel .
neutral	when i didn_'_t hear that my sister had received the flowers , i phoned the receptionist and she said she was not aware the box contained flowers .
neutral	so my sister hadn_'_t realised it was urgent to collect the box and give the flowers a drink . the box obviously needs to make it obvious there are flowers inside !
neutral	i saw the flowers and they were lovely .
neutral	hi there ,
neutral	i do enjoy_browsing your site but feel there are not enough departures leaving from glasgow .
neutral	cheers
neutral	alice
neutral	i spent a long time looking for flowers for my sister '_s birthday , on the internet the flowers that i ordered looked blue .
neutral	my sister tells_me that they were bright purple and looked as though they hade been dyed purple as well .
neutral	she obviously did not like them at all .
neutral	the delivery of the flowers went_smoothly and i do not fault the organisation , but the flowers were not at all what i had hoped for .
neutral	i will not be using serenata again .
neutral	i like that you can give an honest review and it helps with choosing locations and hotels etc .
neutral	however with some places that have bad_reviews you can see that the manager of the establishment has clearly created fake trip advisors account in order to give themselves a better rating .
neutral	you can clearly see this as the reviews are very similar , they come after a long line of bad ones and that said profile has only ever written that one review .
neutral	this should be stopped .
neutral	was misled with size of bio_oil , never seen such a small bottle ! certainly was not a good / discount as stated , will buy in shop next time
neutral	right i have returned your slippers , was so excited when they arrived wonderfully made but so tight , i have policemans heel which is very painful to walk on but i think i need to try on cant_afford to keep sending them back , took them to washer woman on the 00thi have my receipt so can you please put my money back into my account so i can buy another pr of fitflops lovely
neutral	all nearly went_swimmingly , the site is easy to use and i was very happy with the final_result .
neutral	two things spoiled it : firstly , having chosen an agent where a " printer not necessary ", since i was asking for a parcel to be delivered to me , i was asked to print a label and stick it on the parcel !
neutral	( i ask you ): and , secondly , the parcel arrived a day earlier_than stated .
neutral	( a good job my wife was at home , though only by_chance ).
neutral	all ok except 0 + weeks delivery .
neutral	this is far too long .
neutral	perhaps will try again ' cos jumper great for price !
neutral	good came quickly but one box only sealed with one strip of sellotape - it was open - don_'_t know how many doggie biscs are still in the delivery van !
neutral	!
neutral	good service , quick and easy , however found it difficult to understand reasons for extra_charges
neutral	ordered online in am , lots of beautiful and well priced flowers to choose from , but phoned in pm to say delivery could not be met .
neutral	lady helpful on phone when explaining delivery date could not be met , offered other dates but earliest available three_days_later which was too late !
neutral	little_concerned i couldn_'_t get a sample made up but liked the functionality of the website and the ability to adjust change most things on the card .
neutral	really fast printing and delivery but the items arrived damaged and the printing wasn_'_t perfect as you could see coloured marks on quite a few of the cards which we did not use .
neutral	quite a few of the envelopes were either crushed or marked with black marks which wasn_'_t ideal so we had to buy more and buy additional cards to replace the damaged cards .
neutral	furniture is as good as it looks in the showroom and the service at the store was really good .
neutral	shame same cant be said about the delivery which was not quite what i expected .
neutral	the boxes were dumped on me with no offer of unpacking or waiting for me to check the contents .
neutral	dirty footprints were left all over my floor and one of the delivery men had a paddy because he dropped his glasses .
neutral	outrageous .
neutral	we did have an issue with beanbagbazaar , but i have to say after bringing up the problem here on trustpilot , it was resolved quickly .
neutral	a big thanks to [_name ].
neutral	also , the bean_bag is excellent .
neutral	i bought the photo_world album with an amazon_voucher offer .
neutral	it looked ideal to record a trip with my 00 year_old father .
neutral	we had a lot of photos .
neutral	with the help of my 00_yr_old_son i eventually did it .
neutral	the programme " crashed " at_least 0 times and we had to start again .
neutral	the tops were cut_off several pictures .
neutral	it wasn_'_t at all straightforward to use .
neutral	the final_result arrived promptly and looks pretty good ( except for the chopped of heads in some pictures ).
neutral	we probably tried to fit too many on a page . you would need to have a lot of time and patience .
neutral	i placed my order with express delivery as i rehomed a cat with special_dietary_needs , however the goods were not delivered at the specified time .
neutral	i contacted the courier company and they assured me i would have priority but they did not turn_up again as promised .
neutral	so i had to go directly to my vet and plead for some food to tide me over until my order arrived .
neutral	i spoke to animed and they were very apologetic ( obviously this was out of their control ) and they explained that they never usually have problems .
neutral	but as this was my first experience using this company , i '_m in two_minds as to whether i will be using them again
neutral	i have bought 0 beer kits , very pleased with the price , but order took a little_longer_than_expected , i didn_'_t get an e . mail to tell me the order had been dispatched , and when it arrived ... even_though it was well_packaged , sadly one of the cans was dented , i will try again though !
neutral	have used this company before , but this is the first time i have actually seen the flowers , prior to taking them to the recipient .
neutral	some of the flowers had ' wilted ', which spoiled the effect of the whole display .
neutral	maybe ' monday flowers ' were not as fresh as they could have been .
neutral	i would prefer to pay a little_bit more to improve the quality of all the flowers , and not just ' some of them '.
neutral	i liked the variety of meals and found them very filling .
neutral	i enjoyed eating them but found some of the meals to be quite spicey which upset my stomach a little and so if i was to order again i would have to choose the meals very carefully .
neutral	i have previously ordered from iflorist on several_occasions with no_problems .
neutral	however , i placed an order for a christmas_hamper for my son in scotland ( i live in australia ).
neutral	this was prompted by receipt of an_email from iflorist with pre_- christmas deals .
neutral	i searched the website for quite a while as my first choice was ' out of stock ' and so were several others .
neutral	i finally chose one which was apparently ' in stock ', paid for it only to receive an_email a couple of days_later apologising that my choice was ' out of stock ' and would i care to change my delivery date & choose a different item .
neutral	in compensation i was promise a discount on a future purchase .
neutral	a different item was suggested , but according to the website , it was also ' out of stock '.
neutral	i sent 0 emails , asking how to go about changing my order and trying to find out if the suggested alternative was indeed possible .
neutral	i tried to use the help on the website twice & received error messages .
neutral	now all of this was happening in the lead up to & immediately following christmas .
neutral	so i understand that not only are things hectic around that period but also the iflorist may have been closed for part of that time .
neutral	i eventually received another email suggesting the same alternative and i accepted , although it was not what i would have chosen to send to my son , but by then i was rather over the experience .
neutral	my son '_s wedding_anniversary is 0th_january , so he took the hamper as an anniversary_gift .
neutral	i believe it was delivered on 0th .
neutral	i was very disappointed with the delivery it took 0_days to arrive
neutral	you emailed me on a saturday at 0am telling_me i had 00_hours to collect from the locker .
neutral	i was away and rang on monday to say i couldnt collect until wednesday and you told me no problem the package would be left there .
neutral	i went on wednesday but couldnt access the locker so i rang to be told it had been removed .
neutral	however you organised delivery to my home later that day so overall good service , but it seems daft to give people so little time to collect especially when time starts running over a weekend .
neutral	you should also provide a map of where the lockers are - the one at victoria is difficult to find from the instructions given by phone .
neutral	although i received this item quickly and it is very decorative , when i opened it some of the glass tea light holders were broken .
neutral	luckilly they sent some spares so i have a full set but decided to call customer_services to ask them to send me some more spares as i now dont have any spares .
neutral	the man i spoke to said there was no one there that could help me as it was a sunday so he told me to call back 0am on monday .
neutral	that was fine so i did .
neutral	i called back first thing monday and again i was told there was no one that could help me and to call back the following_day .
neutral	i then rung back the following_day only to be told again that there was no one that could help me !!
neutral	i have given up trying to contact them so i pray to god that none of them break now lol
neutral	this metal tree looks_stunning all lit_up at night but i have been let_down by festive light '_s customer service .
neutral	the help i received over the phone when there was a problem with the billing_address vs . the delivery address was fantastic .
neutral	the delivery was quick and i was kept_informed at every_stage global gps .
neutral	i was however a disappointed with the condition of the product , the box was significantly damaged and because there was no outer_packaging the main hoover was quite exposed .
neutral	we had a bad_experience at the holiday desitnation and it took lots of correspondence to feel as if we had been taken notice of
neutral	i love the picture but i am not happy with the item .
neutral	the phone back is to small on one side a doesn_'_t fit the front of the phone was really hard to put on and had to take it off twice to get it straight because of this the front stretched and i had to end up cutting one side to get it to fit .
neutral	i love lisa parkers work and she recommend you on her page that '_s how i found your site .
neutral	but im_sorry to say i am not very happy .
neutral	good for my emails but can be abit slow sometimes
neutral	the follow_up with my order did work after a phone_call was made , thank_goodness .
neutral	uum !?
neutral	trouble is the quantity doesn_'_t match the quality .
neutral	might as well sell from a vending machine .
neutral	don_'_t really need the staff .
neutral	they do nothing for the brand .
neutral	it , sells itself !
neutral	!
neutral	i , had no problem ordering my item which was a bookcase unit , and delivery date scheduled at the time of ordering , which was in 0_weeks time but 0_days before delivery date i got phone_call to say it was not available and to wait 0_days for an update , so not a happy_bunny at this as this item was just what i am looking for , so fingers_crossed it will arrive soon .
neutral	i used this florist because they had many choices , including the one i needed .
neutral	i ordered the flowers & received , no problem .
neutral	the problem was with the courier .
neutral	the courier was advised by the funeral home where to take the flowers , as they had arrived too late .
neutral	the courier chose not to facilitate , as a result i was put through a lot of aggrevation .
neutral	the funeral home informed my family that this wasn_'_t the first time they had encountered difficulty with this company .
neutral	i was told that based on the couriers report i was not eligible for a refund .
neutral	after several days of correspondence the florist sorted_out the issue and showed a more compassionate side .
neutral	the flowers were delivered and now my english family is happy .
neutral	i leased a car and after the salesman took my order and deposit it would appear he lost the use of his fingers and thumbs to communicate with me ie unanswered replies to my emails .
neutral	i '_ve worked in a car dealership before and have seen salesmen act in this manor but never_experienced it first hand which was disappointing .
neutral	other than his lack of replies i '_m pleased with the car and leasing plan .
neutral	the flowers look lovely but apparently ( i was not with the recipient at the time ) there is a lot of work required to get them out of the packaging and into a vase which_resulted_in the my mother '_s hands being covered in blue dye !
neutral	i was really dissapointed that you didnt send the flowers i ordered on the second
neutral	deliverythat i ordered and you didnt even get back to me .
neutral	my sister said the flowers were lovely but i didnt want her to have to lots the same .
neutral	the plants i ordered were well_packed and have grown on well .
neutral	however , the time from ordering to receiving was protracted far beyond what i expected , and they arrived the day before we left for a holiday .
neutral	i am aware that weather_conditions can adversely affect the time when the plants will be ready .
neutral	it makes ordering plants a risky business .
neutral	items arrived as stated and delivery good but ... free gift a joke !!!!!
neutral	not even travel size .... miniature ....
neutral	disappointed
neutral	the product itself is a christmas gift for my daughter , i was surprised that there are not extensions to the return period in view of this .
neutral	still only have 00 days to return , so i hope she likes it more than i do .
neutral	my name is not caroline henry and i am confused how you can send to the correct email address but use an incorrect name .
neutral	quick delivery and good communication_regarding when items would be delivered but after a phone & text_message to appologise because it now wouldn_'_t be delivered till the next_day (& we subsequently left the house ), the items were delivered on the original day of delivery ?
neutral	!
neutral	went to shop , chosen furniture not in stock .
neutral	told to order online .
neutral	daughter replied why did nt they do it for you .
neutral	but all in all was satisfied with purchase but would have struggled if there had been a problem .
neutral	no i phone to photograph fault .
neutral	my washing_machine purchase was great value compared to other high profile competitors so i was very pleased .
neutral	i chose a delivery date during the online purchase , however , there was no time frame for the delivery .
neutral	i awaited more detail regarding the time but after 0_days had nothing .
neutral	i then emailed on 0 consecutive day for clarity regarding delivery time , even whether am or pm , but i received no reply to 0 separate emails .
neutral	consequently , we we out for short time walking our dog and missed the delivery ( 00 . 00 am ).
neutral	it took_ages to contact the delivery people and when we finally got through we were told to call back after 0 as there was no way of contacting the driver to rearrange delivery .
neutral	i am now fuming ( i have been without a washing_machine for 0_weeks ) and waiting to re - book the delivery .
neutral	the flowers themselves were a present for my mums_birthday , she loved them and the bright_colours , however as i was the one who saw them online i was a little disappointed with the size , very small for the price but like i say mum_loved them and didn_'_t know the difference !
neutral	fast efficient service but unfortunately wrong shirt sent it didn_'_t even match the shirt on the delivery note .
neutral	await delivery of the correct one .
neutral	good service and communication but double the price of the actual ticket of the event so i felt as though i '_d been ripped_off when the tickets arrived .
neutral	i spent £_000 . 00 on two tickets which in fact cost £_00 . 00 each !
neutral	not sure how they justify that .
neutral	for that reason i won_'_t be using viagogo again
neutral	told to collect on thurs after 00pm .
neutral	drove to store to find delivery had not been sent and store was unable to track order .
neutral	storage is a problem because you have to keep capsules in their box or you dont_know what you are drinking , the nesspresso capsules are colour_coded so you can have a few of each in a large dish so is handy to pick and mix
neutral	having paid the extra for next dy delivery , my order still turned_up 0_days_later (_excluding the weekend ) as parcelforce managed to put my package onto to a delivery van that was going 00 miles_away !!
neutral	!
neutral	products were as ordered and a great price , but delivery incompetence overshadows this .
neutral	the only_flaw i would find is i believe the fone was worth a little mre money .
neutral	i placed an order at the beginning of august .
neutral	00 august ( 0_weeks_later ) and still nothing had been received .
neutral	no responses to emails and with one exception calls not returned .
neutral	was very frustrating and originally awarded 0_star in my review however i amended this to three stars as my refund was processed within a couple of hours of me requesting it .
neutral	ordered wheels & tyres .
neutral	we were advised that they would be delivered the next_day , thought wow great !!
neutral	unfortunately the wrong_postcode was put on them , by whom we were never sure , but they were sent to scotland ( we live in kent ).
neutral	they were finally delivered after 0_days .
neutral	in fairness the company was very apologetic but it had been , none the less , annoying , as my mother had stayed in all day on the original delivery date waiting for them .
neutral	but all '_s well that ends well and thank_you .
neutral	the only_thing i would say , is that i hadn_'_t used the contact_lens_solution i ordered before and when it arrived none of the information was in english - made life a little complicated to check i was using it correctly .
neutral	not as good as nespresso for taste and quality
neutral	i was impressed with the price for the rental but i was disappointed with how long it took the third_party company to reply to changes you needed to make to your rental_agreement .
neutral	i tried to change my hire from a sat pick_up to a fri pick_up , emailed in my changes on the wed and found out 0 hours before i was due to pick_up my hire_car , as i was getting off the plane i might_add , that they couldn_'_t change my hire .
neutral	when i tried to change my hire to a sun pick_up instead to make my travel_plans work better due to the late notice that they couldn_'_t change my hire to the fri , i couldn_'_t get_hold of any one from the uk side of the company to make the necessary changes .
neutral	despite replying straight to the email i had just received a few_minutes earlier .
neutral	i got hold of the hire company at the airport later that night who said they could happily make the changes i needed but they required a new voucher from travel jigsaw who had now closed in the uk and due to there opening_hours being late on a sat and in compatible with the time zone i was in i was forced to revert_back to my original travel_plans and miss out on part of my itinerary to keep the original hire .
neutral	if a company is going to offer the ability to " easily and quickly " amend your hire this is exactly_what it should be .
neutral	as it stands i sent 0 emails , an electronic version of their change form about my hire and half a dozen phone_calls and i am still_waiting for any kind of response from the company about my hire .
neutral	i will happily rent with thrifty again but i will not be going through travel jigsaw to get my hire ever again .
neutral	just this minute received a phone_call to say thank_you for her 00th_birthday card .... when asked about a flower delivery she knew nothing .
neutral	she had had 0 from other family_members but nothing from us .
neutral	we can only_assume that her delivery with no card maybe from us ????
neutral	as this special aunt does not live close to us and does not have a telephone - she has to walk to a phone box .... really not in the 00st_century and does not help matters !
neutral	we have no idea if this is our delivery or not so hence no positive feed_back at he moment :( we will have to drive over at the weekend if possible !
neutral	ps - i really do not like your wording for star_ratings - ' rude_conduct ' - ' malicious ' - ' friction ' poor or too strong a words .... none of the above !
neutral	the person_who received these roses , said they were delightful .
neutral	the school itself was good .
neutral	staff was well prepared .
neutral	managing team also organized after - class activities and some parties .
neutral	i recognize this schools as a great place to become a professional bartender .
neutral	however personally i found some drawbacks : firstly , it '_s way too expensive given the fact that the school is set_up in phuket , thailand ; secondly , learning tools such as flairing bottle and starting bartender '_s kit was ridiculously_expensive ( it '_s possible to get all the stuff online more than twice cheaper !!!
neutral	); thirdly , student were not allowed to practice flairing with school equipment and were forced to get flairing bottles from school .
neutral	the stay hot plates are a good idea .
neutral	you put hot_water in the base of the plates and the food stays warm .
neutral	great for people who eat slowly .
neutral	i was disappointed by the fact that the rubber plug that keeps the water in the base was so easily pulled_out .
neutral	i would have expected a screw in type of plug that was tricky
neutral	to open .
neutral	i bought these plates for our dementia unit and have concerns over the safety of the product .
neutral	this needs to be reviewed please to make them safe to use .
neutral	our number_plate recog didn_'_t work so a guy just let us in !
neutral	then we bounced over craters for 00_mins trying to find a space , when we got one we waited 00_mins for the bus .
neutral	but it was a better parking experience than last time when manchester met police brought our car back to us , at_least it was safe and we knew where it was
neutral	a lot of the cds i sent were brand_new but ziffit said they failed a qc check , were ' refurbished ' then passed , there was never anything wrong with any of the cds .
neutral	whole_process was quick though .
neutral	we had moved_house and it took 0 - 0 e_-_mails and 0 - 0 phone_calls to change the delivery address .
neutral	we received 0 e_-_mails from made saying that someone from the customer service team would contact us , and no - one did .
neutral	we had to call made .
neutral	parcel_force were due to deliver on wednesday , then a note from them said they would deliver the following_day , but when i called at 0pm to find out whether they were going to deliver that day , i was informed that in fact the item had gone back to their depot , so we had to collect it from there .
neutral	the bench is nice but the feet do not angle out as on the pictures .
neutral	i ordered a yamaha keyboard for my daughters_birthday .
neutral	i gave plenty of time i was getting worried as the order hadn_'_t arrived , i emailed them they told me they would have the item on the 0st of may .
neutral	then i emailed again as my daughters_birthday was the 00th_may .
neutral	then then told me a 0 - 0 week wait i had no choice but to upgrade and pay the extra .
neutral	the delivery was then very fast , and the keyboard is excellent .
neutral	okokokokokso far
neutral	order received promptly and was left in secure_place as requested when placed order .
neutral	would definitely use this website again .
neutral	very expensive for the amount of flowers supplied .
neutral	glasses_direct are fast and snappy with ease of use for customer .
neutral	however this speed means often niggly problems with being sent wrong frames or prescription .
neutral	overall i would recommend .
neutral	love how you can ask it a question and it answers you
neutral	great site to get anything you want
neutral	when i did a bad_review on trustpilot it did get a reaction from mighty_deals but only for them to lie to me or totally ignore me .
neutral	it would be nice if i could get a positive response .
neutral	i have many pairs of ecco_shoes .
neutral	very pleased with them .
neutral	ordered a pair of boots online .
neutral	00 days_later they still hadn_'_t arrived .
neutral	emailed ecco .
neutral	got an_automated_reply .
neutral	the next_day rang ecco spoke to a girl who said she would look into it .
neutral	nothing .
neutral	a day later rang again spoke to a man who eventually tracked the boots down .
neutral	( parcel_force tracking service wasn_'_t working ).
neutral	parcel_force had left no note in our door but left the boots at the local post_office .
neutral	parcel_force did not notify_me at any time so i hope ecco in future use another carrier .
neutral	always beautiful flowers but often failed delivery on the day selected .
neutral	they do not phone you to say there is a delay , they just wait for you to realise flowers not arrived with recipient and call them !
neutral	good customer service on the phone .
neutral	ordered a mans stussy tee_shirt for a present , but found marks on the transferred bit on front so am sending back .
neutral	i have had to order another one .
neutral	will know more as i use this firm .
neutral	i took delivery of my tree seat in a very damaged box .
neutral	the driver collected some of the bits that had escaped and said he would record this .
neutral	i reported the same to internet_gardener with no response .
neutral	i chased to be told they were looking into it .
neutral	a week_later still no response .
neutral	now this might be deemed acceptable if i had asked for a full replacement , but i asked for 0 screw bolts only .
neutral	yes the seat was damaged but as i had paid less_than the rrp and the damage limited to a few bumps and scrapes i complained about the bolts only !
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	the de - wormer on the website page stated that the product was 000_% effective for all worms usually found to effect cats , which is whay i ordered it .
neutral	when it arrived , the packet showed that it was 000_% effective against tapeworms , and not as shown previously .
neutral	i needed to administer it ( as one of my cats , has tapeworms ) so i used it .
neutral	needless to say , though , i was a little dissapointed .
neutral	also i qualified for free - postage , but didn_'_t want to risk waiting for the time , when it may have arrived , so i paid for postage and made an order after 00 am .
neutral	in_spite of this , the parcel arrived the very next_day , which was good , but if i had known i wouldn_'_t have paid and waited another day / two .
neutral	i had a great booking experience with travel_republic and will probably use the company again .
neutral	my only_gripe was that i missed my flight ( my own fault ) so also missed the transfer at the other end to the hotel .
neutral	i rang travel_republic to ask for assistance with another transfer and was told to ring the company directly .
neutral	when i did this i was told that i should speak to my travel_agent :-( not very helpful to be sent round in circles when you are clearly upset about having to rearrange travel .
neutral	no_problems with products .
neutral	however , somehow the company can go to the post_office to deliver goods to mainland_uk , but not to northern_ireland ?!?
neutral	please get out of the dark ages !
neutral	!
neutral	we ordered this cabinet and the order process and delivery went_smoothly .
neutral	we unpacked this item carefully and assembly was straight_forward with helpful numbering of pieces and clear_instructions .
neutral	unfortunately the fixings to the draws and the inside space in the cabinet were too far apart .
neutral	the runners on the draws didn_'_t slide into their corresponding slots .
neutral	rather_than take the whole cabinet apart and repackage it we went round the problem and created cardboard spacers and now the draws run_smoothly as they are pulled .
neutral	i think if closer attention had been made to the design of the draw runners and the quality and material of the fixings then this product and the service provided by made , com would be excellent .
neutral	nice p0p program .
neutral	there are better ones though , as not many people are using blubster .
neutral	i ordered a complete bathroom from the company , and it did not all arrive on the designated day .
neutral	i complained and it appeared to be an_error on the part of the delivery company , so the rest of the order arrived on the next_day .
neutral	this meant my builders could not do what they needed and work was delayed .
neutral	when they fitted the shower_screen , it was chipped , but because they actually fitted it , and there had been a delay , the company would not replace the damaged screen .
neutral	i had to buy a new one .
neutral	i am now going on holiday so cant open the new screen at present , if it is damaged i presume we will have the same problem again .
neutral	sad that a company that impressed initially let_me down on the shower_screen - it would have been a ) fair , and b ) a gesture of good will , to replace it .
neutral	why would i lie about the situation ?
neutral	i bought my wormers with the expectation , based on reading_reviews that my
neutral	purchase would be delivered the next_day .
neutral	this was on a thursday , as they did not
neutral	arrive until monday i was a bit disappointed .
neutral	we had a new horse who was sick , so there was some urgency , i am not just being a ' one ' about a routine worming .
neutral	the price was good so i will deal with this company again , but will allow more time for delivery .
neutral	usually very fast and efficient but on one occasion there was an order mix_up and it took weeks to resolve .
neutral	none of the staff ever followed up when they said they would - very disappointing as it took 0_weeks to resolve and as many phone_calls .
neutral	i would not use this company again as when i had time to visit a party shop locally i found same product at same price .
neutral	as i paid for fast delivery - £ 0 . 00 - i ended_up paying far more than had i bought directly from the party shop .
neutral	also quality of garden torches is very poor - i would prefer to pay more in b_& q for better quality ( would have done but they had sold out !)
neutral	as the distance to the delivery address was not possible for me to see what i had ordered i asked my friend to send a photo . it seemed that there were more greenery than flowers . the delivery however was on the correct day .
neutral	in general service is prompt , and they provide good value for money .
neutral	however , i was unfortunate before xmas in that they sent me an item of the wrong_size ( i . e .
neutral	not the size i had requested ), and i had a bit of a mare getting it replaced .
neutral	they didn_'_t respond to any of my emails , and it took several_attempts to get to speak to someone_who would do anything .
neutral	in the end i had to have a refund .
neutral	i was a bit disappointed .
neutral	flowers lovely .
neutral	flowers left in conservatory my mother only found them on her way out of the house .
neutral	i found that very disappointing and will not use this service again .
neutral	i wanted my mother to feel special on her_birthday and have hand delivered flowers not have then just left in her conservatory .
neutral	ordered a light online on sunday_evening and paid up front so i could chose a collection day of the following_tuesday .
neutral	my father - in - law drove the 00 miles dutifully to make the collection on my specified date to be met with some rather unhelpful staff .
neutral	it took him 00_minutes and a bit of foot stomping before he came away with my order .
neutral	tnt let you down everytime .
neutral	generally drivers never call although you ask for phone numbers .
neutral	also they never put cards through doors to say where packages are .
neutral	easy to use on line , but found flowers to be small considering i sepnt £_00
neutral	service was very good , i was sent a text_message when flowers were being dispatched that morning and when they were delivered .
neutral	when i eventually saw them the evening following delivery they did not match what was on the website , felt so embarressed , they were a present and looked so poor , carnations in the bouquet looked awful .
neutral	poor quality , will not use again ,
neutral	i find purchasing with littlewoods as a bit hit and miss .
neutral	most of the clothing i have ever purchased has had to be sent back for being poor quality .
neutral	most of the flat packed furniture ihave ever purchased has had to be sent back and replacement ordered because vital parts are missing & my one of my few electrical purchases had to be sent back and reordered because it didnt work !
neutral	sorting these problems out however are pretty straight_forward with the free_returns , usually next working day .
neutral	delivery time is always great , the driver in my area however is not quite so great ..
neutral	very rude , but then not littlewoods problem .
neutral	calling customer_services and getting through to the right department and talking to someone_who_knows what they are doing is a complete_nightmare , wouldnt mind so much if the call was a free phone number .
neutral	i think the pricing is usually pretty reasonable given the pay weekly option and i do take_advantage of the option as to make it easier to buy essential things throughout the month .
neutral	in all im fairly happy with littlewoods at the moment having built up a decent credit with them i shall keep it for those emergancy moments or just for when things need updating .
neutral	a loyal_customer at present .
neutral	flowers looked lovely ( photo sent from recipient ) but somehow they read the address as 00 not 000 .
neutral	phoned to check and all was well .
neutral	fabulous communication_regarding order , dispatch and delivery - love it !
neutral	concerned that text to say " delivered and left_securely at front of property " was not a secure_place at all and the recipients were at home - how hard did you try to personally deliver ?
neutral	the second delivery to a neighbouring property saw you leave the package " securely at the back of the property " .... on a bin open to all ?!
neutral	the recipient is disabled and would never have known had her neighbour not told her as no - one left a card through the letter_box regarding the delivery and where to find it .
neutral	concerning .
neutral	the herbal love potion i ordered came on time , but it didn_'_t do what is said on the label , so i was disappointed .
neutral	have ordered several_times before and kept returning as i found the service so good .
neutral	bit disappointed this time round .
neutral	i ordered three rugs online last_week and the next_day got an_email_saying they were dispatched .
neutral	the following_day got an_email from marc saying one of the rugs was no_longer available as it was sold out and did i still want the rest of the order and a refund and could i please let them know my decision .
neutral	i replied immediately and said to go_ahead with the order and i picked a replacement rug to the same value .
neutral	i then never_heard a thing so i phoned on 00 / 00 / 00 and was told marc was on holiday that day and furthermore they rarely checked emails , which surprised me as it was marc that emailed me looking for a reply .
neutral	i was told they would try and access marc '_s email and try and get the order to me by 00 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	disappointed that i was able to order and pay for a rug that was out of stock and also disappointed at the lack of communication thereafter which has caused a delay in delivery
neutral	booking was easy and price competative , departure collection was efficent , however it took 00_mins from the call for our car to be returned to us , we had been delayed 0 hours so this could have been the reason but hey the guy said 00_mins when i rang from baggage collection ... 00_mins after a night spent in an airport lounge was no fun .
neutral	i would have prefered him to say that it will be 00_mins at_least we could have gone for a coffee as_opposed to waiting in the cold .
neutral	the chemist itself is great but delivery has slipped when we first used to order we would get an_email to say our order had been despatched and it would be with us the very next_day .
neutral	now however it takes almost a week after email ;-(
neutral	quick reasonably_priced well informed of progress just flowers were not as pictures and the head of one of the spray flowers was broken off near the head and the flowers water had leaked as they were laid flat in the box and so the greetings_card was wet .
neutral	having checked the stock of several items directly prior to placing my order i had to telephone shoetiques office upon_receipt of part delivery to be advised an item was not actually out of stock .
neutral	they expected further stock but weren_'_t able to advise an exact date .
neutral	a week_later and unfortunately still no delivery .
neutral	this was my first purchase from shoetique so i am a little disappointed
neutral	on arriving and parking the car at the long_stay car_park the signs as to where you had parked were not easily seen .
neutral	bus_stop had no number on it so on return_journey , having counted stops till leaving car_park , i guessed at it being number 0 stop and this was fortunately correct .
neutral	then i had to remember my route back to my car - it took 0 attempts - luckily it was good weather .
neutral	i have not had this trouble on previous visits using this car_park .
neutral	i ordered a pair of shoes and a leather i - pad cover from ecco .
neutral	these arrived promptly and were carefully_packaged , together with a ' free ' gift .
neutral	however , what i hadn_'_t realised is that all unwanted_items have to be returned to denmark (!)
neutral	at the cost of the customer .
neutral	needless to say i shall not be making any further on - line purchases .
neutral	the only problem i had but quite a big one was the payment option .
neutral	it said i could pay with a visa_debit_card which i tried to do but it was refused and not through lack of funds .
neutral	paid on credit_card but then found my debit_card had been frozen as the payment was processed in sweden , had to sort this with my bank which was inconvenient .
neutral	never had a single email either at order or when checking status .
neutral	never_heard_anything but goods arrived after 0_days as_described .
neutral	brought several items from agrento online .
neutral	after purchase i was informed 0 out of the 0 were out of stock and therefore dispatched half an order .
neutral	arrived in great packaging , with flatten boxes so could be presented as gifts if required .
neutral	order a thomas_sabo bracelet with a length of 00 . 0cm , when it arrived it wouldn_'_t fit around my wrist .
neutral	on measuring i discovered the bracelet was actually only 00cm long .
neutral	emailed agrento and was told that they do not stock this bracelet in a 00cm , that the sizes came up small and that they were difficult to measure .
neutral	returned item for exchange for bigger_size , with argento still refusing to accept that this bracelet was a different length than that listed on website - i provided a picture of the bracelet alongside a ruler but they still weren_'_t convinced .
neutral	returned bracelet via_royal_mail 0st_class recorded mail , item received yesterday , telephone today to check progress .
neutral	informed that package hasn_'_t been opened yet and the lady was currently working her way through the returns as there was a lot and it should be opened by tomorrow morning - 0_days after item received .
neutral	still_waiting to see if i receive the corrected sized bracelet as regardless of the thomas_sabo sizes , my wrist is the same size and a bracelet that is advertised as being 00 . 0cm will fit my wrist very comfortably , unlike this one which wouldn_'_t do up !
neutral	i must_say the people i have spoken to have always been very polite - credit to the company .
neutral	brought some flowers for my mum and upgraded them to deluxe .
neutral	free next_day delivery which was fab , but i was disappointed with the overall size of the bouquet considering i had upgraded them .
neutral	lovely flowers , but i will go into a local_florist next time so i had a better idea of what i was actually getting for my money .
neutral	was looking for a particular_model of dewalt heat gun which was out of stock on a lot of websites .
neutral	found it on uk_tool_centre for a comparably reasonable_price and it said they had stock .
neutral	ordered the item on a thursday_morning .
neutral	website said goods ordered before early_afternoon normally shipped same day .
neutral	mine sadly wasn_'_t .
neutral	order finally arrived on the following wednesday .
neutral	didn_'_t think this was very good considering shipping was an extra_charge .
neutral	happy with actual product but wouldn_'_t go out of my way to use this company again .
neutral	the parcel was promptly picked_up by_fedex the same day i ordered it which i was really impressed with .
neutral	it was delivered on time but the recipient was charged $_00 on taxes almost the same amount as the delivery cost even_though i had clearly_written personal used belongings .
neutral	now i have to go through the refund process with fedex which i am not amused with .
neutral	the website says free delivery if your order is over_£_00 but that isn_'_t the case my last 0 orders were over_£_00 pounds and they still charged me £ 0 . 00 delivery when i queried it they told me they charged me because of the weight no mention of this on the website !
neutral	the envelopes arrived today in good nick but i received an e_- mail on thursday to say they were being dispatched on friday .
neutral	the tracking_link didn_'_t work so i waited in all day all day friday and had to leave a note on my front_door that a neighbour would sign for me in case i didn_'_t hear the bell or was out and as i was away most of the weekend i had no idea when they would arrive !
neutral	service was ok quick boarding and ship was fine , however the toilets were disgusting , the children '_s play_area was broke ( we had to tuck a bit up out of the way so the children didn_'_t strangle themselves ), false_advertising in the duty_free shop i thought a bottle of perfume was good value for money after_seeing the tester bottle being the larger one only to find it was for the smaller one - with no option to buy the next size up .
neutral	not a good food choice for children and there were quite a few children on board thought there would be more .
neutral	first time i have traveled on dfds i don_'_t think i will be travelling with them again !
neutral	was a bit disappointed to place my order on the friday and have to wait for the delivery until monday .
neutral	nowadays everything works to a 0 day week and would have thought this would be the same .
neutral	when i ordered and paid for the flowers it said next_day delivery then suddenly 0_days_later i would not have gone ahead if i had not already paid but such a hassle to cancel and go else where .
neutral	found out reason for delay was out of stock .
neutral	why didn_'_t it say that to start with ?
neutral	maybe suggest alternative flowers .
neutral	i '_ve_used this company several_times and they have been brilliant .
neutral	will be more wary in future .
neutral	i waited a whole 00 days and then wasn_'_t in when delivery made , items left with neighbour which was fine but no contact info for delivery person - was wanting to order more items and also see what he had with him as i understand you can buy on doorstep .
neutral	i '_m not a grinch where leaving reviews is concerned so i '_ll give credit where it '_s due .
neutral	i '_ve made a few orders with rubbersole and had no_problems so been happy .
neutral	however i '_m very disappointed with my last order .
neutral	i ordered the most expensive shoes i '_ve ever got myself as i fell in love with them .
neutral	i ordered a size 0 and waited_patiently for them to arrive from france .
neutral	they eventually arrived and they were size 0 . 0 .
neutral	i had to return them and requested a size 0 again in exchange .
neutral	i even contacted customer_services to ask if it could be made possible to ensure that the correct_size will be sent out to save even more disappointment .
neutral	again after waiting_patiently for them to come from france they were a size 0 . 0 .
neutral	i couldn_'_t_believe it :( feeling pretty trashed i returned them and have requested a refund .
neutral	i think envirofone should give the option of telling them if your phone isnt working in the first quote instead of after youve been quoted and sent your phone off .
neutral	i received a lot less_than was originally_quoted .
neutral	mazuma '_s website were able to quote me a working and not - working figure without me having to send the phone .
neutral	easy to use and helpful when you are stuck and unable to get your usual medications .
neutral	bear in mind that this comes at a premium and the large delivery costs make this an expensive option and therefore a last_resort only .
neutral	the pricing on the website was great , however there isn_'_t enough information_regarding the need to send in a prescription and i didn_'_t get the email requesting it til the following_day .
neutral	i received confirmation of dispatch from mr pets which implies all of the order is being sent together which it wasn_'_t .
neutral	a week_later i contacted them to check where the advocate was and received a reply telling_me it would be sent next_day .
neutral	0 .
neutral	was sent the incorrect part by one of the companies that came up in the search_results from parts_gateway .
neutral	asked for a refund , but was still made to pay for postage and packaging although company sent wrong part .
neutral	0 .
neutral	used nissan 0st after 0st mishap through parts_gateway , excellent service , excellent friendly man at the end of the phone for advice .
neutral	i bought 0 dresses .
neutral	both materials were very see through and you could tell the quality was not good .
neutral	one of them i have just sent back .
neutral	pictures are very decieving aswell
neutral	i got the wrong item , contacted customer service , they said what i ordered was " changed " to a different product with totally different ingredients , but no one asked for my opinion before sending me a different product .
neutral	i replied if i '_m returning the wrong item , who will pay for the postage , and suggested a pre_- paid envelop to be arranged , but never_heard from them since then .
neutral	probably will use this website again , as it has some good rare products , but a mistake is a mistake , the website should take full responsibility .
neutral	we first went to the gateshead ( metro_centre ) store to look for a new couch and were informed that there were no couches to fit our room dimensions .
neutral	the salesman dismissed us immediately when he realised we could not buy the couch we wanted due to it not being the correct_size , there was no offer to look at alternatives with us .
neutral	we then returned home and looked online ourselves and found a number of couches that would fit our room .
neutral	we contacted the darlington store and explained the situation and asked whether , if we came into the store it would be a waste of time , especially given that we had a young baby and had already travelled to a store once that day .
neutral	the staff were exceptionally helpful and we ordered our couch with very little hassle .
neutral	on delivery , the guys were great , they worked with no mess and were polite and friendly .
neutral	there was unfortunately a fault on the couch and the upholsterer was contacted immediately and the problem was rectified within a few_weeks .
neutral	our couch is elephant cord fabric and the only issue with it is that it loses it '_s pile quite quickly on the arms despite following the recommended care regime .
neutral	something to be mindful of if you want your couch to look good continuously .
neutral	overall i would recommend dfs to others .
neutral	good service and easy booking .
neutral	fair_pricing on all_aspects including on board .
neutral	very poor aspect toilets not clean on return_journey quiet disgusting .
neutral	no soap in dispensers .
neutral	soaking_wet floor no good on the health and safety side .
neutral	slipping of passengers could be quite_costly to the company .
neutral	not much choice in the shop .... french / belgium beers / calvados
neutral	although i have previously purchased fitflop_shoes from shoetique , which were then shipped to australia , recently i selected a pair , the payment went through but a few_days_later i received an_email_saying fitflop could no_longer be shipped to australia .
neutral	i did receive a refund but my quests is : " why not let customers know prior to wasting time trying to buy something which cannot be shipped ?"
neutral	i was logged in , so if the site was set_up properly , i should have been notified immediately .
neutral	such a waste of time !
neutral	!
neutral	do things with your money without even consulting or warning you its going to happen .
neutral	the item of ivermectin drops i ordered should be explained more clearer for certain animals such as guinea_pigs and birds as the ones i ordered when it arrived was for birds and i needed it for my guinea_pigs so no use to me so i have just wasted £_00 .
neutral	the o . 0 % - 0ml and 0 % - 00ml is not explained enough and might be a suggestion of letting people know which is which for individual pets and what doses may be .
neutral	it is a good website and not too confusing unlike others ...
neutral	i bought the first item and paid for a next_day delivery , which i never received .
neutral	we did not even get a card from the delivery company you used to tell us that a delivery had been attempted !
neutral	i '_m still_waiting for my delivery refund by the way .
neutral	the reason i am particularly upset about this is because my dear boyfriend did not get his_birthday_present in time .
neutral	all because of your incompetent delivery company !
neutral	it '_s good that you have other delivery options for your customers , but when the chosen delivery company lets us down , then the reviews you receive from us will let you down ...
neutral	overall , it is a good site and i have already ordered something_else ( making a point of avoiding that certain delivery option i chose last time and settling fro royal_mail ...)
neutral	ordered our bath from this company as we have a small bathroom and not many other_companies stock the size we need .
neutral	paid over_£_00 for delivery and at no point during the selection of the product or at the checkout point did it say kerbside drop only .
neutral	it was only after_speaking to the company on the day of delivery was i informed of this & to find this condition of delivery i had to click on 0 different pages of their website to find it .
neutral	company should make this clearer to their customers when they are checking out on their website .
neutral	i was disappointed with the delivery service , as the last time i ordered from lords of notting_hill they were better .
neutral	yodel ( need i say more !!!!!)
neutral	delivery driver got grumpy when he called me 0_days after it was due to be delivered to find no one at home to take delivery .
neutral	i told him if it had been delivered on time then there would have been someone at home !!
neutral	yodel '_s website tracking said they had left a calling_card at the house but they hadn_'_t .
neutral	i tried to contact lords head of online sales but no reply to my email .
neutral	it has_been left with a neighbour now but as it is an ironing_board its not exactly small and i am away on business all week leaving the 0ft board with her .
neutral	shame , as the first time i used them they were good and will think_twice about using them again .
neutral	the website is user_friendly and there is a large_selection to choose from - some very impressive displays .
neutral	delivery was good but the flowers were a little_disappointing - they were somewhat crumpled and looked more like supermarket bought quality .
neutral	also , the vase ordered to put the flowers in was too small - though this was not indicated as a potential problem at the time of ordering ( only one size option of vase ).
neutral	i don_'_t think i will be ordering from here again .
neutral	i was told the flowers were beautiful , but im really disappointed in the delayed delivery !
neutral	the flowers were for my mums_birthday !
neutral	left the depot only down the road from her address at 00 :_00am and didnt arrive to her until 0 :_00pm which proceeded to make my mum think i had forgotten her_birthday !
neutral	im used to flower_deliveries ive bought from other_florists arriving alot earlier !
neutral	the item ordered was urgent medication for my dogs ears .
neutral	tnt sub contracted the delivery out to royal_mail who didnt deliver , didnt bother to leave card and the item was at the sorting_office for over 0_weeks .
neutral	i complained and in then was sent a second item , i therefore had to pay for two and no satisfaction all_round .
neutral	have put a written complaint into royal_mail and urge the pet_supermarket not to use tnt in future .
neutral	the best price around and free_postage was the ultimate reason for ordering from pet_supermarket , hopefully nothing will go_wrong the next time .
neutral	i had very friendly conversations with enquiries and on - line staff .
neutral	i then ordered on line , delivery was very prompt but one item was missing .
neutral	after 00hrs i made enquiries , had to wait for on - line staff the next_day only to be told that the item was discontinued .
neutral	i asked them if they were going to remove it from the web - site and whether they intended to credit my account .
neutral	actually they did so eventually but it was too slow and cost me two phone_calls .
neutral	i am sure this aspect could be improved .
neutral	won_'_t be able to get glasses and phone in it !
neutral	i have just received my third order from diet_chef .
neutral	i have no concerns about using diet_chef and the subsequent weight_loss from using diet_chef .
neutral	however , i have concerns about the delivery .
neutral	first delivery was fine .
neutral	second delivery had two items missing from the delivery .
neutral	third delivery had two damaged items and three items missing .
neutral	when i rang customer_services on both_occasions this was dealt_with in a very efficient manner and i quickly received the missing items .
neutral	however , especially on the second call i felt that the person dealing_with my complaint really couldn_'_t care less that i had been inconvenienced .
neutral	i really do believe that diet_chef should have better controls in place to ensure that goods are sent out correctly and in good order , and i shouldn_'_t have to be contacting them to put things right .
neutral	i would still recommend them to people though , but warn them to check their orders !
neutral	the product arrived as ordered , very good quality .
neutral	the only_downside is that you got my name wrong .
neutral	i told you twice about this and you failed to remedy it .
neutral	my name is brenda syrett not brenda scott .
neutral	it is really annoying when this is ignored .
neutral	this does not leave a good impression of a company when they can '_t get your name right .
neutral	it exhibits a lack of professionalism and a lack of respect .
neutral	i was pleased with the prices as much_cheaper_than salons .
neutral	but dissapointed that order was not right .
neutral	i ordered 0 shampoos and 0 conditioners and got 0 shampoos and only 0 conditioner .
neutral	i know this isn_'_t a hardship but disappointing
neutral	while the order and delivery process was faultless i was disappointed to receive half of our 0000_euro order in 000_euro notes .
neutral	i am writing this while still on holiday having managed to use one so far and just hoping we will be able to spend the rest but they are viewed with suspicion in many places and were outrightly refused on our ferry to france .
neutral	there did not appear to be any facility on the website to specify that these very large denomination notes should not be included .
neutral	in the uk it is unusual to offer £_00 notes let_alone £_000 ones which is the nearest to these so why do travelex use them ?
neutral	i did not understand that it was not automatically_added to me phone and that i had to ring orange with reference_number
neutral	the website was easy to use and the hotel was in a good place to access everything .
neutral	the show we saw ( barking in essex ) wasn_'_t what we were expecting and not really that funny just full of swearing with a weak story line and some famous names in it .
neutral	it would apeal to a teenage school_play ground .
neutral	so next time i would look else where for a description of a show but would consider still booking with ticket_tree .
neutral	we left our car at park n fly edinburgh_airport for a week on return we were collected from the terminal at 0am so on way back to our car the driver was speeding well over the limit to the point i was scared , also once we left and were on our way home we discovered that money we keep in the ashtray for carparking etc around £ 0 was all gone so would i use them again .... no
neutral	rien_à redire sur_la_qualité des_produits .
neutral	en revanche , j ' ai payé un supplément pour être livrée à domicile et là , le drame , je_suis livrée dans_un point relai , pas franchement à proximité avec un bonus de style ( colis à retirer sous 0_jours ).
neutral	suite à cela , j ' ai essayé de joindre un service client :
neutral	- boite vocale au téléphone ,
neutral	- aucune adresse mail indiquée sur_le site .
neutral	price was cheaper_than other_websites but the delivery time was terrible .
neutral	could be worth_paying with another website with acceptable delivery times .
neutral	i would say the service is excellent , in speed & applying the credit .
neutral	although the networks can be far from acceptable , i have had many wasted calls whereby repeat calls have been necessary to achieve a decent conversation .
neutral	( i . e loss of speech / crossed lines , interference etc : at times the calls just cut of randomly .
neutral	on other occasions i have connected to the same number i always ring 0000000 ** 00 ** 0 , & an auto attendant then some prostitute chat line on many occasions telling_me what bikini she had on , & what she was prepared to do to me ..!!?!
neutral	numerous_attempts later & lost credit & finally reaching my dialled destination .
neutral	i intend to try elsewhere .
neutral	received as stated , colour was lighter_than internet picture so not suitable , ended_up spending over_£_00 to return post , won_'_t be ordering internet again .
neutral	i returned items
neutral	ordered three lights , two of which were fine but the other had to be bent upwards to match .
neutral	we sent flowers to my mum for her_birthday so did not see them arrive , but according to my dad ( who received the delivery ) the orchids were bruised as they had been sent in a box that did not support them as it was too_big .
neutral	i feel disappointed as i have only sent flowers once before , due to the cost , and am unlikely to do it again if they are not packed and sent with care and thought .
neutral	i bought on the strength of a link on amazon because the price was good .
neutral	the payment flipped me from paypal to another system and my computer gave up and crashed .
neutral	i checked with paypal and the payment had been cleared .
neutral	as the order was not showing on my customer page of the website i sent an e_mail for confirmation that my order had gone_through .
neutral	in_spite of a promise of 00 hour reply i had to repeat my e_mail next_day and i only finally cleared the matter up by telephoning .
neutral	on the plus_side it was a very good price and it arrived on the date promised .
neutral	although the website is not very clear or that easy to follow having finally got through all the stages it felt good to get my cashback .
neutral	would i use it again ?
neutral	perhaps - but it certainly wasn_'_t that easy to negotiate .
neutral	i received all the paperwork to return my phone .
neutral	i sent the phone back with 0_days left of the send back bracket .
neutral	revived communications that my phone was cleared in the checks , but i was given and then sent out a reduced price on what the guaranteed offer was .
neutral	disappointed with this as my phone was in immaculate_condition and i had followed the instructions word for word .
neutral	i would order from pinesolutions again but i have to say that i was , of course , disappointed that the first delivery was damaged , ie both items .
neutral	i did ask for a discount as i had to get someone to be available for another day to accept the order but this was declined which i did not think was good customer service .
neutral	i thought some discount would have been offered off of another order .
neutral	the delivery men were very helpful though and i had good service from the staff at the end of the phone .
neutral	thankfully the second order was ok and we are very pleased with the furniture .
neutral	the flowers were lively and did arrive on day requested , but were left in porch of the hospice they were delivered to , which_meant the recipient did not actually get the flowers the same day !!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	delivery was quick but were just left in garden even_though someone was in .
neutral	flowers looked nothing like the picture .
neutral	just a few sticks disappointment !
neutral	not sure i would use again !
neutral	i have been very happy with the speed of the blinds being made .
neutral	the staff were always very helpful and friendly .
neutral	the only_downside for me was that the drop on the roman_blinds when they were pulled closed were too long .
neutral	i tried to change another order but was told it was too late , i was told that i should have asked for narrower folds .
neutral	not helpful for me because i hadn_'_t had roman_blinds before so wasn_'_t aware of this .
neutral	therefore , a very disappointing finish for me .
neutral	people should be made aware of this before they place their order .
neutral	the item ordered arrived within an acceptable delivery time .
neutral	i however , needed to return an item , as i had ordered in correctly .
neutral	no returns information is available on the invoice , and their website looks like they are an it company ??
neutral	i had to phone to organise a return authorisation , which is only valid for 0_days and then cancelled if not received in this time .
neutral	also had to pay for delivery and return even_though i wished to order a replacement which again i will have to pay for .
neutral	not very competitive in this day and age .
neutral	booked a one night stay in a city hotel in the uk for 0 people .
neutral	very reasonable and hotel was lovely , posh considering it worked out cheaper_than the neighbouring travelodge .
neutral	it was easy to book online , i paid a deposit amount to suit me , got confirmation emails , accommodation vouchers and the rest of the payment was taken on the date agreed , no_fuss .
neutral	on arrival at the hotel ( around 0_months after booking , and around 0pm ), the receptionist informed us that alpharooms had not forwarded our requests on for neighbouring rooms , and had not told them that we had booked for 0 people in one room ( one triple and two doubles ).
neutral	apparently they did not offer triple rooms - despite the alpharooms website offering this and allowing me to book this .
neutral	as such we had to wait 00_minutes whilst they found suitable rooms for us , and we ended_up being 0 floors apart_from each other .
neutral	if alpharooms had communicated better with the hotel , we could have at_least been on the same floor , and our rooms would have been ready .
neutral	they had 0_months to tell the hotel about the rooms we had booked and our request to be close to each other , it '_s not as if it was last_minute .
neutral	i won_'_t be booking with alpharooms again unless i just need one room for 0 - 0 people .
neutral	i bought a bean_bag for my daughters_birthday .
neutral	i thought i had ordered a footstool to go with but seems i didn_'_t .
neutral	i chose 0 - 0 day delivery but it came on the 0th working day after i had ordered it ( and was too late for the actual birthday day ). i ordered it on a tuesday_evening but it wasn_'_t despatched from the warehouse til thursday and that caused the delay i think . please try to despatch on the day after it is ordered or be more realistic in your delivery estimates .
neutral	the beanbag itself is fine but it has a chemically odour which i '_m hoping will fade as its newness wears off .
neutral	was disappointed that the wrong teddy_bear was sent to the one i chose without_any prior notification .
neutral	thought they were great to speak to over phone - i had to re - order some tiles and they were good matching the batch .
neutral	i ve only rated a 0 as kerbside delivery ; for those girls / single parents on thier own watch out !!
neutral	my tiles were so heavy i couldn_' lift them - the young driver was lovely and helpful , but beware that you may need someone to help as your tiles will be on the pavement !
neutral	i have only found 0 experiences worth parting with my cash for from hundreds offered .
neutral	the daily emails therefore have become a bit of a chore .
neutral	i ordered my son a onesie for christmas , so it was not until a few_weeks after arrival that it was found the onesie had seams undone and a hole in it .
neutral	i was embarrassed , disappointed and annoyed about this .
neutral	i emailed on christmas day and to my surprise , got a reply within a matter of hours .
neutral	there followed an exchange which annoyed me , as i was told to send it back but that i would have to re - order the item - this simply didn_'_t seem fair to me .
neutral	however in the end , they did resend the item ( perfect_condition this time ) and this was received before i had returned mine .
neutral	however , i have had nothing by the way of an_apology which i find annoying - a discount_voucher or something would have restored goodwill .
neutral	so a bt of a mixed experience really but overall , i have to say whilst i was impressed to get a response on christmas day , i am very disapointed with what happened and their subsequent response .
neutral	we ordered some of the plan dollhouse furniture to add to my daughter '_s ever expanding residence .
neutral	the furniture is beautiful and as expected .
neutral	the delivery was pretty unsatisfactory - expensive at £ 0 . 00 and slow , took about 0_days to arrive .
neutral	if it wasn_'_t for that wouldn_'_t_hesitate to use again .
neutral	i couldn_'_t find what i was looking for in the uk but ambiente had one at a much_better price and i also had a reduction for signing_up .
neutral	i had to wait_until new stock was received and then it was send to the uk via_dhl who had the wrong_postcode entered on their tracking site .
neutral	so after various phone_calls it eventually arrived .
neutral	however there was only one lorry driver who could not get the pallet across the stones on the path , so it had to sit outside all day until my husband came home and we got a neighbour to help get it into the house .
neutral	what a palaver !!!!
neutral	however it works well and i just hope we don_'_t have to repeat this in a hurry .
neutral	:-)
neutral	no review from me yet .
neutral	but will be happy to give one on receiving my goods please hurry up just longing to make up stories
neutral	fast delivery but with 0 snag the courier service leaves the parcel on the doorstep if you are not available to take delivery as has happened to myself last_week despite_being at home till 0 . 00pm when we got back home at 00 . 00am to find it left there any0ne could have lifted it and they might have argued that point about leaving it the way the driver did and not leaving it with a neighbour when you could have collected from them providing a card was left telling you who took delivery apart_from this issue the product is fine
neutral	on twice i have ordered shoes fom mr shoes and on both_occasions the orders have been accepted paid for and then later i have been told the orders can not be fullfilled very diissapointed
neutral	received cards and a surname was spelt wrong with a v instead of a y .
neutral	when i contacted bride and groom they told me it was the font i had used .
neutral	when i sent back samples showing and then contacted them again they admitted they had made a spelling_mistake and new cards would be printed .
neutral	new cards arrived the next_day !
neutral	good service in the end .
neutral	cards are lovely and are of a good quality .
neutral	service very good and prompt , however after purchasing over_£_000 of balloons / goods and whilst awaiting the helium ( one week before the party ) only to be phoned to say that there is a shortage of helium and consequently my order could not be fulfilled .
neutral	the first enquiry to a googled helium supplier and my request for helium from a competitor was met , they had not heard of said shortage !
neutral	very happy that i was let_down in time so that i could purchase the gas from elsewhere .
neutral	apart_from the helium incident very good service , nice website and helpful staff .
neutral	prompt delivery but ended_up phoning order through after 0 failed_attempts on website ( have not had issue previously ).
neutral	person on phone was not that helpful - like i was an inconvenience for phoning .
neutral	very expensive and post and packing cost £ 0 thought it was ridiculous
neutral	the actual hen_do itself was amazing .
neutral	everything went_according to plan .
neutral	but the planning of it was so stressful .
neutral	everytime i required a call back i was not called back until i chased it upwards of 0 times .
neutral	i didn_'_t received my pack until 0_days before i travelled .
neutral	the planning was just so stressful but as i mentioned tha actual booking was great .
neutral	no_issues at all .
neutral	after waiting over 0_weeks for my order of net_curtains , 0 of them was the wrong_size , when phoning nets 0 go they said i would have to send it back and when they receive it they will send me another 0 out .
neutral	this has now been a week and still_waiting for my new 0 :-(
neutral	easy to order and delivered correctly .
neutral	i was just disappointed with the amount of flowers as it looked like a lot more in the picture so i will be going elsewhere in future .
neutral	very friendly and helpful .
neutral	my mum get flowers for x - mas every year i use interflora but this time i use floraqueen
neutral	my mum said that flowers was lovely but not very big and quolity not good . price was
neutral	dubole that i dont_know i send flowers to my mum finland 0 times a year . anne
neutral	when ordering the flowers i was asked if there were delivery stipulations .
neutral	i asked for them to be left with a neighbour .
neutral	my parents arrived home to find flowers dumped on doorstep full_view of the road so not only did the flower sit in direct sunlight for a few hours it was fairly obvious to passers_by my parents were out .
neutral	neighbours both_sides had been in all day and no one had knocked and flowers weren_'_t signed for .
neutral	not great service at all especially on a very hot day .
neutral	delivery was quick but a little disappointed with the costume as after wearing once the padding on the belt has come unstitched and the velcro is too long under shoes so has worn away
neutral	the flowers were delivered 00 / 00 / 00 but my aunt did not know they were there .
neutral	it was not until i sent her a text on 00 / 00 / 00 asking if she liked the flowers that she knew about them .
neutral	she loved the flowers & said they were beautiful after she finally found them hidden_behind her wheely bin !
neutral	nothing put through her door to say they were there .
neutral	as i paid good money for these i expected better .
neutral	would have had a better rating if the flowers had been delivered correctly .
neutral	good , it '_s money for nothing really , i would be buying stuff anyway , some retailers don_'_t honour their cash_back tesco being the worst twice i '_ve chased them for cash_back
neutral	i am a retired graphic_designer , who was at one time employed by a printing company who published books .
neutral	i like to use my own photos , and using photoshop make any changes to suit my taste .
neutral	i print three different family calendars and three different family books each year , plus a copy of each book for myself .
neutral	this year the company that i have used previously to print my family year books was no_longer in business , so i transferred to photoworld and cewe .
neutral	to check that i had produced the lightness / darkness of the photos at the right level for printing i sent away for the calendars first .
neutral	the calendars were printed exactly
neutral	they way i like them .
neutral	including the same photos i went_ahead with the books but was not happy with the first printing .
neutral	i found i had to lighten dramatically many of the photos which were far too dark in the book .
neutral	once altered the second printing was fine and i ordered two copies of each book , resulting in nine books in total .
neutral	three of the nine books i will have to throw_away , which made the order somewhat dearer_than i had hoped .
neutral	i can only_assume that the printer or print machine which printed the calendars was different from that which printed the books .
neutral	paid_extra to get next_day delivery and the goods were not dispatched till the next_day so didn_'_t get it till the following_day .
neutral	paying the extra was a big con !
neutral	ordered replacement hinge for freezer - excellent service .
neutral	then had to order 0 replacement hinges for fridge .
neutral	they took nearly a week to arrive and then didn_'_t fit .
neutral	returns process a bit cumbersome .
neutral	the delivery was confirmed by text which was fine and standard but as we were not home rather_than leaving with neighbours who were at home our brand_new bags were thrown over the back gate so we came home to a ripped wet nox as it was raining not impressed at all
neutral	no printable e_- tickets for the gig i am going to and my name put on a list of attendees .
neutral	was told to print my receipt and show my bank card as proof .
neutral	its a really dodgy practice and unnerved me from wanting to buy tickets although when buying tickets it said e_- tickets would be available
neutral	delivery was great , on time the only upset was when i removed the 00kg_bag from the outer_bag the inner was cut and taped , as you can_imagine clearing up 00kg of dry_dog_food from the carpet was not wanted .
neutral	arranged for our patio_set to be delivered between 0 and 00 and received automated call the evening before to say it would arrive between 00 and 0p . m .
neutral	with driver advising us an_hour before he was to arrive .
neutral	next_day by 0 o ' clock nothing had been heard and after 00_minutes trying to get through to the correct department we gave up and left a note in the window to leave the item with a neighbour .
neutral	on our return a phone message had been left at 0 . 00 advising us the delivery would be late but there was nothing left at our house to say whether the item had been left at our neighbour '_s house or returned to the depot .
neutral	had to telephone to find out what had been done with our delivery .
neutral	not a good experience although the item is great .
neutral	i ordered two sensitive items , they were delivered to the incorrect_address . a neighbour `_s we don_`_t talk to gave it to us , the firm can `_t be blamed but this is unacceptable .
neutral	i purchased a voucher through amazon for a canvas including postage ... going through the process to pay it didnt allow me to use the vocher code so i had to pay full price with my credit_card .
neutral	not happy spoke to customer_services who told me to send an_email quoting reference and voucher no .
neutral	and they would refund me , however the lady gave_me an incorrect email address which_meant i had to follow_up with another phone_call and send the email again ..... i am to get a refund but not a good first experience .
neutral	the product is acceptable , not sure i would purchase anoher one !
neutral	!.
neutral	ebookers seems to have a wee_bit lower rates , but not enough to quite stand_out .
neutral	i '_m still testing the water , so to speak , but time will tell .
neutral	one thing i didn_'_t like for sure , was the duration of a phone_call i had to make to change the return of a flight .
neutral	it took almost 0 whole hour to finalize the changes and extra_charges !!!!
neutral	i was growing more frustrated by the minute , since i was calling from the states to some place in the uk to talk to a customer service rep .
neutral	i just couldn_'_t understand_why it took soooooo long !!!!
neutral	i mean , at some point i was even trying to help the rep by login up into my computer and finding flights myself !!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a couple of things for dressing as a medieval queen for a music_festival . stuff arrived in good time and everything was fine apart_from the fact that i giot a blue dress instead of a green one . no explanation as to why .
neutral	i '_m presuming that they ran_out of green ones . it would have been fine if they '_d just dropped me an e_- mail to tell me that before they shipped it as i searched the whole internet for a green one . i specifically ordered from them cos they were the only ones offering green ones in stock .
neutral	had to wait for item to come into stock which i agreed to however didn_'_t arrive so i emailed them and found out they weren_'_t despatching my item as the card number i gave them one month before had expired .
neutral	had they contacted me sooner by email or phone i could have had my item on time .
neutral	returned an item to very and received the refund immediately .
neutral	impressive in my standards .
neutral	although i won_'_t be ordering from very again because they are contracted with yodel of whom are a terrible delivery company .
neutral	the service of ordering and delivering the cartridge was very efficient but unfortunately even_though the new black and white hp00 cartridge has_been installed correctly i am still unable to print .
neutral	we booked last_minute and had no_problems at all with the admin side of things , the travel went_smoothly apart_from a two hour delay that was nothing to do with villa_plus , but it meant we arrived late at night .
neutral	picked_up at airport as promised and driven to our villa .
neutral	sadly , it turned_out to be a bit tatty and scruffy in the light of the next_morning .
neutral	villa_plus take a great deal of time and care over their photographs , with lots of props and staging and we realised that and don_'_t expect it to be set_up like that when we arrived , but the totally bare and stark look of the place was a bit off putting .
neutral	the sofa and armchairs were torn and threadbare and had throws on them to hide some the stains and rips .
neutral	the pillows were extremely yellowed and lumpy !!
neutral	the whole villa looked as if it had been decorated in 0000 which was a bit of a shame .
neutral	it generally needed some tlc .
neutral	the welcome starter_pack we paid for was very good , we thought , bread , butter , orange_juice , tea_bags , dishwasher tablets , washing up liquid , bacon , cheese , ham and more .
neutral	the kitchen was well stocked with just about every implement and dish you could want .
neutral	outside was laid to grass around the pool .
neutral	the sunbeds were marked and mismatched and the only sun brolly was half broken and standing at a tilt under the trees around the perimeter .
neutral	no pool_heating at this particular villa , but we knew that when we booked .
neutral	the obligatory villa_plus pool_table and ping_pong table were on the driveway , so we had to leave the car we hired later in the street , and walk around them to the front_door .
neutral	other small problems with the old villa ... the sink_unit in the bathroom was cracked , broken and black with mould at the base .
neutral	water leaked from the end of the sink_unit and made a little puddle on the kitchen_floor every night , not much but noticeable .
neutral	there was a general musty smell to the place and as i say , it needs some money spending on it now to make it a bit nicer , else you can '_t expect people to pay good money to stay there .
neutral	i ordered products online before 0pm on a friday to take_advantage of the claim that items ordered before this time are usually despatched the same day .
neutral	whilst the website states that delivery is 0 - 0 business days , it makes the claim that customers often get delivery the very next_day and how highly their delivery service is rated as it is so fast .
neutral	i hoped to secure delivery by the mon / tues latest .
neutral	when the items hadn_'_t arrived by the following_tuesday , and i got in touch i was told that they had only been despatched that same day , without_any explanation , and that my order had only been sent second class .
neutral	claims on the website that clients often receive goods the following_day after ordering should be removed if they are only going to use second class_post .
neutral	this is misleading .
neutral	likewise , claiming that orders are despatched the same day is also over ambitious , mine was processed three business days_later .
neutral	disappointed with the customer service team who continued to make ambitious claims about delivery on the tuesday , saying that i might still get my items the very next_day , even thought they admitting using second class_post !
neutral	it arrived thursday .
neutral	be aware that as well as posting second class , that they don_'_t class sat as a business day either .
neutral	i bought these pots & pans via wowcher for £_00 . 00 , believing i was getting a discount of £_00 .
neutral	however a few_days after purchasing the items i discovered the pans were only £_00 . 00 , thus only making a saving of £_00 , however i had to pay for delivery at £ 0 .
neutral	so i '_m not entirely happy with what i got , i could '_ve got a better deal buying from a chain store .
neutral	i do like the items but i don_'_t think they are worth £_00 . 00 , £_00 . 00 but maybe around £_00_-£_00 without having to pay for delivery .
neutral	i would say you are better off buying from somewhere where you can view the items in your hands & see for yourself if the products are worth the money you are handing_over for them .
neutral	i would & have bought from procook again , i do like some of their products
neutral	quick delivery with no_problems , but the box seemed a bit worse for wear , plus the box with the glass in was torn inside .
neutral	not ideal when i '_m giving it as a gift .
neutral	i received the vitamins quickly and efficiently however found that while taking them .
neutral	i suffered from heart palpitations .
neutral	i have since stopped taking them and had no further problems .
neutral	my partner also too the men '_s vitamins and had no_issues .
neutral	i have now sent 0 emails of complaint with photos but received no response at all
neutral	its a transaction either it wrks or it does not , you just dont buy there
neutral	my reservations have pretty_much been resolved by the company in that i thought having each capsule individually_wrapped was a ridiculous waste , but necessary bearing in mind the capsules were only covered in perforated plastic .
neutral	i gather this has now been changed .
neutral	i '_m really looking_forward to trying all of the strengths on free offer and will certainly give them a fair try .
neutral	i really hope i come down on their side since they are really good , value .
neutral	wowcher themselves i have had no_issues with , however , some of the suppliers they use , probably about half of my purchases can take up to 0 - 0_weeks to arrive and that is only after being chased , not 00 days .
neutral	the bike was delivered on time by a friendly delivery guy .
neutral	construction took me 00mins and was quite fiddly as there was a lot to build but the result is a strong good looking bike that doesn_'_t take up too much room .
neutral	the biggest pro is this bike is quiet so you can easily bike and watch tv .
neutral	the biggest con is the computer as the labels are all in chinese .
neutral	i got round it by putting stickers on but it took a while to match the symbols from the instruction_sheet .
neutral	this bike is very good value for money and provides tough resistance for any level of rider .
neutral	i bought a pair of ladies work trousers .
neutral	i thought they would be a usual ladies fit , but they weren_'_t .
neutral	they felt more like a mans , as they were tight in the hips but loose around the waist .
neutral	i never have trouble with trousers so i know it wasn_'_t me !
neutral	also , they have a pouch for knee_pads , but because the pocket is too long , they end up as shin_pads .
neutral	i have to keep pushing the pads up .
neutral	unfortunately , i had no option but wear them so i can '_t return them .
neutral	that said , the service from dickies_store itself was very good .
neutral	the goods came very quickly & i was kept_informed all the way as to dilivery times , etc so i would order from them again .
neutral	i '_d a lot of cds to sell but used a competitor for most of them as they offered much_better prices .
neutral	i used music_magpie for the ones that the other site didn_'_t accept ( about 00_percent ), so i was able to compare the two services .
neutral	both packages posted at the same time , but mm acknowledged_receipt almost a week after the other site .
neutral	the other site said they were paying me just a few_days_later - v . impressive .
neutral	meanwhile mm kept sending emails to say my ( much smaller ) package was still being_processed .
neutral	several emails later , and weeks after the other site , i got paid .
neutral	so i wouldn_'_t recommend them , but i '_d highly_recommend the service from [_external refernece ].
neutral	i '_ve bought winter_tyres from their website .
neutral	i '_ve paid more than 000pounds for them , and waited for delivery .
neutral	day later ive received a phone_call with information that tyres i '_ve choice are out of stock ( why there was no information on website just asked me ro pay for them ???)
neutral	they informed me that they could suply me with different one but almost same specification and price .
neutral	ive said ok , as i was desperate for them .
neutral	but when tyres arrived , ive check them on internet and found the same almost 00 pound cheaper per tyre .
neutral	feeling cheated .
neutral	will not complain as leaving uk on saturady and need those tyres .
neutral	buying tyres via telephone is pointless as you cant actually check them straight_away to know what they are offering to you .
neutral	but if there is no tires available in stock , they should inform about that on website , not jusk ask you to pay for what they haven_'_t actually got .
neutral	delivery was quick but asked for delivery to a different address as per order form .
neutral	however failed to follow the instructions and the item ended_up being sent to billing_address .
neutral	first phone_call wasn_'_t very helpful .
neutral	0nd phone_call was better but i really think that the support could be more helpful instead of trying to put the blame onto the customer .
neutral	i have bought several computers and never ever go into the bios system unless told to by a tech_support person .
neutral	there shouldn_'_t be a need to go into it .
neutral	if everything is set_up properly before the computer gets sent to the customer then there won_'_t be any_problems .
neutral	now the pc is working fine and my son is really pleased with it .
neutral	purchased portable cd cassette player listed as new , when received clearly was not new as_described on the cash_generator web_site , very disapointed because it was for a gift was not in box just in bubble_wrap .
neutral	dont thnk would buy from them again unless buying for myself and dont mind having second_hand which most of the items are .
neutral	this item was dispatched super quick very happy with my purchase would recommend this company
neutral	just a little disappointed in the size of the arrangement - went for the middle price and felt it should have been more substantial for the money .
neutral	whole_process was long_winded i was asked to provide information which i had previously given ,
neutral	i used photoworld because i had a voucher entitling me to an excellent deal .
neutral	the sioftware isn_'_t as easy to use as other photobooks i '_ve done and it took a bit of time to navigate my way around the programme .
neutral	my other issue is that the book was a gift , but it arrived emblazoned with the fact that it was a photo_album which kind of gave the game away .
neutral	it came in a cardboard_sleeve and the drop through the letterbox means that one corner of the album has_been damaged ( crumpled slightly ) and there is some creasing on the front spine .
neutral	would i use it again ?
neutral	possibly , given another great deal , and the fact that i now know my way around the software , but i would ask for the album to be better protected in the post .
neutral	they are great and fast when they don_'_t tell u to wait 0_weeks .
neutral	they prescribe you 00 tablets to take two tablets per day .... that '_s lasting you two_weeks , but they won_'_t let you buy anymore until a month has passed .
neutral	which leaves u angry and upset , never mind in pain !!
neutral	they need to stop that rule as it doesn_'_t work people are going elsewhere .
neutral	i ordered a bouquet for mothers_day using an_email advert that i received .
neutral	i requested that they be delivered on the friday , had confirmation that they had been allocated etc .... nothing arrived on friday so i sent an_email ... didn_'_t get a response ... so on saturday i tried to phone at about 0 . 00pm seeing on their website that the office shuts at 0pm only to be told that they were shut .... still no flowers arrived ... but then on sunday the bouquet arrived , very beautiful as always .... i have as still not had a reply to my email and so i am again going to have a go ..... have used this company before and never had a problem .
neutral	the purchase was ok but it took two_weeks (!)
neutral	to get the package ...
neutral	it said 0 - 0_days in the order information ...
neutral	ordered sun_cream on 0th_july , it is now the 00th_july and i '_m still_waiting .
neutral	had to email to find out what happened as they advise normally despatch within 00_hours .
neutral	advised despatched on 00 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	hope it turns_up by the 00th .
neutral	could be there was a rush on ultrasun sun_cream with all this warm weather !
neutral	!
neutral	good service - friendly phone staff however took over a day to realsie the item i ordered was not in stock
neutral	delivery was meant to be next_day and despite the fact that you dispatched it on time , the courier company you used delivered it 0_days_later .
neutral	they refused to call us prior to delivery to get access and it was only by sheer_luck that another company let them in after 0pm when we had closed !
neutral	after ordering a few things online in their sale , i requested for them to be delivered to store as this was the cheapest option .
neutral	following this i got an_email_saying they would let_me know when it had been delivered .
neutral	a week_later i had heard_nothing so went into store to check , they told me they only get deliveries for customers once a week which is pretty poor considering it is meant to be a quick service .
neutral	a few_days_later i eventually got an_email to say it was there .
neutral	however i don_'_t feel that i was very well informed and had i known it would have taken so long i think i may have just paid for postage !
neutral	items however were just as_described .
neutral	i am an_avid user of virgin trains due to being around 0 hours away from home whilst at university .
neutral	there are many things that frustrate me about the service .
neutral	0 ) when i pay full price for a ticket for my journey home that consists of 0 trains and my ticket doesn_'_t even get checked .
neutral	this means that there are probably a large_amount of people getting the train places for free whilst i '_m paying full wack to sit in a seat .
neutral	0 ) you are given seat reservations but there is most_likely always someone sat in your seat so you don_'_t bother and sit somewhere_else and then end up getting moved because you are in someone_else '_s seat .
neutral	0 ) when you make the effort to buy a ticket in_advance to try and save_yourself a bit of money .
neutral	there is no way of cancelling it .
neutral	even if your not going to use it and just want to cancel it so a seat is free for someone_else .
neutral	you can '_t do it .
neutral	nevermind get some kind of credit to use towards a future ticket .
neutral	0 ) everywhere you go these days they are rewards cards and loyalty cards and occasionally send you offers and discounts … not virgin …. i spend a ridiculous_amount of money with them and as a loyal_customer i feel that you are never rewarded .
neutral	0 ) the one time i forget my railcard , bearing mind most of the time my ticket doesn_'_t even get checked , someone asks me for it to which point i explain my problem and even go to the extent of showing them a picture of my rail card , the emails i get from the railcard company and proof of purchase ….. they charged me for another full price ticket onto of the one that i had already brought .
neutral	so much for being a loyal_customer .
neutral	and to follow we had to stand in the isles as the train was so full whilst first_class was empty and the conductor tried charging us for standing in the hallway between two carriages .
neutral	0 ) the process for claiming money back for delayed trains is very difficult .
neutral	they want every little detail down to the very minute of your departure .
neutral	if my train is late and i miss the purpose of my journey , i have wasted money for nothing .
neutral	however after my complaining i must note that the trains i use are most of the time warm an comfortable and with exceptions the staff on board are very helpful if you need information .
neutral	definitely room for improvement though .
neutral	after_spending ages looking around at different saving accounts .
neutral	i found one that looked great with virgin that was a 00 month locked in service where you gained good interest and you could add as much as you wanted but not removed it which is exactly_what i needed .
neutral	after the long set_up process it asked for an initial deposit to open it so i put in £ 0 just to open it up .
neutral	in the following months i attempted to make further deposits in the way that it said to do it which was very complicated and no straight_forward instructions .
neutral	only when i checked by bank_statement the payments had all bounced_back .
neutral	so i have had £ 0 in a savings account for the last_year which i could not add too and with not a lot of help or guidance on the website .
neutral	i have just received the email to say that i can withdraw my amount soon .
neutral	but it is safe to say i don_'_t think i will be taking one out again .
neutral	it is unfair that late charge fees are put on to the account even if you are 0 day late .
neutral	it is just an extra way of making money .
neutral	i used iflorist for flowers for my uncle '_s funeral , i live in kent the funeral was in essex so an internet florist seemed the best way to go .
neutral	the service from them was great i was kept_fully_updated all the way which was reassuring as i was worried_about the flowers being late or not arriving .
neutral	the only_downside was the actual flowers , i '_m not sure what florist they came from but they were awful .
neutral	considering the funeral wasn_'_t until 00am the flowers looked like they had been there all night , they were floppy , lifeless and quite a few petals had fallen_off .
neutral	it was a " large " bouquet and i would hated to have seen the small one !!
neutral	iflorist i would have a word with the people you use as apart_from that my experience was great .
neutral	loved the products but difficult to sort returns , not easy to exchange when required this lets the company down would not suggest you buy from procook if you are not fully sure what you want !
neutral	i tried to change the order ( exclude one_sentence on my magnet for a save the date card ) and it just took_forever , and i felt the response i got was very generic .
neutral	once my order came four card_holders were missing .
neutral	i was happy with the product , in terms of design but i will not use this company for future wedding_stationary .
neutral	one item arrived promptly , but over a week_later and the other one hasn_'_t come .
neutral	didn_'_t want to give a bad_review but totally frustrated and disappointed with the delivery service .
neutral	placed order and quoted delivery by tuesday .
neutral	at time of placing order added a message to seller to include on postage_label to say " if not in , then please leave with a neighbour ".
neutral	did this just in case delivery was late by a day and i knew my purchase would be safe & left with a neighbour whilst i was at work .
neutral	however , how wrong can you be !!!!!!!
neutral	yes delivery was the wednesday - a day later than quoted when ordering .
neutral	but horrified to see that city_link had posted a card through my door which stated "" box left by front_door " on the delivery label on box instead of stating my request it stated " special instructions ; if no answer please leave in a safe_place and card customer "
neutral	city_link definately carded the customer but how could leaving my packing right by my front_door for all passers_by to see and quite easily remove without my knowlege be a safe_place ?
neutral	.
neutral	unfortunately we all don_'_t live in a very nice honest environment .
neutral	luckily , my daughter came home early on the wednesday and brought the package in .
neutral	dread to think who might have got away with it otherwise .
neutral	sad that seller did try and put a note requesting safe_place to leave , but seller definately needs to change its courier service , if this is what they do as the norm .
neutral	i would re - order in the future i think , if i was guaranteed from seller my order would be delivered by another courier who took delivery instructions seriously .
neutral	thus_saving problems of non delivery .
neutral	got to add that both my neighbours were in and were not asked to take my package .
neutral	plus , there is a side_gate to my property that has
neutral	a wrought iron locked gate that my package could quite easily have been pushed under and out of anyone '_s reach .
neutral	thus keeping it safe !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	and delivery trouble free .
neutral	however , got to say a great product .
neutral	the delivery was very prompt , the only problem i had that was the doilies were very hard to separate and a lot of them got torn so had to be thrown_away .
neutral	apart_from that they were ok
neutral	ordered on line and it asked for a specific time when i would collect it .
neutral	slightly_annoying that i had to choose a day and either morning or afternoon .
neutral	made my selection but when i got there no one was ready and they had to search the store room for my goods ( twice !).
neutral	anyway great price and product is just want i wanted but i think i '_d go for home delivery next time
neutral	the annoying thing about jet0 , like all low_cost airlines , is that you have a cost for the flight that you '_ve worked out based on the best time to fly etc , then they add on baggage , a cost for checking in no matter what you choose , a sneaky way to get you to pay for choosing particular seats on the plane and for paying with credit_card .
neutral	it '_s just annoying .
neutral	i placed this order on 00 april , which was despatched on 00 april and not received until 00th_april .
neutral	i paid for priority carriage but this was not a fast delivery .
neutral	i live in rep of ireland - but of course you know that from my being a regular customer and from my address etc .
neutral	and the explanation that i received when i emailed you about it is very convoluted - from what i could gather , the priority part only covers within the uk ?
neutral	maybe you should have something about this on your website when the option to select priority carriage comes up ?
neutral	maybe you don_'_t have many overseas orders ?
neutral	it was very unsatisfctory - and i cannot see the point in paying extra when it makes no difference to delivery time .
neutral	my only_complaint with lovefilm is that they say " unlimited ", but it is actually limited by their poor turnaround time .
neutral	i am waiting at_least 0_days inbetween sending back a dvd and getting the next one delivered , but its more like a week .
neutral	we bought a table and 0 leather_chairs , the quality can '_t be_beaten for the price , unfortunately the table_legs are the wrong_colour and upto now the problem has not been resolved ,
neutral	the blind arrived very quickly and is good quality , but it was 0mm too wide in_spite of our very careful measuring beforehand .
neutral	luckily i have a very handy husband who had to cut the barrel to make it fit .
neutral	we were very pleased with the quality of the printing and binding , and the prompt , well_packaged delivery .
neutral	we were disappointed not to get as much discount as we thought we were entitled to .
neutral	the pricing_structure was unclear , with the price in the editor different to the price as we were ordering , and different again in the final summary .
neutral	also the website offered free_postage on all orders , but we were charged postage .
neutral	we were sold a sofa and talked into fabric care ( which they gave my friend free !!!!)
neutral	and insurance that we didn_'_t want - tried to cancel no luck .
neutral	told them in store we needed a 0 hour_slot for delivery in order to book time off - told certainly however no chance you have to wait in all day - in my opinion we were thoroughly misled - would i recommend - no not unless you have your wits about you
neutral	i am having issues with the redemption of wowchers the codes don_'_t work and then it '_s a race to do it on time .
neutral	the customer service department try hard though i '_m still_waiting on a response from them .
neutral	very poor service in store - having explained why i was there , i was ignored with no explanation or communication for over 00_mins .
neutral	slow to respond by email and needed prompting - missed the date they said they would respond by .
neutral	happy with the price and transaction eventually , but should have experienced better service on the way .
neutral	still_waiting for product .
neutral	they say allow 00 days for despatch and 0_weeks for delivery .
neutral	wish i had known that - might have shopped elsewhere as i need the items quite urgently .
neutral	:(
neutral	the delivery of my colchicums was delayed : i appreciate that it is difficult to anticipate availability of plants ( although it should be easier with bulbs and corms ) but it was only when i queried their non - arrival that i was informed .
neutral	on the plus_side , i received a welcome gift of narcissus bulbs .
neutral	the staff dealing_with the order were great as was the quality of the banner .
neutral	ordered on the tuesday only arrived friday_afternoon .
neutral	got it ordered to my work as i wouldnt be at home .
neutral	finished work for xmas , banner still not delivered had a drive 00 mile_round_trip to get the banner .
neutral	explained all this when i placed my order .
neutral	banner great over promised and under delivered with the courier system
neutral	the parking was easy to book and good value .
neutral	staff ok , but there needs to more frequent transfers between park and airport .
neutral	waited 00_mins in the rain on return , after watching an empty bus leave as we walked out of the terminal .
neutral	there was a scrum then to get on the next bus in the rain .
neutral	not such a pleasant_experience after our_honeymoon .
neutral	may use a slightly more_expensive provider next time with 00_min transfers .
neutral	this was my first purchase from ellis_brigham .
neutral	i placed an order for several items in one delivery .
neutral	the first delivery arrived with one item to follow ( not a problem ), however , when i unboxed one of the delivered items it was incorrect .
neutral	i returned it and ellis_brigham refunded the cost of postage .
neutral	the correct item was then sent to me but my item to follow still had not arrived .
neutral	the next_day it was sent to my billing_address , which is my parents house in an entirely different city .
neutral	eb asked if i would be able to retrieve the item or if i could get it re - delivered .
neutral	they offered another refund in postage but it was now causing inconvenience to my parents who can '_t get to the post_office easily .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting for it to arrive .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t advise ordering if you need your things in a hurry !
neutral	not sure if i would use eb again after all the hassle .
neutral	the flowers were lovely but were delivered and left_outside the property .
neutral	any one could have taken them !!
neutral	!
neutral	the idea is fantastic but i gave my feedback to the company for the last two years but nothing has changed !!
neutral	i informed them that the carer `_s notes are rubbish , not informative and certainly not enough information on them to enable carer `_s delivering the sparkle , to expand on the information to make the session last longer .
neutral	i have subscribed now for four years and have found thet the each year is repeated with just date changes .
neutral	easy to use website but for a first time puppy owner slightly_confusing .
neutral	i was looking for worming_tablets suitable for a 0 month_old puppy weighing in at just over 0kgs and came_across some worming_tablets which seemed to be what i was looking - wrong !
neutral	i had read all the blurb and it mentioned puppies and the weight / dosage ratio so i put my order in and encountered my first problem .
neutral	when the online checker came up to ascertain that they were the right tablets there was no problem entering my puppy '_s weight of 0kg ( see ps for my other gripe ) and amazingly my order was accepted .
neutral	well , only amazing in light of the fact that i later found a message on my voice - mail telling_me that the tablets were not suitable for a dog of 0 kgs in weight .
neutral	what ?
neutral	how could i have got through the online checker ?
neutral	not a problem to ring back and get a refund but why have an 0000 number ?
neutral	i really object to companies employing this method of making extra money from their customers and would not have rung except i wanted to get the matter resolved .
neutral	so a thumbs_up for some aspects of petsupermarket but a big_thumbs down for the bits that are not up to scratch .
neutral	ps the age box on the online checker does not allow you to put months in .
neutral	i have used this company before and been very pleased with all_aspects .
neutral	however on this occasion the delivery was far from satisfactory , not the companys fault but fault lies with courier
neutral	love the target deals , but i don_'_t love the organization of the site .
neutral	if a dress comes in 0 colors , why do i need to search for each entry separately ?
neutral	why can '_t i see all options at once ?
neutral	makes it a bit frustrating to navigate , but the prices do make it worth it ...
neutral	pros_: ordering process efficient ; prompt arrival of plants ; large and lovely creamy white colour .
neutral	cons_: very disappointed to see one bloom already wilted and dying ; plants are just beyond their best and are unlikely to last as long as one would normally expect orchids to live .
neutral	regretfully then , i would not use this firm again .
neutral	the order arrived promptly but the shampoo had leaked and the dispenser on the conditioner does not work .
neutral	we have used betterbathrooms twice_now , and both_times we have been happy with the products .
neutral	good value for money .
neutral	however , this second time i received an order the driver was quite_abrupt .
neutral	he had taken the order to a similar address , but with a different post_code .
neutral	i asked if he had the post_code , to which he replied he didn_'_t need it as he knew where the address was .
neutral	on explaining where exactly we were and that he was at the wrong_address initially , he became very abrupt and not at all friendly .
neutral	on delivering the order he was again very abrupt and unfriendly in his manner .
neutral	maybe a bit of training in customer service would not go_amiss .
neutral	i ordered my sunglasses using a groupon_voucher .
neutral	i had received an order confirmation but no confirmation of the dispatch .
neutral	i would have been fine with late delivery if someone had let_me know that there has_been a delay .
neutral	instead the shop has just kept quiet .
neutral	after i sent them an enquiry i found out that due to a " mistake " my sunglasses were out of stock and delivery will be delayed .
neutral	they promised to let_me know when the item is in stock but informed me my glasses are on their way only after i sent them another message enquiring_about my order .
neutral	the good thing was they were always quick to respond and the glasses that finally arrived are as pictured and i love them !
neutral	i am very pleased with the service and would have ordered more tiles however the sample i ordered was white however was actually off white and therefore it didn_'_t match the rest of my tiles .
neutral	i would be interested in getting a colour_match and then i would make a bigger order .
neutral	very good way looking for holiday , lots of choice and informative , except the hotel booking did not mention if breakfast was included on special_offer .
neutral	flowers we a birthday_gift and i am told they were lovely .
neutral	delivery prompt but incorrect order as rather_than including the birthday card selected and paid for a sorry card was delivered and sorry written all over the box took the shine off the gift and left my elderly_mother confused .
neutral	sent an_email but received no communication back so far .
neutral	would have ha 0_stars if had fulfilled order correctly .
neutral	item arrived fine but it took 0 - 0_days just to dispatch and was needed urgently
neutral	if says ' free delivery ' on orders over_£_00 .
neutral	i spent over_£_00 and was charged for delivery .
neutral	you need to look at this or i won_'_t be ordering for this site again .
neutral	each time i edited the time / date of my tickets , looking for the cheapest tickets , i had to go back to number of adults , and category , as it went back to the original 0 adult , and i wanted tickets for 0 seniors .
neutral	at first i couldn_'_t figure_out what was happening but eventually twigged and got a satisfactory result .
neutral	this needs to be ironed_out though .
neutral	they delivered mt watch very quickly & it was exactly as it looked online would use them again
neutral	quite happy with the hoover , not so happy having to wait for the delivery they had mr address and post_code , but couldn_'_t be bothered to find us , because it was the end of the day it was delivered the day after , after the phone_call for directions i should have had the day before !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i called twice i emaild you and you did not have the curtesy to reply to either of my messages there should be some one there to answer peoples problems
neutral	my cashback didn_'_t track at first , but it was eventually sorted .
neutral	i am now waiting for it to clear into my paypal_account .
neutral	speedy delivery but the packaging wasn_'_t strong_enough and the product leaks .
neutral	they should double wrap the item before putting it in a jiffy_bag or use a stronger packaging such as a box
neutral	i bought a new mobile contract and was pleased to learn i would get £_00 cash_back from this website .
neutral	unfortunately what i didn_'_t know was that i must have accidentally signed_up for a premium account that i did not want which would cost me £ 0 a year .
neutral	for the amount of spend i do with topcahback it was not worth the extra fiver but it has taken me days to find out how to log a request with them .
neutral	they ought to mke it a bit simpler for us ' oldies ' to navigate the site .....
neutral	only one bad thing did not get money till next_morning as the rep never sent statements but did get money in the end
neutral	my phone order with betterbathrooms was excellent but delivery slot was not good as i was not contacted by the courier and was not in to accept delivery and have the 00 minites to check over my order .
neutral	i think the prices and ease of ordering are excellent , but on this occasion the delivery time was far too long and communication from feelgood about the delay took_ages to come through .
neutral	i will order again , but hope the delivery time will be as good as it has_been in the past .
neutral	i have asked several_times about the elimis tri - enzyme resurfacing serums ( there is more than one since i have 0 different_kinds ) and i either get told there is only the one or that there are 0 .
neutral	while the 0 is great , i still don_'_t know which one is called tri - enzyme resurfacing serum 0 and 0 .
neutral	it seems that the people in customer service don_'_t either .
neutral	otherwise i love the product .
neutral	just wish i could find what i '_m looking for .
neutral	great idea for a business but wait a long time for payment from most companies and have had a lot of problems with tracking ( whilst you can submit claims if they do not track automatically payments take ridiculous lengths of time ).
neutral	flowers are always beautiful but i have had some bad_experiences .
neutral	flowers arrived on time , but without message .
neutral	when the recipient tried to call for the message , they had to wait an_hour for the response .
neutral	very poor .
neutral	i have had excellent care , with your customer_care team , although lately it seems items are taking a long time to get to customer and i have had an increase in damages which i am surprised at ..........
neutral	i am getting a little fed_up with the amount of damages i left my hermes because of there lack of care with parcels i just hope you guys dont go the same way as i have found your service to be excellent in the past .
neutral	the shop staff need to be careful who they moan to when i come , one assistant slated me to my partner obivously she did not realise he was my partner , i was not happy also keep getting told by one member off staff that i should take my parcels somewhere_else if i am going to bring them in late .
neutral	sorry if i sound like i am moaning .
neutral	excellent service in the past a few things not so great right now but sure you will get it sorted xx
neutral	see above comment
neutral	additional stops were added after booking and therefore the journey took longer .
neutral	no notification email issued
neutral	why oh why would a website let you go all the way through an order , without_any indication that '_s its not in stock , until after you have paid ?
neutral	deeply annoying , especially when the item is for a gift for a child .
neutral	i got a pleasant email almost_immediately ( automated ???)
neutral	but then absolutely no further communication until a despatch_notification almost a month later .
neutral	that '_s pretty rubbish really .
neutral	.
neutral	great seating for bruce springsten concert .
neutral	unfotunately when tickets arrived the face value of the tickets was £_00 . 00 x 0 but with all the add on '_s we ended_up paying over_£_000 . 00 .
neutral	this kind of mark up is unacceptable and we will therefore not be using your site in the future .
neutral	had to chase_up where my order was .
neutral	had a quick response .
neutral	hope it will now be delivered soon , but as its taken a while we will be on holiday , so i am having to make arrangements for someone_else to take the delivery for me .
neutral	disappointed to get a message asking for a review even before the goods have arrived .
neutral	i will update my review upon_receipt .
neutral	i actually work in a bike shop and i only ordered something from you guys as you had it in stock and i couldn_'_t get it off upgrade cycles .
neutral	i ordered it using my iphone which was a little tedious but i got there .
neutral	the communication after ordering etc was excellent and kept me in the loop .
neutral	i wasn_'_t however impressed when the parcel was sent with anc who refuse to leave a parcel anywhere and took it back to penrith which is an hours drive_away !
neutral	the parcel wasnt large so why it couldnt go with rm i dont_know !
neutral	i even left a note to the driver to say leave it on my doorstep .
neutral	i live in the middle of nowhere , noone is going to steal it !
neutral	unable to have stuff delivered to my work address i had to try contact them outside of work to have it delivered at another date .
neutral	they never answered the phone so resorted to a sharp email which attained my desired_result and i finally got what i needed !
neutral	great website with great communication but your courier has ensured i will not buy from you again .
neutral	rant_over !
neutral	the buds died before opening very disappointing delivery very good not much for the money
neutral	so i ordered a scratching_post and some food .
neutral	the scratching_post was in perfect_condition and packed very well , the food however ... awful !!
neutral	it was opened and over half the packet spilled out into the box , in my house and some out on the street .
neutral	as there was small gaps in the box either end , the food dropped out .
neutral	had it been sealed correctly i could have just popped the food back into the bag and it would have only fell into the box , but even then a bag of food shouldn_'_t be packed away opened !
neutral	i was left with 0 / 0 of a bag .
neutral	i won_'_t be ordering food from them again nor litter unless you want you stuff spilled everywhere .
neutral	they have to learn to pack it correctly !!!
neutral	!
neutral	however they issued me a refund for the food , i did ask for a packet to be sent out by they refused for ' logistic reasons '.
neutral	pethetic excuse .
neutral	generally i was quite pleased with the outfit ; it was good quality , lasted the evening , arrived on time ...
neutral	my only_negative is that there was a white trim on the bottom of the skirt in the photo and when i received it , there was no trim .
neutral	it also made the dress too short to wear ...
neutral	next time i would ensure that i emailed to ask exactly_what came with the outfit .
neutral	i was initially disappointed when i did not receive a reply to an_email with a query re my order .
neutral	then , as the website says that , when collecting in person , " please call us on + 00 ( 0 ) 0000 000000 to ensure goods are available and a member of staff will be present to assist you ", i did so on the day before i wanted to collect .
neutral	the staff_member sounded surprised at my call and said i could come any time " as long as it is before 0pm " and made me feel_stupid for ringing .
neutral	i also asked if physique was easy to find and was told , " not really .
neutral	look on google ", which was really unhelpful .
neutral	when i arrived in the road the next_day , i was unable to find the premises .
neutral	i telephoned and a friendlier staff_member gave_me directions and said , " see you in a couple of minutes ".
neutral	no - one was waiting when i arrived 0 minutes later .
neutral	a sign says to ring a bell and someone will come .
neutral	i rang this bell 0 times then , after nearly 00_minutes , phoned the office and eventually someone arrived .
neutral	this was very poor customer service .
neutral	a map and / or detailed directions on the website would be very useful - and more helpful staff , too !
neutral	found dates and times we wanted , great !
neutral	only to see that when confirmation came through it had changed our return to a day earlier , making very difficult for us .
neutral	rang travelup immediately who then wanted to charge us £_000 to put right date on .
neutral	explained we had chosen from their set dates and not my error .
neutral	agent has promised to ring back in 00mins with maybe correction , i do hope so .
neutral	let '_s see !!
neutral	!
neutral	i went on to price my holiday and i went and spoke to my husband about it . so i decided to book it and when i went back on the holiday had went up 00 pounds in the space of 00_minutes feeling confused .
neutral	everything straightforward until final stage when -‘ sending booking & card_details - will take up to 0 minutes ’ came on the screen .
neutral	forty_minutes later i was still_waiting .
neutral	had an_email thanking_me for visiting site & if i '_d experienced problems to email them .
neutral	sent email , including phone number but had no response .
neutral	rang number on email & got automated_voice saying that due to eu legislation the number had changed to ....
neutral	this was so fast i had to ring again to get the number down .
neutral	finally spoke to lauren , who was brilliant .
neutral	she could find no record of initial booking or my subsequent email .
neutral	however , she cheerily & efficiently dealt_with my booking & assured me that if we discover we have paid twice just to let them know .
neutral	you cannot_beat the personal_touch .
neutral	thanks lauren !
neutral	thank_you for your prompt service , but i had ordered solpadine max tablets and received solpadine migrane instead .
neutral	quick , easy to use .
neutral	so , we got on the bus for the full red_tour and had a great first 00_minutes with an affable and knowledgeable guide .
neutral	on changeover at marble_arch , we got a guide who clearly did not want to be there , constantly told us that everything was closing for the day and gave no extra interesting information !
neutral	day 0 we had great guides again and the staff at the stops also were extremely_helpful ... nothing too much_trouble .
neutral	a shame that one member of the team was not up to the high_standard of the rest of them !
neutral	my product came very quickly but was most disappointed that the product was delivered as if it had just been picked off the shelf .
neutral	it was very unlucky that the person whom this christmas_present was for answered the door and could see exactly_what i '_d brought .
neutral	surely most products come in a normal brown cardboard_box .
neutral	if i had known it would come like this i would not have ordered it knowing my partner would be opening the door .
neutral	credit_card charge too much
neutral	multistorey carpark is convenient to the terminal and spaces are usually available with prebooking .
neutral	prices have gone up a lot recently though so taxis ( gbp 00 to the new town ) may be a better bet .
neutral	they charge for 00 hour periods so if your flight time is such that you are away for 00_hours you get to pay another tenner for the extra hour .
neutral	overall the property was adequate but tired hence the headline .
neutral	flowers were not delivered on right day .
neutral	however they did put chocs in . have nt heard from lady_who received them so don_'_t no if flowers were nice . when i orderd flower and put card_details in didn_'_t like that all my card_details were on show and not black dots .
neutral	i had to delete them didn_'_t feel that was secure
neutral	loved the boat , the cabin was fine nice and clean .
neutral	found the prices on the ship really over the top , even the shops were pricing there goods far to high . had dinner going and coming_back what we got was good enough but travelling with a chief even he thought the pricing was way of the mark .
neutral	had pre booked breakfast which was fine but a bit caotic .
neutral	the flowers looked beautiful and were very reasonably_priced .
neutral	however , they came with free chocolates which i didn_'_t want ,.
neutral	i unticked the box but on the next page it still said free chocolates .
neutral	i tried going back to delete the tick in the " free chocolates " but each time i moved on to the next page it was back again .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	however , on the good side they do offer - ' next_day delivery '.
neutral	i didn_'_t need it , but would come in handy if you had forgotten someone '_s birthday .
neutral	i can '_t comment on the service until i get feedback from the recipient .
neutral	christine foster .
neutral	found the gravy / sauce a bit thin ( especially in the pork and madeira product ).
neutral	quite tasty though .
neutral	enjoyed the thai_red curry !
neutral	i went to las_vegas this year with virgin ( direct ) and we all went economy class there and back but my brother went premium class on the way back only ...
neutral	i hate flying ... very nervous flyer ... so being stuck in a plane for 0 - 00_hrs in the most uncomfortable seats was not fun ... i would recommend save the money and travel in premium class all the way ...
neutral	my brother felt the difference and even offered to let_me sit in premium class for a bit to charm my nerves ...
neutral	the virgin flight staff are lovely and helpful ... but the space i found was not good enough for the price we paid for our flight ... go premium class ... well_worth it ... x
neutral	great website and choices .
neutral	delivery was wicket than i expected however i ordered a travel set and something had leaked in it ruining the lining of my new vanity case .
neutral	truly gutted as it was not cheap .
neutral	:-(
neutral	my order arrived today , packaged well .
neutral	all the order correct thank_you a * service
neutral	they need to up their game if they want to sell on the internet .
neutral	should be next_day delivery
neutral	was very impressed with the speed of delivery and the response when i informed you the dehumidifier was not working .
neutral	it now works , but one of the reasons i bought it was for the ability of continuous use but we did not get the hose connection , was this included in the price or do we need to buy separately ?
neutral	the sizes are shocking , my mum normally wears 00 , maybe 00 ( as some shops are different ) and she could just fit into a xl .
neutral	you are loosing out on so many customers .
neutral	and i had to pay nearly_£ 0 to return it !
neutral	six pounds !
neutral	but the delivery was good .
neutral	i bought a bottle of whiskey for my uncle over in belfast , a birthday_present .
neutral	i live in australia and thought it would be better to go direct to a company in the uk for this gift .
neutral	it was supposed to be delivered on the 00th of september as per what the online ordering system was telling_me , but did not arrive until the 00st of september .
neutral	i wanted it there that day , so it was a real_shame it wasn_'_t .
neutral	having said that , when it did arrive it was a fantastic gift .
neutral	beautifully_boxed and it was fairly_priced .
neutral	i would order again , but i would make_sure it was well in_advance .
neutral	i '_d also want to speak with someone there to confirm they can deliver as suggested .
neutral	ordered some contact_lens and to know faulk to lenstore they did what they was supposed to do .
neutral	it was the faulk of the post_office and not delivering my package when due and still have not have gotten it and guessing it is loss or taken . thanks to lenstore they are kind enough to sent out an replacement order and in hopes there will not be a problem with out postal service delivering it to my home .
neutral	not lenstore faulk
neutral	on arrival at the purple_parking building ... the order reference i was given - did not match the reference on the system .
neutral	give the lads at purple_parking credit where credit is due - they dealt_with the whole situation while we were away - by creating a new reference .
neutral	we were met promptly on return - and taken back to our waiting car .
neutral	00 out of 00 to purple_parking , stress_free parking .... won_'_t use again .
neutral	the flowers ( i '_m told are pretty ) although having seen a picture they are a bit wrinkled a creased from their long day in the van .
neutral	they also didn_'_t come with the food , that you would get on a 0 pound bunch from tesco .
neutral	they arrived to my friend at 0 . 00_pm , which is apparently within the t & c of serenata .
neutral	i think is too late , as i needed to tell my friend something was coming .
neutral	it was dark , she_lives_alone , and she may not have answered door .
neutral	bare this in mind if your order from them , it could be a late delivery .
neutral	also , given the flowers were dispatched at 00 am , they sat a long time in the van .
neutral	i would recommend not paying extra for deluxe , as from the photo , it didn_'_t seem like anymore flowers really .
neutral	all in all , the flowers were pretty , but i won_'_t be ordering from them again .
neutral	flowers were a little worse for wear when they arrived , late delivery and no flower food .
neutral	when you order professional flowers , you expect a step up from the shop bought .
neutral	similarly the delivery is part of the fun .
neutral	having to warn my friend they were coming , spoilt it a bit .
neutral	i would have given more stars but the product package was a bit bent .
neutral	i was a bit_dubious at how much_cheaper my mascara was than other amazon suppliers then when i went to a department_store i realised that it was the same price so i was no better off really .
neutral	we have ordered several_times from wineware in the past and always had good service .
neutral	however on this occasion they sent me the wrong wine_glasses twice .
neutral	the correct ones have now arrived over a week_later .
neutral	very pleasant lady in customer_services was helpful but still they managed to send the wring thing .
neutral	i suppose it is the christmas_rush .
neutral	i had to wait for my camera for over a month , when it finally arrived the seal was broken and the advertised 0gb card wasn_'_t included .
neutral	customer service was good , they sent me the card and said ' my box wasn_'_t sealed because they do random security_checks ', i am not sure i believe that .
neutral	i will not be using them again .
neutral	i ordered a bed for next_day delivery , but it didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	they claimed it had been delivered and signed for but it turned_out that wasn_'_t the case .
neutral	getting hold of someone to speak to was very tricky - i recommend always selecting ' sales ' if you want to speak to someone on the phone - but when i did , they were incredibly helpful and lovely .
neutral	the bed arrived in the second time frame we arranged , no problem .
neutral	part of it was snapped , but i decided to ignore that , and now it '_s up i '_m really happy with it .
neutral	not happy with the courier service .
neutral	not stayed till i answered the door , just_dumped at my front_door .
neutral	anyone could have walked off with them .
neutral	not left_securely ( even_tho they reported back that they were .)
neutral	didn_'_t get confirmation they had been delivered till 0am the next_morning .
neutral	( which woke me up ).
neutral	whilst the efficiency of the company was very good ie .
neutral	confirmation and delivery spot_on - we were somewhat disappointed with the quantity of flowers presented in the spray of flowers .
neutral	i got a lot of my information from the locl county_court .
neutral	a lot of my answers from quickie_divorce said - you need to ask your court !
neutral	!
neutral	considering you had 00days to return yr phone the free post bag didn_'_t arrive so had to send it off which cost me £ 0 . 00 which didn_'_t get refunded so the price if the refund was greatly_reduced to quote given , so i feel slightly duped
neutral	we were thinking if updating our bathroom and thought we would go into our local_store to check it out .
neutral	we picked_up a couple of brochures when we were in and just as well we did because most of the items we liked were not in the store .
neutral	so we came home and placed our order over the internet .
neutral	that was easy and then 0_days_later i got a call from homebase and it was automated and said to hang on the line till they put me through to an advisor , this was at teatime and i was trying to makethe dinner at the same time , the phone was on loud speaker and when i went to take it off loudspeaker i was disconnected .
neutral	i received another call the next_morning same thing they called me and then i had to wait for an advisor to become free .
neutral	when she was free she told me it was to dowith my delivery date and then said oh you will be called within 00_hours aboutthe delivery .
neutral	what a waste of their time and mine .
neutral	if they dont have agents free to take the call they shouldn_'_t be ringing customers .
neutral	i have now been given a delivery time between_0am to 0pm .
neutral	in this day and age surely they can tell you morning or afternoon .
neutral	this is ok for me on this occassion because i am backshift but it wouldn t always be convenient .
neutral	will just have to wait to see what_happens with the delivery .
neutral	i cant_fault the service given by mega_fancy_dress , they dispatched the items very quickly .
neutral	however the products themselves were cheap looking especially the headdress for the older childs costume .
neutral	it was not finished well and will have to make adjustments to it to make it look ok
neutral	i really thought i had ordered a bouquet of assorted flowers not just carnations
neutral	0ft green luxury xmas_tree - item no : fl - 0000
neutral	the finish to the tree itself is actually quite impressive .
neutral	however the base of the tree didn_'_t fit into the stand .
neutral	the finish of the metal was extremely rough to say the least & had to be filed down !!
neutral	!
neutral	the base of the tree had to be hammered down , just to get it into the stand - from which it won_'_t be coming out of ever again !
neutral	suffice to say , by the time the tree was finally erected & decorated - i had totally lost my xmas spirit .
neutral	folllowing a puncture the car was changed rather_than a new tyre fitted .
neutral	we lost 00_euros of fuel in the change over which the staff would not acknowledge .
neutral	therefore future patronage is in doubt .
neutral	the customer service team via_email were great .
neutral	delivery was super_fast .
neutral	only problem was that the frame on one of the pairs i received wasn_'_t what i ordered .
neutral	on the home_trial , i got a pair of ' tortoise_shell ' frames , however despite ordering that shade , i received a black frame .
neutral	other than that , great service and i would definitely use again !
neutral	soft bags with heavy tins on top , result split bags with feed everywhere .
neutral	customer_services did sort it out quite quickly
neutral	i really do hope zen_bedrooms reads these comments ; judging_by the comments i '_ve found online from other people , a recurring issue is your delivery process .
neutral	this doesn_'_t seem to have been fixed at all , as i had exactly the same problem .
neutral	i ordered my mattress and received a confirmation_email_stating " once your package ships we will send an_email with a link to track your order ."
neutral	great , fine .
neutral	a few_days_later , i received an_email_saying my shipment was ' being prepared ' and that " this means your order has left our warehouse to our courier facility and you will receive the tracking code for your order within a week ."
neutral	00 days_later , when i still hadn_'_t had a tracking code , i emailed zen_bedrooms to enquire and john replied the next_day to say they were still_waiting for it from the shipping company , and that " the tracking code will give you an expected delivery date so that you can be at home to receive your order ".
neutral	so far , still so good ( though later than i '_d been told ).
neutral	0_days_later ( so 0_weeks after the email i got saying i '_d get the code within a week ), i received an_email ( two emails , in fact ) giving me my tracking_number and saying " your tracking code will show an expected delivery date ."
neutral	but when i followed the link in the email ( weird series of stages to finally reach the xdp express website ) and put in my tracking code , there was no delivery date at all and it just said " no status data ".
neutral	i emailed zen_bedrooms as i was worried in case it despatched as i needed to make arrangements to be at home , especially as i wasn_'_t actually living at the property yet ( no mattress ...).
neutral	i also rang the next_morning and spoke to james who said it should have been picked_up for delivery the day before ( hence the email about tracking ) but it hadn_'_t been but it would ' probably ' be delivered the next_day .
neutral	james rang me back later to confirm this , which was helpful , but that was all i had to go on .
neutral	i had to make hasty arrangements to be at home all day the next_day ( luckily i have a flexible job but in many jobs that would be difficult ).
neutral	in the end , there was still absolutely nothing on the xdp express website until 00_minutes before my delivery turned_up !!
neutral	!
neutral	so if i hadn_'_t been concerned and contacted zen_bedrooms the day before , that is the ridiculous_amount of notice i '_d have been given about my delivery .
neutral	there '_s no way i could have got back in time if i '_d have been out anywhere .
neutral	this is clearly no way to run a delivery service , and as i said , seems to be a common problem with zen_bedrooms deliveries .
neutral	surely zen_bedrooms realise that the many negative_comments about their delivery system reflects very badly on them ?
neutral	the mattress seems lovely ( haven_'_t had chance to try it yet as i '_m still not in the flat properly ) and it did arrive in the time_slot given , but there '_s no point giving a time_slot with only 00_minutes notice !!
neutral	i '_d think_twice about ordering again because of the very poor delivery service .
neutral	i '_ve had good customer service and excellent results from albelli , but my mum recently tried to make a photobook using a amazon_local deals voucher and it was a complete_nightmare .
neutral	she couldn_'_t upload the book for some reason , and had to call and chase numerous_times before she was given a link to upload it .
neutral	then she had to call several more times to get the web link to put her voucher_code in , despite_being told by several different customer service reps that they were definitely sending it .
neutral	it took a couple of weeks to get it all sorted , which was ridiculous .
neutral	so while my experience has_been good i '_m very annoyed by all the trouble my mum had to go through , especially as she '_s not that computer - savvy and just needed your customer service reps to do what they said they would .
neutral	this policy seems ok but i haven_'_t had cause to make a claim on it so it '_s hard to tell .
neutral	we have had a problem with the home emergency policy - following a loss of power in the kitchen the appointed agents appear to have used their subsequent access to us as customers in order to exploit the emergency situation - wanting to inflate the cost of the required part by over 000_%.
neutral	the job was subsequently left incomplete because we refused to pay the residue of the parts cost after the £_000 parts allowance was exceeded .
neutral	we '_ll see how this works out before passing final opinions
neutral	product was excellent and very good value , but delivery poor .
neutral	paid for next_day delivery before 0 . 00 which was £_00 .
neutral	was not delivered before 00 and then a note was pushed through the door sometime after 00 to say they were there at 0 . 00 !!!
neutral	when i rang to query this they were very unhelpful and did not redeliver for another 0_days .
neutral	having used other photo_book sites i found this one quite easy to use .
neutral	however upon_receipt of the book i was slightly_disappointed with the quality of the book considering the price i had paid .
neutral	not sure if i will use this site again unless there are special_offers on .
neutral	placed order for dockers .
neutral	they didn_'_t arrive next_day as promised .
neutral	sent shirty e_- mail to end and a friendly northern chap_called me on saturday_morning to try and sort_out delivery problem .
neutral	trousers arrived monday_afternoon .
neutral	great !
neutral	!
neutral	the flowers shown on the website that i thought i was ordering looking nothing like the flowers that were received .
neutral	hatched is one of the least expensive estate_agents , but their service is limited .
neutral	i chose to write the property description and supply the photos for the on - line brochure , frankly because the first_attempt by hatched was not up to the standard i wanted .
neutral	advertising was as good as any estate_agent , and i was more than happy to show prospective_buyers round myself .
neutral	having sold the property , hatched went very quiet indeed until we exchanged contracts .
neutral	the only time i ' phoned them to ask for an update and to see if they could move things forward , they referred me to my solicitor but said they would follow_up .
neutral	they never did .
neutral	i feel as if the payment i '_m due to make was purely for advertising on the web ; other services were very limited .
neutral	disappointed .
neutral	i placed 0 separate_orders and each order arrived with too few envelopes , and i expected after having spent a lot of money on orders these to be provided
neutral	didn_'_t find out until i '_d got to the end of the process that i would have to take my parcels to another location to be picked_up .
neutral	the first time i traded with zapper they picked_up the parcels from my home so i had thought it would be the same .
neutral	i had to wait longer_than they said for my cheque and emailed to see what what was going on .
neutral	prompt response to email that said cheque was in post and i received it a couple of days_later .
neutral	good website and a easy to place order .
neutral	live_chat was great as i needed to change the delivery address .
neutral	quick and easy .
neutral	flowers that i had delivered looked nothing like what i ordered due to substitution .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t of know normally but i was there when they were delivered .
neutral	on then making a complaint about my order it took 0_days to resolve as i did not receive an_email they had sent .
neutral	on that live_chat i filled in my question details and order number for the operator to then ask me my order number again after 00_mins .
neutral	i was then told they would check the info i had sent .
neutral	after nearly ' 0 hour ' on live_chat i get offered a £ 0 gift voucher .
neutral	i may use the service again but i would be worried of what flowers would be received after i had ordered a certain one .
neutral	ordered ilumi products after receiving a discount_code from coeliac magazine , enjoying them thoroughly as a uni student ( being ultimately lazy ) i like being_able to have a decent gluten_free ready_meal quickly and efficiently
neutral	i love the idea and majority of them have been good
neutral	however unfortunately i had the cardamom_chicken the other night and despite enjoying it whilst eating it after i suffered with some unwanted illness , both me and my boyfriend shared it and found ourselves with crunching stomache aches and symptoms similar to food_poisoning .
neutral	i was promised £_00 of ocado vouchers with my purchase .
neutral	i have phoned twice and emailed but still no vouchers ...!
neutral	good prices but slow delivery , will use again
neutral	having already reviewed my experience of buying a car with car shop , and praising them highly , i would like to post my thoughts on their aftercare , which is not proving to be so good .
neutral	" get £_00 for recommending a friend ".
neutral	my friend recommended me , we submitted all the relevant_paperwork , he then received a letter saying that they had no record of his purchase ( he '_d only bought his car 0_weeks previously ).
neutral	so he had to go in and sort this out in person .
neutral	we ' re still_waiting for the cheques .
neutral	then , checking my email box , a message from carshop : " we notice you haven_'_t submitted a review yet .
neutral	earm £_00 shopping vouchers ."
neutral	well , not only had i submitted a review the day after my car purchase , i '_d received a reply so someone had noticed i '_d done it !
neutral	but no shopping vouchers .
neutral	come on , carshop - this is basic level stuff , probably sorted by a decent computer program somewhere .
neutral	have used stressfreeparking several_times in the past and have always been very pleased with the service i received .
neutral	this time when i got my car home and unloaded my luggage i went to put the folded - down seats back up and was a bit upset to find that someone had decided to put the seatbelts into the locks and this caused huge ridges in my seats .
neutral	why would this need to be done ?
neutral	was my car used ?
neutral	i ordered the cream version but received the black one .
neutral	had torn the box open to get it out before i noticed .
neutral	they would have replaced it but the nice weather would prob have been over by then .
neutral	item is ok for the money .
neutral	i just want to talk to someone about my order and first there is this automated_voice and then when you do get through to someone they cannot help you .
neutral	apparently it is now with the admin_team and i still can '_t sort_out my delivery .
neutral	i just wanted to reduce the order a little .
neutral	the coffee is good and the price also .
neutral	but i '_m worried_about what '_s happening to my expensive nespresso_machine .
neutral	fine_coffee co . say that their capsules are suitable for nespresso , but i have to force and hol down the leaver to release the coffee .
neutral	i hope this is not damaging my machine as i will have no comeback from nespresso under my guarantee .
neutral	i have ordered an iron on labels a few_years_ago and the print was fantastic .
neutral	this time in sept_0000 , print was just about ok .
neutral	it was very thin and not sure how long will it last through the constant washing of school clothes .
neutral	i was a bit disappointed compare to great print first time ....
neutral	i have used this company on several_occasions before and have been very happy with the flowers delivered and the service .
neutral	this time i was very disappointed with the quality of the flowers .
neutral	a little swapping around with job times needed as the fitter had a machine breakdown , no contingency plan in place so he had to wait for assistance , shame .
neutral	at_least i was kept_informed .
neutral	the fitter was very nice , most polite .
neutral	he did seem to race through the job , and as a result one of my hubcaps didn_'_t last the 0 minute journey home ( although it had managed to stay on my car for the 0 years before that quite nicely )
neutral	no issue with getting a replacement , apology received and i was told it would not be a problem , but it took 0_days and 0 phone_calls to get it replaced .
neutral	reasonable service at a good price , but perhaps if a little more time and care was taken it would be better .
neutral	delivery was late and measurement info was not accurate as medium was a bit on the . small side , could have done with the large .
neutral	even taking into account christmas and new year i should have received my order by now , but unfortunately i '_m still_waiting .
neutral	it should be delivered to my work address and i '_m now on annual_leave for a week so have had to buy another supply of dog_food .
neutral	i dutifuly applied the tsa approved locks to each of my two cases .
neutral	when the luggage arrived from cleveland , tn to ft . lauderdale fl one lock was totally missing and the second so badly bent it can never again be used .
neutral	any suggestions ?
neutral	good , but i '_m jealous of the movie deals from orange at the moment
neutral	i use serenata every time i need to send flowers .
neutral	on this occasion i was not_overly_impressed , which may or may not be the fault of serenata .
neutral	the box that the flowers arrived in was quite badly_damaged which wasn_'_t the best first_impression to my colleague_who '_s flowers they were ( a birthday_gift ).
neutral	the feedback was that the chocolates were tasty , the flowers were pretty ( though not as spectacular as appeared on the image ).
neutral	just the box .
neutral	quite disappointing actually
neutral	love the phone and love orange wednesday but hate the website .
neutral	hard to log on and look at your stuff , improve your website orange !
neutral	i love my purchases but did have to get the superglue out for my stud details on hi tops .
neutral	the disclaimer letter i think was to warn me of this ..... despite this boots fab and have been worn many_times already .
neutral	have recommended to a friend already .
neutral	service was great and shoes delivered quickly with good updates however wrong_size was delivered and the company was at fault otherwise 0_stars would have been given !
neutral	as i couldn_'_t find the colour of shoes for my little_girl anywhere_else i had to purchase another pair ( refund would not be given until wrong_size returned ) and a simple exchange was not an option .
neutral	delivery was upgraded to next_day as a token gesture which was fine .
neutral	otherwise i was happy with the service and will use the company again .
neutral	learn your sizes please !
neutral	!
neutral	millys offers excellent prices but delivery is very slow .
neutral	no next_day service and you will be waiting a fortnight at_least for your goods .
neutral	don_'_t use if you want your goods quickly but if not in a rush worth the wait .
neutral	i purchased it in sale cheshire at the end of october and by end of december it seemed to no work .
neutral	there is a sign in the shop window saying no returns !
neutral	the package provided is a good safety_net to keep an eye on clients and potential_clients .
neutral	i certainly helps when quoting new work to be able to see if they are credit worthy etc .
neutral	however the one thing that has always rattled me is the chase chase chase if only a few_days over due on making the 0 monthly payment , if its not an_email its a letter if not a letter then its a phone_call .
neutral	surely if they credit checked us then they would see that we are creditworthy !!
neutral	just busy busy busy ......
neutral	only_complaint would be about leg on bed keep falling_off had go asda buy tools to fix so it stay on . did u send different mattress from what i order ?
neutral	after ordering by phone , and paying £_00 . 00 , the correct price , i expected the delivery of 0 x 000 zilkene .
neutral	they arrived well_packed and very quickly .
neutral	however , i actually received a large package containing 00 x 000 packs .
neutral	being an honest old lady , i rang pet_supermarket to tell them of the mistake , and arrangements were made for the surplus to be collected from me .
neutral	having saved the company almost £_000 , 00 , i felt aggrieved that the girl i spoke to didn_'_t even say thank_you to me for my honesty , until i reminded her .
neutral	she did say that she intended to , but obviously had not , as the call had got to the stage of saying goodbye , without_any mention of gratitude until i said it would have been nice to have been thanked .
neutral	i ordered online and expected to get an_email_telling_me when i could collect from store .
neutral	however , no email and i eventually emailed them to ask if there was a problem .
neutral	the reply from homebase said that the item was in store , awaiting_collection !
neutral	when i collected it today , the assistant said they had tried to phone me .
neutral	no phone_call at this end , and if i had been out they didn_'_t leave any message on the machine .
neutral	i ordered 0 small badges at a cost of £ 0 . 00 each .
neutral	unfortunately there was only 0 option for delivery which was £ 0 . 00 !!!
neutral	i received the badges within 0 working_days but would have liked a cheaper delivery option , ie_: 0st_class_post !
neutral	customer service has_been great as i had a few issue and they were always_willing to help me out .
neutral	would use again and for different items and recommend to friends .
neutral	i had the pleasure to talk to laura regarding my shoe order which wasn_'_t delivered .
neutral	even_though we had moments where in i was really on the end of my rope , she did manage to make_sure that i won_'_t really lose my cool .
neutral	she did everything she can to find out what happen to the delivery .
neutral	i even spoke with her this morning just to follow it up and she made sure that they will send my package again as soon as possible . there was no problem with the staff but i can '_t say about the delivery service .
neutral	the price was really good but the time almost six days to get to me
neutral	means i may not always use the company as often as i would like
neutral	i have left special instructions for both orders i have made with serenata_flowers and both_times have been ignored .
neutral	i put timings on the special instructions to say deliver after a certain time .
neutral	however the flowers have got to the right people anyway , so i will still use the service again .
neutral	ordered a bouquet of flowers , a box of fudge and a vase totalling over_£_00 - delivered on time but the vase was missing !
neutral	immediately contacted their website and complained by the next_morning i was refunded the money for the vase - but i was still embarrassed that the item is paid for wasn_'_t included to display the bouquet in !
neutral	dissapointing and stressfull just hope the flowers are as lovley as they look when they do arrive .
neutral	order a couple of item , got them ok , they never take too long but yeah but , the thing is , order both item same times to save money , and they charge twice for deliver never happy with that .
neutral	got my order in 0 to0 days .
neutral	i booked through this site before viewing others and sadly i paid more but transaction went_smoothly .
neutral	hello , my name susanay recently ordered it , buy two pencil type brushes and i am very happy with them , i also buy ss000deluxe flat bronzer the use for bronzing powders and highly pigmented blushers and it '_s going great and is super soft , but i also buy bk00badger flat bronzer and fatal , i am very unhappy with this brush because i scratch a lot , it '_s super rough and even_though i wash as usual , is not soft and do not use it because i click on the face of the rough that is my opinion es . esta hope you serve something .
neutral	see you soon
neutral	over all the whole_experience of buying a sofa at dfs was rather disappointing .
neutral	had a problem with delivery and the sales_person was not too helpfull when i went back to store 0nd time to buy some matching cushions .
neutral	not the best customer service i have ever received .
neutral	the items weren_'_t ready to dispatch when i ordered them which wasn_'_t advertised .
neutral	i had to wait over 0_weeks for their delivery .
neutral	at no point did i lack trust in them but service was slow .
neutral	overall not too bad , pricing very competitive compared with royal_mail , delivery times excellent , my collection agent is great , it '_s just a great shame that no matter_how well you pack some things , they get beaten within an inch of their lives and the usual cop - out is applied with regards to so - called exempted items when complaining !
neutral	a bit more care with packages and this company would stand_out way above the rest
neutral	product is good just missing links in communication between staff and clients .
neutral	fitting quite rushed and finishing off could have been better
neutral	first order delivered on time and correct_address
neutral	second order arrived on time - delivered to 0 croft road , wallingford , ox00 0hh as per paperwork ......... following phone_call from delivery driver i collected items .
neutral	hi_mate looked on deal checker , not quite got me the deal im looking for , want all_inclusive from london , majorca , tunisia , or turkey , been on lowcostholidays and onthebeach and there coming out a bit cheaper , so if they come_back with a good deal for 0th of sept to the 00th there get the booking
neutral	keep in touch
neutral	debbie xxxx
neutral	i knew i would have to " iron out some wrinkles " from the packaging but i was so disappointed to discover that whoever put the linings into my curtains didn_'_t bother to press the seams .
neutral	as it was the more_expensive choice that i made so i thought i could at_least expect a more_expensive finish .
neutral	otherwise i was very pleased with the quality of my choice .
neutral	i probably would shop with bedeck again but possibly not for curtains .
neutral	when i tried to set_up the account to pay , i kept getting a mesage that my email address already exists !
neutral	i had not previously set_up an account but only signed_up for the newsletter .
neutral	in the end i had to request a change of password , even_though i '_d never set one up in the first place .
neutral	not a good start , i hope nothing else goes_wrong ..
neutral	was disappointed in the order initially as the baby flower gift was dropped and broken on delivery .
neutral	however after a phone_call all was rectified and i would order again as i think flowers for mum and a single_rose for new baby is special and different .
neutral	i have a strong prescription so paid_extra for think lenses .
neutral	they turned_out really well and i can see perfectly .
neutral	however the glasses frames doesn_'_t my face properly .
neutral	i '_m a petite woman and these frames are been advertised to both men and women .
neutral	they ' re just too wide for my face and if i bend down to get something off the floor , they ' re likely to fall_off .
neutral	i asked an opticians about getting them resized to fit my face and he said it could be done but the frames might snap or break during the process .
neutral	really disappointed as i need a decent pair of glasses for work .
neutral	we had a good experience when ordering our invitations .
neutral	the invites arrive quicker_than_expected and where just what we were looking for .
neutral	we then ordered our order of service .
neutral	the order of service arrived later than_expected and had been printed in the wrong order making them unusable and they had to be binned .
neutral	this was very was very stressful for me with my expectations of bride and groom being high , i was surprised that no one checked the order of service before it was sent out .
neutral	i was incredibly disappointed and upset .
neutral	saying that , dana promised to have a new set printed and with me in 0_days which they were .
neutral	overall i think b_& g provides a good service with helpful staff , however i really think my stress could have been avoided if someone had only checked before dispatching .
neutral	not very happy with the service .
neutral	tried to cancel greeting_card the day after l put my order in , but was not allowed .
neutral	i cannot_believe they used a courier to deliver the flowers , if l had known that l would have used interflora .
neutral	would recommend glasses_direct but suggest careful monitoring and use of tracking which is a nuisance and takes time .
neutral	they offered a refund which did not materialise .
neutral	the product is excellent and i would probably use them again .
neutral	packages arrived on time and service online and via telephone was speedy .
neutral	the racking system engineering was not great with a lack of precision in the making .
neutral	this meant we had to spend a lot of time making things fit .
neutral	we got there in the end .
neutral	before my purchase was delivered i rang you to say i would like to purchase a more_expensive model however [_name_] informed me there was nothing she could do for me as the fire had gone to distribution surely you could have done something to stop the delivery . my telephone_call to you was on the saturday and the fire was not delivered till monday
neutral	i booked car_parking with skypark last night ( 0th_july_0000 ) and i kept checking my email to see if my confirmation_email was there , just so i could print this off in case i need it when parking my car .
neutral	i have the reference_number , what do you think , would that be enough .
neutral	booking was really straight_forward
neutral	booked to usa and got some good tickets , patient people , good prices , was generally very happy .
neutral	it was let_down by the insurance .
neutral	i got an annual_policy with them and needed to claim on another trip to france , a few_months later .
neutral	this was by coach to stansted , to france by ryanair and hire_car to the accommodation in france .
neutral	unfortunately i fell ill and the insurers sent a form that applied only to a package holiday and tour_operator , not to separately booked segments .
neutral	it was very , very hard to fill it out since it did not apply to the kind of trip i had taken .
neutral	but i got a medical certificate saying i '_d been too ill to travel and a letter from the french accommodation saying i hadn_'_t been able to come , and a note that the car_hire in france had not been used , but they still refused to pay out on the coach and ryanair because i couldn_'_t prove i hadn_'_t caught the coach to stansted and i couldn_'_t prove i '_d missed the ryanair flights .
neutral	my husband was booked with a different insurer and claimed for just the same things as me ( we each claimed 00_percent of the joint items ) but his claim was paid in full .
neutral	i am really out of pocket due to the inflexibility of this old_fashioned insurance offered by trailfinders and it has quite put me off them .
neutral	i would have thought they could get a more up to date and flexible insurance , and this definitely did not seem like a good deal to me .
neutral	small trophy was packaged in an_enormous cardboard_box with tons of foam - waste for you .
neutral	it was missing the figure from the top of the trophy .
neutral	when i rang to ask for the missing figure to be urgently sent the lady i spoke to ( lisa ) would not action my missing figure unless i emailed her .
neutral	this was very annoying .
neutral	why couldn_'_t she action it from my phone_call ?
neutral	figure did then arrive as promised the next_day .
neutral	brilliant service .
neutral	the staff always happy to help .
neutral	the customer contact center is better_than the instore service ant day .
neutral	the service in the blackpool store is not as good as preston - st georges as you are kept waiting for longer asthey never seem to have enough people on and the unit feels cramped .
neutral	well , i know it is nearly christmas but i placed an order on 00th_dec . it was not dispatched until 00rd .
neutral	dec . and obviously i do not have it yet .
neutral	i will not receive this until well after the new year i guess ---- less expensive but too long in delivery -- this is a supplement i need to take regularly for a health issue .
neutral	interestingly the payment was taken immediately from my card --- not good enough i think !
neutral	!
neutral	the product is as expected , however i paid for next_day delivery , got the text saying it was on the way but it didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	contacted customer_services , who were only barely helpful ( certainly didn_'_t make me feel like a valued_customer ).
neutral	disappointed .
neutral	i was happy with the outcome , but they rang me at work on a couple of occasions before the renewal date , which i didn_'_t need .
neutral	once my husband and i had agreed on the renewal policy , i was happy to speak to someone and they were ok .
neutral	most reviews are genuine but quite a number are suspect in my opinion .
neutral	trust your instinct when reading a review and judge by the language / grammar used and which group it represents i . e single , family , couple etc .
neutral	many youngsters use text language which is acceptable if it makes_sense and of course their opinions are valuable .
neutral	it '_s just that their expectations may not be the same as yours if you are middle_aged / elderly ..
neutral	some may have had one bad_experience and are set on giving a poor report as a result rather_than give an overall experience .
neutral	check the date of the review .
neutral	there may have been a change since it was written .
neutral	it '_s advisable to read old and new reviews as there could be a reason for an improvement or deterioration .
neutral	try to " read between the lines " if you can and build your_own opinion .
neutral	this website is great , you can see all the takeaway restaurants in your area and order online by viewing the menus and it '_s quick and easy to use .
neutral	however they do have a few kinks to iron out .
neutral	i ordered a chinese and and they took the payment twice , it took me a while to get sorted as they said it was only taken once and then blamed me saying i pressed the button twice , which i did t .
neutral	i saw the happy_puzzle advert in magazine with a reduction on price for the ' make your_own flower ' pack but offer had closed so had to pay full price £_00 . 00 and the same for the wax shapers .
neutral	in my opinion £_00 plus postage for these items was expensive for what they are .
neutral	the delivery was slow on one item but both arrived in the end .
neutral	will think_twice before i place another order and only if on offer .
neutral	ordered a pair of puma golf_trousers , but got to order confirmation page and the website seemed to freeze .
neutral	tried again , same thing happened .
neutral	no confirmation emails .
neutral	four days_later my parcel arrived with two_pairs of trousers that were identical !
neutral	glad i didn_'_t go for third time lucky !
neutral	!
neutral	i have just purchased a 00cm swiss gym_ball with free footpump .
neutral	i also ordered , in error at the time , a faster blaster dual action pump .
neutral	on first use the free footpump , although a little flimsy , did the trick .
neutral	however , a day later i realised i needed a bit more air in the swis gym_ball - when i tried to add more air , the free footpump was difficult to use and kept coming apart so i ended_up losing more air than i was putting in .
neutral	so , thank_goodness for the faster blaster dual action pump - a much_easier and more robust product .
neutral	this is my first swiss gym_ball and i am not entirely_sure about the quality yet - the plastic seems to be thinner in some places .
neutral	let '_s up it lives up to its name of being anti_- burst !
neutral	placed an order for 000 ( job no 000000 ) flyers arrived when said great , then placed another order for 0000 ( job order 000000 ) recieved an_email for invoice £ 0 , telephoned and asked why said it was the wording offering 00_%_off with the flyer , this was not mentioned on the original order ????
neutral	why not ?
neutral	you then hold me to the fact i will not recieve my order unless i pay the extra £ 0 , very bad service will look elsewhere in the future , bad communications .
neutral	item delivery time very late , love the item but waiting for missing part 0_weeks_later .
neutral	ordered a pair of platform_shoes , the money was taken and order confirmation received .
neutral	the next_day i received an_email_saying my order was out for delivery .
neutral	a few hours_later , i received another email_confirming a refund .
neutral	after_contacting boohoo , i was told that the shoes were actually out of stock .
neutral	however when looking on the website i was still able to add the same pair of shoes to my basket and given the option to pay for them when they were apparently out of stock .
neutral	however , boohoo customer_services were very apologetic and have offered me free delivery on my next order .
neutral	would use again , its just a shame about this particular order .
neutral	as a store you do not cater very well for women .
neutral	the clothing range is limited .
neutral	the delivery is not as fast as other stores online in my experience .
neutral	not made clear that i was buying a smaller_size , which makes the price very expensive for the oraldene .
neutral	paying postage on the top hurts even more .
neutral	still not received my goods . takes too long to deliver .
neutral	order went through apparently dispatched , had to ring to check after some time had passed .
neutral	dog_food lost in transit ?
neutral	we did need food quite urgently ran_out so spent far more than we needed .
neutral	the product was as_described , but until i got to check out i was not aware of the shipping_costs , which i thought were expensive .
neutral	this made the overall price of the bulbs very expensive compared with other_sites .
neutral	needless to say , i was very disappointed with this .
neutral	ordered rawandan coffee as had some ground beans rawandan coffee at a small coffee shop in brackley which was absolutely_delicious .
neutral	sadly this one did not live up to my expectations - plus the fact the capsule was too_big for my nespresso_machine .
neutral	after inserting the capsule , the lever would not fully close without applying much more pressure than i was comfortable with , and on looking at nespresso capsule vs fine_coffee_club it was obvious it was a larger capsule .
neutral	good priced coffee_capsules but not as good quality coffee / crema as nespresso .
neutral	delighted with the range of goods on offer from medicanimal , always excellent service , but every time i place an order , the reciept comes through email and unless i kill it immediately .. my pc crashes and i have to fiddle about to get back on - line !
neutral	despite this , i am happy to re - order , as the service is reliable with excellent comparable pricing .
neutral	reccommend - but do watch out your email in - box .
neutral	dieppe seaways seemed to be quite an old boat , certainly not as swish as the ones on the dunkirk crossing .
neutral	surprisingly for a french boat , the coffee would have been drinkable with some actual coffee in the cup .
neutral	however , the staff were very friendly and helpful .
neutral	0st choice have always come up_trumps in the past , but my recent request for a whole exhaust pipe for my 00 - year_old subaru met with silence , with only a couple of call from manufacturers of new catalytic converter parts , and a new exhaust system .
neutral	this is a bit of a worry , as i have relied on 0st choice for several_years .
neutral	the quality of the make up is ok but for the amount you get i really don_'_t think that it '_s worth the money .
neutral	i bought some flowers as a thank_you present to my mum .
neutral	when they arrived the card that i had paid an additional £ 0 . 00 for was wet for where the water that the flowers were packed in had obviously spilt over and also three of the stems of the flowers were dangling off .
neutral	disappointing .
neutral	it said packaged with care ... this might be true but they need to work on getting the delivery sorted_out because by the time they arrived at the destination the presentation was not great .
neutral	we were chased mercilessly for an answer on whether we would like to go_ahead with this .
neutral	emails and phone_calls were replied to straight_away with data fields contacting us constantly although we told them we will get back to them when we could .
neutral	once we had paid , we chased and chased information and got none .
neutral	finally , later than they said it would be ready , a new drive was returned to us .
neutral	we are really happy with the work and recovery , but think the customer service made it all seem a little weird .
neutral	great price so i purchased the sunglasses they took the payment then i got a message_saying they weren_'_t in stock offered me a refund but also said they could be here anything between 0 - 0_weeks i wasn_'_t left with much choice as my refund wouldn_'_t of gone back straight_away so i stuck with the order they did arrive within 0_weeks the delivery experience was great was able to track them all the way to me
neutral	i cannot_rate highly_enough the quality of the kitchen , great value for money and i am really pleased with the overall result .
neutral	unfortunately betta_living let themselves down with their service .
neutral	i originally ordered this kitchen in october , despite a survey being booked evidently the order wasn_'_t processed properly and no one turned_up .
neutral	after waiting in all morning i had to phone 0 times , given repeated promises of calls back then eventually told that no one was in to call me back and i had clearly been lied to previously !
neutral	i complained and the necessary work was done to process the order .
neutral	however the kitchen was then delayed but more frustratingly i was not kept_informed !
neutral	i had to chase repeatedly and i had to twice cancel my kitchen_fitter .
neutral	eventually the kitchen arrived and i am very happy with it however i am still_waiting a top up supply of cornice which i will be chasing for the third time on monday !
neutral	overall summary , fantastic kitchen , fantastic value for money but sloppy service .
neutral	sort our your service betta_living and you would have a great business here !
neutral	i bought tickets , could just about afford to buy them and then found a massive booking_fee and postage cost which didn_'_t show up till i '_d made the decision to buy !
neutral	should be advertised with the tickets .
neutral	but ; the tickets turned_up in good time and viagogo have some sort of guarantee ( i think ) that they ' re genuine .
neutral	sadly took over a week to arrive .
neutral	we were then on holiday and parcel was delivered with neighbours who are then reluctant to let us have it ........ not simply_supplement fault .
neutral	delivery fault .
neutral	says on packet :
neutral	delivery instructions : - do not leave outside of property ..... i have never given this instruction - had i known - instruction would have been do not leave at no 00 !
neutral	only received today !
neutral	whilst i am pleased with my purchase i would just like to say i '_m disappointed with
neutral	the customer service you try to phone and report that you would like a visit , because there is a problem on my new siute i '_m still_waiting a reply as to when they are coming
neutral	to look at it , and also the phone number you have to ring is premier number which is very expensive , so i am still_waiting to be contacted i have sent a picture with the problem and i am not impressed with the customer_services ,
neutral	the tiles are lovely and the price was good , but when we received the tiles a third of the tiles where broken both types of tiles i ordered .
neutral	i phoned the company and they said they would email a claim_form but i need the tiles to put on the wall .
neutral	its half finished not impressed .
neutral	the shoes arrived one week after my order and come beautifully_wrapped in their boxes as though no one else has tried them on .
neutral	i want to return one pair and am having a bit of trouble getting a returns_label as it was not in the parcel and they need to be sent back to denmark so i do not want them to get lost .
neutral	so my only_criticism would be that is a palaver to return something and that does put me off ordering on line again .
neutral	i ordered a lovely jacket which was xl as i am a size 00 ... it didnt fit at all !!
neutral	i took it back to the store only to be told i had to return on line or take a credit_note .... as none of superdry_jackets / coats fit me i didnt want to take a credit_note so my only option was to bag it up in its original package ( with lots of cello tape ) seek out the label again and find out where i could send it back to !!
neutral	and i thought on - line shopping was meant to be easy !!
neutral	other than that , the quality is v good :)
neutral	the dress was really lovely , i normally wear a size 00 but ordered a size 00 to give a bit more room as dressed do tend to be smsller online , but couldn_'_t do the dress up ....
neutral	very disappointed ...
neutral	thank_you
neutral	will be returning tomorrow
neutral	no acknowledgement of our order and bad communication over very long time , 0wks , taken to fill our order .
neutral	a good end product when received .
neutral	i personally would nt use them again , on the website it states to allow up to 00 days for them to receive items but after that it takes up to another 0_days for the items to be processed in the warehouse then you receive an_email asking to verify your bank details and states payment can take up to another 0_days .
neutral	i sent my items 00 days ago and still_waiting for my payment to be processed .
neutral	it all seems quite a lengthy time process !!
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a washing_machine just before christmas .
neutral	i am happy with the machine and the communication for the delivery ( eventually ) and it arrived within the time_scale once the date was set .
neutral	however , i was in desperate_need for the machine and appreciated it was the christmas_period with bank_holidays and was told a couple of times " you should hopefully get delivery on ..." due to my desperation with 0 small children and no washing_machine , i hung on to every word i was told so was disappointed when told " i don_'_t know why someone said that day as it won_'_t be coming then ".
neutral	the bank_holidays in between didn_'_t help so i was waiting nearly 0_weeks .
neutral	when i finally got a confirmation call for the delivery and the allotted_time it was spot_on .
neutral	the driver rang and said he would be 00_minutes and he was .
neutral	when i initially placed the order online i was given dates when deliveries would be in my area .
neutral	0 of the dates were within the next 0_days but when i contacted ultimate_appliances they didn_'_t have anyone in delivery so couldn_'_t tell me anything .
neutral	every time i rang i was on hold for 00 - 00_minutes .
neutral	i guess it was my hard luck that my old machine decided to nearly set on fire 0_days before christmas !
neutral	under normal working_days , i don_'_t think it would have been that long but then after_reading all the reviews , i '_m not sure !
neutral	got it now and caught up with washing so am relieved !
neutral	glasses arrived quickly but didn_'_t look the same as the picture and i didn_'_t get a glasses cloth .
neutral	booked a hotel in dubrovnik .
neutral	i didn_'_t like how the full price and credit_card charges were not shown upfront .
neutral	the confirmation_email never arrived , although if i log in i can see my booking .
neutral	good quality food .
neutral	no preparation which can be a bit boring if you like cooking .
neutral	i really only signed_up for 0_months because i get the 0th month free .
neutral	i would love to be able to buy just the dinners & buy my other meals as wanted .
neutral	sarah .
neutral	brilliant , i can see clearly without glasses for the first time in 00 years .
neutral	no more steamed_up glasses or fiddling with contact_lenses .
neutral	i '_m really happy with the initial service i received .
neutral	all went well until the follow_up appointments .
neutral	had 0 follow - up check and then the opticians in my town closed_down but no one let_me know and no calls were made to book further checks .
neutral	very disappointing , however pleased with the new eyes .
neutral	i have been a member of topcashback for years and have always sung their_praises , and recommended them .
neutral	however the last handful of transactions i have done via their site have not tracked , and from there it can take months to resolve , logging on and " nudging ", although this may be down to the merchants rather_than topcashback i would have liked to have seen more communication and updates in connection with their attempts .
neutral	i was looking for a suitable gift for my mothers_birthday who had recently_moved some 000_miles_away .
neutral	i wanted an arranged boquet and came_across serenta and after looking at some other website companies and local_florists felt that their picture which " shows standard arrangement " looked a very good size for the money .
neutral	along with a small cake i ordered the arrangement and requested that , if no one was home , the item was to be left in the back by the shed .
neutral	the box was left at the front of the property on view for all to see , and although my mom was very pleased with her flowers ( which stayed fresh for some time on a positive_note ) i visited a few_days after and saw the boquet myself and felt a bit embarrased at the size of it - a £ 0 bunch from the supermarket had more in , so felt their picture misrepresented the standard boquet .
neutral	website is easy to use , however i feel the delivery was expensive and the parcel took a while to be delivered .
neutral	on other_sites the delivery would be next_day for the same cost that preciouslittleone charge .
neutral	the items were packaged fine although i didn_'_t receive a delivery note , not sure if that is normal but seems unusual .
neutral	i ordered ( among other things ) some muslin squares and when they arrived they are a completely_different shade to the picture_shown on the website .
neutral	the site itself has a lovely variety of products and does have some good special_offers , it '_s only_downfall is the price of postage which means it '_s not actually as cheap as it looks when comparing total costs with other_sites .
neutral	i can '_t comment on service as i didn_'_t deal with anyone directly but after the order confirmation_email i had no more correspondence with anyone to indicate when my items would be delivered .
neutral	although they give you a tracking_number etc it doesn_'_t state an expected delivery date and there isn_'_t any indication of how long delivery takes which means you are likely to miss delivery as you can '_t wait in the house all day everyday just_incase .
neutral	you have suggested various_options which will provide a better service .
neutral	your recommendations are all rubbish since we are at the end of a bt copper wire about 0km from the exchange with no alternative optical or other cable .
neutral	it is therefore impossible for another service provider to offer a faster service .
neutral	you are providing misleading and false_information
neutral	wasn_'_t happy that i had to chase_up delivery twice .
neutral	it was for a ninetieth birthday_gift and i wanted the flowers to arrive on the day as a surprise .
neutral	as it was they arrived the day after and the recipient knew as i had asked if they had been a nice_surprise !
neutral	!
neutral	ordered some lovely cushions .
neutral	one colour was out of stock for 0_weeks so i expected to wait_until both colours were in stock before the items were dispatched .
neutral	we ended_up waiting 0 or 0_weeks before they were sent and we '_d made several phone_calls to enquire_about them .
neutral	i understand that stock is delayed but it would have been good to receive an_email keeping us posted on progress as we had paid for them at the time of ordering .
neutral	when the cushions did arrive they were lovely and worth the wait .
neutral	my experience wouldn_'_t stop me using urbanara again .
neutral	i may just take delivery times with a pinch of salt .
neutral	this is a good company , always_willing and able to answer any_questions .
neutral	my only_grumble would be with the website - not able to save and retrieve quotes :
neutral	i usually need to secure_payment for goods before despatch - i therefore need to get the quote , and then need to re - type everything when ordering the service .
neutral	surely transglobal , this is something you could fix quite easily !
neutral	loved the colour exactly_what i was looking for and the exact colour i had been searching for so i was amazed ... my only problem was that it was for a tiled_floor so kept sliding when anyone stood on it so would appreciate any feed_back on what to buy to stop it slipping on the floor or if there is anything i could buy off you to help my problem .
neutral	thanks
neutral	veronica
neutral	veronica
neutral	as it took 0_days for the order to even be despatched !
neutral	we all love the sparkles they jog our memories of our past and of happy times
neutral	you find that argos i selling nowdays almost everything and they curtomer service is better as the have the rating_system about the service you recieved , so they are all smiles ;))
neutral	you do find bargains but some ppl arent so friendly or reliable at all and becouse you dont get to try on the clothes / shoes , its a risk sometimes not worth taking
neutral	logged a claim months_ago about a payment that had been withdrawn .
neutral	chased up three_times and still no response .
neutral	think it must go into a big black_hole , because obviously nobody has seen it .
neutral	i received an_email_advising me of the dispatch of my 0 items .
neutral	one arrived the following_day and the other took a week to arrive .
neutral	i was disappointed at this .
neutral	tried various days and times of days to reach an advisor on the telephone without_success .
neutral	went on line to website .
neutral	filled in as necessary , although the " do you take any tablets " name them section , which then dropped down 0 reasons for this was very technical .
neutral	none of these applied to myself .
neutral	this led to confusion when i obtained my quote at the end of the session .
neutral	i then sent an e_- mail explaining the situation and in all fairness received a reasonably quick response .
neutral	i eventually got through to an advisor , who dealt_with my problems very efficiently , my insurance was dealt_with satisfactorily .
neutral	just awaiting my documents arrival .
neutral	i have e_mailed to the home_laundry company & attached a photo of the cracked joint but so far have not had any response
neutral	ordered from glowsticks for a school_disco having had previous bad_experience when we bought cheap glowbands from ebay - but we still had two bands split and ooze liquid - we checked for bite marks as that is unacceptable use but the plastic wasn_'_t bitten , it had split .
neutral	all good with the exception of communication - there was absolutely no telephone_number available on the website and i sent an_email communication through the website and a direct email with regards to expected delivery date - neither of which got a response .
neutral	if that could be rectified then a highly_recommended service !
neutral	have used this company many_times .. bit disappointed that the package was in such a bad state .
neutral	it was open on one end and the content boxes had been crushed but the wormers intact .
neutral	i ordered flowers a strawberry bouquet 0_days ahead of time for 00 . 00 , the flowers were dispatched at 0 . 00 in the morning but didnt turn_up till just after 0pm , and the flowers that turned_up contained more daisy flowers rather_than as the picture displayed -- dont_think i will use serenta again --- sorry
neutral	i ordered two new pairs of glasses from glasses_direct on a special_offer .
neutral	i love their home_trial and have used it several_times so was confident that i had got the right pair of glasses for me .
neutral	ordering was easy and the price was great - a pair of glasses and a pair of sunglasses , both with thinner_lenses than standard for about £_000 - brilliant .
neutral	the communication from the company was really good , keeping_me up to date on how the order was progressing and the glasses arrived about a ten days_later which was faster_than i had expected .
neutral	but i was so disappointed to find that neither pair fitted .
neutral	perhaps with working on them and fitting the lenses , the legs had loosened but the legs were so far apart that they wouldn_'_t stay on my face even when looking_forward never mind moving around and looking down .
neutral	all they needed was the legs tightened and the loops over the ears bent a bit more .
neutral	this should have been done before they left the lab .
neutral	instead i had to send them back for refitting and got them a week_later .
neutral	they were fast to respond to the request but it is one that i don_'_t think i should have had to make .
neutral	so 0 / 0 .
neutral	will use again but so easily could have been a perfect experience .
neutral	good deals
neutral	difficult to operate website ( where are the details )
neutral	website stops working at important stages ( payment , terms & conditions )
neutral	poor choice of engineering visits - especially for someone_who '_s employed !
neutral	i have used animed on several_occasions now and have always found them very helpful when i have phoned them - however on this occasion when speaking to someone to confirm that they had received my prescription by fax ( this been a thursday 00th_dec ) i was told yes they had but the vet hadnt looked at it yet and it would probably be monday the 00th before the vet looked at it and i would be lucky to get the order before xmas !
neutral	- so on this advice i had to reorder some more tablets from the vet to make_sure i didnt run_out before xmas .
neutral	then on the 00th_december i received a email to tell me my order was due to be delivered on 00th !
neutral	this did not come via the royal_mail and was wrongly delivered to a different address - which took some tracking down !
neutral	however i managed to retrieve the order but feel a little miffed that i spent another £_00 with the vet that could have been avoided .
neutral	will_definately be returning to purchase all treatments for my three cats .
neutral	after_placing order then a day lateran e_mail telling_me it '_s been dispatched and is with royal_mail , it took another 0_days to arrive !
neutral	so when ordering , leave at_least a week and a half before you need it !
neutral	unfortunately the traffic was horrendous which_meant that the tour took longer_than_anticipated .
neutral	also it meant that the commentary was at times out of sinc with where we were .
neutral	but apart_from that it was very good .
neutral	price acceptable but tried to call to discuss medical_issues but not yet successful and call costs a fortune
neutral	we had a three hour flight delay arriving into gatwick , phoned them when we were getting our bags , but skis took a while and by the time we got to collection_point , they had arrived , waited 0 minutes and left again and we had to wait half an_hour for them to return with our car .
neutral	even_though it was past midnight and there were no officials getting people to move along quickly .
neutral	they blamed it on lack of staff but they had our flight details , so knew we weren_'_t coming in on schedule .
neutral	ordered 0_seater ford galaxy or similar and was given a vw transporter which is a 0_seater .
neutral	had to pay £_00 diesel on picking_up the vehicle but as car_hire company will verify it came back with the same amount of diesel as vehicle was too_big for me to confidently drive .
neutral	i would like this £_00 to be refunded as it wasn_'_t used .
neutral	easirent was the carhire company
neutral	after buying tickets in the past from gumtree in the form of a computer print out & then worrying that they may not be valid , i felt a lot more reassured buying through seatwave .
neutral	my only_gripe is that the festival started at 00 . 00pm but the ticket office in moorgate where i had to collect my ticket , only opened at 0pm .
neutral	i contacted customer_services on several_occasions to ask if possible to collect earlier & except for a standard computer_generated reply_stating my query had been received , no one got back to me .
neutral	consequently by the time i arrived at the festival venue , hyde_park , i had missed the first 0 acts .
neutral	the ordering process was easy and my parcel was well - packed .
neutral	shame it was delivered to the wrong_address .
neutral	fortunately i get on well with my neighbours who delivered it to me the next_day .
neutral	example : ordered three chairs which took one month to come .
neutral	they arrived not suitable , so wasted all that time and very disappointed in the quality .
neutral	find it very frustrating that we have had several_occasions when my card has_been declined through no fault of myself which creates a problem at the bank .
neutral	product as expected .
neutral	paid_extra for royal_mail delivery to make delivery ( or collection ) simple as am out working all day but was sent via courier which made things more complicated .
neutral	after receiving a delivery note with both my items included and a date for expected delivery , i was surprised to find only one of the two skirts in the package .
neutral	there was no explanation , i had received no emails saying anything was out of stock .
neutral	i had to contact them and ask what the problem was , via_email as no telephone_numbers , and wait to be told that they had run_out of stock and i then had to wait for my account to be re - credited with the money !
neutral	the item i received was very nice and good value for money , shame about the service .
neutral	did not get confirmation when ordering the first time so therefore ordered again , however , ended_up with 0 orders .
neutral	has_been a bit of a hassle trying to return it as the post_office will not accept any sprays , but once we contacted the correct people , they said they were quite happy to pick it up , although it is now over a week and we still have it ?
neutral	?
neutral	i '_d used rentalcars before and i knew that i would get good value .
neutral	getting to the hertz pick - up was the hard bit - it '_s not downtown , it '_s at the hilton , at_least a mile from the town and on a dual carriageway .
neutral	the guy on the desk was really professional and i found i had got an upgrade .
neutral	thanks for that !
neutral	the car was almost new , clean but a bit damaged - what do other people do to hire_cars to bend them ?
neutral	i think that all phones , old or new , shud have a price on them , tht way , it would encourage more people to send in old_mobiles .. as the prices i get for the ones i have are stupidly low , knowing that they can be re sold for a much higher price
neutral	great delivery service , great price although this year the balloon was not delivered ......
neutral	last_year there was no card in side .....
neutral	need to work on checking all items correct .
neutral	we were hoping for a cancellation but as this didnt_happen we went along so as not to loose our money .
neutral	really wish i had stayed at home as an_hour and a half in amsterdam seemed pointless if it wasnt for being on the boat for 00_hours and wanting some fresh_air i wouldnt have bothered getting off the boat .
neutral	the boat itself was good but think the people going for the trip round amsterdam should have been given the opportunity to cancel
neutral	it took 0 goes and a lot of wasted time over 0_days to order what i required via the website .
neutral	after my payment wouldn_'_t process i tried again the following_day as they '_d sent me another email overnight offering me another 0 %_off my order ... they must have known that i '_d given up the day before !
neutral	i found the website bad and will phone if i decide to use them again .
neutral	just never received my confirmation of flight / booking ...
neutral	not really sure where to go for that .
neutral	no explanation , nothing ... :(
neutral	easy to compile
neutral	pleased with the outcome .
neutral	thought it was going to cost £ 0 . 00 as advertised ( which didnt indicate a number of pages ) but with added pages ( which it added automatically as i uploaded photos ) ended_up being £_00 .
neutral	so not sure i would have chosen
neutral	photoworld over others if i had known this at outset .
neutral	felt this was a case of misadvertising .
neutral	would i use again ?
neutral	maybe but would shop around at prices next time .
neutral	i purchased a pair of oakley jupiter squared sunglasses with polarized_lenses for a present a couple of weeks_ago .
neutral	unfortunately as soon as i had ordered them , i found the same pair of sunglasses for £_00 cheaper on another site - they were in stock and would have been delivered in time for my partner '_s birthday .
neutral	i then found the price matching guarantee on the cycle_store website , so the following_day after i had ordered the glasses , i emailed the address as instructed on the website , with details of where i had found the product and evidence that it was in stock and available for delivery .
neutral	i heard_nothing back from cycle_store at all .
neutral	i waited several days , and then called customer_services who very bluntly told me that they always check their price matching emails every day and that they don_'_t do price matching retrospectively .
neutral	there wasn_'_t even any kind of apology ( considering there is no mention on the website that they don_'_t do price matching retrospectively !!)
neutral	- all i got was the same line said several_times " we don_'_t do price matching retrospectively !"
neutral	in a gleeful tone .
neutral	i am considering just sending the glasses back out of principle , although i '_m reluctant as i wonder_if the " 00 month return_policy " has similar unwritten restrictions on it !
neutral	after ordering some flowers over the internet realised i needed to change some details .
neutral	their website says you can over the phone .
neutral	after waiting for an age to get through was told they could do nothing to help apart_from cancelling the order .
neutral	disappointing .
neutral	delivery was later than initialty forecast - said 0_days then gave a range covering 0_days .
neutral	did actually take 0_days
neutral	i have received in the past extremely good service and would have happily given 0_stars .
neutral	my last experience has left me frustrated and although i except that the problem may be a blip , i have just gone in to order some addition tablets and found that my prescriptions even after the blip are still not showing against my account .
neutral	my advise is to ensure that your prescriptions are showing against your account , is to shop early so that you have time to chase and chase and chase before the pets drug supply runs_out .
neutral	to be fair to animed i have to say that the support_team have been helpful and in the end i know it will be sorted_out and therefore just for the support_team i am still happy to give three stars .
neutral	excellent service with original order , but when rang for advice as i wanted to exchange for a different pair as these did not fit properly was vague and was told not many sizes available so would be better with a refund , as i really want these before my holiday i felt a bit frustrated , so have returned them and ordered an_alternative pair and am waiting for them as to whether they are suitable or not
neutral	when ordering the flowers i was given the opportunity to select the delivery day so as the person i was sending the flowers to works part time i chose a day hat i knew she would be home , however they were sent 0 working day before this .
neutral	as i received a text prior i could arrange for somebody to poppy their house to receive the flowers but i shouldn_'_t have had to do this .
neutral	i order quite regularly and it seems recently every time i place an order there is an issue .
neutral	iv had that i placed an order when the website was being changed and it wasn_'_t acknowledged iv had that things have been out of stock but not updated on the website which i just find disappointing that i have to then choose something_else to what i had my hopes up for and also the fact the items i order are for presents and iv had close calls with them not being sent in time yet i order in plenty of time but the problems don_'_t seem to flag up fast enough how does it take 0_days to notice an item is out of stock from the order being placed ?
neutral	love the sofa however was reluctant to order as the sofa wasn_'_t in the sale and knowing dfs i feared it would be in the sale in the near_future .
neutral	our sofa was in the country living range and the salesman assured us that this sofa would not be in the sale as sales only applied to the regular ranges .
neutral	imagine by frustration and anger when a couple of months later our sofa was advertised on the tv in the sale .
neutral	i contacted dfs to express my disquiet however i was told that it had been in the sale but was now back up to full price , very helpful .
neutral	unfortunately this had put me off ever buying from dfs again , despite loving the sofa i feel that the sales_patter is extremely dishonest .
neutral	well i like that there lenses makes your eyes look bigger without looking fake .
neutral	there are loads of lenses out their these days to give an illusion of bigger eyes but often looks fake or someone could tell you are wearing lenses .
neutral	however , feel good contacts with the diameter of 00 . 0 makes it look rather natural .
neutral	the negative side for me is that it feels very dry in the eyes .
neutral	it feels as if it will fall out any second .
neutral	i got this discomfort with in the first our of using .
neutral	after 0 hours , your eyes will become very dry and start to look red .
neutral	well , overall cosmetic reasons , this would be a good option .
neutral	looks pretty natural .
neutral	if you only wear this occasionally it '_ll be ok .
neutral	bottle arrived on time , however the recipient found the bottle which was thrown over this 0 foot gate .
neutral	there was no card left and the recipient did think it was rubbish until he picked it up .
neutral	so far all the food i have tried has_been delicious .
neutral	dissapointed that my first order was not dispatched until 0days after i ordered it which_meant i couldnt start my trial on time .
neutral	its great having the menu prepared and not having to think what to have .
neutral	porridge would be better in measurable sachets ,
neutral	i was impressed when a sales_consultant from axa ppp called me immediately to tell me more about the services they offer .
neutral	i found this both helpful and informative .
neutral	however as soon as the company got the business they weren_'_t really interested in providing any further customer service .
neutral	most notably this particular consultant scheduled to call and check i was still happy with the service after i had purchased the product .
neutral	he failed to bother .
neutral	hence in hindsight i think the company just used high pressure_sales tactics ( including pressurising me to join before the april end of tax year increase ) to get the business .
neutral	emma
neutral	item not delivered , telephone company advised item had been lost , item delivered the following week .
neutral	this is now my 0th car from peugeot and stoneacre and again i am highly pleased with the level of service and care from the sales_team .
neutral	i would certainly recommend peugeot , the level of customer_care is excellent .
neutral	what has_been extremely disappointing is the finance side as money has_been taken out of my account when it should not have been and two_weeks_later i am still trying to resolve the issue .
neutral	very very disappointing that nobody seems to care about this and i am expected to keep chasing and making phone_calls and getting_nowhere .
neutral	disappointing when i have spent 00 years dealing_with stoneacre and peugeot .
neutral	it will make me reconsider a further purchase .
neutral	no worse no better_than any other such organisation .
neutral	i found the extra_charges ridiculous who is going to go on holiday without a suitcase huh , even if it is only one between two , so why is it classed_as extra .
neutral	it is a case of captive audiences .
neutral	when i arrived it took several minutes for the blood to start circulation as the seats were so close together and uncomfortable to boot , the staff were snooty and unhelpful , next time i visit my friends in toulouse i will drive , i will not be using bmi baby again .
neutral	i am disappointed with 0 i have found the coverage extremely limited and have quite_often been left without service even in populated areas when this contract is finished i will be swapping to another network .
neutral	the coat itself is great , i was kept_informed of my parcels progress so that was all brilliant but in the process of ordering the coat i got an_error code flash up on my screen whilst trying to pay with paypal .
neutral	with nothing showing up on my emails for a couple of minutes i assumed that the order hadn_'_t gone_through so i re - ordered .
neutral	this time i payed via card and again i got an_error_message .
neutral	i checked my emails again only to find that both payments had gone_through and i now had two coats on their way .
neutral	ok i thought to myself i will just cancel one . not so easy as you have to wait for delivery before sending it back !
neutral	hmm , luckily it is a popular brand and a friend has shown an interest in buying it off me .
neutral	the flowers were a birthday_gift for my sister as i couldn_'_t be with her on her special day .
neutral	i chose serenataflowers . com because they could deliver next_day .
neutral	in the instructions box i specifically said " she will be in the house so please knock on the door ."
neutral	because life can be unpredictable i also added " if she doesn_'_t answer then leave on the porch ."
neutral	i pictured my sister getting a knock on the door and opening it to find her surprise flowers !
neutral	i didn_'_t imagine my poor sister thinking i hadn_'_t sent her anything for her_birthday , and me worrying all day that they had gotten lost and not been delivered .
neutral	my sister was in the house like she had said but when the flowers were delivered at approx 0am ( i got an_email_saying that they had been delivered ) she did not get them .
neutral	i spoke to her on the phone and i asked if she had gotten anything nice today ( i didn_'_t want to spoil her_birthday surprise by telling her what to expect ).
neutral	she said that she hadn_'_t received anything and i began to get really worried because i had received an_email_saying that they had been delivered .
neutral	many hours after the flowers had been delivered my sister went outside .
neutral	the flowers were sitting_outside the entire time .
neutral	i was relieved to find out they had been delivered , but for hours i was worried_about it , and they weren_'_t delivered properly .
neutral	why ask for delivery instructions serenataflowers if you don_'_t follow them ?
neutral	also , the options to choose where to leave the flowers , as you state are for if no one answers to a knock on the door , they are not the main delivery instructions .
neutral	if they had been delivered as i had asked i would have given 0_stars .
neutral	the flowers were beautiful but the delivery of them let the whole service down .
neutral	overall the weekend was good but the communication from chillisauce on organising the event was very poor .
neutral	some of the events that were booked got cancelled due to business closure and chillisauce didn_'_t let us know until a few_days before we arrived so there was no time to book anything_else .
neutral	would not use again .
neutral	east ordering but only 0 of 0 cold_packs received .
neutral	awaiting delivery of outstanding order .
neutral	good product and website very easy to use .
neutral	disappointed that delivered to wrong_address despite clear_instructions .
neutral	the product was supposed to be next_day delivery but was damaged in transit and the delivery people sent it back ( it never made it to me ).
neutral	a replacement was sent but this meant three_days delivery instead of next_day .
neutral	when the replacement arrived one dish in the set had a flaw in the coloured glaze .
neutral	i sent an_email to customer_services and they responded very quickly , sending another replacement dish straight_away .
neutral	this arrived smashed due to poor packaging .
neutral	i am now waiting for the third replacement !
neutral	first order never came in the mail and the company made me wait a month before they would send a new pair .
neutral	the next order took a good 0_weeks but at_least they came that time .
neutral	once the glasses finally came their what i expected not amazing quality , they creak every time i move them or open and close them but the lenses haven_'_t seemed to have fallen out despite all the commotion so for what i paid they are acceptable .
neutral	may order from again but if order is lost again defiantly wont , its just hard to beat their prices .
neutral	received really bad quality hair .
neutral	really damaged my clients hair , on telling additional_lengths so they did try and rectify the problem but was still really not happy with product of euro hair
neutral	the service was excellent .
neutral	some of the leaves were torn and 0 of the roses was not looking healthy ( died after just half a day out of the box ).
neutral	website , ordering and delivery excellent :)
neutral	product not perfect :( some of the bags are coming apart at the seams ... haven_'_t checked them all so could just be an unlucky first couple ... if major problem , will give them a call and i '_m_sure they '_ll replace :)
neutral	i have bought lots of furniture from oak_furniture_land and i must_say the furniture is lovely .
neutral	sales people great and delivery men really good .
neutral	that '_s when things are going well .
neutral	so what_happens when you receive a fault item ?
neutral	in my case i ordered a pair of tokyo bedside_cabinets , waited 0_weeks for delivery with some other items .
neutral	one cabinet was fine , the other looked like it had been dropped before being packed .
neutral	followed the procedure to raise a case on thursday of last_week and put a landline contact number as i was working from home .
neutral	got an_email on monday to say they had tried to call me on friday ( turns_out they decided to use a different number no_longer in use - why ?).
neutral	i have been working from home all of this week and so if they had tried harder to speak to me we may not have got to this point .
neutral	i work away mon to wed each week and i am now told that they don_'_t have any delivery slots available for thurs / fridays so can '_t tell me when i will get my replacement .
neutral	odd that when if i go online and go through the process of ordering a new cabinet , it offers me next friday as a named day delivery option if i pay £_00 .
neutral	maybe they don_'_t want to give that away to a complaining customer !
neutral	i now have to wait for the delivery guys to phone me to arrange some date in august .
neutral	they can '_t tell me when because apparently their system isn_'_t showing august dates yet !
neutral	it '_s only next week for goodness_sake !
neutral	it would seem to me that ofl work for the delivery guys rather_than the other way round and i just happen to be an annoyance in the middle .
neutral	why is the customer service department not authorised to make special delivery arrangements in cases where a complaint has_been made .
neutral	they need to wake_up and realise that we are the most_important customers to please if they want to prevent the many bad_reviews i have since found on this site .
neutral	the old cabinet is sitting in the way in my hallway and now looks likely to be there for another few_weeks .
neutral	i have today spoken to customer_services and they have confirmed there is nothing more they can do .
neutral	no customer service and i will not buy from them again or recommend .
neutral	update .
neutral	i received a phone_call from customer_relations ( cr ) about an_hour after i had posted my review on trust_pilot .
neutral	after a couple of weeks and a few more issues , i now have two lovely matching bedside_cabinets .
neutral	during this process i have spoken consistently to two case handlers from cr on a number of occasions .
neutral	if one was going to be out of the office , the other was fully_informed on the latest update .
neutral	they have both been very apologetic and i believe sincerely so .
neutral	this is a company that has_gone from being internet only to now having a very large high_street presence ( regrettably something many stores are moving away from ) and at times they are struggling with the extra demand this has put on them .
neutral	yes there are some problems with quality control ( from the reviews would seem to be certain ranges ) and the end to end supply_chain but i believe they are working to improve these .
neutral	since i raised the issue , they have already put some additional measures in place to improve sight of the delivery slots that customer_services can offer ( previously they couldn_'_t see the delivery slots showing as available to customers ordering online ).
neutral	i am also told that they have brought in specialist resource to look at improving the way they do things from a customers perspective .
neutral	in summary , if you get an issue , remain calm and polite , work with them and give these_guys a chance ( or two ) and some time , to put things right .
neutral	the furniture is lovely and worth the wait .
neutral	despite the problems , the way my case has_been handled has restored my faith in ofl and i will buy from them again .
neutral	i think the switches and sockets are perfect for my new_kitchen but i thought they would come with backs that fit into the wall - for that price i think they should have .
neutral	i was sorry to see that i had to insure the parcel against loss or theft when i am already paying for the safe deilvery of the parcel to start with .
neutral	i think you should review this policy you have .
neutral	surely if you are selling a service you should then not make your customers pay extra if your staff loose the package or it gets stolen .
neutral	apart_from that it was very easy to set_up and pay for the service .
neutral	although i had to buy new extensions due to the previous ones being the wrong_colour so i tried to dye them with the impression that they should be real hair , however the colour did not change & ruined my extensions .
neutral	the new extensions i have recently_purchased are however the right colour & exactly how i wanted .
neutral	shame they didn_'_t get it right first time
neutral	i had to phone them to to get the money transferred after two_weeks with no response .
neutral	they told me the parcel was just waiting to be picked_up from a warehouse or some such .
neutral	found that it was more difficult than_expected to order .
neutral	one particular object i could not order on line as the information number was not accepted .
neutral	the box of flowers were left at my front_door which is at the roadside so anyone could have taken them - they were left vertical and upside_down whereas the box explicitly said store horizontally - most of the flowers were lovely but the central carnations were all dead -
neutral	not always easy to find what i want .... . but i get there in the end !
neutral	partyrama website was fairly easy to use but they could have made navigation a little simpler .
neutral	i couldn_'_t seem to go back to the page i was on once i had added something to my basket .
neutral	delivery was prompt but i did have to wait around for a whole day as they couldn_'_t give me a time frame to expect delivery .
neutral	i have one or two hour delivery slots from most companies these days so i would have thought this should be better .
neutral	everything ordered arrived and looks as_described on the website .
neutral	it took longer to get to the resort than to get from liverpool to barcelona .
neutral	i '_ve_used resort_hopper for years with no problem but i think they '_ve changed the coach service they use at barcelona .
neutral	waited in the airport for nearly 0 hrs .
neutral	the driver also got lost dropping_off in calella .
neutral	hoping its just a one off .
neutral	i was so disappointed when i opened the box and saw my lights for the first time .
neutral	i chose what i thought was the best - looking company to buy from to make_sure they weren_'_t cheap and nasty but , my first reaction was that they are cheap and nasty !
neutral	before i ordered i had spoken with the office a couple of times and felt comfortable dealing_with them .
neutral	the lights arrived very quickly , packaged very well , and i was very keen to see them in_situ .
neutral	but , when i opened the first box and took the wall - light out i was so disappointed .
neutral	i kept tapping to see if they were made from glass or plastic ( i still don_'_t know but fear they are plastic ) and there was a sort of weird sheen on them that made them look like they need a good clean .
neutral	i did consider returning them , but the electrician was standing beside me waiting to install them ( i bought two wall - lights and a hanging pendant ) and i didn_'_t want to have to wait while i went through the whole_process again .
neutral	and what would i say ?
neutral	they probably are very accurately_described - perhaps my standards are too high .
neutral	so i had them installed .
neutral	i bought them as matching but they don_'_t .
neutral	it '_s not immediately apparent but noticeable when you look properly .
neutral	perhaps i should have given the company the chance to refund me but i feel that if they are going to sell cheap and nasty that people should be warned .
neutral	we shouldn_'_t have to find out the hard way .
neutral	i '_ll save my pennies and buy new ones next year .
neutral	i ordered a t shirt , which was exactly the same as i bought previously from yourselves in the cheshire_oaks outlet centre , the quality was great , however even_though reference and sizes on both t shirts were the same , the one i ordered from you was far smaller , and did not fit .
neutral	i enjoyed using this website and would recommend it to you as i sold phone in no time but didn_'_t get as much money as i would of liked to get
neutral	although the delivery service was very good , the outfit itself wasn_'_t the best fit and did fall_apart towards the end of the evening .
neutral	also the outfit was a little_pricey and i felt if i had more time i could have researched in to cheaper options .
neutral	:-)
neutral	we ordered the item as it said 00 hour delivery , when ordered no date could be given .
neutral	company then called to say it would be on a wednesday a scheduled it to be delivered to a friends work as we were both not able to stay at home that day .
neutral	they called to change the delivery i asked for the monday to be delivered to our home .
neutral	it turned_up on saturday .
neutral	the delivery guy left it on the street lent against the house as said he couldn_'_t move it further due to a bad shoulder .
neutral	when constructing it yesterday there were nails showing that were not actually going into wood and a parts of the sides were already split .
neutral	on a whole the summer house does look nice but we had to spend a lot of extra time and work bettering it
neutral	de_foto '_s waren snel afgedrukt en geleverd en_de prijs / kwaliteit verhouding is prima .
neutral	het is alleen een beetje jammer dat_ik 00x00 besteld heb en dat_de helft vervolgens in 00x00 wordt geleverd , deze passen nu niet goed in het fotoalbum ...
neutral	having ordered two shirts for two little pageboys , they arrived the next_day - great ...... except they were from two different makers , one was creamier than the other and the collars were different_sizes .
neutral	having telephoned my tuxedo , they sent out two identical white shirts the next_day so all is well , thank_you .
neutral	i have some bad_news regarding my purchase of your battery led blue lights .
neutral	they were needed for a school_play , i needed them for a jellyfish costume .
neutral	when i inserted the new batteries into the case , switch the lights on , i had an electric shock and they started to smoke .
neutral	kids thought it was really funny .
neutral	the other set are just fine .
neutral	i would like a refund as i have had to buy more from a local_store ( costing double the price ) .
neutral	will be sending the others back to you .
neutral	i tried over a period of 0 or 0_days to be able to book the ticket .
neutral	sometimes the website said the pricing couldn_'_t be found , sometimes the particular journey did not appear .
neutral	on one occasion i put in all our details to be told there was a problem with the site .
neutral	finally i managed to make the booking .
neutral	we were not so happy with the service .. the van which picked us up seem old and no name of the company listed on the van ... the driver was not a professional one and quite rude .. it took us 0 hours and 00_minutes to reach the airport .. and upon getting off he asked for our confirmation ... upon boarding the van he asked for our terminal no and i replied lufthansa and in a rude manner he replied " what terminal ?
neutral	you ' re going to the airport and you don_'_t know which terminal your going !
neutral	then i replied to him terminal 0 .... i had no problem from the booking etc , but we were not happy with the actual service ..
neutral	a nice villa with well_equipped kitchen .
neutral	en_suite bathrooms as well as family bathroom made travelling with 0 adults and 0 child much_easier .
neutral	pool was a good size and provided some good entertainment especially for a 0 year_old !
neutral	bbq area could be improved .
neutral	beds also not the most comfortable , we were all looking_forward to our own beds after 0_weeks .
neutral	i found the website easy to use and is very well set_up for its need .
neutral	i was very happy with the prices of the a0 sleeves i was buying and next_day delivery was also a bonus .
neutral	but my goods were delivered while i was not in and obviously i didnt know this as there had been no card through the door to say .
neutral	eventually , a week after ordering , it was urgent that i needed to get my goods .
neutral	the email service was very good with quick replies , where i managed to get the problem_solved .
neutral	my goods had been left with a neighbour which i was glad about but it would have been nice to have known this was where they were .
neutral	no complaint particularly about paperstone but poor for fedex , in my opinion its a key thing for deliveries to let the buyer know where their items are .
neutral	i would perhaps use paperstone again mainly for their good service .
neutral	i '_ve_used boiler_juice for almost 0 years they get you the cheapest price when you order , but 0 of the suppliers isn_'_t giving you what you paid for , on 0 delivery occasions i have not been given the full 000_litres as ordered , twice i was short 000_litres and a delivery of 000_litres ' , the print out you get given says 000 litre '_s yet it definitely is not !!!!!!
neutral	having now had it checked i shall be hoping for the missing oil to be put into my tank !!
neutral	!
neutral	it was good to receive texts and e_mails_telling_me how the delivery was going but fell flat when my last message was that they had been left i still do not know if they have been recieved
neutral	i used the tesco site last_year to do the same type of book , it was much_better before the upgrade .
neutral	you can only add 0 pages at a time - before you could add one page at a time .
neutral	i felt the the clip_art was very poor .
neutral	before much_better range
neutral	i wanted to add the easy open spine .
neutral	but no function for this eather .
neutral	i did have a code to buy a second book for 0 / 0 price but the code did not work .
neutral	i will not use this again .
neutral	having not heard_anything for a week after ordering an inhaler
neutral	on line i ' phoned to be told my account had been cancelled for some reason even_though i had an acknowledgement via_email to say it was on its way .
neutral	i didn_'_t know you had to be in for delivery and because i wasn_'_t .
neutral	i then had to drive to my local post_office to collect it .
neutral	it would have been easier to order it from my doctor .
neutral	took 0_days to despatch my order after i '_d ordered and paid for it .
neutral	had purchased the tree as a thank_you gift for someone but the delay lessened the gesture somewhat .
neutral	ok but no fire_extinguisher has turned_up
neutral	very pleasant member of staff when i had a problem ordering , sorted straight_away , but had a bit of a " ditherer " when i rang to say that that they had sent the wrong item , just didn_'_t understand , and sounded miserable !
neutral	but all said and done , lovely product , although set is incomplete at the moment !
neutral	placed order on 0 july took until 00 july to receive order , and only after 0 phonecalls .
neutral	wanted to refund instead of supplying the goods which does not help me as a customer when i required the goods i ordered .
neutral	got there in the end !
neutral	00 days after purchasing my watch i had not received either my watch or any communication_regarding it .
neutral	i emailed 0 times with no response .
neutral	in the end i rang up their customer_care who were not very helpful and who told me my watch wasn_'_t in stock and would be sent to me ' tomorrow '.
neutral	another 0 working_days passed so i rang again and was finally told it was dispatched .
neutral	not once did i receive an_email reply or any communication , i felt i had to chase down the company for information .
neutral	that being said , when the watch finally arrived it was in perfect_condition in the box , a beautiful watch , and watchtown provided the cheapest website online , even cheaper_than amazon
neutral	the date of delivery was confirmed , i arranged my work around that day / time & set the insurance_policy up from the 00th_may .
neutral	the car arrived a day early yesterday morning with a couple of hours warning .
neutral	i was very inconvienant time at my work , also i did not have the nationwide form with me or the even the correct shoes to drive home in .
neutral	the experience was quite stressfull and the delivery man seemed unaware of the agreed delivery day / time i had with nationwide .
neutral	bonjour ,
neutral	a priori il_y a beaucoup_de mécontents , quelle que soit la nationalité des acheteurs ..
neutral	au vu des dernières reviews ( infurn . fr et infurn . com ) je_suis assez inquiète concernant notre première_commande_chez infurn ( au 000000 ) datant de tout début avril 0000 .
neutral	il s ' agit de 0 chaises victoria ghost ( starck ) et nous_avons évidemment trouvé que_le site d ' infurn était très_bien fait , hyper attractif avec_des_prix défiant toute concurrence .
neutral	nous ne nous_sommes même_pas méfié une seconde , l ' entreprise étant européenne avec_des filiales un_peu partout en uk , espagne , etc .. tout paraissait parfait , sauf le délai_de_livraison qui était d ' après nous un_peu exagéré mais bon , nous étions prêts à attendre pour obtenir ce_que_nous voulions .
neutral	0 .
neutral	livraison prévue la semaine du 00 août 0000 : nous_avons indiqué sur_le site ( dans notre_compte client ) une adresse de_livraison différente de_notre adresse habituelle car nous serions en congés .
neutral	0 .
neutral	lors_de_ma consultation de_notre_compte au début de_l ' été , je m ' aperçois que_le statut de_la_commande est toujours " en attente de fabrication " et que_la_livraison_est passée à_la semaine du 00 septembre .. première mauvaise surprise .
neutral	et_pas un seul message pour nous prévenir : c ' est à nous de le découvrir presque " par hasard ".
neutral	je rédige donc un message au service client en demandant pour quelle raison la_livraison_est différée de plus d ' un mois et pour dire_que vraiment , là , ça devient trop long .
neutral	réponse immédiate par tél + mail ( une dame a laissé un message sur mon répondeur en me disant qu_' elle m ' envoyait un email ) : les chaises n ' étaient pas conformes à leurs standards de_qualité donc ils les font refaire .
neutral	cette_fois la date de_livraison_est garantie mais si je veux annuler ma_commande je_n ' ai qu_' à le confirmer .
neutral	de plus ils s ' excusent , font un geste commercial en créditant notre_compte client ( pas notre_compte en banque , on est d ' accord ..) de 00_% du montant de_notre commande ( à utiliser comme bon nous semble sur_le site ).
neutral	je dis que ok , je veux bien attendre un mois de plus mais plus de blagues , cette_fois je_n ' accepterai pas d ' autre retard .
neutral	0 .
neutral	il_y a 0_jours en consultant le compte client , nouvelle " surprise ": la date de_livraison_est passée au 00 novembre pour_la même raison qu_' évoquée précédemment : défaut de_qualité , retour à_l ' envoyeur et refabrication .
neutral	cette_fois le compte client comporte un message expliquant tout_ceci , avec nouvelles excuses à_la clé .
neutral	je décide de leur écrire afin d ' annuler .
neutral	tant pis pour_le_prix intéressant , cela_fait 0 mois que_nous attendons des chaises pour compléter le salon , nos travaux sont finis et on arrête de rigoler .
neutral	je leur dis dans_le mail qu_' ils ont perdu notre confiance , que c ' est dommage mais que_nous désirons le remboursement immédiat .
neutral	habituellement la réponse du service client est immédiate , mais là , au bout de plus d ' une_semaine et 0 emails , aucune nouvelle .
neutral	uniquement des accusés de réception envoyés en automatique .
neutral	d ' où mon inquiétude .
neutral	je me suis donc renseignée , ai consulté différents forums et suis encore plus inquiète !
neutral	!
neutral	si tout_ceci devait s ' éterniser , nous_avons trouvé un moyen de_faire appel à différentes instances ( avec juristes , etc ..) pour régler ce litige ; apparemment de nombreux clients d ' infurn connaissent les même problèmes et_tout_ceci prends de_l ' ampleur .
neutral	il_n ' est_pas dans leur intérêt de jouer comme ça avec les nerfs et_l ' argent des clients qui leur font confiance , et_je_suis prête à comprendre que des délais_de fabrication peuvent être très allongés , qu_' ils ont beaucoup_de commandes ( et certainement de réclamations ) à traiter et qu_' ils sont débordés .
neutral	je_ne souhaite pas fusiller l ' enseigne et abonder dans tous_les forums avec_des commentaires négatifs et ne demande qu_' un règlement à_l ' amiable , comme avec toute enseigne sérieuse et respectueuse de ses clients et_de_la législation .
neutral	je m ' estimerai satisfaite quand notre demande d ' annulation sera bien prise en compte + quand nous serons remboursés de_la somme prélevée .
neutral	nous aurons perdu un_peu de temps mais pas plus .
neutral	je rendrai compte régulièrement de_l ' avancée de tout_ceci sur trustpilot et d ' autres forums / blogs .
neutral	en espérant que cette expérience sera utile et se terminera bien ...
neutral	00 / 00 : j ai_reçu un appel de jeremie de infurn .
neutral	il m a confirme que_le remboursement avait bien ete fait , ce_que_j avais constate moi meme ce matin completement par hasard en consultant notre_compte bancaire en_ligne .
neutral	la societe a donc bien recredite notre carte bancaire avant la fin du delai de 00 jours .
neutral	donc , pas tres bonne experience commefciale ( c est le moins qu on puisse dire ) mais societe honnete et_de bonne foi , mon experience me le prouve a present .
neutral	je_suis prete a commander a nouveau chez eux , mais cette_fois uniquement les_produits disponibles immediatement .
neutral	autant d attente et surtout de retard , ca n est_pas possible ...
neutral	ordered my boyfriend a pair of trainers for £_000 . 00 for his_birthday , then paid a further £ 0 . 00 for next_day deliery , which came a day later than promised .
neutral	then to find the box the trainers had come in was damaged , ( an_avid trainer collector always keeps the boxes ) so this was a disappointment .
neutral	for £_000 . 00 in total , the service was not great .
neutral	unfortunately i will avoid ordering from you in future .
neutral	when i ordered my product from bcs , i was given the option of a suitable_alternative or full_refund in the event of my choice not being available .
neutral	i definitely did not want an_alternative so ticked the box for full_refund .
neutral	i received an apologetic email to say that the product was unavailable , however , instead of confirming a full_refund , i was again given the option of an_alternative with a full_refund being available if i did not respond within 00_hours - resulting in a delay of receiving the refund .
neutral	apart_from this little_niggle , i have to be fair and say that this is the only order i have placed so far and would use them again - but would prefer my chosen option to be taken into_consideration if there is a problem .
neutral	cheapest price around i could find as i got mine on a star deal but service and updates weren_'_t too good , unhelpful delivery dates and misinforming me of information was frustrating but overall average experience .
neutral	the overall experience was good and the delivery was speedy .
neutral	the only_downfall is the join on the back of the metal box was broken when i opened it up .
neutral	hopefully see if jessops reads this to see if they contact me to arrange delivery of a new jigsaw tin ????
neutral	?
neutral	tryed to buy jewelry set as a present only for the last two_days the link saying no deal found after paying , checking my bank_statement this morning to find they '_ve charcged me 00 . 00 twice !!
neutral	fumming , single hard working mum trying to shop about for presents and now £_00 down !!
neutral	emailed and no reply ,,
neutral	i have spoken to a very polite man after a response to this and now have claimed my gift and the other 00 . 00 has_been refunded , thank_you would still be a little_weary to use again unaided .
neutral	it took 00 days to get the product i ordered .
neutral	i ordered it for next_day delivery then got a phone_call to say it would be 0_days , instead it took several phone_calls and a further 0_weeks to get the product .
neutral	if you can not fulfill an order you should of said and we could of got the product we needed else where in the timescale we urgently_needed .
neutral	had a apology phone_call which is much_appreciated and proves they can do good customer service .
neutral	very easy to book with but making a date change on a booking to the day before the cost was not what was mentioned on the website and was 00 pound to change it .
neutral	wont_be booking through ferries . co . uk again as a friend booked direct and was able to make_changes at no cost .
neutral	the bed_frame was ok except for the feet which were sloppy and poorly attatched so broke of when putting it together
neutral	the delivery and service were fine
neutral	hi there ,
neutral	i was disappointed to find that some of the flowers sent to my friend for her 00th_birthday were substandard ie dead or decayed .
neutral	it was embarrassing although she
neutral	understood .
neutral	a resend will be due to her tomorrow so hopefully the flowers will be top_notch .
neutral	over all the service was good , just a shame the flowers didn_'_t do the company justice on this occasion .
neutral	as a former travel_agent i found this site somewhat confusing to use
neutral	i have been buying at contactlenses . co . uk since i moved to the uk 0 year and half ago and it has_been always well .
neutral	i just have a bit complain_about the information they gave on their website about a model of contact_lenses , that wasn_'_t completely right .
neutral	my order has not yet been delivered so im unable to comnent in the full service yet
neutral	not to bad .
neutral	i purchased erdinger dunkel for my partner for fathers_day and found the bottles to be scratched and looked very battered , labels were hanging off too .
neutral	i also found that the use by date is in three_months which for the cost of the beer is poor .
neutral	regardless of these two issues my partner was still happy with them , however he opened one up and poured into a glass , before he drank any i noticed lots of white pieces floating in it .
neutral	the glass was clean so i know this wasnt the cause .
neutral	i am also a little unhappy that the message i requested to be in for him from his daughter wasnt included .
neutral	once again for the amount this cost i am really unhappy about it .
neutral	thanks
neutral	kirsty
neutral	sometimes great but sometimes they take the cash and for some reason haven_'_t dispatched the order until i chase it a week_later .
neutral	full of apologies but as i order specialist_cat_food it is really bad if i run_out before my order arrives .
neutral	has happened one too many_times .
neutral	item was as_described but the angel_wings and halo combo came to £_00 something with delivery and this was after a 00_%_discount .
neutral	quality is not amazing for this price .... however quick delivery and well_packaged !
neutral	really great , easy way of getting a take out in a larger town , and im_sure as the site develops more and more businesses will eventually post their menus etc .
neutral	living in a smaller town on a weekend however proves to be a bit of a nightmare .
neutral	none of the local take outs have joined up or even submitted their menu , but this is hardly just eats fault .
neutral	ok service , would recommend .
neutral	i have been loyal to o0 since owning a mobile phone .
neutral	i love the service they provide and the signal is fantastic for where i live ( in the sticks ) however , the crazy expensive contracts are beginning to wind me up and the repair service is incredibly_frustrating .
neutral	they couldn_'_t understand the original fault with my phone so instead replaced the circuit board which hasn_'_t helped the problem at all .
neutral	next time , i think i will send it to htc directly as they seemed to understand the problem a lot better when i explained it to them .
neutral	apart_from that , o0 are still a good company , but they need to be more competitive in terms of pricing and benefits if they want to keep_up with their_competitors .
neutral	buying a domain is an_absolute_bargain .
neutral	however the hosting options seem a little expensive in comparison to their_competitors .
neutral	switching hosts proved to be a little frustrating and the agent i was contacting proved to be less_than helpful .
neutral	would recommend for cheap domains , but for the rest of the service , including buying email accounts , head somewhere_else for a much more affordable service .
neutral	the aol website is quick and easy to use , but as an internet provider , i just cannot recommend them .
neutral	i used aol before switching to bt , which i still remain on til this day .
neutral	the customer service and internet_connection was collectively terrible .
neutral	not a month went by without a fault or problem , incredibly_frustrating .
neutral	the customer service was mediocre .
neutral	occasionally they would manage to reset the line ?
neutral	and it would magically turn back on .
neutral	other times this didn_'_t work and we had to wait it out to retrieve connection again .
neutral	bit of a nightmare .
neutral	ease of on - line ordering and price highly competative .
neutral	contact from mattressonline re discontinued mattress_protector ordered was solved with an upgrade at no extra_charge .
neutral	however i informed about the restricted access to the cottage with limit at a luton van size vehicle .
neutral	no one read the notes and on the morning of delivery as we were waiting , a phone_call informed us that the van arranged was too_big to come .
neutral	further communications from delivery company poor , leaving us to chase_up via mattressonline .
neutral	early morning call with phone number to contact , connected to a message which said office now closed .
neutral	delivery finally came next_day , but plastic mattress cover very dirty and torn and new mattress had dirty patches .
neutral	appointment made on the phone and long descritption of the glass required .
neutral	horror on arrival , wrong glass .
neutral	i felt sorry for the mechanic as his day wasted as was mine .
neutral	new appt made and this time excellent service and all done with satisfaction .
neutral	just wish more attention had been given to getting the correct glass first time
neutral	i was a bit disappointed that the flowers arrived late as i knew that doris was going out .
neutral	fortunately she hadn_'_t set off so all was well .
neutral	i was very happy with the next_day delivery service and the amount of communication with the delivery .
neutral	i received emails and text_messages in regards to the where about of the flowers and when they had been delivered .
neutral	although , i did request that the flower be delivered with a neighbour if no one was in .
neutral	it was even on the box that contained the flowered but they were left " in a secure_location " outside of the house .
neutral	it was left_behind bins .
neutral	i was not happy with this given that i had requested otherwise .
neutral	i was very impressed that the website actually asked where you would like the flowers to be left if no one was in i just don_'_t understand_why the delivery driver would not follow the instructions when it is a very helpful thing .
neutral	otherwise , the flowers are very nice and came with a nice card .
neutral	i cannot_fault the flowers at all .
neutral	just a shame with the delivery letting it down .
neutral	i ordered a product and specified a separate delivery address ( my work ) to my billing_address ( my family home ).
neutral	it arrived very quickly but i only found out when my mum called me to say that i had post .
neutral	i avoid deliveries to my flat as it '_s not very secure but it '_s inconvenient to have to travel to my mum '_s house to pick_up some makeup !
neutral	!
neutral	in addition , i stopped being_able to make card payments temporarily and when i called up my bank , they said that there was a discrepancy and possible fraud on my account which when we looked closer was caused by the fragrance_direct transaction which failed to pass full security because the addresses didn_'_t match .
neutral	i can understand this extra layer of security when its an expensive product like electronics but it '_s a very low ticket item .
neutral	that said delivery was very fast and the price of goods and shipping very reasonable and i would still use fragrance_direct if i could be sure these problems didn_'_t happen again .
neutral	the first thing i would like to have been told was the face value of the tickets , i am bitterly_disappointed with getmein !!
neutral	!
neutral	i bought tickets through getmein via ticket_master , as it stated it was a sister site !
neutral	i didn_'_t know the price of beyonce , but when i had received them i got the biggest shock of my life firstly to discover that the face value of the tickets was just over_£_00 , when i had paid well over_£_000_pounds on two tickets .
neutral	i would not use getmein again as it basically does what is supposed to not be done and that is sell tickets for a considerable_amount more than the face value of the tickets .
neutral	cant seem to resist a quick look every day , and order far to much according to my husband .
neutral	my only_criticism is that if items are missing from an order is does not get picked_up by achica and unless i email and complain nothing happens .
neutral	also a long wait to get money refunded .
neutral	i would be nice to phone a customer support number , rather_than just emails .
neutral	i have been on the cambridge_diet plan in the past and really liked the products .
neutral	however i thought the idea of exante was great .
neutral	not having to see a consultant , a wider_range of products including meals which are all veggie ( as am i ) and being_able to buy it all online .
neutral	i couldn_'_t wait to start and was really in the zone .
neutral	after 0_days i had to give up as just could not stand any of the products other than the porridge , but could not imagine living off of porridge alone for the next few_weeks or months .
neutral	the shakes have a metallicy taste , the bars are super_dry , the soup made me feel physically sick and the meals were just weird .
neutral	exante was not for me !
neutral	!
neutral	would say though , the delivery was exactly_what i ordered ( one week started pack ) and it arrived all on time along with my free calender and book .
neutral	i have no problem with the company , just the products !
neutral	!
neutral	to be confirmed
neutral	i think the dispatch takes too long hence the goods take to long to be delivered
neutral	paid for 0 day delivery , states on the website if ordered before 0000 will dispatch the next_day .
neutral	my item took a week to arrive , so overall disappointed although got the product i wanted .
neutral	i just keep dropping on to amazing bargins .
neutral	recently i have bought loads of perfumes and make up for christmas_presents at a fraction of the cost i would pay on the high_street .
neutral	i have even treated_myself .
neutral	only one niggle i never seem to qualify for the free gifts , i thought that both my recent_purchases should have allowed me to claim a free watch or lip_gloss but the form said i didn_'_t qualify .
neutral	spent way more than limit .
neutral	wound me up for a few_days after as the watch was advertised every day .
neutral	can '_t fault teleologic on the ordering side but the royal_mail let them down .
neutral	the box clearly said perishable item on it and because my mum was out they took them back to the sorting_office when they could have left them elsewhere .
neutral	behind bin , with a neighbour .
neutral	mum then had to wait 0_days before they could be redelivered which not only upset me but ruined the surprise for my mum .
neutral	my friend tells_me she never recieved her flowers that is why i am disappointed , but serenata have been very helpfull trying to resolve this problem .
neutral	no ones fault just one of those things .
neutral	ordering was easy .
neutral	rapid delivery but very poor quality product .
neutral	return was easy and refund was made rapidly .
neutral	very happy to use boo_hoo again .
neutral	product as expected
neutral	i made a mistake on booking the ferry .
neutral	i was checking several dates for the prices and left the wrong date when i booked .
neutral	this happened at 0pm on a friday_evening .
neutral	i rang up immediately and the office was closed , so i made a return phone_call at 0 . 00 saturday_morning only to be told that i had entered a contract and was going to be charged_£_00 for an_amendment .
neutral	i know that another ferry company will not charge in the first 00_hours so i was quite disappointed with the service as i had spent £_000 on a single way ticket which is not cheap .
neutral	will probably not go with aferry again .
neutral	i ordered only shirts but they had a bit cheap quality for that money .
neutral	i usually ordering from the sale_section .
neutral	price was fantastic and i received the aftershave quickly but was a bit annoyed when the parcel had a aftershave / perfume sticker on it as well as the price i had paid .
neutral	this was a gift for my partner and he answered the door when it was delivered so saw the stickers on the box and ruined his_birthday suprise :(
neutral	ordered tubes which arrived in flimsy box and both had been snapped , charterhoue resent and luckily new tubes arrived ok but still send in cardboard_box , would think that these could be easily squished
neutral	beställde dopkort via er och fick dom snabbt levererade .
neutral	det fanns många fina designer att välja på , hade varit bra om man hade kunnat byta ut vissa symboler .
neutral	när vi fick korten ( snabb_leverans ) så fanns det på hälften av korten , 00 st , en missfägnningskant , troligtvis av ytbehandlingen ( glatt yta ).
neutral	var tyvärr tvungen att skicka de missfärgade korten då det_var lite bråttom .
neutral	det hade varit bra med_en bättre kvalitetskontroll som troligtvis hade upptäckt missfärgningen .
neutral	jag har mailat info_@ optimalprint . com för ersättning .
neutral	on returning our car to the car_hire company , enterprise , we were told there was not enough staff on a bank_holiday to leave the desk and check the car back in at gatwick_north airport .
neutral	on returning home we received an_email that we were being charged our £_000 excess on the insurance we had taken out with enterprise for a chip on the windscreen .
neutral	on complaining this was reduced to £_00 . 00 .
neutral	this is a con .
neutral	we had the car for two_days and did very little mileage .
neutral	there was no damage when we checked the car ourselves .
neutral	it is not possible to know which company your car_hire is with until you select the car .
neutral	i would not want to hire from enterprise again .
neutral	it took around 00 days for the order to arrive despite saying on the website it was in stock .
neutral	i didn_'_t have a particularly negative experience since i didn_'_t call - but it wasn_'_t that positive either - i received an_email_saying the item had been despatched after a few_days and it still took another week to arrive !
neutral	reading other people '_s orders , seems as though they need to work on their supply_chain ...
neutral	despite this , i '_m still quite happy - i ordered a deuter bike rucksack and am very pleased with it - great quality and useful extras .
neutral	the car is underpowered and is small for 0 adults - the boot is snot largeand unfortunately we were not told by the rental staff until afterwards , that there was extra boot space underneath , so we never discovered this !
neutral	we had booked ' ford_focus or similar ' and probably would have preferred the ford_focus ...
neutral	petfleas are the best value for money and delivery was quick .
neutral	my only_concern is that the product arrived not in the original packaging , but in a plain_brown box !...
neutral	very unsure_whether to use this product on my dogs
neutral	website easy .
neutral	ordering easy .
neutral	email_saying order received and next email would give details of when to expect delivery - easy !
neutral	but ... no next email .
neutral	wait in , wait in !
neutral	not easy !
neutral	no user_friendly phone number .
neutral	eventually found one .
neutral	not easy !
neutral	then transferred from one department to another .
neutral	only wanted to know if delivery was going to be that day or not .
neutral	goods did arrive but i never did receive that second email as informed .
neutral	this way online shopping does not get easier .
neutral	overall happy .. flowers were lovely but not as_described .
neutral	.
neutral	i appreciate there would be some variation on available blooms but i ordered pink and they turned_up yellow and white .
neutral	i have been using this company to order dog_food for the last 0_months or so .
neutral	generally deliveries are made without a hitch ... however my last order was put " on hold " because one of the varieties i had ordered was out of stock .
neutral	when i called 0_days_later to enquire when the delivery would be made i was told of the problem and asked if i would like to substitute ?
neutral	i wonder_how long i would have waited if i hadn_'_t called to chase my order ?
neutral	not good enough !
neutral	!
neutral	the flowers i ordered from you on thursday where delivered yesterday and she said they are beautiful .
neutral	i am just letting you know that when i tried to order them earlier in the afternoon it said that there was a problem processing my order , so i did the order again later in the evening thinking that the first order hadn_'_t been processed , which_meant that i had ordered the same flowers twice . does this mean that you have taken both payments from my account .
neutral	i was very pleased with my purchase , it was great being_able to get a taste of the foods in which i cannot get here in the usa .
neutral	i am very disappointed in the prices you charge for the actual product and then the shipping_charges are horrendous , having said that it is worth a one time purchase , but would definately not be able to purchase these items on a regular_basis due to the costs , i went into the tesco and asda sites and saw the regular prices , i also know how much shipping_costs .
neutral	i know you have to make money but feel you would get a lot more sales , if your prices were much_lower and more economical for the buyers pocket .
neutral	having said hat i do appreciate getting something special now and again .
neutral	the stars rating i will give a 0 because of the prices you charge for the products and shiping it is way to high .
neutral	had a delivery of edging blocks as they were out of stock in b_& q .
neutral	the customer service was very good but the delivery was a bit chaotic .
neutral	they arrived on the back of a van with a drop down tailgate and the driver had a right struggle getting them off and needed me to give him some help with pulling the pallet truck .
neutral	quite a few of the blocks arrived damaged and i was not sure if they were seconds or not .
neutral	overall not a disaster but not as good or as efficient as builders_merchants .
neutral	i ordered a shower_tray which was a good make at a good price but it arrived in minimal_packaging that was damaged during transition .
neutral	luckily the product inside wasn_'_t damaged .
neutral	i did not receive an_email or text to advise me when it had been dispatched or was due to be delivered so consequently i was out when they attempted delivery .
neutral	the delivery company chosen to deliver the product was difficult to contact .
neutral	i couldn_'_t change the place of delivery to my work and they required me to be at home from 0 . 00 am to 0 . 00_pm to accept re - delivery , ridiculous in this day and age .
neutral	my previous order , with another company , on the internet i was kept_informed at all_stages and given an_hour_window for delivery and my product arrived within that hour .
neutral	for these reasons i would think_twice before using bathrooms and showers_direct again .
neutral	i was a little_concerned that flowers were just left on the door_step for anyone to take .
neutral	however the recepient got them and all was well .
neutral	would suggest that flowers are not left_outside .
neutral	the quality of the flowers was good though
neutral	trustworthy mean charging the correct amount on your order , not on the parts you cannot supply , having me phone you , s to get a refund , good job i do internet_banking or i would have had to wait_until i got a bank_statement , the part you sent i recieved next_day were exellent but half a day serching the net got me the main part i needed
neutral	getting laser_treatment done has made a big_difference , not having to bother with glasses .
neutral	the only nuisance is i got one done for reading and the other eye corrected for long_distance , the eye for distance heeled quickly , but 0_months later i am still travelling once a month to my nearest optical , express which is 00_minutes drive_away as the eye for reading keeps changing and i will probably need to go back and get an enhancement in that eye .
neutral	the flowers were very nice but the amount of flowers was considerably_less_than i feel was needed for the £_00 price_tag .
neutral	also there was no gift card included in the box despite the fact that i had written the message i wanted included when making the order .
neutral	upgraded to the deluxe_bouquet and rather_than receiving a larger bouquet , an additional tiny bouquet was included .
neutral	overall not bad but wouldnt order again .
neutral	delivered on time and i was kept_informed by email and text .
neutral	however the confirmation of delivery text i received said the flowers at been delivered and left_securely at the front of the property .
neutral	i had to call the recipient to check she actually received them , and she said they were accepted at the door by her son .
neutral	i found the text_message misleading as it indicated there was no one home .
neutral	one of my items was unavailable and i was emailed to see if i wanted to amend my order before dispatch .
neutral	i did this , but with some_confusion .
neutral	i eventually dealt_with the matter over the phone and resolved the change in the order .
neutral	it did take several days after that before the items were dispatched and arrived .
neutral	glad i left myself plenty of time , before the gift was due to be given !
neutral	great staff and car but the devil is in the details .
neutral	i did not know at the time of booking that i was required to buy a whole tank of gas .
neutral	this doubled the price of the rental .
neutral	i have always had a good comment to say about mazuma but i have had a little problem recently .... i did sell my phone and i got a price for it and i got a good price considering the phone was in a non - working order ... i requested to have this money put in my account but still , i have not had this money put into my account !
neutral	it is driving me mad and i have asked them to sort it but they have not yet done this which has caused me to rate mazuma not as good as a wanted to !
neutral	hope this gets sorted eventually then i will not have a bad_word to say about them
neutral	love the service !
neutral	but when you say voucher 00_%_off next purchase voucher no 00000 00th_oct . how come i only got £ 0 off .
neutral	????
neutral	jennifer lowe
neutral	the driver took an international student with his suitcase to the arrivals .
neutral	i thought they are professional drivers for the airport_transfers .
neutral	timber of the staging is good but when they are erected the struts and holes don_'_t match up .
neutral	one of the tops is warped .
neutral	value for money but i put a note on when ordered saying if picture too low resolution don_'_t print and let_me know .
neutral	picture looks good but is slight pixilated in one area but doesn_'_t affect how good picture is .
neutral	also black and white and i think it '_s too dark .
neutral	slightly .
neutral	i found a beautiful_arrangement on the website for a very special friend .
neutral	it was a bonus that the pot was included .
neutral	on arrival i was extremely disappointed as the arrangement wasn_'_t as it appeared on the website !
neutral	the vase was about half the size and the arrangement was nowhere_near as tall as it appeared on the website .
neutral	some of the flowers did look as though they had been through the wars and weren_'_t that fresh .
neutral	for an arrangement of that price i would have expected something better .
neutral	this is the first time i have used eflorist and will definitely be the last !
neutral	the delivery was fast .
neutral	but i was very disappointed with the product i bought .
neutral	it wasn_'_t what the website showed .
neutral	but when i phoned the company to say i am returning the product the lady on the phone was very nice and polite .
neutral	i have previously been extremely pleased with plants from suttons , but not this year .
neutral	of 00 begonia value plugs only 0 have survived .
neutral	in the past i have had great success with these .
neutral	the portulacea , described as bred for the british climate , spreading and free flowering ,
neutral	have been a great disappointment .
neutral	they look super in the picture in a hanging basket and i bought 00 to fill my tubs .
neutral	however 0 of them .
neutral	hardly grew at all and the rest just produced very straggly plants with tiny inferior flowers .
neutral	they looked so awful that i have dug them up and had to replace them with plants from my local_garden_centre .
neutral	therefore i think that next year i will go to the garden_centre for plants rather_than buy by mail order .
neutral	they may be more_expensive but at_least i will know what i am getting .
neutral	they felt so nice to begin with but just after one wash they dont feel new anymore
neutral	we stayed at one of escalea '_s paris apartments .
neutral	the apartment was amazing but the service was terrible .
neutral	we were told check in was after 0 and to call when we arrived in paris .
neutral	we called at 0 : 00 and were told we missed our 0 pm check in .
neutral	we were given a new check in time of 0 pm .
neutral	we arrived at 0 pm and waited_until 0 :_00pm for someone to show up - after many calls and texts from us .
neutral	we were charged an extra 00 euro for checking in on a monday that was a bank_holiday even_though we were the ones inconvenienced .
neutral	the wifi never worked so they gave_us a code for a wifi service that kept dropping the connection and ignored our request to have the wifi fixed in the apartment .
neutral	after our stay i included this information in a survey from them and received no response .
neutral	i gave them 0_stars because the place was great but the service was one star .
neutral	the flowers were delivered and were nice .
neutral	concerned that the recipient had a lot of difficulty_finding out who had sent them .
neutral	i added names to appear on card but they did not appear on card .
neutral	we ' re with bt at the moment , have been for around 0 years .
neutral	since then we '_ve had numerous charges that shouldn_'_t have been on there .
neutral	called up a couple of time to have to wait 00minutes for somebody in india to pick_up .
neutral	they then say they '_ll write a note on the system and the charge will be reversed ( which doesn_'_t actually appear to happen ).
neutral	also upgraded with them to infinity , to then get a bill for over_£_000 for leaving the previous contract early and £_00 for the existing hub which i refused to pay .
neutral	remember to write down the vol id number when dealing_with them , as they are sloppy in keeping their promises .
neutral	i used to use ebay all the time , but it appears nowadays the majority of auctions are set by companies and ebay businesses .
neutral	there '_s nothing wrong with this , but it '_s not the same as it used to be where people are selling their used belongings for much less_than it would cost in the shops .
neutral	i didn_'_t really like the mix of colours .
neutral	i felt there wasn_'_t enough variety .
neutral	would have liked a smaller window of time for collection of parcel to be able to plan my day better .
neutral	the parcel was collected right at the end of the day after waiting in since breakfast time
neutral	i was impressed with the ease of the booking , the amazing price and i had good service with alamo at the desk .
neutral	however , i wanted to get the limited insurance ( to keep the price low ) and when i went to pick_up my car they told me they were going to put at 0000_euro deposit on my credit_card .
neutral	this is an unacceptable amount to take as a deposit for a two day rental !
neutral	in fact , it exceeded the limit on my card , and i was forced to buy the full insurance for an extra 00 euro , making the rental no_longer a deal .
neutral	the fine print had said that the company " may take a deposit " but had not suggested that it would be an unpayable amount .
neutral	i always send flowers to my lovely auntie and they always make her smile and that smile lasts while the flowers bloom .......... her smile didnt not last long with your flowers sad to say wont_be sending flower this way again .
neutral	i was happy with the flowers and the teddy_bear i ordered for my mother however when the delivery man arrived at 0 in the morning my mum was already up , however there was no knock on the door or any attempt to give the flowers personally to my mother , all she heard was a van driving away .
neutral	luckily my mum being aware flowers were being delivered checked outside and there was a note put through the door saying the flowers were left on the door_step .
neutral	we have a driveway which had two cars on and a side way leading to the garden , it would have been better if he driver was to lazy to knock to have placed the flowers in a safer place to prevent them being on display on the front step for any one to take a liking and pinch them .
neutral	it could have been hours before my mother found them and what if they had been stolen .
neutral	i think it was poor of them not to even attempt to knock on the front_door and actually do their job .
neutral	ordered amazonia with upgrade and would really have liked to see a picture of what the upgrade would look like , especially as i have now seen the flowers and rather wish i had further upgraded .
neutral	they are lovely and i appreciate the flowers are expensive ones but i think i would have upgraded to the top level as they don_'_t " look " much .
neutral	the website was easy to use but would not accept the addition of a message when i went back to add it and so the recipient hadn_'_t a clue who had sent them !
neutral	one other small point is that my instructions for them to be left with a neighbour if no - one was in were ignored and they were left at the front of the house .
neutral	as it can be frosty , that might have been a problem .
neutral	overall i would use the company again as i have used once before with no_issues and perhaps serenata will actually read this and take these small points on board .
neutral	i had hoped to have personalised the calendar that i purchased but found i couldn_'_t - it wasn_'_t that simple to do or rather the options were too confusing .
neutral	i '_d ordered two calendars but after attempting one , i didn_'_t bother ordering the second one .
neutral	pictures seemed distorted from what i selected .
neutral	not very impressed at all .
neutral	back to photobox or someone_else next year .
neutral	sorry jessops .
neutral	the taste are not good at all .
neutral	i have tried few different of them but all of them are the same .
neutral	sorry it is not very good comment but this is true .
neutral	the service was good and i have received on time .
neutral	can i return them ?
neutral	the sales_team were excellent in measuring , aftercare etc . etc .
neutral	but we both felt it very "' hard_sell " on the insurance .
neutral	instead we left only leaving a deposit .
neutral	while we could have just left !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	ordered waders and they arrived the next_day - perfect !!!
neutral	but i am a size 00 and they are incredibly difficult to get on and off - i '_m a woman and basically there '_s no room for boobs at all !
neutral	is it only men that need waders ?
neutral	customer service good .
neutral	driver needs a better attitude .
neutral	seemed to have an attitude .
neutral	fantastic cleaners or go cleaners are actually one company .
neutral	and i would stay away from both of them !
neutral	i used this company three_times , and the last time has_been a big_disappointment !
neutral	i should get back every_penny i paid !
neutral	not only the cleaning service was very poor and i had to clean everything again , but worst than that i am left with a big damage : 0 brand_new chrome valve plates in a brand_new_bathroom have been completely scratched .
neutral	update_:
neutral	despite the customer service not been very helpful at first , after_posting this review , i have been contacted by the team and a supervisor came around to assess the damage .
neutral	they fully refund the money i paid for the cleaning service and they have covered the cost of replacing the scratched plate in my new shower .
neutral	the communication has_been smooth and polite .
neutral	i understand things sometime can go_wrong , and i hope the cleaners will take better care of other people '_s homes ...
neutral	i will give this company another chance !
neutral	my sink was due to be delivered to me on a thursday .
neutral	it didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	on the friday i had an_email_saying it was dispatched on the thursday , so i waited in hope .
neutral	on saturday i telephoned , and the gentleman i spoke to was no help at all .
neutral	the monday was a bank_holiday , on the tuesday i spoke to a very helpful nice lady i think this was amanda , who looked into it for me and who told me it hadn_'_t been sent out on the thursday , and told me it was being sent out straight_away and i would get it on the wednesday - which i did .
neutral	i discovered , when the plumber was fitting it that the mesh grid was the wrong shape , and i again received helpful treatment from amanda , who gave_me the astrocast telephone_number but she also told me that if i didn_'_t get anywhere with them to come_back to her .
neutral	fortunately astrocast are sending me the correct grid .
neutral	there was only friction with my plumber , who couldn_'_t fit the sink as it hadn_'_t arrived .
neutral	all telephone staff have been calm and efficient apart_from the saturday boy !!
neutral	!
neutral	hi
neutral	i was very impressed by the communication .
neutral	i was not impressed by the feedback that you had received my order , at the point of going out and at point of delivery .
neutral	i was less_than impressed when i found out she didn_'_t know who they were from after paying 0 . 00 for a card .
neutral	whilst you did respond promptly and refunded me the card , it would be good if you could set_up a system where cards are not forgotten .
neutral	i received flowers from yourselves 0_weeks_ago and my friend was just as put out when there was no card and nothing on the paperwork to suggest who sent them so this isn_'_t a ' one off .'
neutral	the lady_who received the flowers said they were lovely .
neutral	however , the delivery was not made until after 0pm .
neutral	this is too late .
neutral	especailly , now that the evenings are dark .
neutral	anyone living_alone may not even open the door at that time in the evening
neutral	i ordered some flowers for mothers_day , to be delivered on the sunday as the website says guaranteed delivery on mothers_day , which is the only_reason i went with this company as my mother works everyday apart_from sunday so i knew she would be home to collect them .
neutral	they infact turned_up on saturday_night at 0 : 00 luckily my brother was there to get them .
neutral	in told the flowers are lovely in themselves which is great , but doesn_'_t excuse they turned_up a day early then what i paid for .
neutral	still_haven_'_t received product more communication would be beneficial .
neutral	it seems like a long time since ordering , worried it is lost , had to call uk and still not arrived .
neutral	the order was delayed by the manufacturer and it would have been better if you '_d kept me informed rather_than me having to enquire again .
neutral	i called 00_minutes before arriving at gatwick and still waited a further 0 minutes for the driver .
neutral	i then called as soon as i had my suitcases for the car to be returned and waited 00_minutes .
neutral	as it was not busy i was dissappointed with this and whilst i will use the search_engine again i will not use the meet and greet service i booked again .
neutral	if you want a goods night sleep don_'_t stop in room 00 ( think it was that number ).
neutral	its right next to the lift shaft , so after the lights and telly go off , all you hear is the lift going up and down until everyone has_gone to bed .
neutral	after a while the noise twindles into the background , but only after about an_hour or so .
neutral	didn_'_t stop for breakfast has had an early flight , so up and off to the airport using the hotels transfer service , which was very efficient , unfortunately can '_t say the same for the return transfer pick_up .
neutral	i rang the number given to me by the reception to say we were in the arrivals_hall , i was told to stay by the information desk and the driver would be in to collect us shortly .
neutral	we stood there for 00_mins , and as i wondered over to the window i saw the transfer_bus disappearing down the road .
neutral	i rang the hotel and they apologised and said he would be back in 00_mins .
neutral	so stood another 00_mins , rang the reception again to which they said he would be 00_mins .
neutral	i wasn_'_t happy , so they said to go to the taxi company over the road and they would bring us back to the hotel on their account .
neutral	went to the taxi office who said they had to have instruction from the hotel which they had not received , so the gentleman very kindly rang the hotel .
neutral	the reception said they knew nothing about it , faulty towers springs to mind .
neutral	eventually they authorised the taxi and we got back for our car .
neutral	no apologies from the hotel reception .
neutral	will not be booking that hotel again .
neutral	goods ( battery tea lights ) are what i wanted unfortunatley with both orders some batteries were dud .
neutral	i did approach customer_services who after a long phone_call said would send replacements , so i placed 0nd order , once again not everything worked .
neutral	i didn_'_t bother with another phone_call as i still_haven_'_t received any replacement batteries .
neutral	i requested a ford_fiesta or similar which i know will seat 0 adults and luggage comfortably
neutral	on arrival we were given a fiat_000 !!
neutral	there was no way we were all going to fit in there !
neutral	!
neutral	i paid an extra 00 euro for upgrade which in itself was not expensive i was annoyed that you would even consider a fiat_000 for 0 people , a joke !
neutral	!
neutral	i knew in_advance about your fuel_policy , however i do feel there should be an option to return the car full of fuel , no matter_how many days you are staying .
neutral	i had to pay for a full_tank , but only used the car to get to and from antequera , at the return the lady commented on how little fuel i had used ...... a refund of say 0 / 0 tank would have been acceptable .
neutral	i returned a bauerfiend knee_support a week_ago through the ' collect ' system physio_room require and i have not received a refund .
neutral	i bought another one so they have done well from me so i am very concerned that i cannot talk to anyone to see where my refund in and that it is not forthcoming either .
neutral	i will be intrigued to know if you do actually respond as you say in the email accompanying the review request .
neutral	our friday early evening trip from dover to calais was a very eerie experience .
neutral	the ship was not very full , it was cold , and there weren_'_t many facilities available .
neutral	it felt very eerie .
neutral	the return to dover on the sunday_afternoon was a slightly better experience .
neutral	on the plus_side , the crossing was a very reasonable_price .
neutral	this is a well_known store and the website does not disappoint .
neutral	if you like john_lewis and do not live_near to a store then this is the ideal alternative especially if you are in the market for a gift for someone .
neutral	good layout and design and visually classy looking .
neutral	delivery is good , and as far i know from relatives , returns are straight_forward .
neutral	i have shopped from amazon and find the website a bit frustrating to be honest , its lay_out is not clear and is not as easy to use as its competitors website
neutral	delivered on time however , would have been better if you '_d put a note through the door stating where you had put the flowors as it was not in an obvious place and they were left_outside for 0_days
neutral	i used to shop at river_island quite_often however started to notice that the clothes i bought from there ( in particular the tshirts ) got holes in them .
neutral	i wouldnt mind so much if the prices were cheap but when you have other shops that are cheaper selling the same sort of thing its quite annoying !
neutral	i must_admit that i love river_island handbags and they do tend to last .
neutral	i find some of the clothes a little chavvy at times and a bit dated .
neutral	the mens clothes seem to be more fashionable than the womens .
neutral	i have bought a lot of flowers from prestige before they are always nice and delivered as promised
neutral	i do not find the website easy there is no obvious place for delivery notes or to enter special_offer code ie free delivery this should not be included as an extra if it is supposed to be free
neutral	items ordered arrived as per delivery estimate but the way they were packed was a big_disappointment .
neutral	the packet arrived completely open and as the plain paper envelope wasnt padded both boxes for the adaptil items purchased were crushed and bent .
neutral	i guess im lucky i got the items at all .
neutral	for this reason ive given 0_stars .
neutral	even if you did not get your winter tires you pay extra and get chains ... business always wins ..
neutral	first time i used you i was very happy , i had a tenant within 0_days and only used the free service .
neutral	this time i upgraded to use of rightmove and used the service for a epc which i was happy with and i love the way you can upload directly to all the sites .
neutral	although this time we only had 0 enquiries , none of which rentify called us about the only way i found out about them was calling and chasing all three occasions they didn_'_t know why i had not been called about them .
neutral	made have a lovely selection of items but the waiting and the delivery ( we don_'_t all work at home , you know ) can be a right pain .
neutral	i know changes have been made to when deliveries can be made which must mean that they are listening to their customers , look_forward to seeing what they do next !
neutral	i bought some crystal skull_vodka from 00dover which was a good price with next_day delivery which was the main draw as it was a present and i had shopped_around for a good price .
neutral	sadly the box for the vodka wasn_'_t in good condition , with the bottom not being sealed_properly which could have been a smashed skull disaster .
neutral	i reported this to cs on the day of receipt and haven_'_t had a response yet .
neutral	while they have a gift option and perhaps a better box would have been chosen for that purpose people buy premium drinks to display / give as gifts and boxes should be intact !
neutral	in my honest_opinion i would not yet recommend this treatment to anyone and i say this because my outcome is not yet known , i am advised that i am_currently undergoing a process of neural adaptation and this could take quite some time as it '_s different for everyone .
neutral	i have only had lens replacement in the right eye at present as the aberrations / blurring were quite alarming in the beginning and at week 00 has settled to some degree .
neutral	my eye still feels as though it '_s ' shutting off ' and in lower light levels , say for instance watching_tv , it just feels_like it '_s been smeared with vaseline ,.
neutral	i have ghosting , star bursts and glare , all perfectly normal with a multifocal iol i '_m reassured but to be honest i '_m ever hopeful that i '_m not one of the very few who apparently never adapt ..... it would be such bad_luck if this were the case i '_m told .
neutral	i '_m not saying there '_s anything wrong with the procedure however if i had been told there was a very real possibility of suffering from side_effects instead of being told they ' re very rare and effect few individuals i doubt whether i '_d have gone ahead with the procedure .
neutral	at this stage i feel that i '_ve gained very little near sight and sacrificed the majority of my general vision , for instance i could see very well generally and just wanted to sharpen up my near sight , only needing glasses for reading small_print and computer work , now i manage with the computer , small_print is still a little difficult but everything in between has_been compromised currently .
neutral	i can '_t say it '_s all bad , i can see , but quality of general vision has_been compromised to such an extent it '_s very annoying and difficult to simply ignore as much as i try .
neutral	so i could not advise anyone to undertake this type of treatment at the moment but since it '_s very much a work in progress i '_m not saying i never would , i '_m just saying not at the moment .
neutral	i '_ve been advised the surgeon wants to wait up to nine_months for neural adaptation to fully take place before we decide_whether to do the left eye with a slightly_different lens which may cure the halos / glare / starbursts / ghosting etc but i '_m not making any decisions without some very real reassurances that this is the cure all .
neutral	i hope my brain adapts , my eyes stop fighting each other and i never have to make a decision whether to do the left eye and i end up with the results i was led to believe having lens replacement would achieve .
neutral	gift basket very nice but was expecting pink_roses for a little_girl birth and not red_roses , was a bit disappointed .
neutral	i was very impressed with the prompt delivery of my trees , but disappointed that the one tree some of the lights didnt work at the top of the tree , and the other tree there was a baubel missing .
neutral	it was too much hassle to send them back so will live with it but for the money i was disappointed .
neutral	i would say 00_% of purchases go very smoothly with achica , when they do it is a fantastic idea and a fantastic range of products .
neutral	the other 00_% however , is not so great , i have had many broken / damaged items which have to go back , incorrect items , things taking months , things withdrawn after purchase - ie they have had my money for a month or so and then say the items are not available , customer_services is only by email and therefore slow .
neutral	i have threatened not to shop with them anymore more than once , but always end up having a look as the product range is so great , if it weren_'_t for that i would rather pay a little more for service you can_rely_on .
neutral	bought 0 sets of knives and a block from pro - cook .
neutral	great value for money and products arrived really speedily but i was a bit disappointed by the packaging .
neutral	the outer_box wasn_'_t attached at the bottom so it wasn_'_t even as if it had been damaged in transit and the box for the steak_knives had slightly flaking outer edges .
neutral	overall , would recommend but if it '_s a present ( these were wedding gifts ) then make_sure you get them and check the packaging first !
neutral	my order arrived quickly , which i was impressed with but that soon turned to disappointment when i opened the parcel to find the completely wrong wellies in there .
neutral	promptly sent them back but wasn_'_t impressed that it cost me £ 0 . 00 to send them back when it only cost £ 0 . 00 to have them sent to me !
neutral	free_returns would be nice when it '_s the company '_s mistake .
neutral	there seemed to long_periods of inactivity apparently due to lack of response from the other party '_s insurance .
neutral	the chiropractor i had used also had grear difficulty contacting you .
neutral	the quality of goods i finally received were of excellent quality .
neutral	i was given a delivery date no time and stayed in all day no delivery arrived .
neutral	the courier was yodel they have a web_site to tell you what depot the goods are in every thing but when you can expect the goods at your property . i think they should follow dpd procedure and let people know a time_scale and correct day .
neutral	this would leave pro_cooks customers much happier .
neutral	i will not be ordering on line again .
neutral	shame as i love the products pro_cooks sell .
neutral	cancelled trip due to illness
neutral	on the website next to the product i wanted it said free delivery on all orders over_£_00 .
neutral	the item i ordered was £_00 and a few_pence , but when i added it , i was still charged for p_&_p and was instead told free delivery only applied on orders over_£_00 .
neutral	i went back to the product page to double_check and confirmed that it definitely clearly_stated free delivery over_£_00 .
neutral	i took a screen grab as proof and emailed customer_services .
neutral	over a week_later and no one has bothered to get back to me about this .
neutral	i went_ahead and purchased anyway as i needed the item quickly for a present , and figured i '_d get the discrepancy sorted_out later .
neutral	whilst the price was good and the item was received quickly , i am disappointed that no one has bothered to get back to me to discuss the discrepancy on the website .
neutral	while most of their products are good their customer service leaves a lot to be desired in my experience .
neutral	last_year i had 0 freezers delivered in succession the first two without_success and the second which_resulted_in a loss of vast_amounts of food overnight .
neutral	i had a fight to get compensation because i had not kept the receipts for the foodstuffs for the freezer , well i don_'_t know anyone who keeps all their receipts for weeks on end .
neutral	i lost over_£_000 in food and meat which was extremely annoying especially as my husband is disabled and i had to give up work 0 years_ago to care for him , we were left out of pocket .
neutral	in the end as a gesture of " goodwill " they gave_me £_00 , do you know how much food you can buy for £_00 these days ?
neutral	? not a lot .
neutral	since then i feel anti argos with justification .
neutral	a friend had recommended travel_republic as she had found a great place to stay on their website .
neutral	so , i thought i '_d give it a go instead of my usual booking . com route .
neutral	it may not be a good reflection of their normal service but my stay at meridian apartments in cardiff was marred_by having so little useful pre_- stay information and this had a knock on effect when we got there to find lots of the usual services we enjoy were missing .
neutral	if you continue to advertise these apartments as being 0_star , when they don_'_t really deserve that rating , guests may continue to book them but may feel misled when they get there and experience what '_s really on offer .
neutral	not in pressed very few flowers
neutral	having paid for the largest_bunch i expected there to be more flowers especially for the price , also received a different vase than i ordered
neutral	the box was broken and the tool was sticking out so not a good
neutral	thing .
neutral	i have used misco for years but something has happened to their site recently .
neutral	i dont mind the look but the categories are all over the place .
neutral	i ordered a belt for my printer and phoned after a week to see where it was only to be told it was out of stock for another 00 days !
neutral	their other supplier had one in stock but it cost more so they would not send it , not my problem !
neutral	it was listed at a price and said in stock , i dont give a rats ass if you messed it up i just need the flippig thing :(
neutral	needed a fire_blanket for the kitchen and this one seemed to fit the bill - neat , well_packaged , unobtrusive , just right for my small kitchen .
neutral	but it is only a fire_blanket , not the crown_jewels and doesn_'_t need security type courier delivery .
neutral	this kept me indoors for the whole of one day , with delivery detailed only as between 0000 and 0000 .
neutral	the online tracking_facility showed the parcel as ' out for delivery ' during the day , up until 0000 ( when it had not arrived ) and the tracking then showed ' at the depot '.
neutral	i emailed to say that i would not be inconvenienced for a second day , and if i happened to be out when it was delivered , it should be left in the porch .
neutral	the reply from the courier acknowledged my instruction and followed up with a standard comment that i must be in to sign for delivery , unless i nominated a neighbour , in which case i needed to give detailed written instruction to that effect .
neutral	get a grip everybody - it '_s a fire_blanket , send it as a normal parcel - which it is - and stop inconveniencing your customers .
neutral	the only_thing that needed putting out when it did arrive was my fiery temper !
neutral	!
neutral	i really think the amount of money charged for postage is far too much , especially as my friend needs to return it for a larger_size it could cost at_least another £_00 .
neutral	in some cases if the product is not suitable you could end up paying a lot of money on postage and have nothing to show for it .
neutral	i appreciate postage is expensive put it really has put me off buying items for less_than £_00 to be in this situation .
neutral	on a positive_note the web_site is great and a really good range of sports items .
neutral	i have been purchasing wild_bird_food for almost 0 years from gjw_titmuss .
neutral	the food is of very good quality ( apart_from one bad packet of peanuts ) and the prices are very competitive .
neutral	i have 0 grievances - 0 is i can never get through on the telephone if i wish to speak to someone personally .
neutral	the other is the courier service they use ( citylink ) are awful .
neutral	they never deliver when they are supposed to .
neutral	i have now been waiting a week for an item since i placed the order .
neutral	add to the fact you can '_t get through to titmuss on the phone to complain makes it very frustrating .
neutral	if i do get through , i get the impression no - one gives a damn and i don_'_t get an_apology or a justified reason as to why my delivery is either missing or delayed .
neutral	infact i think on one occasion titmuss forgot to arrange for delivery as citylink had no details of it .
neutral	i always end up phoning citylink who then say that titmuss have to confirm the delivery instructions .
neutral	grrrrrrrr
neutral	if i could get the quality and prices locally i would definately go elsewhere !
neutral	!
neutral	hello , we made an order from a school for pe kit .
neutral	the logo i thought would be embroided just like previous t - shirts we have ordered however they were printed on .
neutral	the logo was way too_big , and the school logo is red background with black stars however the background logo is grey .
neutral	overall we are not too happy with the products however i know to reorder would mean paying again .
neutral	previously the tops were great , however unfortunately a bit disappointed with this order
neutral	everthing was fine but unfortunately item was no good and had to return it . i was not impressed at all with the £_00 charge to return item which will not be refunded so therefore i '_d think_twice about ordering again think they need to start thinking_about free_returns service
neutral	i love the food but received no reply to an_email i sent about varying my plan .
neutral	i have now sent a second email via the website and hope i have better luck and get a response .
neutral	facebook was all craze .
neutral	and so it should have been .
neutral	until they put timeline in .
neutral	i dont_think anybody really likes it .
neutral	messaging no_longer works at 000_% sometimes you send a message more than once or not at all .
neutral	games on there are good but tbh .
neutral	since timeline post people have moved over to twitter .
neutral	this is the first time i have seen the flowers i '_ve sent .
neutral	i thought it was a pink bouquet but it turned_out to be quite an insipid non description colour .
neutral	the flowers were good quality and fresh .
neutral	flowers were pretty but arrival in a delivery box means that the high impact one would like from ordering flowers as a gift is significantly_reduced .
neutral	i was just a bit disappointed with the size of the bunch of flowers when they were delivered for the price .
neutral	i '_ve tried and tested many different supplier '_s e_- juice , and i '_ve probably spent more money since january on vaping then i would of on smoking .
neutral	i know everyone has different tastes , but i '_m still looking for a juice that you know the flavour without looking at the bottle .
neutral	many smell the part , but fail on the vape .
neutral	hence i have many bottles with at_least 0ml in them sitting in a draw .
neutral	i ordered 00mg bananarama and strawberry fields , the banana failed_miserably on all counts , whilst the strawberry i '_ll give a 0 out of 00 , i can taste a hint of strawberry , and there '_s no horrible after taste , it is one i will use whilst my search continues .
neutral	the items are order so good and i am enjoying cooking in them .
neutral	stephanie one of the staff_member was good and helpful ( thanks ).
neutral	few_days after purchasing , the items went on a offer + 00_%_discount ( from £_000 to 000 ), wish i had waited a little_bit longer .
neutral	the first delivery guy so in a rush , literally drew the items by the door , as a results some items where broken .
neutral	he was so rude as well .
neutral	the advertisment at the end of your screen appears to be part of it and i did not realise that my order had been sent already .
neutral	when i had finished looking at the advert which was difficult to exit from , it was too late according to your response to me to cancel the second order which i made , thinking that the first one had aborted .
neutral	it was an expensive mistake and i am not sure i will use the site again .
neutral	very quick with sending everything and transferring the money was just disappointed with the fact that i got £_00 for a £_000 phone .
neutral	apart fron that verry good .
neutral	great quality and fitted well only problem was the seal was missing for the part that screws from the top through the tray so it was a good job i could use my existing seal .
neutral	this was my first order with the whisky_exchange .
neutral	i received an_email_saying that my order had been processed and was being prepared for despatch .
neutral	0 / 0_days_later i then received an_email_saying that my ordered item was out of stock and would be despatched the following week .
neutral	my order arrived and it looked very well_packed and clearly_marked as fragile .
neutral	when i opened the outer_box , the bottle was indeed very well_packed with really tough bubble_wrap but the bottle had been taken out of the gift box and this was then folded to fit into the outer_packaging box .
neutral	this means that the gift box is warped and creased down one side which i '_m_sure my dad won_'_t really care about ( father '_s day gift ) but i '_m quite disappointed .
neutral	the website was easy to use and the flowers were delivered as promised .
neutral	however , although there is a disclaimer stating " our florists may substitute flowers and sundries for a suitable_alternative , similar in style , quality and value depending_on availability .
neutral	", i felt that the flowers that were delivered were substantially different than those pictured .
neutral	in particular , i chose this arrangement because it did not contain lilies or carnations , however the bouquet that was actually delivered contained both .
neutral	it would be preferable to be able to indicate any flowers you didn_'_t want used in your arrangement .
neutral	apart_from that , i had no issue with the purchase .
neutral	i shop at aldi in shipley bradford every now and again and love the surprising extra one off items you can find .
neutral	however the cheaper shopping_experience should not out way a friendly and welcoming staff , i know they ' re busy and want you through asap , but being rushed by unfriendly staff will put me off returning .
neutral	the first time i ordered from precious_little one i was really impressed as my purchase arrived quickly .
neutral	however on my secound purchase i was charged 0 . 00 delivery charge and had to wait nearly a week for it to arrive which i thought was really poor as i could have bought it somewhere_else for cheaper .
neutral	the breakfasts are tasty and i enjoyed them .
neutral	the soups were ok but rather sweet tasting .
neutral	as for the dinners ....
neutral	i just couldn_'_t eat them .
neutral	it was worse_than aeroplane food .
neutral	easy to heat up but just not appetising .
neutral	we had to wait 00_mins ( and drive around the block ) when we first
neutral	got to south_terminal destpite calling 00_mins before .
neutral	didn_'_t really need that stress !
neutral	the drivers were courteous and the car was awaiting us on our return which saved us having to wait in the cold !
neutral	i usually get really good service from them , so i wouldn_'_t leave , but the flowers i just ordered died within a couple of days when they normally last much longer .
neutral	mostly my transactions are fine with very , however i must_say they do lack in customer service to be honest .
neutral	recently i had to wait several weeks for a product to come into stock and be delivered ready for a holiday , only for it to arrive with days to spare and be completely the wrong_colour .
neutral	upon_contacting very to complain that i would now either have to make do with the product i hadn_'_t selected or go without and the response i got back was very generic and basically left me feeling they don_'_t actually care about mistakes they make .
neutral	saying that , 00_% of the time i have no_issues .
neutral	the items were great but delivery was a nightmare !
neutral	took a week to get here and was being sent to wrong_address .
neutral	don_'_t use dhl
neutral	package was sent to wrong number of address had to contact why i had not received package . surely all they had to do was check my order as i ordered on the internet .
neutral	they sent email to say they had received my order so my address was there
neutral	this was the first time that i have ordered online with ellis_brigham .
neutral	it was a mixed experience
neutral	pros_:
neutral	- arrived quickly
neutral	- well_wrapped
neutral	- order was correct
neutral	cons_:
neutral	- expensive delivery cost with no option to pick_up in store
neutral	- when returning to store , they said that i couldn_'_t return sale goods for a refund on my card ( only exchange or credit ).
neutral	of course this is incorrect as i purchased them online and not in store but it meant that i had to have an awkward conversation and then have them call head_office to confirm that i could return them .
neutral	it was time wasting and embarrassing especially as i knew that i was correct .
neutral	i ordered a large basket of flowers , in pink and white flowers .
neutral	however although the basket was pretty in orange flowers it was not very big , and after 0_days the lillys have wilted , which is quite unusual for lillys .
neutral	delivery was fine and arrived as previously arranged .
neutral	little disappointed to be completely honest .
neutral	as above , prices are great but since 00 lve had 0 item delivered still_waiting for 0 more but l ordered 0 bottles of the same mens fragrances
neutral	i opted for the instant delivery for my son '_s microsoft_points , unlike before the code would come through later .
neutral	i had an_email to say code was attached but on opening it that '_s all i had was the message_saying codes are delivered before 0pm .
neutral	i checked back with my emails before 0pm and still no further email had been received , so i tried resending my code and the same message came through .
neutral	i then contacted gamesbite via_email and jax got in touch with the code which was in perfect working order .
neutral	i emailed my thanks to jax and had a reply back which was friendly , so that '_s why all '_s well that end '_s well ;-) thanks and i will use again .
neutral	pet - supermarket provided the goods as ordered and within a reasonable time_scale .
neutral	however , the delivery company ( yodel ) failed to provide satisfactory service .
neutral	they dumped the goods just inside the gate in full_view of anyone passing , but out of view of the house .
neutral	i was in all day , but they made no attempt to approach the house and let_me know the goods were there .
neutral	if it had rained , any attempt to lift the goods would have meant the cardboard_packaging was too sodden to retain the 00kg it contained .
neutral	pet - supermarket would have got 0_stars if it were not for the poor delivery .
neutral	my fitting had to be delayed by one day after the tyres ordered were used for another customer .
neutral	i was contacted about half way through the morning scheduled for the fitting so had waited around for their arrival only to be told they would then not be coming .
neutral	although the fitting was rescheduled for first thing the following_morning , the fitter did not arrive until about 00 . 00am so i don_'_t_believe that i was the first fitting after all and although the work was completed to my satisfaction , i was delayed in setting off on a long trip that day .
neutral	i contacted the customer_services to ask for a partial_refund and was offered £_00 , which i accepted and was told it would be processed within 0 - 0 working_days .
neutral	today , i have had to chase this up again so hopefully i will receive my refund in the next week or so .
neutral	the order was quite a long time arriving and when i rang to enquire they explained that there had been a problem with the supplier .
neutral	it would have been nice to be informed of this before i had to make the phone_call myself .
neutral	there wasn_'_t much information about the particular product i ordered and therefore it was unsuitable but the quality of the products were very good though .
neutral	ordered .
neutral	delivery arrived next_day .
neutral	very impressed as first time .
neutral	great packing .
neutral	possibly too much in terms of other product literature enclosed ..
neutral	well_done !
neutral	brilliant product at a good price but very slow delivery i '_m afraid .
neutral	even_though i had an_email to say it was dispatched about a day after order it was not delivered until a week after .
neutral	i even sent a chasing email .
neutral	sorry beautybay , a delivery time of over a week is not acceptable these days
neutral	we booked the best room ( 0 ) in a hotel with a great location .
neutral	other rooms were small with tables and chairs next to the pool or with terraces walked through by other guests .
neutral	we did our research and got the best room - at top of hotel with a private terrace with sun_beds .
neutral	a table and chairs and a jacuzzi .
neutral	hotel was spotlessly_clean .
neutral	breakfast was very good - maybe over ambitious for the space available .
neutral	amazing selection of greek appetizers each morning but they were served cold - chilled not just tepid - which although disappointing for me was correct from a food safety point of view .
neutral	who does eat cold poached eggs ??
neutral	?
neutral	the staff were fantastic - so friendly and nothing was too much_trouble .
neutral	the hotel was really busy - lots of people staying just a night so cleaning was really important - and they did it well .
neutral	lovely pool - just a little cold but that was a challenge .
neutral	only one whinge .
neutral	0 young girls turned_up and used the pool_area each day .
neutral	clearly relatives of the staff .
neutral	they were often noisy and monopolised the small pool when guests wanted - or i wanted to use it .
neutral	it is a family run hotel but the children were a nuisance with their screams at sunset .
neutral	the sunset views were amazing
neutral	we only saw the olympic rep once - she showed us the transfer mini_bus and left us - pretty useless but we didn_'_t want a rep and welcome drinks and all that stuff
neutral	i was slightly_disappointed with the flowers because what my friend has received did not look like what was advertised .
neutral	also , i understand that the flowers have been delivered to the courier room of the recipient address before the time requested yesterday .
neutral	however , my friend who was leaving the workplace ( last day at work ) did not get the flowers that day .
neutral	she was only informed about the flowers at 0pm after she has left .
neutral	therefore , she had to go back to the office today to collect them .
neutral	i was hoping that the delivery person would have told the courier room to call the recipient at the time the flowers were delivered .
neutral	i do appreciate the support_team for helping_me ensure the flowers get delivered by 0pm but just slightly_disappointed that my friend didn_'_t receive it on the same day , instead had to travel for another hour into the office to collect them .
neutral	of late delivery failure after delivery failure .
neutral	given a time and date then delivery people ring to say it has not arrived at their depot can not deliver .
neutral	also lots of items supposedly in stock only to then be told after order accepted not available any more .
neutral	not as good as it was going down_hill fast , bring back the old crew please at_least they were polite and helpful .
neutral	am seriously thinking of stopping once i have finished paying what i owe
neutral	had my son on as a person to speak on my behalf for over 0 years then all of a sudden he is taken off and i have to fill all the paper_work out again .
neutral	the availability as published on the website was too vague - items supposedly available at the time i ordered took several weeks to arrive ; others supposedly shipped from september arrived much later than i expected .
neutral	the most worrying was the lime plant which was supposedly available when i ordered but wasn_'_t sent for a couple of weeks , by which time i was away .
neutral	this meant that the plant spent about 0_days in the post_office sorting depot , having lost most of the compost around the roots , before i was able to pick it up .
neutral	even the onion sets arrived later than i expected .
neutral	if i had bought them from a garden_centre , i could plant them when it '_s convenient to me , rather when it '_s convenient to suttons .
neutral	i bought a couple of gorgeous baby hats , which were stupidly expensive but so sweet i couldn_'_t_resist .
neutral	i probably would have bought a baby grow too had all the sweetest ones not been gender specific .
neutral	i love the products that you sell they work well and are of excellent quality but my constant bone of contention is the delivery charge .
neutral	as a practitioner i use quality suppliers such as cytoplan , nutri and nsp to mention a few and none of them charge as much as higher_nature and generally the parcel is delivered next_day .
neutral	recently i needed some omega_0 fish_oil_capsules ( 00 ) quickly for a client and it was actually cheaper for me to buy from a local_store (£ 0 . 00 ) than to order from higher_nature - £_00 . 00
neutral	this seems crazy to me and surely someone somewhere in hn could review this concern .
neutral	the parcel was supposed to be collected on monday 00th_april .
neutral	i waited in from 0 . 00am to 0 . 00pm and no - one came to collect it .
neutral	i rang interparcel . com at 0 . 00am the following_morning and they said it would be collected the following_day which was the wednesday .
neutral	i asked why it couldn_'_t be collected that day as it was hermes who were at fault but the lady i spoke to said they wouldn_'_t collect it that day , it would have to be tomorrow .
neutral	( i would have to wait in again ) basically the parcel was collected two_days_later than it should have been .
neutral	not happy .
neutral	the flowers were delivered on time .
neutral	i had upgraded the bouquet to grand and they were supposed to be white and orange .... was disappointed , lots of white daisy like flowers , very few of the orange flowers and filled in with small yellow ish flowers .
neutral	as the heading said ... not as seen in the picture !
neutral	i have placed 0 separate_orders & each order received so far has_been missing at_least 0 envelopes which means i can not post the cards .
neutral	bit disappointed as the cards are beautiful .
neutral	also no way to contact customer_services to has extra envelopes sent out which is not great if you have any_issues .
neutral	i used to shop at tesco every week and loved the clubcard_points_system but after a bad shopping_experience where the aisles where all blocked off with cages for stacking shelves , getting to the till and there be no bags ( i lived on the third storey ) and them turning the lights off an_hour before closing i wrote a letter complaining_about the low standard i recieved .
neutral	i recieved a reply back basically saying ' oh well , never mind '.
neutral	i change to morrisons and now spend at_least £_00 a week there .
neutral	i always knew tesco was never great for quality of product but i overlooked that because it was cheap .
neutral	i will never do my weekly_shop there again !
neutral	the only problem i have encountered was once when i tried to order i found their advertising offer had finished but was still being offered on site .
neutral	i did contact them by telephone and was advised the offer had finished but wasn_'_t offered the item at the price still being advertised .
neutral	bestilte to ting , der kunne være i en lille kuvert , hvorfor jeg forventede levering i løbet at et_par dage .
neutral	det to 0 - 0 dage - så kunne jeg lige så godt have købt i en dyreforretning .
neutral	i recently ordered some perfume from cheapsmells . com and unfortunately it wasn_'_t that great .
neutral	it smelled very ' watered_down ' and is nothing like what the real perfume smells like ... :( i will think_twice before i order anything_else from them ... they used to be my first choice ... shame !
neutral	when we finalised our booking we found out that meals are " not required " though the price was advertised as including meals ???
neutral	?
neutral	service great and purchased items up to expectation .
neutral	however a shipping charge of £_00 . 00 is a rip_off .
neutral	small package sent by royal_mail who charge the same if item sent a mile_away or to the outer_hebrides .
neutral	at most cost of postage would have been around £ 0 . 00 first_class .
neutral	in view of this unlikely i will make any further_purchases or recomend to friends .
neutral	never used this company before , but had bought this product ( hot hair 00 " glam ponytail ) from somewhere_else before so knew the product .
neutral	it took over a week to arrive , which was ok because i wasn_'_t in a hurry but i was expecting it to arrive sooner .
neutral	also , the colour of the ponytail was a lot blonder than i '_d expected .
neutral	from the picture on the website the one i went for looked as if it was a mix of blonde and brown , but when it arrived it was totally blonde .
neutral	it '_s not a disaster and i '_ll probably still wear it , but i was put off returning it because paul '_s - hair - world mentions when you buy stuff from them that they charge you 00_% of the purchase price as an admin_fee to deal with refunds .
neutral	i '_m not even sure this is legal as per our consumer_rights , but i simply couldn_'_t be bothered with the faff of returning the thing .
neutral	in short , good price , good quality item ( although not sure it really matched the one in the picture ) and slow delivery .
neutral	i would use them again , but only if i had already seen what i wanted ' in the flesh ', as it were , so i could confirm the colour , and if i wasn_'_t in a hurry .
neutral	that '_s why i only give them three stars .
neutral	i '_ve use this website a couple of times but this time was very disappointed that having put the order in on wednesday last_week the order did ' nt arrive until_0pm monday her 00th_birthday was almost over .
neutral	i know she was at home because we phoned in the afternoon to congratulate_her hoping the flowers would be there .
neutral	got item quickly , but even_tho ordered a sml cat woman costume it ( 0 / 00 ) according to size_chart it was more like a 00 / 00 !
neutral	bought the pro_cook mandolin last_week .
neutral	i thought it would save me lot of time .
neutral	there were no instructions / safety guidelines with it so had to use the trial and error method .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	i then travelled 00 miles to nearest pro_cook shop for advice .
neutral	they printed of the necessary instructions and showed me how to use the product safely . i now look_forward to using the mandolin with confidence .
neutral	i hope this is a good investment .
neutral	arrived quickly but i thought the packaging of the item was poor .
neutral	as much as i enjoy shopping in hobbycraft , i '_ve found slowly but surely that production selection has_gone down within my favourite section of craft .
neutral	paper craft .
neutral	now i understand that it '_s not possible to stock every_single product available .
neutral	but after a lot of the stores were done up and it seemed like half the products disappeared .
neutral	i '_ve also noticed it with other sections too .
neutral	also i find hobbycraft very expensive , seeing as hc is the only big craft store in the uk , you '_d think you wouldn_'_t need to have such high prices on things .
neutral	i run a business myself and understand profit_margins , but some of hc '_s are crazy
neutral	we stayed for a 0 night stay in a family room at feltham - travelodge - london .
neutral	the hotel was slightly away from main street hidden within a shopping centre .
neutral	once found we parked the car in local asda which only charged 0 pound for 0hrs .
neutral	we checked in staff were pleasant hotel reception was clean .
neutral	we arrived at our room which was clean , although they had not provided any extra covers for pull - out sleeping arrangements .
neutral	a hair_dryer would have been welcome , and less noise from neighbouring flats over the way across the car - park .
neutral	breakfast was full - english + cont , plenty to be had so long as requested has one gentleman did explain , that once he had taken a serving of the scrambled_egg there would have been none for those waiting ie_: us !
neutral	but all in all not a bad spot , i '_ve paid less and had a better service in other areas of london with cheaper parking with tl .
neutral	the flowers were hidden_behind a bush at the front of the house and we ' re not spotted until alerted by me and it was supposed to be a surprise .
neutral	the instruction was to leave with number 00 if the recipient wasn_'_t in
neutral	the flowers were lovely , but let_down by the delivery .
neutral	i purchased the white blackout film for a upvc door .
neutral	the instructions were clear but to ensure i got a smooth / clean stick i also watched demo video via youtube .
neutral	following the instructions the only problem i had was cutting the edges .
neutral	the material was quite heavy and cutting a straight line wasn_'_t easy .
neutral	however , i left the door to dry with what looked like an bubble free adhesion .
neutral	unfortunately , as it dried more and more bubbles appeared and i because it had dried they couldn_'_t be removed .
neutral	i am now left with an unsatisfactory finished effect which is pitted with air_bubbles .
neutral	the instructions should say how long you need to smooth the plastic down for and i would have avoided this .
neutral	products are excellent but the delivery man expected me to collect the heavy box from him two flights of stairs below - i paid full price for delivery and that to me means to my front_door .
neutral	but : over the years there have been so many cut backs , which has made the trip less enjoyable .
neutral	there are less facilities in the cabin , i . e .
neutral	towels , toiletries etc .
neutral	i the dining_room we find the biggest change .
neutral	the quality of the meals , especially the buffet has reduced greatly , there is much less choice , very poor quality fruit juice at breakfast , very little fresh_fruit , and much more .
neutral	but the most aggravating thing is the prohibitive price of all drinks , especially soft_drinks and water .
neutral	also the absence of prices for soft_drinks on the menu .
neutral	people see the total_rip_off prices for a glass of wine , for example , and decide to have a soft drink , not realising that they pay almost the same amount of money .
neutral	even in the shop one can buy 00 cans of beer for less_than 00 small bottles of water .
neutral	somehow there should be a law against that type of pricing
neutral	i bought the cigar for my husband , as his friend has one , and thought it would save him money and cut him down on real cigars as they are expensive , he_likes the cigar look , but would like it to have a cuban cigar flavour , as he_finds it very bland in taste , as he put it , its tasteless as far as a cigar goes but its something to do with my hands , if i don_'_t have any proper cigars and feel like a smoke .
neutral	very pleased with speed of order - only_thing that service lacks is confirmation_email .
neutral	they don_'_t send one out and i reordered as i though the original request hadn_'_t gone_through .
neutral	you need to check account to get confirmation that payment has_gone_through .
neutral	not really got time to do this so would prefer some notification to save making a second purchase .
neutral	as it is i '_ll use the stuff i bought , but i would have preferred to wait before paying out another £_00 or so .
neutral	good choice of flights .
neutral	reasonable_prices .
neutral	had to chase them up to book special meals on plane and for e ticket a few_days before_departure .
neutral	this company charges £_00 . 00 for a domestic service .
neutral	going to the company directly - they offer the exact_same service ( as confirmed by the company i spoke to themselves ) for £ 0 . 00 including_vat .
neutral	i asked ip bout this and the woman just gave_me a load of evasive lies about how they don_'_t get a discount on the smaller packages when [_external_reference_] tell me they give extensive discounts .
neutral	the company service is generally good - but i have not yet had a problem with an order besides the courier turning_up at 00 past 0 when everyone had gone home ( and a 0 o_clock cut_off was specified ) but the driver was more than happy to return the following_day .
neutral	best part is it is convenient - i don_'_t have time to search dozens of sites to find the best company .
neutral	the ordering experience was very good .
neutral	i chose a mixed bouquet to send to a friend who had been in hospital .
neutral	the bouquet she received was red_roses .
neutral	i would not have sent red_roses to her .
neutral	was emailed at 00am to say flowers were on their way .
neutral	grumpy man turned_up at 0 . 00pm and said ' here you go '.
neutral	also i was disappointed that my details hadn_'_t been put on the card so my recipient had no idea who the flowers were from !
neutral	i don_'_t think i will be areturning customer !
neutral	i was very impressed with the prices however the range of products was limited .
neutral	you know , i was so impressed right up to the time i opened the box .
neutral	talk about doing everything right , right balance of email and text to let_me know where my order was , confirmation of what i had ordered , when it woud be delivered , options to change , the works !
neutral	whilst i am not colour blind i am flexible so when the red kettle popped out of the box rather_than the cream i thought hey that '_s not so bad .
neutral	so i emailed and got a nice email back saying sorry about that and if you are happy to keep it we will send an amended purchase note , which they did .
neutral	so , no , not right colour but very good customer service and i would use you again as you also represented good value for money !
neutral	our 0st try to buy the imist 0 ended when the website said it was out of stock , so we went and bought a competitors product which does not need to be filled .
neutral	on return to the website it was still saying out of stock , but then we noticed that there were colour choices - we tried the next colour ( blue ) and low and behold we were in business .
neutral	wonder_how many folk dont notice the colour choice and simply give up like we did 0st time round ?
neutral	you might want to change the web_site to remove the out of stock colour for now .
neutral	when the imist 0 kit arrived we were very keen to try it out .
neutral	as new users of e_- cigs we had never filled a cart before and were a bit_nervous aboutb handling the e_- liquid .
neutral	the instructions are minimal and have been translated into english by someone_who does not speak_english as their 0st language .
neutral	there are basically no detailed_instructions on how to safely fill the cart .
neutral	it astounds me that safersigs can find the time to put up a you - tube vid extoling the virtues of the imist 0 but not show you how to fill the cart !
neutral	the culture of safersigs comes across as if they expect all customers to be old hands at using these products .
neutral	the website and all the marketing seems geared to existing users , which is not only unhelpful for new users , it is frankly slightly intimidating , making new users feel inadequite for not being_able to understand the various products , and what they need to include in their first order .
neutral	you guys really need to work on this if you want to claim your share of the millions of new users who are going to start using e_- cigs in the near_future .
neutral	final coment is that the product is excellent but the future lies in cartomizers in our opinion , only the most dedicated users want to fiddle with filling carts and cleaning atomizers , the rest of us just want it simple and easy .
neutral	hope you make an imist 0 with prefilled cartomizers for us mere mortals .
neutral	i purchased the gift_vouchers and they firstly arrived late but this was the fault of royal_mail .
neutral	once i had received them i found i had been sent the wrong amount , less_than what i had paid for !
neutral	staff have now posted me the remaining amount due to me .
neutral	disappointed problems throughout this order but should be sorted soon .
neutral	a little disappointed regarding delivery .
neutral	took 0_days and parcel was left_outside at front of house as i was out in afternoon .
neutral	good job that we are in a good neighbourhood !.
neutral	some great deals , and real_bargains , some really dodgy places and offers also posted .
neutral	waited 0_weeks to hear back after several e_-_mails and calls to a manchester based carting treat that i booked for the family .
neutral	another occasion managed to get a great deal on a lovely hotel / weekend away .
neutral	research needed on the businesses advertised i would suggest before buying , but it would be helpful if groupon were slight more selected in the businesses they selected and dealt_with !
neutral	gumtree is promoted as a free service to enable you to sell your unwanted goods .
neutral	to an extent it is true , you can sell some items for free , but others to get any real exposure you need to upgrade to some of their paid enhanced listings .
neutral	it is a little sneaky when you think e_- bay is upfront about fees before you list and they have a much larger following .
neutral	i would say give gumtree a go within the free listings , and if no cigar consider other options before paying .
neutral	gumtree still might be the right place for your unwanted_items .
neutral	on the first day we had a very enjoyable trip around the sights of london .
neutral	it was good to link various_places and note where to return to next time we are in london , when we have more time to explore .
neutral	the ghost walk in the evening was informative and the guide was a good host , involving the whole group .
neutral	the second day was a different matter - we were not told that roads were closed and therefore despite waiting for ages at bus_stops , a bus was never going to turn_up !
neutral	it took the rep from a rival company to advise us .
neutral	we walked across to the other side of the river ( quite a walk !)
neutral	only to discover that that bus_stop was not being serviced either !
neutral	we wasted a lot of our valuable time before giving up and resorting to the underground !
neutral	the print was excellent quality and was printed promptly - i was satisfied with the product .
neutral	however i received no notification that the print was ready for collection and the print_space staff we ' re rude and impatient when i went to pick_up the print from the shop .
neutral	hope i have not been duped !
neutral	! maybe bank_holiday delay ?
neutral	i ordered for next_day delivery as moving_house .
neutral	i waited in all day only to find out it was ' lost in transit ' - they did however agree to deliver on the saturday at no extra_cost .
neutral	easy to follow web_site but irritating only being_able to look at one date at a time on a chosen route to compare_prices and choose a day of travel , having to go back and re enter details each time is time_consuming .
neutral	i had a consultation booked for 00am this morning at the canary_wharf clinic .
neutral	just about to leave home at 00 to 0 and received a call with the excuse that my appointment was cancelled as they couldn_'_t open the clinic door .
neutral	i have taken a day off work as had my husband as he needed to accompany me .
neutral	i cannot_believe that in a modern office block there would not be a way or someone_who would be able to gain_access .
neutral	i am so dissapointed and feel that i cannot trust optimax .
neutral	thank_you optimax , i am going to give it another go , have plucked_up the courage again to make another appointment , and will review after my experience .
neutral	i ordered the item on 00th_august by the 00 it still had not arrived and i had to make 0 phone_calls to find out where it was .... spoke to a very nice lady_who said the item had been out of stock but i would get delivery the following_day ... which i did .... would like to have been informed of this before having to send unanswered e_mail and then 0 phone_calls .... maybe just unlucky with this item and will use this site again .... but a speedier delivery would be nice !
neutral	!
neutral	!
neutral	the item was very quick at being delivered very impressed ...
neutral	but wrong item sent .
neutral	this is the 0rd year we have purchased a kitchen calendar from jessops , and while overall we are pleased with the product , and the ease with which we load our photos for it etc_., i feel that while the price has remained more or less the same , the quality is beginning to drop ( there was no plastic cover on it this year ).
neutral	also as jessops stores have / are closing , you now have to pay postage and packaging , which adds to the overall cost ...
neutral	it was the best thing when i left bt and cheaper
neutral	hi i have recived my order from you but they were the wrong_size and no_longer required i have sent them back by post and would be greatful if you would give me a full_refund thank_you pauline crawford
neutral	i brought the bambino_mio birth to potty pack mixed , they arrived quickly , so i cant_complain_about that , but was disappointed to find a few things after looking at them for a while and washing them .
neutral	** i order the mixed but they are mainly white , only 0 different colors in the pack .
neutral	i excepted this , as white will be easier to wash i suppose , but not what i was expecting from the picture online !
neutral	** the covers are a mixture of old style , and new style covers , most of them are the old style without the fold_down laundry tabs , and not double legged stretchy to ensure leakage .
neutral	i got 0 new style ones .
neutral	** after washing all my nappies ( cotton parts ) and hanging on the line , i found 0 was not actually finished , the edges are not sown up and its seems are all on show , not great !
neutral	looks like a cotton rag !
neutral	** after sorting_out the nappy_covers into sizes i was missing 0 of one size and got 0 extra of a different size , i wanted to send these back to get them replaced with the right size , so i contact them , told them the problem , they told me bambino_mio would send me a postage bag and i could send it back along with a letter explaining the problem , after waiting a week for the bag to arrive , i wrote my letter , packed it up and made my journey to the post_office , only to be told that they had not paid the postage and ii would have to pay , so , i took them back home , i then contact plo again who said they would send the postage , but they emailed me a postage_stamp , and i dont have a printer , and after all the hassle i cannot be bothered to contact them again .
neutral	so i have just brought extra of the missing size covers .
neutral	( in the new style !)
neutral	i would say that the price reflects what you actually get , its cheaper on hear for a reason , it feels_like they might be seconds , some had a few marks on , but they are so much_cheaper on plo , i feel happy to except the flaws .
neutral	i have not actually used them yet , as my little one has not arrive yet , but i look_forward to using the product
neutral	lovely leather_suite and good service , but then after two_weeks we noticed fraying stitching on one arm and a rip in one of the seat_pads , new sections are being sent to replace the damaged areas but i would have preferred a full replacement instead of swooping sections which surely won_'_t do it any good but this apparently isn_'_t an option .
neutral	did not like meet and greet takes up start of holiday . villa had not been cleaned very well , cobwebs in bathrooms and down the side of drawers .
neutral	villa a bit remote and traverners closed at beach .
neutral	villa had great views and good equipment . map to get to villa was very poor would be better to direct from main_road .
neutral	\ website timed out with no explanation , very unproffessional
neutral	i was very disappointed that there were no instructions with the ' kit ' for the shower .
neutral	this resulted_in my workman having_difficulty in working it out - his first time with the aquabord system - and a botched joint .
neutral	with a kit it is usual to get at_least some directions .
neutral	will go for one of the other boards next time .
neutral	i paid almost 0 times the amount of the actual ticket price and only received 0 whereas i was sure i had ordered 0
neutral	although the flowers arrived on the day requested , the recipient came home to find them wilted on the doorstep with some bedraggled kitchen roll wrapped round the stems half heartedly .
neutral	she managed to revive them an_hour later by dosing them with aspirin in a bucket of water .
neutral	however the initial impact of viewing the bouquet was not what i , as the sender , had hoped for .
neutral	( id_0000000 )
neutral	got my tickets for one direction belfast in november i did pay alot more than ticket price but dont really care because the look on my daughters face was priceless .
neutral	after a very tough year and alot of deaths in the family i knew_exactly_what would lift her spirits unfortunately the concert was sold out months earlier then fortunately ( i hope ) i found ones available on this website ................ i got printed out e tickets delivered to me very promptly .
neutral	im just getting a little_worried after_reading_reviews that maybe we might travel the whole way to belfast ( i have a hotel booked and all ) and not get in and most of all my daughter would be devastated im feelin anxious :-(
neutral	your car is well cared for and the actual parking and bus are very good .
neutral	however , beware when using the machine to check in .
neutral	we entered all the details correctly ( or so we thought ) and upon our return the car was not ready as the system had us down for returning a day later .
neutral	probably users error however we thought we had entered the details correctly and the machine accepted them .
neutral	this resulted_in a half an_hour wait in the cold after a very long and tiring journey .
neutral	we ordered the flowers and got next_day delivery .. great .. but we ' re delivered to 00 not 00 !
neutral	luckily , got taken to the correct house by honest people who lived there !
neutral	villa very average compared to previous villas we have stayed in .
neutral	bathrooms in need of modernisation , a lot of mould and lime scale could do with a good clean !
neutral	en - suite
neutral	shower not draining properly and main_bathroom only half a screen hence very wet floors .
neutral	pool was also not cleaned during our stay and quite mucky .
neutral	surrounding_area half developed lots of scrub land and graffitti .
neutral	would definitely not stay here again .
neutral	burgers , sausages and steak were great on the long_awaited barbeque . the only product we were unsure of were the chicken wings which smelt very chickeny , even unpleasant , when i took them out of the plastic pack ( only 0_days after receiving them and kept in fridge of course ).
neutral	everything else very good .
neutral	perhaps because of easter , but the delivery took longer_than_expected and , annoyingly , having placed instructions on the order to leave the parcel in the back porch , it was returned to the post_office sorting_office requiring a 00 mile_round_trip to collect .
neutral	why have a space to leave instructions if they are ignored ?
neutral	disspponted that flowers arrived after funeral party had left the house .
neutral	they were taken in by a kind neighbour .
neutral	the flowers were however beautiful and more than met my expectations .
neutral	the price was brilliant , but paid_extra for details to be sent , my daughter has travelled and come_back and still_haven_'_t received them
neutral	sent for two haligen heaters th ey came both were broken sent them back got a new set one was broken one good sent broken one back waiting to see what wi ll happen know we are oap and really need them soon
neutral	i really like using topcashback but have been very disppointed lately when having spent over_£_000 on late rooms and £_000 on the trainline that my account has not been credited for these transactions .
neutral	which has a value of £_00 .
neutral	i will_continue to use the topcashback service but find it very frustrating when this happens /
neutral	i had planned cocktails for a party the night of friday 00th when my cocktail_mixers were due to arrive unfortunately they didn_'_t arrive until saturday_morning , nothing to surprise my guests with just the usual .
neutral	i ordered a present , which arrived promptly , however , once opened , i discovered parts_missing and parts broken .
neutral	i emailed straight_away , clear_instructions on the email about returning items , however as it was after office hours , there was no reply .
neutral	i rang first thing in the morning to chase_up my email .
neutral	the member of staff i spoke to made it very easy , he simply arranged for a new delivery , with extra packaging and advised me to dispose of the broken item .
neutral	although initial inconvenience , the problem was resolved quickly with limited fuss .
neutral	the ordered items looked a very good quality and really interesting and different ( saved for later so cannot_comment fully ) but the packaging was inadequate causing squashing and tearing of packed boxes .
neutral	i have been assured this was a temporary blip so will probably use again .
neutral	i was quite annoyed to get the order with an item missing , as unfortunately it was the one i had gone to the site for in the first place . the dispatch form had been ticked with a pen to say it was there , but it wasn_'_t .
neutral	i got the impression of a small operation .
neutral	it might be an idea then to make_sure a first order is dealt_with carefully as it creates a bad impression .
neutral	having said that the mistake was put right straight_away .
neutral	lovely pink bed_frame , mattress is top quality memory_foam , bed easy to put_together , wooden_slats are poor quality , thin & slip out far too easily from the black plastic caps that fit into bed_frame .
neutral	would benefit from solid pine bed slats !!
neutral	good fast delivery , would have loved to have been a copy of the order i made , or some kind of delivery note .
neutral	wait too long for the shipment
neutral	i like their prices but not their attitude .
neutral	i sent an e_- mail ecentlyasking why prescriptions were deemed invalid after 0_months .
neutral	i have not had a reply .
neutral	i have to pay for scripts from my vet ; if they make out a prescription for a years supply of medication i don_'_t want it all delivered at once .
neutral	in future i will place my orders with a more nderstanding company .
neutral	made the order & was directed to payment page & i put in my details , then i hunted for a pay now icon . saw an icon above my details & pressed it , a page came up that said the page or something like it didn_'_t exist . tried again & the same thing happened . i ended_up ringing animed & ordering over the phone i had no apology when i explained what had happened .
neutral	ordering easy , prices good and delivery on time .
neutral	unfortunately one item , a thermometer , not working and although i left a message 0_days ago on the company answer phone i have not had any contact from them .
neutral	won_'_t buy from them again
neutral	i was happy with the way my costume looked an was a true_reflection of the picture however there was no communication of when it would be delivered .
neutral	i '_d paid the extra £ 0 . 00 to have a tracked order and next_day delivery and was initially sent an_email to tell me once it was dispatched i would be told roughly when to expect it .
neutral	this didn_'_t happen which_resulted_in no one being in the house to sign for it .
neutral	it was then sent to the local post_office and was informed i couldn_'_t pick it up for 00_hours .
neutral	i needed to try the costume on asap to ensure it was a good fit as i intended to wear it that weekend which is why i paid_extra to have it sent next_day delivery .
neutral	luckily it does fit well , however a simple email to inform_me of a rough delivery time would '_ve made me happier with my purchase and the process .
neutral	beautifully_arranged but poor quality
neutral	order placed on 0rd may_0000 and am still_waiting for this .
neutral	free delivery good but i would have paid had i known it would take so long .
neutral	on 00 / 0 / 00 i ordered some dog_food and chews for my dog .
neutral	i was contacted the next_day with many apologies that they were out of stock of the chews .
neutral	this was fine , and i was told that once they had received a delivery they would be sent .
neutral	however , i then had to contact them about the dog_food that was in stock , and asked if it was being delivered , as i had not realised they were holding it to despatch both items together , & the food was needed .
neutral	this was complied with , and the food was delivered a few_days_later .
neutral	however , it is now the 00 / 00 / 00 and i have still not heard_anything about or received my chews .
neutral	& so i am not very pleased with the service
neutral	i shopped_around quite a bit before_deciding on this product ,
neutral	my bed is alot more comfortable however very sweaty which i did not expect , especially with the cost of the topper , i was quite dissapointed that i never got any paper_work with the delivery i expected something stating i had a ten year_guarantee !!!
neutral	!
neutral	no_problems with the order except the delivery .
neutral	wish you would use the postal service and not apc .
neutral	good afternoon
neutral	i received my pack of bulbs , good price and good service in delivery , however
neutral	0 of the bulbs had no bayonet pins , i emailed the provider and still have not heard
neutral	how this is to be replaced or creditied .
neutral	these bulbs are very good , and very expensive so a new bulb or credit would
neutral	be appreciated .
neutral	the flowers that were delivered were perfect i have no_issues with them .. my issue is the card , now to everyone it may not mean the same but to me the card is just as important as the actual flowers .
neutral	my partners name was spelt wrong on the envelope and then the message i had requested had been scrawled on the inside and was barely readable .
neutral	this isn_'_t acceptable you '_d think in this modern age that if someone has the handwriting of a 0 year_old that they would have the card printed instead .
neutral	the product - personalised face_masks - were brilliant , good quality and were made and sent out really quickly .
neutral	however , whilst the correct_address was written by hand on the inside envelope correctly , the actual address it was sent to i . e .
neutral	on the couriers label and plastic packaging was massively incorrect , in fact it wasn_'_t even a proper address i . e .
neutral	said something like flat 0 , no 00 - 00 xx road .
neutral	the masks were sent out on the wednesday for a party on saturday .
neutral	i had a phone_call on friday_evening about 0 . 00 to say that they had tried but failed to deliver i . e there was no - one in , the masks and could i call the courier directly to arrange delivery .
neutral	the lady on the end of the phone was very grumpy with me that no - one was in to collect the parcel .
neutral	the next delivery date the courier could do was the monday so i had to drive out to collect the masks myself on the saturday_morning between 0 - 00 .
neutral	basically , i only recieved the masks by a massive stroke of luck , i . e .
neutral	i got the message on time friday_night , the courier was open on saturday am , i had transport to collect them etc .
neutral	all because someone along the line had not bothered to actually read the label they stuck on the courier envelope , very shoddy .
neutral	having said all this the product was great and did make the party , so my advice would be never order anything the week you need it to allow for the company to cock it up and for it all to end up ok .
neutral	great website except that it is confusing when you select your dates .
neutral	double_check them as it seems to change the date you leave for the date you actually arrive .
neutral	hi , the stuff i bought tastes vile but the service was fine .
neutral	i only had one question that was not fully answered by iflorist support group .
neutral	from a choice of small , medium or large basket of summer flowers i selected large to be sent to new_zealand .
neutral	the recipient was very happy with the flowers , however , i thought the container did not look like a large basket and i have been trying to find out if in fact it was a large .
neutral	i hope you can clear this up for me .
neutral	otherwise everything was satisfactory .
neutral	we got the wrong information on the trip and thus missed the last bus and we were leaving the following_day .
neutral	we still have the tickets and would appreciate a refund .
neutral	i am sure it will be a memorable experience .
neutral	the rating_system is not helpful in my case so i just used it to be able to post these comments so don_'_t use it as objective as we did not have the experience .
neutral	please make it a bit friendlier and enable it to cover objective issues .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	please writer to wagoro @_gmail . com
neutral	i recently brought a pair of bryan adams tickets ( 0000000 ) for the concert on monday for my partners_birthday .
neutral	after_reading bad_reviews i am sceptical i will ever get them .
neutral	what '_s worst is i have tried to change my address so it can be delivered to my work place and it says can not be done .
neutral	i have emailed regarding this and had no reply .
neutral	lets_hope i '_m wrong
neutral	you used ups , they do not tell you by text etc ... when they are gonig to delvier and attempted 0 times , i eventually went and picked it up .
neutral	the glasses were not polished , and the box and glasses were dusty - i would have expected £_000 sunglasses which still cost me over_£_000 in the sales to be sent to me in better condition .
neutral	please keep the package as small as possible so that it has a chance of going through a letter_box .
neutral	it is so awkward having to go to collect it from the po .
neutral	we stayed three nights at the kenways in scarborough , the room was clean and comfortable but rather small .
neutral	hazel .
neutral	the owner was friendly and helpful .
neutral	breakfast was nice although i would have liked a choice of fruit juice , there was only orange which i , m not keen on .
neutral	its located in a nice position near to peaseholme park and the north bay .
neutral	we enjoyed our stay .
neutral	my experience with the order and samples was very good ( 0_stars ) but when when the order arrived this morning , the man refused to help me with the boxes to the house , leaving them on the road in front of the house .
neutral	i would suggest bringing it to the attention of the buyer that they need to arrange for a man or two people to be at home to take the delivery .
neutral	as a female , i was left helpless .
neutral	lucky for me the local milkman helped_me when he saw this behaviour .
neutral	either having 0 man to deliver so that they can actually deliver to the location or note to the customers could have avoided this bad_experience with delivery .
neutral	could not access my account to check on status of delivery .
neutral	took some time to come .
neutral	after all that , it doesn_'_t fit the trampoline i have , but it will serve it '_s purpose after a bit of re - jigging .
neutral	good service , good price , fast delivery , great website but i ordered my glasses with a tint and they sent me ones with clear lenses so i am not happy at all , now i have to go to the trouble of sending them back
neutral	ordered blinds , when they were delivered on 00th only part of the order was received , the other part had become detached from the order .
neutral	we were told balance of order would be with us on 00th , they were not
neutral	told courier had tried to deliver twice which they hadn_'_t
neutral	eventually balance of order was received 00st .
neutral	it is obvious that the courier let you down which is a shame as it tainted the whole_process for us .
neutral	have not looked at the quality of the product yet , but will assume that they are ok
neutral	we will be ordering more blinds in the future but will have to consider the service next time
neutral	item was as_described arrived in the expected time frame although packaging could have been better as that witnessed by other designer_clothes sellers such as cruise / thackerys etc
neutral	good website with great range , but if anyone had told me it could take 0_days for an item to be delivered when you '_ve paid over_£ 0 . 00 p_&_p for a very small parcel , i '_d have thought they were joking .
neutral	i had to wait 00 days to get my candles 0 emails and 0 phone_calls later they arrived .
neutral	i will try this website once again because of the value if not i will return to my regular website .
neutral	an_email with expected delivery date would be helpful , and why do you still use yodel / home delivery network ?
neutral	also can '_t use online contact form until order number is registered on your system which takes_forever - no good if you have an_immediate question
neutral	the website was easy to use and the 00_%_discount was great ...
neutral	but , i guess you get what you pay for !
neutral	the quality of the card and the print was reqlly good but they had been poorly trimmed , with a think whit edge showing on 0 sides .
neutral	i checked the on line proof again just to make_sure it wasn_'_t my mistake and it certainly didn_'_t show on there .
neutral	we were in a hurry to get these thank_you cards out so sadly couldn_'_t take the time for a reprint , here or with another company so i am not sure if they would have rectififed / reprinted if i had asked .
neutral	over all it '_s a good service but just be really careful if you don_'_t use an image that you can over size .
neutral	overall i am very happy with my eyesight however , six_months on my eyes still get sore due to dryness and there is a lot of glare when i drive at night .
neutral	i wasn_'_t pleased with the way the surgeon spoke to me when he was trying to get the plastic mould in place to hold my eye still - this part really hurt .
neutral	the laser_treatment was fine and you can neither see or feel anything happening .
neutral	we hired a car from tullamarine airport ( in melbourne ) and assumed incorrectly that it would be no more than 00_mins after exiting the airport before we would be mobile .
neutral	wrong ... it took over 00_mins and then we had to ask the staff to hurry as my husband was heading to a meeting in the city .
neutral	next time we will know and leave more time , the depot is over 0 kilometres away from the airport and if they have people to drop at the airport they do that then pick_up those arriving .
neutral	good economy of course but had we known we could have made better plans .... didn_'_t like driving a hire_car and being so stressed about making a deadline in melb cbd .
neutral	most of the time i get the same offers - that '_s a shame !
neutral	i like myshu as have a good choice of boots & it '_s good to support local_shops - but you need to pay for your_own returns & they don_'_t supply returns postage_labels , so it makes it a bit faffy & expensive to return goods .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	which can be a pain , because if a shoe doesn_'_t fit .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	i am happy to book with sky_park , but i think that the booking charge is excessive
neutral	i ordered 0 items , one of which turned_out to be not available due to stock discrepancies , the other was delivered ( with difficulty ) but was the wrong_size .
neutral	they were very helpful when i rang , and we arranged to have the new one delivered on the same day as the old was picked_up , as delivery is difficult .
neutral	this didn_'_t happen , and i received 0 texts_telling_me my delivery was 0 different days .
neutral	the delivery firm picked_up one day , delivered the next , leaving me with problems being in on 0 occasions .
neutral	so not a bad firm , but please use a different delivery system !
neutral	nice site easy to navigate
neutral	good delivery times
neutral	nice looking offers but when i received my " bead mix " a lot of the weight was in very large chunky beads in odd colours i . e .
neutral	mustard brown etc - not much good for my work at all
neutral	i would not buy an offer of mixed beads by weight again but all in all 0 / 00
neutral	i ordered a bottle of rum from this company as a surprise christmas_present for a friend .
neutral	their choice of alcohol was good , ordering and paying online was easy and the e_- mail communications about process and delivery were helpful .
neutral	unfortunately they only use parcelforce as the couriers .
neutral	the website advised that somebody should be home to sign for the parcel , however i assumed , as with other couriers , that if no - one was home , a card would be left notifying the recipient that a delivery had been attempted .
neutral	this is not the case with parcelforce , who instead , after a few failed_attempts during the day when my friend was at work , noted - incorrectly - that the premises were unoccupied and returned the present to the store !
neutral	needless to say this upset me greatly and i had to phone my friend to enquire his whereabouts that week and whether i had his postcode correctly - which upset me even more as it left him suspicious and risked ruining the surprise .
neutral	i got in touch with the whisky_exchange who advised they would immediately re - send the gift , with instructions to parcelforce to put a note through the door if delivery was unsuccessful .
neutral	on phoning the store yesterday , i discovered that the gift had been left at a nearby post officce , although they were unable to get parcelforce to establish whether a note had been left .
neutral	this resulted_in me having to contact my friend and tell him that something was waiting for him at his post_office .
neutral	i spent nearly_£_00 on this surprise christmas_present , ordering it 0_weeks before christmas to allow for delivery .
neutral	the debacle with parcelforce not leaving a card has now resulted_in my friend not getting his present before christmas ( he had left for his family '_s house by the time i found out it had been left at the post_office ) and also not getting it as a surprise , which has upset me and made me seriously question whether this was a good spend of £_00 .
neutral	certainly , although i would have no_hesitation using the whisky_exchange again , it will not be until they change their couriers .
neutral	how many britons work during the day and are therefore not able to sign for parcels ?
neutral	do parcelforce really think it '_s practical to not even let recipients know that they '_ve tried to deliver something ?
neutral	we ordered a lectern which arrived promptly but was not adequately packed .
neutral	the courier had tried to tape up the parcel but there was still a big hole in the bottom , and corners of the item had been slightly_damaged .
neutral	there were no assembly_instructions .
neutral	even before it was used properly for the first time , the screws holding the book tray came out causing further damage .
neutral	however , on reporting this to chase av direct a refund was organised promptly .
neutral	was recommended by my son and have earned £_000 in about 0_months but have 0 outstanding claims that have not been paid one for a hotel stay in feb and another for recommending a friend if i did not have these outstanding it would have been a 0_star_review .
neutral	the sales_man on the phone spun a tale around ' sales ' prices and recommended to order the product i wanted the same day as the price could not be held .
neutral	when visiting the store a few_days_later the price was still the same .
neutral	the product was not as expected and the exchange was fuss free .
neutral	the sales_person in the shop was not_overly excited to see customers and had more interest in his phone initially until he found out we were genuine customers .
neutral	a further tale was ' spun ' around answering phone_calls in the shop .
neutral	please don_'_t treat customers as if they are 0 year_olds .
neutral	love the dresser we bought .
neutral	great quality .
neutral	i loved this outfit and everyone complemented me on it .
neutral	though only down_side was i ordered the large size as stated was a uk " 00 to 00 ".
neutral	i '_m a uk 00 / 00 , when i tried it on it was really big and more like a 00 / 00 .
neutral	i got it to fit with some clever sewing .
neutral	that said though it was a great outfit for the hen_do i was on and i did love it .
neutral	also great value for money :)
neutral	buying tickets online is relatively easy , even if the website is terrible to use on a mobile device .
neutral	advance tickets are also great value , but why do they stop offering them over peak times , like christmas ?
neutral	there '_s a quota system anyway , so if they ' re sold out , they ' re sold out - what '_s the difference .
neutral	holiday travel may be a money spinner , but i think this is just a little unnecessary .
neutral	oh , and those advanced tickets ... really , train guards need to accept them on later and alternative trains whenever there '_s a cancellation or delay .
neutral	making someone buy a new ticket as they ' re travelling on a different train by necessity is just plain mean .
neutral	on time but service nothing special .
neutral	food awful and very sparse .
neutral	smooth flight but don_'_t think worth the money .
neutral	helpful staff wide_choice competitive_prices , you will need hours and a skip or van to get_rid of packaging if you do a whole room .
neutral	chose this supplier over several others who had same product because they had next_day free delivery .
neutral	alas , that did not happen - ordered on a wednesday ( evening ), delivery scheduled for following_tuesday which is not ideal .
neutral	products are good though .
neutral	and dpd is carrier - they are v good .
neutral	i ordered 0 items , 0 in navy and 0 in black .
neutral	the confirmation order had this at 0 navy and 0iin black , which i pointed_out and krowmark changed .
neutral	the initial proof had my website as wrong ... thank god for proofs !
neutral	delivery was well over a week from proof approval .
neutral	on receipt all items were navy !!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	happily i actually prefer the navy and i have to say the quality of both the text stitching and the items ( fleece , sweatshirt , polo_shirts and hat ) are fantastic .
neutral	another note , the womens medium polo_shirt ismmore llike a large .
neutral	overall because of the quality i would recommend and order again , just double_check all correspondence they send you !
neutral	a nice garment but not quite what i expected so returned and ordered a lined sweater
neutral	my order was placed for three items that were all listed as being in stock .
neutral	after four days the order status was still at " processing ".
neutral	when i called customer_services i was informed that one of the items was out of stock and that delivery was due that day and therefore dispatch of my order would be the following_day .
neutral	three_days_later when i called again i was informed that the item was still not in stock .
neutral	at this point i asked for my order to be cancelled and money to be refunded as i was disappointed that payment had been processed at the time of the order and ten days_later i had still not received my items .
neutral	i was promised a refund and cancellation of my order .
neutral	an_hour after this call i received an_email_confirming my order had been dispatched and sure enough it turned_up the next_day .
neutral	i was pleased with the products and the quality of the packaging however i was disappointed with the delivery time and a bit_suspicious that as soon as i asked for the order to be cancelled it was finally processed !
neutral	i ordered two pirate_costumes for a fancy_dress event at a music_festival .
neutral	ordering was easy , the items came quickly and overall we were pleased with the outfits .
neutral	however i was very disappointed to find when i opened mine that there was a hole of about 0 - 0 inches down the seam of the skirt .
neutral	as they only arrived a few_days before we were due to go away i did not have time to return the items , so ended_up having to spend half an_hour sewing up the hole .
neutral	obviously you do not expect brand_new items to arrive with such a fault .
neutral	has this not been the case my review would probably be 0_star , but this was a real inconvenience and , had i not checked in_advance , could have ruined the whole outfit .
neutral	i did not have my sewing_kit with me when we went away so i would have been unable to repair it , meaning i would not have had a costume .
neutral	my delivery came extremely quickly and with all the accessory '_s included .
neutral	the outfit did look slightly_different on than in the picture and was a tad too_big even_though i ordered a size smaller_than i usually get .
neutral	it is a pain when it keeps flipping back and you lose info . you loose details when you read the terms and conditions as it takes a long time to read it
neutral	having used_serenta_flowers in the past and been happy with their service , i had no_hesitation in using them again , however this time i was very dissapointed with the service .
neutral	due to a technical_hitch the flowers didnt reach the intended friend until 0_days after her_birthday .
neutral	with no customer support number , i had to rely_on emails to rectify problem .
neutral	serenta did upgrade flowers on recognition of failure to deliver but would have prefered the small bunch on the day than a bigger_bunch 0_days late !
neutral	i wish i had looked on the amazon site fraction of the cost and a fraction of the shipping .
neutral	the tube arrived quickly but i could have brought a dozen on amazon for the price
neutral	the blind , when we got it was just as_described .
neutral	however , it was late .
neutral	i emailed the company and got a reply indicating a new delivery date which wasn_'_t right either .
neutral	i emailed again and received no reply .
neutral	i phoned a few_days_later , but the blind was delivered this day .
neutral	delivery stated as 0 - 0 working_days , mine took over 0_weeks .
neutral	the boat was roomy and comfortable .
neutral	good childrens play_area .
neutral	poor expensive food and duty_free area .
neutral	no maps of northern france in the information area , a pity , surely you could have more tourist information .
neutral	overall a satisfactory trip .
neutral	useful but it would be good to know to which removing companies get my details
neutral	it does not stay in for very long .
neutral	it is patchy and too expensive .
neutral	i will not buy this product in the future .
neutral	the cotton duvet_covers i choose are lovely quality , very silky , went for 000 thread cotton .
neutral	but the finishing is poor , plastic stud fasteners , one of which has pulled_out of the material since using .
neutral	buttons are far better .
neutral	also a lot of loose_threads hanging off the covers and pillow_cases which ive pulled off .
neutral	if i hadnt been in a dire need and could have been bothered i should have returned them .
neutral	chairs were good value apart_from having no instructions .
neutral	the knobs on the side of the chairs don_'_t seem to do anything .
neutral	have asked for instructions but no response yet .
neutral	one of the drink holders arrived broken but it was replaced .
neutral	...... should be free as it bumps up the cost of the outfit , if it has to go back like mine which is too_big .... sorry
neutral	after my other half heard about musclefood '_s on a bodybuilding forum and saw the prices we had to give it a go , after years of spending a fortune on supermarket chicken_breasts for him and the family too .
neutral	ordered 00kg of chicken_breasts which qualified for free delivery which was a bonus .
neutral	delivery was speedy although with a fresh product as this it would be great if the delivery company would give a 0 hour delivery slot as some others do , i did not want to miss this delivery and have it redelivered the next_day , it did arrive on the expected date , albeit at the end of the day .
neutral	the order arrived in a very strong box , however more packing tape could be used to seal the box , especially with fresh_meat inside , the single length of tape across the boxes length was nowhere strong_enough to hold the boxes weight and the 0 main flaps had seperated and the box was partially open , the box contents was still cold though .
neutral	upon_opening the box and inner foam liner i immediately noticed that the paperwork in the top was soaking_wet , with raw chicken juice !!
neutral	i can only_assume the rough_handling by the courier ( none of them handle parcels with care ) had caused the bottom tray of 0kg_chicken_breast to split and leak its liquid content .
neutral	the chicken in the split tray was thrown_away in case of contamination .
neutral	onto the quality of the chicken , not bad , definitely more flavour than supermarket breasts but we find them a little tougher / stringier than we ' re used too , they seem to shrink about the same as supermarket breasts and seems to be just the same amount of water in the baking_tray after cooking ( cooked in oven with seasoning in glass tray & covered with foil )
neutral	overall could be better - stronger trays for the meat - box taped up more - better courier .
neutral	if musclefoods gets these right then there '_s a potential future regular customer here .
neutral	been here since sun and tombola was joined but stayed with tombola ..
neutral	i have won jackpots but if you win them tombola takes them back ..
neutral	i am on a pention so don_'_t have enough money to play as much as i would like .. that '_s about it ... but hate the moaners
neutral	received cushion which was good quality .
neutral	however photo on cushion wasnt what previewed and ordered .
neutral	spoke to customer service who were helpful but gave no explanation as to why the whole photo had been printed and installed no confidence as to whether of returned the next order would be as requested .
neutral	good quality product but not sure if worth the price of not as i requested
neutral	my only_complaint is that , when i placed the order , i specified that the parcel should be left in the greenhouse if i wasn_'_t at home .
neutral	unfortunately , there was nothing on the outside of the parcel to indicate this and i had to arrange for the parcel to be redelivered as i was out at the time of the original delivery .
neutral	what is the point of inviting customers to enter delivery instructions if they ' re not going to be used ?
neutral	my dog_chews alot never found anything that lasts .
neutral	thought i had done with the everlasting dog treat ball but she still managed to get lumps off the rubber
neutral	ordering the flowers and being kept_updated re - delivery was excellent .
neutral	however i had opted and paid for delivery before_noon and was hoping that the sympathy_flowers would arrive before the couple had to leave for her mum '_s funeral at 00 . 00am .
neutral	they obviously did not arrive and felt annoyed that they should have been delivered so close to the noon deadline .
neutral	also didn_'_t like not having the choice to leave a small gift card with the flowers , was only given the choice of a card which would have replicated one i had sent earlier .. just needed a little note without_any extra_charge !
neutral	capsules arrived_safely , very quick service .
neutral	however not the same with a refund . tablets posted back to you well over a week_ago and nothing !!
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered the guinevere outfit which arrived within the allotted_time .
neutral	my only_criticism would be that the head_band was too_big and non - adjustable .
neutral	the dress was fine given the price paid for the outfit .
neutral	all_round a satisfactory purchase .
neutral	package was destoryed during process . waiting for ur response
neutral	a website messed me around with my order so i looked them up on google which lead me to here .
neutral	i '_ve been shopping online alot recently and the reviews here have helped_me alot with deciding who to buy goods from and who to steer_clear of .
neutral	( however with people posting so many reviews with pretty_much the same spammy reviews i don_'_t know how much i can_trust the reviews on here , scrapping the whole ' our friends ranking ' section would probably lead to more honest_reviews and not people seeking ' fame ' or maybe make people elaborate more on their experiences ).
neutral	i have purchased a few items from this site , usually takes nearly a week to receive the items , also when you receive an item that they sent in error they ask you to pay postage to return it and will not send you the correct item until they get the wrong item back .
neutral	warning - give yourself plenty of time before actually wanting the hair in case they mess up !
neutral	went along to winchester store today to see what all the ad fuss is about " voted britains best supermarket "
neutral	the store was grim and depressing and the service was impersonal and rushed " no_frills " i guess and you don_'_t get what you don_'_t pay for .
neutral	bought a small variety of items of which i have tried the crisps - not too bad but nothing special and wensleydale cheese which had a bitter aftertaste .
neutral	cats had a good go at their new cheap food and they ' re normally quite fussy !
neutral	the bill was about 00_% cheaper_than it would have been at sainsburys however i am not sure i will go again just to get a handful of items at a cheaper price .
neutral	ordered item and money sent - emailed several days_later to be told discontinued item - why on website ??
neutral	contacted them and a full_refund given straight_away
neutral	we order our dog_biscuits on a regular_basis , and switched to pet_supermarket recently without problem .
neutral	however our last order just received was poorly packed and it seems that all 0 packets of kelties are in broken bits .
neutral	there was no padding in the package and they have obviously been damaged in transit .
neutral	very disappointing , and our irish_setter is not impressed either !
neutral	!
neutral	initial customer service was excellent .
neutral	however despite placing the order at 0am on a thursday and getting a confirmed delivery date of the friday the branch that held the part somehow_managed to neglect to send it either on the thursday or friday .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t chased the delivery i '_m not sure_whether it would ever have been sent at all !
neutral	however jeanette in customer service did everything she could to sort_out the error and we eventually received the part on the tuesday_afternoon .
neutral	i asked if there was anything that could be done on the postage and they refunded it in full .
neutral	overall great telephone service but massively let_down by the branch '_s performance .
neutral	products as expected , good price .
neutral	hispek need to find another carrier if they want to keep customers .
neutral	delivery did not turn_up on the day i was informed it would be delivered .
neutral	informed hi - spek we would pick_up from carrier in liverpool as we were desperate for the products .
neutral	just about to go to liverpool when next door neighbour appeared with the goods , they had been delivered that afternoon with no prior_warning or telephone_call to ourselves .
neutral	sky_park steve booking was easy to use and very straightforward .
neutral	however , received an_email afterwards offering a further 0 %_discount if i revisited the site when i had already made my booking which was a bit rough !
neutral	our ferry journey from ijmuiden to north_shields was delayed by 0 hours due to an electrical fault , so we left at 00pm and arrived at 0pm the next_day rather_than the expected 0am .
neutral	we understand that the fault had to be repaired before sailing , but we did feel there was little or nothing done to compensate for the inconvenience_caused .
neutral	we were travelling with two children - its a long journey to keep them happy and entertained .
neutral	the cinema was closed due to the fault and while the childrens ' entertainer was great inn the evening wouldn_'_t it have been possible to provide an_hour or two of activities in the morning ?
neutral	we also heard the details of the electrical problem ( a fire the previous evening due to water leaking onto a circuit board , lots of smoke , passengers sleeping in the cinema !)
neutral	via the childrens ' entertainer !
neutral	not really what you want to hear just before you set sail .
neutral	also made us wonder_if the problem was due to insufficient maintenance of the ship - worrying .
neutral	obviously this was a one off - generally our experience has_been ok on ferry_crossings , although more could be done to keep older_children entertained / occupied on what becomes a long and slightly tedious journey once you '_ve done it a number of times !
neutral	there is entertainment for young kids and adults but very little for age range 0 +
neutral	very disappointed that due to ultralase joining with optimax i have to travel all the way to glasgow for my ( 0 week ) after appointment instead of going to aberdeen .
neutral	i live 00 miles from aberdeen which is far enough to travel for an_appointment that lasts less_than half an_hour .
neutral	i find it ridiculous that specsavers cannot do this check up .
neutral	i really would have had second_thoughts in having the treatment at all had i known this was going to happen .
neutral	i trust i will be re - embursed for this extra travel expense .
neutral	i was delighted when my parcel arrived the day after ordering it ,
neutral	however the bag it was in was burst & the postman handed it to me with the bag inside the cardboard_box .
neutral	he suggested i check it as this was how they had received it .
neutral	the item was intact but there was no paperwork with it .
neutral	i trust this does not contain personal payment information .
neutral	after getting a quote and subsequently deciding to go_ahead i was contacted far too many_times by bewiser .
neutral	about 00 phonecalls , plus txts and emails .
neutral	happy with the insurance and the people are lovely but i am not happy with the amount of hastle i have received !
neutral	!
neutral	love ordering from cheap_smells , the prices and products are great , but this time around the courier delivering the box had kicked it around and the perfumes inside had damaged exteriors which was pants as i was planning on giving these as gifts to people .
neutral	fine if you ' re only using the perfume yourself as the container inside was undamaged .
neutral	first_tutors was my first experience of trying to arrange a tutor .
neutral	i was under the impression i would be able to interview a few tutors to find the one most suited to our daughter '_s needs .
neutral	in fact , the way it worked was that i could text tutors but not actually meet up with one without first selecting that tutor , paying the fee and having a situation where that tutor was deemed to have been chosen without us even meeting .
neutral	luckily it all worked out but it might not have done .
neutral	ordered 0 which were a great price and children chose their greeting and font , arrived in good time in nice boxes .
neutral	unfortunately , one has a scratch just above the engraving ( if it had been on the underside this would not have been noiticed , so rather spoils a great looking gift ) ie one is perfect , one is not - shame ( also had something sticky on it , luckily i managed to remove this ) thanks anyway
neutral	efficient and polite fitter so perfectly happy with the end_result but a little annoyed that the online booking allows selection of a slot the very next_day when in actual fact the representative calls to allocate the job with a wait of over a week .
neutral	slightly_misleading i feel .
neutral	ordered 0 bottles perfume .
neutral	one came empty , bottle being broken .
neutral	phoned , sent photos - then waited .
neutral	email after email arrived .
neutral	nothing happened and no joy .
neutral	after quite a while , rang again , speaking to a gentleman_who dealt_with issue immediately and voila - replacement bottle arrived in 0_days .
neutral	very easy to compare and search equipment on the website .
neutral	i received my headphones , the day after i placed my order , very impressive !
neutral	they are comfortable to wear and the case is convenient for carrying .
neutral	i was a little disappointed that i could still hear the car radio , when i was trying to listen to an audio book .
neutral	this was the main_reason for buying them .
neutral	also if using them with sky go on my ipad the sound goes out of sync , in fact distorted if you with the noise reduction mode !
neutral	i am very pleased with the quality of the keyring however , the cardboard_boxes are thin_cardboard and look cheap , disappointing !
neutral	an otherwise perfect gift well_packed and presented but disappointingly delivered late despite going by parcelforce and missing the birthday that it was intended for .
neutral	we chubby / fat / obese / normal size ladies with a size 00 - 00 frame also want to look pretty and so therefore would like to see allot more choice in that size range just for a change !
neutral	!
neutral	also we have normal size legs / calves mine are 00 inches ( circum ) and for once i would like to be able to have choice when shopping for boots and that actually fit all the way up !!
neutral	!
neutral	listen to what we say cause i know for a fact there is a massive market out for larger_sizes that fit everyday people .
neutral	go on evrything0pounds make a statement and start a trend :) i dare and challenge you !!
neutral	!
neutral	good price and helpful staff however delivery was supposed to be on 0 / 0 and for some reason was arranged on 0 / 0 .
neutral	unfortunately it snowed over the weekend and the person we had arranged to sit could therefore not get here resulting in my husband having to take 0 hours off work .
neutral	the labels were delivered quickly and look great abut they tend to peel away at the ends and some have come off after washing .
neutral	i am now ironing them on for much longer_than the recommended 0 seconds .
neutral	got the wrong pair of sunglasses .
neutral	it world have veen appropriate with a small compensation for all the bother returning the glasses , and for the delay .
neutral	orherwise the service has bern quick and efficiant .
neutral	best low_cal diet in terms of taste most products n you genuinely feel full .
neutral	but be prepared for it to play havoc with your musical
neutral	movements !
neutral	also bars not good , nasty texture .
neutral	i am quite disappointed with the meat , although not you would call tough it is definitely chewy , think i am going to have to try using this as a braising_steak .
neutral	the products are good , the price is good , but it would have been nice to have been warned when the delivery was due , like it said when i placed the order , rather_than have it just turn_up at the door !
neutral	what would have happened if i had have been out , i dread to think . i would still use them again , but perhaps arrange to collect the goods from the nearest_store a week_later .
neutral	two_weeks after ordering we found out that our order had been returned to the courier delivery depot and had to re - order with the happy_puzzle_company .
neutral	they did their best to assist and we received our order within two_days via_royal_mail !
neutral	the booking was quick and easy to make .
neutral	the money was taken out of my account yesterday but i have not yet had an_email_confirming my booking - just this one asking for a review .
neutral	i ordered a couple of containers and a trackable window cling ( and a few other things ) one of the pots was badly_cracked due to it being poorly packaged and the window cling tracking_number did not match the copy tag so i now have a useless trackable in my car .
neutral	i did open a call with geotees and they have said it will be rectified in a few_days so hopefully not all bad :)
neutral	the other products i got were very good quality , the order process was easy and the delivery was quick .
neutral	photo image was good but didn_'_t realise the stand came separate but i may have missed that in the description , the heart sits on the stand but it isn_'_t very sturdy so you have to handle with care ....
neutral	i purchased 0 items from the xile website on sat 00th_dec , all items ordered were supposed to be xxl ( 0 t - shirts and 0 x shirt ).
neutral	when i opened the parcel a few_days after it arrived , ( due to this being a christmas_present for my husband ) i realized that one of the items had been sent in the wrong_size it was a l opposed to a xxl .
neutral	i '_ve now had to try and find a replacement present a few_days before christmas and no_longer have the option of ordering anything online due to missing the last post day before xmas .
neutral	i would have rated this service much_better but fail to understand_why something like this can occur .
neutral	there needs to be better quality control of items being dispatched by post and now i have to go to the unfortunate task of posting this back - at an additional_cost of recorded delivery ( as per instructions ) and requesting a refund .
neutral	i would now think_twice about using the online service again .
neutral	coffee ordered at time of main order arrived 0_months later that is not acceptable , especially after i called and said please just send an_alternative .
neutral	delivery paid for next_day - friday ( order went in on time ) royal_mail delivered monday instead
neutral	as of yet not received book trust all will be ok when i do but hard to say how good the service is
neutral	when
neutral	not been delivered yet
neutral	i ordered the sea breeze bouquet to arrive the next_day for my mum .
neutral	i was surprised that even_though i was ordering them late that evening i could still get them delivered the next_day .
neutral	the website was easy to use & eflorist have a fantastic variety to suit all tastes & budgets .
neutral	when i chose the bouquet i opted to pay an additional £_00 for the largest on offer .
neutral	they arrived the next_day & as requested were delivered after 00am .
neutral	although the flowers were in good condition they didn_'_t quite have the same wow_factor as the picture i saw on the website of the large bouquet .
neutral	there didn_'_t seem to be as many flowers as i was expecting despite it being a large bouquet .
neutral	that said , i would probably use them again as the service was excellent & there was loads to chose from , i was probably expecting too much !
neutral	the flowers arrived for my sister and sbe phoned to thank me but i was a bit disappointed as she said some of the flowers weren_'_t in bud they were open and also the reason for me ordering these particular flowers heaven_scent ( my mum has just passed_away so i thought this appropriate and also her favourite colour was blue ) which in the picture they were .
neutral	unfortunately she said only a coupe had a blue tip .
neutral	having been with this site for couple of years , when making a sale ( which is few and far between i might_add ), i am constantly informed after making a sale that the quality of the image is not good enough !
neutral	continually told to re - photograph the images is impossible as any of the works i have on the site are either sold or have been discarded due to damage .
neutral	i was a premium member but i am now in a quandary as the artwork is still not good enough even_though i have limited sizes available for buyers as i am useless with fauxtography .
neutral	blurry , lighting , half cropped signatures are always the problem + i hate making sales when i know that i will get an_email_stating the image is pixelated , blah_blah_blah !
neutral	i realise it is up to the seller to check images at 000_% but it would be good to have someone check the upload , someone_who_knows what they are doing , advise the artist to amend this and that before a sale is made !
neutral	as an artist , i am constantly attempting to make the images larger , only to be told they are still not " good quality ".
neutral	a cancellation recently occurred and i was gutted again .
neutral	i am not a photographer , have no idea about cameras and yet now i have to await my son in laws visit to see if he can do the job that faa needs to get a " quality " photograph that will be up to scratch , and then maybe i will become a premium member once again .. we will see !
neutral	took a while to arrive and when it did delivery box was open and very soggy .
neutral	however , goods inside the delivery box were all intact and fine .
neutral	i ordered the christmas ' large ' flowers in a bag .
neutral	well when they arrived i was really disappointed because some flowers had fallen_off before they was received and if your expecting the bouquet to be big then you will be in for a shock .
neutral	for £_00 . 00 and p_&_p on top i was expecting it to be a lot bigger .
neutral	it was really embarrassing because it was a gift for a lady_who was retiring .
neutral	can '_t fault the service that was excellent just shame about the size of the bouquet .
neutral	i '_ve always shopped with inter_flora in the past because the bouquets are beautiful but i won_'_t be doing it again in the future .
neutral	the flowers were for my daughter '_s 00th_birthday - in a few_days ' time they may look lovely but as delivered , in bud , they were mainly green stems .
neutral	i ordered the sized - up bouquet but didn_'_t think it was really worth the extra .
neutral	delivery was on time and the flowers were in good condition .
neutral	if you pay for first_class delivery then you expect your order to be delivered within 0 working_days .
neutral	jessops are failing_miserably on this and therefore forces me to use your competitors to ensure a fast delivery .
neutral	special instructions : please kindly deliver as late as possible but before 0pm as birthday is on sunday only .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	delivered : between 00am and 00_noon , i think you could delivered later as per instructions for which you asked .
neutral	the steaks , wings and sausages tried so far have been lovely .
neutral	however , i '_ll be unlikely to order again because of a bit of confusion on the quantities .
neutral	the package i ordered indicated a pack of chicken wings would have 00 - 00 pieces .
neutral	i assumed that would be the half wings , so approx 00 - 00 whole wings would be included .
neutral	there were eight , which seemed a bit skimpy , considering .
neutral	the packaging on the sausages was damaged , but luckily the meat was ok .
neutral	i was really pleased with the item and price that you offered , delivery was made within 0_days but i paid about 0 . 00 for post and packaging which i felt was too much .
neutral	my items were 00 small plastic_containers which arrived in a huge box .
neutral	i was very disappointed that the prices werent kept down by using smaller delivery boxes .
neutral	i have used cash_genie twice and they are very quick and professional .
neutral	i would definatley recommend them .
neutral	was a bit disappointed with the flowers which arrived on time , smaller bouquet than_expected , to be honest wish i had gone to local_florist
neutral	although the brush_heads were a great price it seems that this is because they are of inferior quality .
neutral	they are ok and i will_continue to use them all now that i have bought them but the brush_heads are softer and i don_'_t get such a great clean .
neutral	i ordered next_day delivery for bilateral splints .
neutral	i did not receive my product for 0_days .
neutral	the product i ordered was great but i was very upset to pay the extra money and then get standard delivery !
neutral	delivery came v quickly and very well_packaged but it wasn_'_t the actual product i ordered - it did the job just as well but i think i should have been contacted and given the choice .
neutral	bought a beautiful and expensive pashmina , stunning quality with a great feel , to match a bag bought from a different shop .
neutral	the colour represented on the website was nothing like the colour the scarf turned_out to be and of course didn_'_t match the bag .
neutral	bought last_minute there was then nothing i could do .
neutral	good customer service friendly and helpful .
neutral	however they were nir able to fullfill my irder by the date they said .
neutral	i was ordering floor and wall_tiles .
neutral	wall_tiles nit available but they also stopped the floor_tiles being delivered as they said they normally deliver on 0 pallet .
neutral	had to chase to get floor_tiles delivered before the weekend as my tiler was already booked to lay the tiles .
neutral	flowers were nice but my card and message were not included , which was a shame as i had written a special poem for the recipient .
neutral	the value of products is great but i was sent the wrong item .
neutral	botifies them twice .
neutral	and have not received a reply let_alone an exchange or refund .
neutral	good site and good products but bad customer service !
neutral	overall i was quite happy with the service i received from jokes masquerade .
neutral	they had my product sent out promptly and buybox was a great alternative to shipping to my house , especially as i work all day so wouldn_'_t be home to answer the door .
neutral	the product was genrally pretty good although i did need to alter it as it was alot bigger_than i had expected based on the size_guide .
neutral	it was also not quite as accurate as the picture portrayed .
neutral	i bought a vampire costume that had a collar standing up although the actual product was not entirely like this .
neutral	the collar was floppy as was the skirt which didnt make the costume as appealing as i would have liked .
neutral	i ended_up unpicking the collar and putting my own piece of cardboard inside .
neutral	they should really alter the collar so it has a piece of stiff plastic or wire inside as this helps make the outfit .
neutral	the should also consider doing something_similar with the skirt . this would make the costume more dramatic and accurate to what is displayed in the picture .
neutral	overall i was generally pretty happy and the product was delivered promptly .
neutral	i have used oakfurnitureland before and think they use the nicest delivery guys for their lovely , good quality products .
neutral	i got a phone_call and a series of texts a few_days before delivery to give me a time_slot , and then a couple of days before another text with a one hour delivery slot - very , very good pre_- delivery service .
neutral	again very nice guys .
neutral	the furniture was so well_packaged that the large bookcase wouldn_'_t go up the stairs and they were very quick to suggest returning the whole order as they were a matching pair of large and small bookcases .
neutral	they spent 00_minutes mainly discussing the problem .
neutral	one suggested taking it out of the box , but the other was quick to dismiss that saying it would then be second_hand and couldn_'_t be returned .
neutral	they said i would have to pay £_00 just to return it so i decided to keep it at the bottom of the stairs .
neutral	so glad i did - my husband unpacked it and got it upstairs himself .
neutral	lovely furniture .
neutral	shame you have to dispose of the packaging yourself .
neutral	i ordered brake parts for my car which arrived promptly the next_day the discs were correct but unfortunately they sent the wrong brake parts after a few telephone_conversations they did send me the correct pads but i am still_waiting for a return s label to return thew in correct brake_pads to the company
neutral	didn_'_t realise before i ordered , but use citylink to deliver , who i avoid like the plague unreliable , and rare places to pick_up .
neutral	makes them not worth the saving .
neutral	i particularly_like secrets of the phoenix as its not available on other_sites .
neutral	however , at times i have to turn chat off - the hosts are very variable .
neutral	some allow blatantly sexual banter while one female host in particular drags people off chat for the slightest reason , particularly where she does not agree with their jokes !
neutral	when k is on duty i switch off chat and just concentrate on the games !
neutral	winnings are up and down but i withdrew £_000 this weekend :)
neutral	staff were very helpful when dealing_with my problem but decided to accept a partial_refund as technician could not remove mark .
neutral	would be reluctant to order any other items in case they also arrived damaged .
neutral	the office staff at villa_plus in england and in majorca was very pleasant and helpful .
neutral	except one time i rang the england office prior to the holiday and the person on the other end of the telephone told me how busy he was on the day i rang , and made me fee i should not have the rang .
neutral	the villa_itself was nice and everything we wanted .
neutral	but there was raw sewerage on three occasions in the bathroom , this was totally_unacceptable .
neutral	the owner of villa came out twice , and gave_me a bottle of pipe unblocker !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	kind_regards
neutral	mrs julie reed
neutral	the tyre_fitter undertook the replacement of four tyres promptly .
neutral	however , it was only after obtaining a signature for completion that the fitter then mentioned that one of the wheel_nuts had broken .
neutral	this could only have been done by the fitter or by my mechanic .
neutral	it '_s unclear who was at fault ( mechanic believes that the fitters power_tools would have cauaed the break ) but i would have appreciated being made aware of the problem before having to sign for completion of the job .
neutral	my other comment is that kwik_fit did not call 00_mins ahead of the job to let_me know when they would be arriving , which is what kwik_fit '_s customer_services had advised me .
neutral	ordered a large roman_blind .
neutral	easy enough to fit when i read the instructions i had emailed ( rather_than those that came with the delivery ).
neutral	the blind looks beautiful but the blind mechanism comes across as awkward ( being behind the blind itself ) and is clumsy to lift and drop .
neutral	because of this it has often come unclipped from the brackets .
neutral	think the 0 - year_guarantee might come in useful :-(
neutral	ordered a new mattress on - line and arranged for it to be delivered twelve days_later when it was convenient for us .
neutral	the mattress failed to turn_up .
neutral	the lady at customer_services was very helpful and said it had not turned_up at the leeds depot .
neutral	she promised to look into it first thing the following_morning and she rang me early to tell me it had still not arrived at the depot .
neutral	later in the day she rang to advise me it was missing as she had not managed to locate it .
neutral	she had checked to see a replacement was in stock and we received it the following_day .
neutral	we had asked for it to be delivered at the start of a week '_s annual_leave so it was not a problem being in for the rescheduled delivery , but in other circumstances people might be very inconvenienced should it happen to them had they taken time off work specially .
neutral	the mattress itself is lovely , extremely comfortable and a welcome replacement to our old memory_foam_mattress which we did not get on with as they are very hot .
neutral	i would strongly_recommend sleepeezee luxury backcare 0000 .
neutral	this review would have been five_stars had it turned_up on the right day .
neutral	when picking the car up on arrival i was taken back to find there was additional_costs for insurance which could have been explained better on the on line booking site .
neutral	i also wanted to add another driver who was arriving two_days_later .
neutral	when i went to add the other driver the waiting time was anywhere between 0 to 0 hours to have this done .
neutral	to have only two people on when the company should know how many people are arriving at any time is rediculas .
neutral	when waiting one of the staff went off to the cafe and left everyone standing so i left and did not add the other driver .
neutral	this is the only_thing that has let the company down in my opinion we enjoyed the car .
neutral	i was surprised to find that there was not a road map included as part of the information as when leasing cars in the past from other_companies i have always been given a road map .
neutral	i went to another company and got one even_though i had not leased from them .
neutral	i did bougt and pay for item 00 £ by paypal . i thought it done and after transfection thei did ask 0pounds extra for shipping in 00hrs , and any other options could not find ... i would not buy if i would now it is a 0pounds extrabecause in other_sites was much_cheaper with postage . but i coud not do anithing because of 00pounds was allredy deducted .
neutral	newer have any similar experence with extra other tranfection for postage ...
neutral	i booked parking then received a percentage_off if booked within_00hrs , they should give you the lowest_price without offering discount
neutral	we placed our order and was expecting delivery today thursday , received a phone_call this morning and was told delivery will now be on monday twelve days from order .
neutral	this was due to the vehicle breaking_down , standard excuse for not meeting our expectations .
neutral	this is for nine doors , i am now concerned where my doors are and the over handling of them , expensive order and worried .
neutral	they managed to get our address wrong , contact name wrong and email address wrong even_though i placed the order on line , i emailed them regarding an account quire as no one on the phone could help me so i was asked to email accounts , its been 0_days and still no reply from accounts , i was told items would be with me with in 0 - 0 working_days , two_weeks_later still had not received items i had to chase them , still have items outstanding even_though i was told they would all be here at the same time , although the price of the items are very good , i find their customer service not on top form .
neutral	i was disappointed by the length of time the product took ro arrive .
neutral	was expecting a bit better quality too .
neutral	all the same , after i washed it and the fluff stopped coming it looked good on my bed .
neutral	as a photographer , you need to provide direction and not just stand there .
neutral	direction wasn_'_t provided and was not happy .
neutral	but they are getting 0_stars because the person_who was showing us the photos was nice .
neutral	i took my car for m . o . t .
neutral	on a saturday after booking and paying online which was all very straightforward .
neutral	unfortunately my car failed so i was told by the lad on reception to phone back on monday and he would see if he could get the parts to do the job .
neutral	i was told not to worry , they would sort it for me .
neutral	great , i thought .
neutral	after the weekend i called in person on the monday to find out if they had gotr the parts and when they could do the job .
neutral	the guy in question wasnt there , half day or something so i spoke to another who rang the guy and he said he couldnt get the parts !
neutral	while i was there the other lad rang their supplier only to be told no , they couldnt get the parts !
neutral	i asked what i should do now as i needed my car and was greeted with a shrug of shoulders and told to take it to the nearest proton dealer a 00 minute drive !!
neutral	yes i was upset and angry about it to say the least !!
neutral	i just thought i would ask at another local_garage and have now got it booked in for 0_days time when the parts they did order , and got , arrived !!
neutral	needless to say this is what i have done .
neutral	i feel let_down because you would think a proton car was a rarity and the parts like gold_dust !!!
neutral	well they arnt !
neutral	!
neutral	my first experience with pretavoir was years_ago ordering a pair of chanel_frames .
neutral	i was notified of a delay of a month which i accepted .
neutral	however this was further delayed and i had to keep emailing to check for updates .
neutral	the lady_who took my order on the phone was also a bit curt and not as friendly as some of the reviews i had seen had led me to believe .
neutral	my second order was conducted wholly online a few_days ago .
neutral	they took my money instantly and now told me it was out of stock .
neutral	i checked on the website and nowhere does it say it is out of stock .
neutral	why do retailers do this ?
neutral	i was offered a refund but now i have to draw on savings to go look for the frames elsewhere whilst waiting for my refund .
neutral	they should only take your money after order has_been processed and confirmed .
neutral	first_class_post , does it always get packages the next_day ?
neutral	don_'_t use this company if you ' re running_low in stocks as delivery takes about 0 working_days !
neutral	eventually dog_food arrived and packaging was ripped with dog_food falling out everywhere !
neutral	i rang company immediately and they were very apologetic asking for a photo to be emailed .
neutral	i sent email and they said they would send a replacement but this still took another week to arrive !
neutral	i had to go elsewhere to buy as by the time it did arrive the 0nd time i '_d already run_out of food !
neutral	they seem rather disorganised as a company , and customer_care is a bit lacking , but they '_ve rectified any_issues i '_ve had ... eventually .
neutral	on the plus_side ... their 0000 thread bedding and their silk products are to die for !
neutral	i love the 000_% mullberry silk throw i bought ... it '_s like a soft , snuggly blanket .
neutral	i have sent you feedback via your site already .
neutral	i was very satisfied with service , delivery , packaging , but the date on the rabbit_food only allowed 0_weeks before it was out of date , this i thought very inappropriate as the bag was 00 . 0k , that is why i mentioned before i do not think i will purchase from you again .
neutral	i have never purchased a bag so close to the date as this , and therefore will have to shop elsewhere .
neutral	when arranging delivery on the web - site the date displayed was a month out ( december rather_than november ) so i was wary of placing the order as i needed the products asap .
neutral	i went_ahead and thankfully the e_- mail confirmation stated the correct delivery date .
neutral	the web - site needs attention .
neutral	all of the pictures in the advertisement included a hamper , so i was disappointed that the wine and cheese just came in a cardboard_box .
neutral	i '_m_sure everything will taste fine , but i was anticipating a bit more .
neutral	easy to use website - collection of goods very convenient .
neutral	only_criticism that payment took over six days before reaching bank_account .
neutral	i paid £_00 . 00 for a polo_shirt which is of very average quality .
neutral	not worth more than £_00 . 00 .
neutral	believe the flowers where lovely although i didn_'_t see them myself . only one disappointment and that was the flowers didn_'_t arrive until after 0pm . as it was my friends birthday they where delivered when the day was nearly over .
neutral	this was the first time i had ordered from walls and floors .
neutral	hundreds of tiles to choose from and the tile calculator was great .
neutral	however one large box of the tiles was completely damaged on receipt and the young_lady i spoke to at walls and floors was quite curt and abrupt when i rang to explain .
neutral	the problem was resolved but until i received the replacement tiles i had no idea what was happening with my claim .
neutral	this was my first order with them and it will be my last !
neutral	fast service and pleased with item but due to bad customer service i will not order from them again !
neutral	!.
neutral	0_days after my laptop arrived they had £_00 off it but would not let_me have the offer !
neutral	had it have been an item of clothing i could just return it and reorder at the offer the price so felt this was very unfair !
neutral	what happened to customer service where they want to look after the customers ??
neutral	?
neutral	the catalogue is confusing , giving very little information as to what problems the pills are for .
neutral	i only knew because i had bought them before from a different supplier .
neutral	the delivery is good but more education about the herbs used etc would be good .
neutral	was a little disappointed with the service , i bought a phil and ted vibe and wanted some help but unfortunately no one could answer any_questions and didn_'_t have a clue re the product .
neutral	the flowers i ordered arrived when they were supposed too and were also very fresh however i could not have been more disappointed .
neutral	the picture_showed on the website put what actually arrived too shame .
neutral	i have purchased better bunches of flowers at my supermarket for half the price .
neutral	could somebody please give me a call to discuss - thanks
neutral	car_mats uk are prompt and efficient on the whole i '_m pleased with my product i was offered an up grade for an extra £ 0 . 00 which i '_m_glad i took up as i dread to think what the standard matts would of been like as the upgrade makes only just worth having as i don_'_t rate the quality as high as the company , however i did want mats that are a perfect_fit for my new car hence_why i opted for these , so my advise would be not to go for the cheaper option as you could gets mats of this grade for far less in your local_supermarket
neutral	the harland hair that i used to order on a weekly_basis was amazing , never had any complaints from any of my clients .
neutral	but recently there hasn_'_t been any stock when i try to order or i '_m sent an alternitive without being informed and the hair is just not the same standard .
neutral	i ordered a few_days ago and the hair had unexpectedly jumped up in price and they said the hair was now true remy so i paid .
neutral	i used it on a client yesterday and it was so thin .
neutral	go back to harland hair !
neutral	i ordered 0x eames replica dining_chairs and they arrived within 0_days , quicker_than i had anticipated , which was very good .
neutral	they were addressed to another customer however , but at my address , so the courier double_checked they were mine and they were , so that was a bit odd ?
neutral	i think they look really good and i thought they would be easy to wipe_clean , which really helps with a toddler in the house , and was one of the reasons i purchased them , however one chair is now sadly marked after getting washable paint on it which won_'_t come off !
neutral	any tips on removing stains ?
neutral	thanks
neutral	have used other_sites whose costs are about the same but delivery is much speedier .
neutral	lovely lady spoke to me on the phone , my only_criticism is that i was promised a phone_call at 0 - 00 and it was actually 0 - 00 when i got the call .
neutral	took at a contract on the galaxy_s0 after two_weeks had problem with the phone when making phone_calls the person on the other end sounded very distorted , so sent my phone into three for them to repair , after receiving my phone back the issue had arisen again and this happened two more times where i sent my phone in for repair and it '_s wasn_'_t repaired properly i asked for a new phone but they didn_'_t give me one in the end the phone repaired it '_s self after months of problems with it .
neutral	i had put a game in my basket and went to the checkout only to realise that the game had been removed , tried to put the game back in my basket only for game to tell me it was out of stock , this should have been noted before i tried to put it in my basket there was nothing to say out of stock , then had bought a game only for them to refund me cause ey never had it in stock , neither did they give me a reason for the refund i was confused ,
neutral	i like the concept and the website is relatively easy to use .
neutral	also , any size parcel is possible - no minimum or maximum order , which is handy .
neutral	i also like the seasonal products ( christmas cards , easter_eggs ...).
neutral	they are also very careful about packaging - nothing has ever arrived squashed , broken , or spilled .
neutral	i did have a problem sorting_out one order , which didn_'_t go through properly due to an internet glitch .
neutral	it got through in the end !
neutral	i also wish there were a wider array of goods on offer , in particular cheaper brands ( of pickle or marmite equivalent , for example ), and magazines ( i often have problems getting specific magazines of which i only require one or two issues , their range is not very large and the ones i choose have often been_discontinued ).
neutral	but they are very friendly and always try to do their best to help .
neutral	fik mine vare efter 0 dage , det jo meget hurtigt .
neutral	desværre var_der intet som helt levede op_til forventningerne eller passede , skulle nok have set varen inden i butikken inden .
neutral	nu har_jeg sendt det retur med deres egen returlabel , men har intet hørt fra der , det_er 0 dage side .
neutral	på deres hjemmeside står der at de retunere pengene på ens konto inden for 0 - 00 dage_efter de_har modtaget pakken , men jeg_synes bare det kunne være rart med_en bekræftelses mail på at de_har modtaget den .
neutral	faktisk kan jeg godt undre mig over at jeg inden for de sidste 00 dage har fået reklame mails end " tak for din bestilling " mails .
neutral	det_er jo spild af min tid , da_jeg jo bare gerne vil gøre en handel .
neutral	the communication_regarding the item being dispatched and delivery was poor involving making two telephone_calls to the company .
neutral	having paid an extra 00 . 00 to have a saturday_morning delivery and waiting in all morning the delivery company failed to press the right bell and therefore didn_'_t deliver the product .
neutral	this involved me having to drive to the depot 00_minutes away .
neutral	i was unable to contact anyone on the saturday_morning .
neutral	made did refund my delivery costs but it was more about the inconvenience !
neutral	great products , excellent service and communication , but in this day and age when ordering products via the internet is the norm , the delivery time on rubbersole is far too long .
neutral	most sites are able to deliver items within a couple of days , items take about a week to be delivered on rubbersole which is poor .
neutral	if this was fixed they '_d get 0_stars .
neutral	reasonable_price for high_quality dry_cat_food , but delivery was slow .
neutral	i ordered on 00th_march .
neutral	although the acknowledgement said it was out of stock ( no mention of this on the website or i would have ordered elsewhere ).
neutral	i had no_indication of probable delivery date by a week_later and emailed to ask what had happened to my order .
neutral	i was told it would be delivered by 00th_march , which it was .
neutral	i think the fact that it was out of stock should have been shown on the website , or that i should have been given the option to cancel .
neutral	i have subsequently ordered dry_dog_food elsewhere with better results .
neutral	the web_site was well set out and easy to navigate .
neutral	i did see the delivered product as it was a gift .
neutral	the feedback was a little_disappointing however , the flowers were described as " nice "
neutral	i had expected more than nice for £_00 .
neutral	i ordered 0 boxes of tiles they were delivered very quickly and happy with my choice , but realised i needed another box .
neutral	it was no problem ordering some more of the same and was pleased you still had them in stock .
neutral	again they arrived very quickly but when i opened them 0 of the tiles were broken , i '_ve emailed your company about this but so far no reply .
neutral	i hope to get a reply soon .
neutral	i will be very annoyed if my email is ignored .
neutral	it '_s a mystery to me how this company have obviously having given some thought to the branding and attractiveness of their packaging , but didn_'_t consider being_able to read the instructions was all that important .
neutral	not only are they tiny , but they have also chosen colours that make it even harder for the customer to read them .
neutral	font_size is probably about four ( non - bold ) and green lettering on a yellow background ( for instance ) gives poor contrast .
neutral	they have also given more weight to other elements of the design and seem to have forgotten that actually , the instructions are one of the most , if not the most , important parts of the packaging .
neutral	it would have been easy to improve the instructions by changing the design slightly .
neutral	so folks - enjoy the food , but get out the magnifying_glass before you cook it !
neutral	bags were printed well and was happy with the product .
neutral	some employees i worked with could seem a little sharp , but the end product is well received .
neutral	ordered everything we needed for our ensuite and could not fault the quality and value though one box of tiles were broken , but they were fine about sending out a new box within a few_days .
neutral	my only_criticism is the delivery , you pay quite a lot for the service , you get a call to arrange a day , all good and then they come 0_days early !!
neutral	they did this again with the replacement tiles and was only pure_luck some one was in .
neutral	easy to order as usual , but the person_who wrote out our address labels missed kemba ( the house name ) off and the courier would not deliver .
neutral	took 0 heavy_parcels back to depot - sent us a letter ( kemba still missing ) which got here , and we had to phone premium tel .
neutral	line - wait on hold - and go through everything , then ring your co ,.
neutral	we got the delivery 0 or 0_days late ( everything sat in cambridge parcel depot over a weekend ).
neutral	was told you handwrite large order labels because only one label can be printed by your computer .
neutral	please can '_t you manually instruct your printer to print more than one with the complete invoice address on , then this won_'_t happen again ?
neutral	most annoying thing was waiting in all day for a non delivery !
neutral	easy to use the pre booked system .
neutral	car_park road surface extremely poor with huge pot_holes and very uneven surface for anyone with mobility_issues .
neutral	short_walk to terminal which is great - although no pedestrian direction given so we ended_up walking through the car entrance area - not very safe .
neutral	exit was swift with no_hassle .
neutral	good service each time i have phoned , but i have purchased 0 of the same item , 0 of which have broken within the first few_days of use
neutral	the computer has_been ( for a week so far ) exceptionally good .
neutral	it was securely_packaged , well built , worked immediately and i '_ve had no_problems .
neutral	it '_s beautifully quiet , and incredibly fast .
neutral	i wish i could extoll the virtues of the customer interaction experience though .
neutral	when i ordered the product , i fully expected it to take the full two_weeks , having read recent reviews on this site .
neutral	on the 00th day though , i had had no update and no computer .
neutral	i called up and was promised that it would shipped that day , or the following_day at the absolute latest .
neutral	the chap even went and checked on this for me .
neutral	so far , not satisfying but not terrible .
neutral	by 0 :_00pm the next_day i still had no shipping email , so i called again .
neutral	this time , i was told my motherboard was out of stock , and they were having to wait for a delivery .
neutral	when i informed him that i '_d called the previous day and been promised a delivery the day before , he went to " check " and all of a sudden my pc was actually complete with a motherboard and he '_d made a mistake !
neutral	funny that !!
neutral	it was shipped that night , but the whole_experience was frustrating , and a little_disappointing .
neutral	if a product is delayed past the two week limit , you really ought to be informing people as a matter of courtesy .
neutral	if it is delayed because of out of stock products , you absolutely should be informing your customer ( if that truly is the case ).
neutral	this is not customer service only exhibited by large retailers , and it is worth_investing in if you want return custom .
neutral	i can '_t fault the product so far , but the polite yet misleading phone operatives are something to be dealt_with .
neutral	had to wait for my lens cos the box was too_big !!
neutral	!
neutral	we ordered around £_000 , worth of bits including blow_up saxaphones and guitars what a disappointment - they were rubbish they never blow_up properly and the ones that did went down ...
neutral	everything was great apart_from them - which to be honest was supposed to be the fun part !!
neutral	!
neutral	delivery was excellent .
neutral	sweets were good apart_from whopper bars that were coated in some brown chalky stuff .
neutral	also thought postage bit dear .
neutral	whilst this company were very prompt in sending out the part ( gasket for britannia oven ) it was faulty , i had to return and they would then refund and i would have to reorder .
neutral	00 days have passed , i haven_'_t as yet received my refund ( although i don_'_t doubt that i will , the refunds dept were very helpful ) i tried to reorder and part was out of stock .
neutral	i consequently went to britannia direct who posted the same day and were considerably_cheaper .
neutral	£_00 . 00 including_vat and postage as_opposed to £_00 . 00 !
neutral	i booked car_rental with car del_mar for a trip in december and i had problems .
neutral	i carried on with my february booking with advantage at toulouse via car del_mar .
neutral	i wish i hadnt .
neutral	at_least this time i knew where to find them - 00 minute_walk from the terminal in sub_zero temperatures .
neutral	at the office i had to wait 00_minutes before anyone came to the counter .
neutral	the booking process was quicker this time but as i was booking the car for over 0_days i had to pay for a tank of diesel - luckily i used the whole tank otherwise they wouldve made money out of this .
neutral	i then went to find the car .
neutral	it wasnt where they said it was and when i found it the car hadnt been cleaned .
neutral	it had been wiped over and looked terrible due to the snow / salt marks on it so i couldnt really examine it for damage .
neutral	as i had to drive 0 hours i didnt want to wait for it to be washed .
neutral	apart_from that the car was ok . as the office would be closed when we were to return it we were told to park it at the car_rental hertz near to the airport .
neutral	on return we did this and hertz initially would not accept it and said we had to take it back to advantage .
neutral	we refused and eventually hertz accepted the car .
neutral	i am now awaiting the final_bill for the fuel and the additional driver as hertz inisited on taking all the paperwork including the itemised bill for these items .
neutral	if i am charged for anything_else i will be expecting a refund .
neutral	i will be very careful in future not to accept a booking using advantage as the car supplier at toulouse airport as the difference in price is not worth the reduced level of service you get with them .
neutral	if you have young_children , lots of bags or reduced mobility do not use advantage as you will struggle to get to the offices .
neutral	the product i received was excellent value for money and exactly_what i hoped it would be ,,,, however , it was intended for a birthday_present , so i paid for next_day delivery , it was not delivered for a few_days .... missing the birthday and still no refund on post and package .
neutral	bitterly_disappointed and will not be ordering again .
neutral	i seem to have had the same problems as a lot of se customers .
neutral	0 ) not being told they are hk based
neutral	0 ) generic replies to emails ( we are sorry for the delay , awaiting dispatch , high_level of orders etc ), none of which answered my questions
neutral	0 ) upgrading of delivery process
neutral	i am sure this all stems from the fact that they wait for your order , and take your money , before they source the product .
neutral	this is highly suspect and very unethical .
neutral	however , the product did arrive in a reasonable amount of time and i am pleased with the camera .
neutral	but unless i hear they have raised their game , i will not be using them again .
neutral	the blind looks_fab although still_waiting to be fitted .
neutral	unfortunately , the end of the box was completely missing , so plastic packaging was open to the elements .
neutral	i signed as ' packaging opened ' but was a little disappointed that no - one from the company got back to me to ask if the contents were complete and undamaged .
neutral	i hope all the parts are still intact .
neutral	order arrived really quickly , however some items were smaller_than_expected and i do not think they are worth price paid , also when i first looked on the site that day it said free brio watch on order over a i think £_00 but by the time i came to placing my order this offer had disappeared and i got a free leg wipe thing in a shoddy looking packet .
neutral	the only_reason i ordered off this site in the first place couple of years_ago was that they stocked my favourite_perfume which they don_'_t do anymore and now tell me they have not heard of it when i search the site , makes me sad , so come on please_please get_hold of " myqueen " eau_de parfum by alexander_mcqueen again so i can buy more .
neutral	but i am happy with the order and items i used so far .
neutral	thanks
neutral	hi the process from ordering to delivery was very good .
neutral	really impressed with the texts to report on the progress of the order .
neutral	the actual costume i was really disappointed with , my son has worn it once to a halloween_party and the whole back along the seam has ripped .
neutral	very poor quality and for a costume that cost £_00 . 00 i think it is quite unacceptable that i have had to pay to get it mended so he can actually wear it for halloween .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	my order was lost in the post and i will have to wait 00 days for a refund .
neutral	i am still_waiting
neutral	booked the hire_car online in the uk so that it was all paid for before the trip .
neutral	on arrival in ireland , we were stung for more money to cover full insurance , yes this was optional but would have been nice to have had this option when booking the car so that everything was prepaid up front .
neutral	having said that , we were given a brand_new car , golf tdi and it was a very nice car to drive , no_complaints there .
neutral	front desk staff were very friendly and amicable both on pickup and dropoff .
neutral	great service able to track when tickets were arriving .
neutral	rather pricey for two £_00 tickets .
neutral	more than double !
neutral	i ordered a couple of the ' eiffel ' chairs , but only one arrived .
neutral	i sent an_email to the sales_department , and the rep apologized for inconvenience , and is arranging for second chair to be sent out asap .
neutral	not a big problem really , i would still order from them again .
neutral	my initial order was badly packaged and as a result , the courier refused to deliver it to my house .
neutral	to their credit , there was no_quibble and a replacement order was quickly dispatched , this time well_packaged and arriving safely .
neutral	the customer service was excellent but the original dispatch should never of happened .
neutral	i got an autogenerated email regarding my order - it had been put on hold .
neutral	i then contacted their help_desk , they replied promptly , and i then stated the correct info they were lacking .
neutral	however , they never confirmed my update nor my order status , so i have no idea if my order went through or not .
neutral	inconvenient for me as i need my order asap .
neutral	i enjoyed_browsing on the different selections of lovely flowers .
neutral	but the negative is i had difficulty in completing / processing my order after i entered my card_details as it keeps on coming_back to the same page .
neutral	it was frustrating as i had to call the helpline .
neutral	i was told that it was the cookies on my computer and i had to redo everything again , including the personalised free card with picture of my aunt .
neutral	this nearly put me off completely but i decided to pay via_paypal after redoing them all over again !
neutral	i '_m pleased it it all done and hope that my aunt will love it for her_birthday .
neutral	that will help me decide_whether to use your site again for future orders .
neutral	many_thanks !
neutral	there are quite a few books that are not accepted which is disappointing .
neutral	the sequence of sending is good but i had a problem with my money which was not paid into my account when stated and i had to ring them .
neutral	this was an accepted mistake which was rectified quickly .
neutral	i will use the company again although the payment is sometimes very little and you have to find numerous books in order to raise the £_00 minimum .
neutral	would not have purchased the outfit if i new it was spunch clean only
neutral	i ordered a bouquet for my mum , i was a little disappointed because i paid for a deluxe_bouquet .
neutral	i was slightly_disappointed because it didn_'_t look very big for the money .
neutral	one of the sunflowers had lost petals and one of the alomeira had died .
neutral	the box of chocolates was tiny for £ 0 .
neutral	despite all of this my mum was please with it .
neutral	the villa was beautiful however there were a few problems , the seals on the plugs in the kitchen_sink had gone , the plug in the main_bathroom_sink once pushed in couldn_'_t get it back out , the other bathroom no plug at all .
neutral	the tv in one of the bedrooms wasn_'_t working nor could we get the cd_player to play a cd .
neutral	the freeview wasn_'_t working in the living_room which to me wasn_'_t really a problem but my boys wanted it on occasion , someone turned_up on our first night to install a washing line , then the rep came out the next_day to see if we were ok and let us know she was arranging for an engineer to come out and fix the freeview , she came back to say he would come out the next_day which he did , the day after the cleaners turned_up , we then had 0 day '_s of peaceful bliss but couldn_'_t properly relax as we felt someone_else may turn_up unannounced again , the cleaners were back again on the friday , we then had a free undisturbed weekend and monday then the cleaners turned_up again , the day after a man and woman just turned_up to go in the owners garage .
neutral	the views from the villa and the lovely garden and pool were amazing the only_thing that spoilt it were the people that kept turning_up unannounced with the exception of the cleaners , although everyone was very nice i think a phone_call prior to any visits would have been appreciated .
neutral	the money it cost to rent a private villa when it wasn_'_t actually very private was pretty high , any_problems should have been sorted before our arrival , we didn_'_t tell them about the other tv or the problem with the plugs as the last thing we wanted was another engineer or plumber turning_up .
neutral	it was just a nuisance not being_able to order a hamper and flowers on the same order .
neutral	however , it was all delivered promptly with no_problems .
neutral	i ordered my bugaboo_buffalo from pramworld on recommendations from friends as well as the fact that the buggy was in stock and i was told over the phone that it would be delivered the next_day .
neutral	however , despite having placed the order over a week_ago i am still_waiting for my items and my order still just says processing despite the nearly_£ 0000 payment being taken immediately .
neutral	apparently this is because the parasol i ordered is out of stock and they will only deliver the order all together .
neutral	i am so very disappointed as if i '_d have known this i wouldn_'_t have ordered the parasol and would have bought it from elsewhere as bugaboo products are pretty_much the same price everywhere .
neutral	i am now concerned that by the time the parasol is in stock other items of my order will be out of stock and i '_ll be waiting even longer .
neutral	i was so excited_about ordering the buggy and was really pleased that it would be delivered straight_away and now i '_m just really disappointed and frustrated and panicking that its not going to arrive in time for baby .
neutral	i just wish i '_d bought elsewhere now
neutral	website was excellent .
neutral	communication was good .
neutral	delivery did what it said on the tin but i was disappointed that the delivery card said rosen instead of rose .
neutral	i can '_t be certain that i didnt key it in wrongly when ordering but i '_m fairly sure i didnt so it was a bit embarrassing for me with the recipient .
neutral	in the end , my problem was fixed and almost a week_later it still seems fine .
neutral	i originally went to 0000rpm as my laptop screen just showed white and couldn_'_t do anything .
neutral	i went in on a saturday and handed it in and paid the £_00 to get it done quickly ( i am a student and needed it for work ).
neutral	i was told i would be informed about the price of the repair before they did it , i was not , i got a call saying to come pick it up .
neutral	they said they couldn_'_t replicate the problem and it was fine but they hadn_'_t fixed it .
neutral	so i pay £_00 and it worked for one evening .
neutral	the next_morning i turned my laptop on and same problem again .
neutral	went straight back at 0 . 00 .
neutral	they then told me the screen will need to be replaced and it might be up to £_000 .
neutral	i wanted them to phone me when they had a price , as being a student i dont have £_000 lying_around .
neutral	got a call at 00 saying it is fixed and ready to pick_up , no call of the price however a text was sent after they had phoned saying it was fixed .
neutral	i went and picked it up , it was working fine , but i had to fork_out another £_00 ( was supposed to be £_00 but they took the £_00 labour charge from the previous day off the price ).
neutral	so overall , yes my laptop is fixed but a lot of stress , especially over prices which i was not informed over , and the fact they said it was fine and it was broken again the next_morning , a positive was that the second time i brought it in they got it fixed on the day .
neutral	overall experience was alright however i might ask around for other repair people next time .
neutral	ringtons_tea good as ever , ginger snaps the best in world , sultana biscults really moreish .
neutral	unfortunatly the person delivering my goodies , rude , unpleasant and generally not helpful .
neutral	i have just come out of hospital , and an not allowed to carry anything , so i asked the courier if he could put the box in the hall for me , he throw it in to my hall .
neutral	the ginger snaps were broken and since one of the packs were for my friend i was not happy .
neutral	ringtons change the delivery company for one who at_least makes an effort .
neutral	i '_m a bit of an old stickler for routine and have been using our local argos for many_years , as have my kids who like the idea of choosing in the catalogue and then waiting_patiently to pick_up their toys etc when their number comes up .
neutral	argos can be a bit hit and miss .
neutral	some stuff is really good value and it is convenient to find a lot of things in one store but recently there have been some changes afoot in our local_store .
neutral	they have changed the catalogue areas from long benches to small circular table structures which now means that if it is busy you have to queue more to find an available catalogue whereas before there always seemed to be plenty of space .
neutral	i also don_'_t like the new computers .
neutral	i was trying to find out if something was in stock the other day and the touch screen thing didn_'_t work .
neutral	the previous electronic stock finders might have looked a bit old_fashioned with their green screens and basic text but at_least they worked !
neutral	i ordered a £_000 leather_jacket and i picked it up from store as i had to get it delivered as my size was not in store .
neutral	when i picked_up the jacket it was sent in a bag , all crumpled up and foldered in on itself .
neutral	i expected for the price and as its a leather_jacket it would have come on hangers with a bag around it .
neutral	i was really disappointed with this , and my jacket was all creased up :-(
neutral	very pleased with the blinds but the colour was stated as barely pink and i wouldn_'_t have described it as that .... more like a pale lilac / pink !
neutral	two years_ago i looked forward every wednesday to looking at my travel zoo e_mail , not now .
neutral	think that they should do more earliey travel deals , with discouts , at good hotels .
neutral	have booked many holidays through travel zoo in the past , but truly don_'_t think it '_s as good now .
neutral	the villa was dated and in need of refurb .
neutral	the pool caused a couple of cuts bad scratches as the steps are quite rough and the water was particularly cold .
neutral	it was meant to be heated .
neutral	big roomy villa with everything you would need for a great holiday .
neutral	you would need a car but are close to great restaurants and only just over a mile from a fab beach .
neutral	would recommend the resort if you want quiet place to recharge but not very touristy for the kids .
neutral	we had a lovely week and will definitely use villaplus again .
neutral	after_reviewing a company and reading other reviews on that company , all 0 gave a five_star_rating but the overall rating was 0_star ?!
neutral	makes no sense .
neutral	one bunch was nice but the other very poor .
neutral	for the money spent i could '_ve bought two big bunches from the supermarket and will do in future .
neutral	the product is good - unfortunately the blinds came up a little short to fit the window , but that was probably my poor measuring ?
neutral	!
neutral	we have travelled on dfds from newcastle to ijmuiden many_times as it is the easiest_way for us to get to europe on our motorbikes .
neutral	the cabin , restaurants , bars and other facilities on the ship are excellent and there is everything that we need .
neutral	the only_gripe is that in recent years the motorbikes have always been left till last for boarding - and this year for some odd reason at newcastle we were boarded 0 bikes at a time with long gaps between , even_though we were all going onto the same deck it '_s really frustrating .
neutral	also , your crew tell us to go up the ramp then hold us halfway up the ramp .
neutral	have they ever ridden a motorbike ?
neutral	it '_s not easy to hold a fully laden bike and then do a hill start on a slippery metal ramp .
neutral	at_least hold us at the bottom and let us go all the way up to the flat deck in one movement , then at the other end , we had to wait over an_hour after the boat docked to get disembarked .
neutral	i understand you have to balance the weight of the ship and load accordingly but it does really feel like bikers are second or third class citizens these days .
neutral	i hope you can look at this and make some improvements
neutral	i order a lot of gifts for my fiance from john_anthony and find there is a good choice of brands and products available .
neutral	however having made a number of purchases it is becoming a recurring theme that when they arrive there is serious damage to the packaging which is not ideal considering i intend to give the garment or accessory as a present .
neutral	for example the most_recent being a vivienne_westwood wallet and the box came very scuffed and marked .
neutral	only_downfall but a critical one i would say .
neutral	follow through on quality until it reaches my door not just the confirmation of my payment .
neutral	i have used villa_plus on numerous_occasions and have been very happy with them . this year i went to coral_bay in cyprus fantastic place but was disappointed with villa_plus .
neutral	i booked villa , flights and transfers with them .
neutral	firstly i could not book my seats on the plane as villa_plus booked flights through thomsons which then changed to jet0 i phoned villa_plus who told me to go to airport early .
neutral	i arrived in airport three hours before_departure and still didn , t get seats together which i was not happy about .
neutral	on arrival to villa the first thing i noticed was there was no air_con in living_room there was a unit but is only used for heating in winter .
neutral	you really needed it you came out air_conditioned bedrooms and a wall of heat hit you . i did presume all villa_plus villas had air_con throughout if i used them again i would definatly check .
neutral	it did spoil the holiday a bit as when you were cooking the sweat was running down you
neutral	i ordered my item , paid for it and then 0_days_later i received an_email explaining that this item wasn_'_t in stock and wouldn_'_t be for the next 0 - 0_weeks .
neutral	i emailed back asking to cancel my order and they did so immediately and a refund was issued .
neutral	the website and range of available boxes were brilliant and i quickly chose exactly_what i needed .
neutral	i felt that £ 0 . 00 was quite_expensive for delivery but the boxes were a very good price so i still went for it .
neutral	when the delivery arrived the van_driver phoned me because he couldn_'_t find our office , although we receive a number of parcels every day and they all come straight to our door .
neutral	so i had to walk all the way down the car_park in the rain to collect a huge , soggy , slightly crushed box from the delivery driver , who was very nice , but it was still not ideal after paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery .
neutral	however , i will order from rajapack again as their products are great and i will assume that this delivery mishap was just a one off .
neutral	i the person isn_'_t at home when you call then take the flowers away and try again later .
neutral	i didn_'_t want them them left out side , as it happens they found but much later .
neutral	if thay had gone_missing do you replace them !
neutral	other wise that flowers were great thanks and she loved them
neutral	kind_regards

neutral	ordered a little helper fun pod - fab product .
neutral	only_gripe is that i ordered this on a sunday , expecting dispatch on the following_day as promised on the website .
neutral	late_afternoon , i received an_email_saying they '_d tried to contact call me to conduct a security_check .
neutral	no - one called , no message , no missed call - as such , i '_d missed delivery for that day .
neutral	bit annoyed , but the product is great .
neutral	ordered my item in good faith as website showed it was in stock .
neutral	heard_nothing regarding the despatch so after 0_days i contacted them to see why i had heard_nothing .
neutral	it was clear from the conversation that the item was not in stock and had to be obtained from the manufacturer .
neutral	i was promised a call back but heard no more until i contacted them again after the weekend .
neutral	what was most irritating was that the money had been taken as soon as i placed the order , but they had no item to send to me .
neutral	after some back and forth they did get the item to me within the next 0_days .
neutral	however i think if i had not pushed it would have taken considerably longer .
neutral	it is unlikely i will be using them again .
neutral	after taking off all the add - on costs , it didnt update the balance correctly .
neutral	i then forcibly had to write a review comment
neutral	the drop_off was a nightmare , the guy to collect the car could not understand us and visa versa .
neutral	in the end we had to just leave it with him or miss check in .
neutral	the collection on return was great , polite prompt etc , only_thing was car was very muddy on return , would probably use again now we know what to do .
neutral	a lot of messing for little money , ok telling you of each process that is going on but all that for so little
neutral	good quick service but the description of the little girls pirate dress i ordered stated it was a dress and hat .
neutral	stripy tights were suggested as additional purchase so i added them to my basket however when the item arrived the packaging on the dress clearly said that tights were included within the pack .
neutral	so now i have two_pairs of black and white stripy tights and i '_ve been done out of £ 0 . 00 which while not a huge_amount of money leaves me feeling that it was all a bit deliberate to omit to mention that the tights were included and then suggest i need to buy them .
neutral	dress was great but won_'_t be using this particular company again ,
neutral	i was very impressed with the service when booking and the collection went fine .
positive	once again , i have been back to ultralightoutdoorgear as they simply offer the best price and the best service for what i was looking for .
positive	i also know that i can_rely_on them for good advice and an excellent website .
positive	what is there not to like ?
positive	quick delivery quality item - faultless
positive	both costumes ordered were of great quality and looked great on !
positive	helped_us have an amazing night !
positive	needed a ruck_sack for my sons xmas_present , ordered on line and it arrived very quickly , good packaging , no trouble what so ever ..

positive	easy to pick_up from delivery point will definitely do that again .
positive	good size and for price paid well_worth it
positive	it was quite easy to find correct_part i needed , easy to follow_instructions , delivery time not too bad , just a few_days .
positive	i will use this site again if i need any more parts for my hoover .
positive	thanks .
positive	excellent service , we phoned when we were about 00_minutes from gatwick_airport and the driver was there waiting to take the car .
positive	it was very easy to follow the directions and find the drop_off point .
positive	we had our car cleaned inside and out whilst we were on our holiday for £_00 and i was very pleased with the results .
positive	upon our return we phoned after we had claimed our_luggage and the car was there waiting for us .
positive	we were impressed with the punctual service .

positive	even better price !

positive	for the price i paid for those ceiling_lights i did not expect them to be as good looking , well made or packed so well and delivered in a flash as they were .
positive	i reckon i got a great deal more than i paid for .
positive	the site itself has a fabulous range of goods , is easy to navigate , and easy payment .
positive	i knew_exactly_what i wanted and very lucky for me google took me to castlegate .

positive	you got to see for yourself , here borrow my computer while i make us a cup of tea .
positive	the dewalt_drill has made erecting my new shed an_absolute_pleasure .
positive	one battery lasted a full 00_hours of working and then some .
positive	two batteries are even better , especially when they recharge in only an_hour ...
positive	the drill itself has plenty of oomph for those tough jobs , though maybe a little on the heavy side .
positive	price_wise it '_s great value .
positive	i am a excellent and avid diyer and it '_s going to be amongst some of the best tools i have .

positive	certainly the best and usually the cheapest for all staple products and medicines like flea & worm control .
positive	it '_s not really worth anyone '_s while using precious time trawling suppliers when animed is so consistently reliable and fair .

positive	i would happily reccommend this site .
positive	from a youth centre point of view - our centre has sessions for young people 00 - 00_yrs and we have found over the past few_years that items ordered from the happy_puzzle_company are great for getting young people to socialise and learn with each other .

positive	great service i would recommend this company to a friend .
positive	i '_ve only ever bought genuine cartidges , not the compatible ones , so the quality is bound to be good and i can '_t comment on the compatible versions but the price is always good and the delivery speedy .
positive	also because delivery is free and fast , it means i can order cartidges when my printer first tells_me the ink is low on watever colour , and they always arrive before i need it .
positive	i don_'_t do a lot of printing , this is for home , so i guess if you did higher volume , you '_d need to keep a stock of spares .
positive	all of my buying experiences with this company have been great .
positive	very easy site to use .
positive	was recommended by my local_garage who explained that nobody could beat tyre - shoppers prices .

positive	excellent company - used many_times - great quality products and efficient service
positive	my search for a new mattress came about as a result of a bad previous decision and a very poorly back .
positive	this time i tried every bed , in every shop , at every price and then i did my internet research and was actually intrigued by a negative_review ( on another site ) which looked out of place when i found the website and read the entire thing , and got in touch with my questions .
positive	the service was excellent .
positive	this company is really knowledgable , really polite and really informative .
positive	they recommended a mattress and i took the plunge - after all , why on earth would i buy a mattress i can test for two minutes in a shop , surrounded_by onlookers , when i could love it or return it within a month ?
positive	the company called after i made my order to check that i '_d made the right_decision , they then called a few_days_later as the mattress was ready !
positive	it was delivered on time , unpacked and put on the bed for me , and away we went .
positive	by night 0 the backache had gone , by night 0 we were sleeping for hours at a time .
positive	just to make_sure we '_ve revisited those bed shops and checked our short list again and this mattress is by far the most comfortable of all .
positive	if we '_d paid three_times as much it wouldn_'_t have been this comfortable .
positive	so , thanks to the negative_review ( from someone_who was unlucky_enough not to purchase from john_ryan ) i found one of the best , british made mattresses and one of the nicest , most knowledgable companies to do_business with .
positive	highly_recommended to all my friends .
positive	really pleased with service and products .
positive	would definitely use again .

positive	all flights , transfers , pick - ups and excursions were arranged for us and we had not one issue with any of these , everything_ran so smoothly from the moment we flew out of heathrow to the moment we landed back .

positive	we also went to a brilliant gourmet pizza restaurant round the corner that i can recommend called babalou .
positive	the only_thing i thought might be useful would have been a small kettle to heat up water for cups of tea , but we microwaved our water in lieu of a kettle .

positive	haven_'_t yet received my order as i only placed it this morning .
positive	but i placed an order the evening before but changed my mind .
positive	i called the next_morning and spoke to a very friendly and helpful customer service advisor who very easily and fuss free changed my order for me .
positive	they were extremely_helpful over the phone and you were not made to feel embarrassed ordering the items over the phone , as i would ordinarily do it online this being one of the reasons .
positive	i have done this before with other_companies where i have called or emailed to change an order but have been fobbed_off with the fact of it being too late as i was told it had already been packed !
positive	i also like the fact they offer super_saver delivery and send out free batteries with each toy that needs them .
positive	i was a loyal_customer to another well_known online adult retailer but have been looking elsewhere since they stopped offering free delivery on any order amount and only applying it to orders of £_00 +, having paying for batteries of which i think should automatically come with a toy if it needs it ( either from the manufacturer of the toy or the retailer selling them ) and a few unsatisfactory customer service enquiries that have been less_than useful .
positive	i will be sticking to nice ' n ' naughty from now on !
positive	good are always delivered promptly and price are fair

positive	i '_ve never had any_problems .
positive	i absolutely love tripadvisor .
positive	there are always great tidbits of information on there , especially about hotels / b_& bs and things to do in a certain place .
positive	you can tell the website is well - supported -- never any foul language , any_problems with the reviews .
positive	you can also select the " map_view ," which lets you see all of the hotels and b_& bs to chose from by location , so you know just where you '_ll be staying .
positive	i also love the fact that the photos are from the travelers themselves , not professional photos .
positive	the only_thing i '_d love to see improved is if there was always a direct link to a hotel / b_& b '_s website right from the review page -- it '_d be so easy to click over .

positive	i certainly would not buy my perfume , aftershave or cosmetics from anywhere_else .
positive	all as above .
positive	i used this place for the first time last_week .
positive	having inherited a wee red foot tortoise from a friend , there were lots of things i wanted to know about and many questions to ask .
positive	i had looked online and was bamboozled by the array of advice on how to look after these creatures - all i am sure very good .
positive	i phoned the centre and spoke to a lovely girl called sam who put me right on a few things and advised me what to buy provide an appropriate habitat .
positive	i am a complete_novice but she put me at ease wit her patience and understanding of what was required .
positive	when my stuff arrived and i was unsure what to do i called again and got the same girl who pointed me in the direction of the video they had posted on how to put_together the vivarium .

positive	we are very happy with the goods that we recieved , i would order again off them .
positive	they are for my grandchildren for my 00th party in december . l
positive	key_solutions were our answer to the problem of dwindling savings .
positive	we had known about key for sometime but were rather concerned_about what it involved , but when sarah_jane visited us she explained all very clearly and set our_minds at rest .
positive	the whole_procedure has conducted in friendly and professional way .
positive	even on our visit to the solicitor peter bartlett ( a charming man ) we felt comfortable .
positive	so thank_you all especially sarah_jane and peter ( who have told us if we have any_problems to get in touch with them .
positive	but we don_'_t expect we will .
positive	i found dealing_with this company easy and efficient .
positive	item arrived promptly and is of good quality .
positive	ordering was nice and easy so was payment and the goods turned_up promptly .... perfect .
positive	i am so indecisive .
positive	the thought of picking glasses out of a line up to buy freaked me out , which is why the home_trial option is so ingenious .
positive	i was able to choose , try and compare 0 pairs at a time in the comfort of my own_home , with the help of friends ( and scattered internet friends as the pictures went viral ) and family to dwindle down my favourites .
positive	there is no limit to your trialling attempts - i finally found my favourites in trial number 0 .
positive	my only quibble is that during the time of the first and last home_trial , some of my shortlisted pairs had sold out .
positive	thankfully i kept my eyes peeled and as soon as the pair i wanted was restocked , i grabbed them before anyone_else could .
positive	the staff are really friendly and helpful - i '_m not normally someone_who_likes to speak on the phone to ' customer service ' departments , but it felt like these people actually just worked there and were helping out by answering the phone .
positive	no sales_pitch , no security questions , just straight_forward service .
positive	i have had a great experience with glasses_direct , and i would recommend them to anyone in search of their new frames .
positive	i used alpha_rooms for the first time last_year .
positive	i had booked with another travel_agent only to later be told ( a week before_departure ) that the hotel was fully booked and they couldn_'_t accommodate us .
positive	luckily , i stumbled_upon alpha_rooms and booked the same hotel through them with no_fuss .
positive	this year i decided to use them again .
positive	their website was easy to use and when i called to make the booking , the agent made the whole_process very easy .
positive	would definitely use alpha_rooms again
positive	we had to wait a while for our order as it was initially declared out of stock but this was understandable as each item is apparantly ' made to order '.
positive	we would have appreciated a lesser delivery charge especially as when we later noted that another added item to increase the total_cost , would have resulted_in a ' free delivery ' .
positive	however , even after personal contact , we were unable to amend the original order .
positive	as first time customers , we would have welcomed a tweak here !
positive	this is very early stages , but the douglas small sofa_bed will suit our needs perfectly & we are delighted with the product design , size , colour , comfort & quality .
positive	we were notified in_advance of the delivery date & time which was very helpful .
positive	the product was unpacked for a quick check on contents but during assembly & attachment of the metal base , we later found that one of the 0 washers required was missing from the sealed package ( needed to find a substitute )
positive	the 0 delivery men were cheerful & friendly .. perhaps they could have offered to remove shoes before coming into the house but this is a minor ' tweak '!
positive	i cannot_fault the service i received .
positive	my vet provided a prescription which was scanned & sent .
positive	the response was a curteous reply & the medication for our elderly labrador was delivered within a few_days .
positive	we were pleased that we could split the prescription into 0 by buying 000 plt anti_inflammatory tablets now @ 0 a day & reserve the remaining 000 until the 0 month deadline ' on file '.
positive	thank_you for an excellent service !
positive	blanket arrived quickly even in the pre_- christmas_rush .
positive	quality looks lovely .
positive	haven_'_t taken it out of packaging as was a gift for my granny .
positive	she seems pleased with it .
positive	customer_services were very efficient and refunded the delivery charge which had wrongly been added to my order .
positive	at last my life is back on track thanks to dfd i can sleep eat and be happy again all the stress worry and strain have been taken_away they are both proffesional as well as personal with very friendly staff .

positive	was very impressed as the usually nightmarish procedure of organising life cover was made quite simple .
positive	( i used to work in insurance and know how many forms , delays , questions etc there can be .)

positive	i am a very sad vacuum fan who loves vacuuming and the gtech is just brilliant .
positive	the power for such a small vacuum is incredible .
positive	its light_weight and hassle_free as it is cordless .

positive	i love little_sunflowers for its hard to find on the high_street products .
positive	there '_s only one shop near me that stocks scandi clothes but its great to be able to purchase online rather_than dragging 0 small people around !
positive	my one criticism of little_sunflowers would be its branding and postal delivery .
positive	the brand identity is wishy_washy and doesn_'_t stand up to the premium stock it sells .
positive	this also translates in stock sent out in its factory clear bags and a posting bag .
positive	for the money you spend on nice clothes it would be nice to have the in store experience through your door , still picking and packing is time_consuming i '_m_sure - just a bit more brand love please !
positive	excellent speedy service
positive	i first liked hostelbookers . com because of their blog and regularly_updated twitter account but using them to book my stay for a busy_period ( rio_de janeiro carnival ) proved - with a lot of price comparing - that they have the cheapest rates and really are the only site without booking_fees .

positive	i had a mix_up with the post_office and printbasics made me feel no problem was too small to bother with .
positive	excellent customer service .
positive	i needed two hinges for my chest_freezer .
positive	the website was clear about which model could be used .
positive	it was easy to order and the spares arrived earlier_than the projected delivery date .
positive	fast , efficient and reliable .
positive	i once exchanged an item and got an_immediate_refund .
positive	that '_s what i call trustworthy .
positive	advice on sizing is spot_on .
positive	i ordered some samples wednesday_night which arrived friday_morning .
positive	i tried them on friday_morning went online and bought the pair i liked the most and they were on my doorstep the next_morning .
positive	amazing quick service !
positive	the glasses were well_packaged and appear so far to be durable and of good quality .
positive	i went to glasses_direct for the price but came away amazed by their service .
positive	have used this service now may times and have never had a problem .
positive	makes travel so much_easier with the added_bonus of arriving home from university to find your dirty clothes have been washed , dried and ironed !!
positive	!
positive	a fast and good quote was followed_by an excellent service .
positive	i would recommend to anyone .
positive	thank_you .
positive	service very good , and very helpful ,
positive	no_problems_whatsoever
positive	i would highly_recommend the use of trust_deed scotland if you are having financial_difficulties .
positive	the web_page was very easy to use and they got everything sorted and set_up for me reasonably quick
positive	the goods i purchased are exactly as_described , good quality at the right price .
positive	delivery was speedy .
positive	i can '_t fault the service .
positive	i was pleased with the rapid and efficient service and would use this company again .
positive	like all delivery drivers , they are cheerful , pleasant and helpful .
positive	such a pleasure to have contact with and so much_nicer_than shop_assistants who mostly can '_t be bothered .
positive	i will always prefer to buy online due to the efficiency , fast delivery and cheerful drivers who maintain this no matter_how busy as stressful their jobs must be .
positive	they are an underestimated asset as they brighten_up the day for so many people .
positive	by the way , i am not married to , related to , or a friend of any delivery driver , i have just had a delivery from yodel and found the driver so cheerful that he has really brightened_up my day .
positive	i am very pleased and impressed with the topper and the service .
positive	i have purchased toppers before so i feel qualified to comment on this one .
positive	the speed of delivery was superfast and the topper was very well_wrapped and packed , had there been any damage it would have been very easy to see before opening the inner packaging .
positive	there was no smell at all once it was unpacked and having arrived fairly early in the morning i was able to lie it on top of my bed for the rest of the day .
positive	early evening i put it on the bed as it was almost ready but certainly enough to sleep on .
positive	by the following evening it was as it should be and very , very comfortable indeed .
positive	the cover having a ‘ rough ’ surface underneath , stops it from slipping and having had it now for a week or so it has not moved at all .
positive	the free pillows that came with it were a real_bonus as although i already had similar pillows they were not such good quality as these and certainly they are far more comfortable as they are a bit softer to lie on .
positive	i would recommend this company highly to anyone as the service and product are exceptional .
positive	there are many firms selling toppers on the internet so thank_goodness i found this one as not only is the product and service first_class , the price was very , very competitive .
positive	thank_you .

positive	very shocked to receive such genuine advice for my acne when i called , i have never received a better service in 00 years of trying to treat my adult acne and needing help despite using other professional clinics .
positive	this resulted_in me researching the info i had been given by paul ( who was very helpful ) calling back and speaking to clare making a large order to try the dmk acu - klenz range which i would not have done if i had felt pushed_into it just for sales !
positive	they are a professional clinic striving for professional results and they really want to help . i feel_confident that if this range is not for me i can call for guidance and they will know what i need to do to adjust it . i only wish i lived_near them as i would book some professional treatments at there clinic . this service will result in repeat treatment and referral .

positive	i spent_ages looking for some new frames for my updated prescription - traipsed around all the local high_street shops but found nothing i liked .
positive	a friend recommended glasses_direct , as they will re - glaze your old frames .
positive	brilliant - i was always comfortable with the old frames so why_bother getting new ones ( i love recycling anyway !)
positive	they sent me the cases in the post , i sent in my old glasses and then a few_days_later the re - glazed glasses return .

positive	i decided to go_ahead with lens replacement after a consultation where i was advised it would be perfect for me .
positive	i have been severely short_sighted since my youth and now the age_related long sight was kicking in and i was juggling with contact_lens with glasses on top to try and get through various scenarios where my needs were different .
positive	i feel like my life is completely changed , being_able to wake_up and see the clock was a bit of a shock quite honestly but gradually i have become used to it and now dont have to worry_about having everything with me if i go_anywhere or suffer the pain of dust on my lens causing watery eyes for hours .
positive	the procedure sounds much worse_than it actually is and although daunting was completely pain_free .
positive	at no stage did i feel like i was being " sold " something and i feel it has_been the best money i have ever spent .
positive	when we ordered the dolls_house , there was a problem with the online payment page and it was not clear whether the payment had gone_through or not .
positive	the next_day i called customer_services who answered quickly and courtiously and confirmed it had gone_through .
positive	the parcel arrived the next_day , even_though it was during the peak christmas delivery period .
positive	as it is a christmas_present my 0 year_old hasn_'_t opened it yet , however he has played with it in a shop and loves it ( where it is 0 / 0 more_expensive than at preciouslittleone ).

positive	i was a bit_worried to start with as i thought " oh well i may as well start another new diet .
positive	but , when the meal_packs arrived and i unpacked the boxes , i couldn_'_t_believe that all these wonderful labled dishes were for me to try .
positive	then after one week i was converted .
positive	this is the most easiet diet to stick to that i have ever started .
positive	i shall not weigh myself until after week 0 , but i think i am slowly melting away .
positive	this is the most perfect company to do_business with .
positive	i placed my order for an arctic jacket on the 00th_december and it was delivered to me on the 00th_december .

positive	i recommend them to everybody .
positive	just read some terrible reviews for this company and i think i was reading about some other courier service .
positive	i was expecting a parcel on 00 december .
positive	interlink sent me a text that morning to say my parcel would be delivered between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 .
positive	my parcel was delivered to me at 00 : 00 .
positive	it was delivered by a very nice man who knocked at the door and wished me a good day .
positive	the parcel wasn_'_t damaged in any way .
positive	in fact i was absolutely_delighted with the whole courier experience as i had been previously very let_down by parcelforce .
positive	when i was finally allowed to collect my parcel from their office , the staff there said they were very disappointed with their driver , which didn_'_t help me much at all !!!!

positive	as a service you delivered exactly_what u promised with no_hassle ... so thank_you .
positive	i like the idea of this product as i work_shifts where i need to eat my main_meal in a short amount of time .
positive	having these ready to go meals whilst knowing that they are not loaded with salt / artificial flavouring etc .

positive	it arrived really well_packaged and within 0_days of being ordered ; it fits_beautifully , is obviously very well made and i can see it fast becoming a wardrobe favourite !
positive	rentify archives all your adverts so the next time you need to advertise a property ( and this could be in two years time or longer ) the advert will still be there , in your account .
positive	it then may just need to be tweaked , rather_than fully rewritten , which saves busy landlords masses of time & trouble !
positive	your account is easy to access as it does not demand a difficult to remember password or user name which can be so frustrating !
positive	the rentify team are also easy to access .
positive	they don_'_t keep you hanging on the phone for ages and are helpful , polite and efficient .
positive	i ordered the sanderson quilt throw from bedeck as i had already bought the rest of the bedding_set from house of fraser sale but they had no throws left .

positive	a few_days_later i had a call from a guy_who was funny and very down to earth , confirming that i was happy with everything and cleverly checking things that would make life_easier , such as whether the deliverer would need to climb steps and whether there was parking access .
positive	i received a text the night before delivery giving me an eight hour_window within which it would come .
positive	lastly , the deliverer called me personally one hour beforehand to let_me know he was coming .
positive	in all , there was a fantastic quality of service which ensured that everything was how you wanted and communicated well , without being overbearing in the slightest .
positive	the delivery itself was done and dusted_within fifteen_minutes - there were two friendly males who just got on with the job , were efficient and polite .

positive	from order to delivery .. i ordered a cot_bed mattress from a well know store . no choice of time or day was offered . i stayed in all day only for them to deliver the wrong_size mattress .
positive	then had to wait in another day for them to collect it . then to top it off they didn_'_t have any of the correct_size mattresses left so was going to have to wait for them to get more stock in .
positive	in the mean time i discovered " pramworld " i ordered a mamas and papas cot_bed mattress on the thursday_evening before good friday and was told it would be here on the following wednesday ( that wasn_'_t convenient ) but with a couple of clicks i could choose another day or could have it left with a neighbour .

positive	since_starting with windsor telecom in 0000 , they showed that they understood the needs of a business which relies on a fully_operational phone system and since then , we have never had any telephone down time caused by them .
positive	from our initial start - up we needed a reliable , flexible system , that did not require a large financial investment .

positive	i had an old pair of glasses that i really like , but the lenses had somehow got badly_scratched so i only ever wore them as a spare_pair .
positive	i decided to revive them by sending them to reglazemyglasses , using the £_00 discount_code on moneysavingexpert . com .
positive	i filled in the form online , and within a few_days received a box and instructions on how to send off my glasses .
positive	in my haste to send them off i forgot to include the personalised information sheet , but had included a copy of my prescription with my name on .
positive	i gave them a call to explain and was reassured that they would use the prescription to find my details so not to worry .
positive	the following_day they called me to confirm that my glasses had been received , and to check what thickness lenses i required .
positive	i wasn_'_t sure what the numbers meant , so after some discussion with the member of staff looking at my old lenses i decided to go with the slightly - thinner - than - standard lenses .
positive	they took my credit_card_details and assured me that i would receive my reglazed glasses back within 00 working_days .
positive	sure enough , they arrived well within that time , and i have been wearing them like a new pair of glasses ever_since .
positive	overall i '_m delighted with the service , and wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend them to anyone .
positive	this was my first order from chocolatetradingco . com and i was very impressed with the choice of products available , the information provided relating to the products and the prices were very competitive .

positive	i was impressed with the easiness of use and the variations of layout i could have on each page .
positive	at the end of the process the system asked me to proof the book which i thought i had done but then it flagged_up an empty photo box on a page that i would have otherwise have missed and would have been obvious once printed so great save there , especially after i '_d ticked a box to say i had proofed it and was happy with it !
positive	once i had finished the book it was uploaded to the website and i was able to track the progress through printing , binding and eventually posting where it arrived 0_days_later .

positive	i recently bought my hubby the dji phantom 0 to go with his gopro hero 0 camera , and rcgeeks has_been an_absolute_pleasure to deal with .
positive	everything worked_perfectly straight out of the box , pretty minimal setting_up required and we were ready to fly within an_hour or so .
positive	but due to our lack of knowledge with this type of thing , we thought we needed an upgrade kit to get the camera to pan up and down , so we ordered the upgrade kit for it that evening .
positive	however , shortly_after we realised that the kit was already installed as standard ( a switch on the back of the controller ) and so first thing the next_morning i rang rc_geeks to cancel the order before it got shipped and thankfully there was none of the usual malarky of " sorry but the order has_been processed now ...".
positive	the chap simply said " no problem , i will cancel that for you ", which he did .
positive	job_done :_o_)
positive	btw , the dji phantom 0 is amazing !!!
positive	you know when you are expecting something to be pretty awesome , but then you get it and it still way exceeds your expectations .
positive	it is such a fantastic , quality piece of kit and well_worth the high price_tag .
positive	if in doubt , buy it , you wont_be disappointed !
positive	!
positive	so in summary ... super customer service , fast delivery , fabulous item and one very happy hubby !!
positive	top_marks to rc_geeks !

positive	we splashed_out on the omega_0000 juicer ( chrome ) after_reading the reviews and listening to my brother - in - law who is brilliant at researching products before he buys them ( we basically wait and see which model he buys and then go with that !)
positive	we paid the extra £_00 to get the chrome model which i think is worth it as it is an expensive thing and the white one just has a bit of a cheap look about it to me .
positive	not doubting the quality of the machine of course as it is fantastic i just felt the styling in white looks a bit cheap to be sat on your worktop all the time !
positive	this machine is such a good quality sturdy piece of equipment and while it is expensive , it is worth_every_penny and we have been .
positive	it is an amazing juicer and one of the brilliant things about it is how easy to clean it is !
positive	it all comes apart into about 0 big bits which wash really easily and pop back together very simply .
positive	it '_s so well_designed and thought out and the build quality is superb .
positive	we bought this after watching the programme " fat , sick and nearly dead " ( well_worth a watch if you havent_seen it !).
positive	we have cleaned up our eating_habits a bit recently and thought we would try and add some healthy veg juices to our daily diet .
positive	we ordered it from uk_juicers and it arrived the next_day , fantastic service and the free recipe_book is brilliant !!
positive	it is a flip book in a little plastic case ( all pages are plastic coated so the juice drips won_'_t ruin it ) and gives you loads of different recipes and tells you what health_benefits they each have .
positive	really great free gift to receive with it !
positive	can '_t recommend this juicer or this company any higher !
positive	!

positive	i started to build computers as a hobby for friends and family , but in the last_year have set_up my own computer business , repairing and building computers for customers .
positive	i seldom have any_problems with components but when i do aria are very good at replacing them .

positive	sitting only feet away from sir ian mckellan when you '_ve only paid for a cheap seat taken some_beating !
positive	easy site to use , great products and delivered on time , in short delivery windows ( so you don_'_t have to stay in all day ).
