negative	very unsatisfied with product .
negative	it was shipped with multiple wrong parts .
negative	it took months to resolve .
negative	they stopped answering my calls to get the right parts so i had to call credit_card company to get a credit before they finally responded .
negative	i wish i would have read thier reviews online prior to buying .
negative	my husband drove 00_minutes one way to the location to sign the contract because i was told the facility was only open every other day .
negative	when he got there the facility didn_'_t have the confirmation that he showed them on his phone and didn_'_t even have storage available .
negative	he then drove back .
negative	he basically wasted 0 . 0 hours of his day because sparefoot didn_'_t bother to check with the facility .
negative	we worked hard to send out email invitations for our customers past and present to leave reviews about their experience with us .
negative	trustpilot then called us to sign_up for their paid service and we declined because we used another review company at the present .
negative	0 week_later .. the handful of reviews we had on trustpilot were all taken down .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	i ordered two pieces for a halloween_party in sept . 0_weeks_later i called about my order and was assured it would be here by or on the 00st .
negative	with halloween being on a monday i explained that the costume was for parties and not trick or treating and i ordered early enough not to have to worry .
negative	i was told one piece was on back order and would be sent out as soon as it came in .
negative	one week before halloween , i emailed ami that i no_longer wanted the order .
negative	0 days_later they replied that i piece was shipped and the other piece was refunded .
negative	when i received the one piece in the mail ( on the 00st ) it was nothing like the picture .
negative	so i used their return_label and sent it back to them .
negative	in mid nov .
negative	i got it back with a standard form as to why they would not except the return .
negative	the form had several reasons listed , but none were checked .
negative	instead they hand wrote at the bottom that i didn_'_t have some_sort of return # that is required ???
negative	after several emails and 0 phone_calls i finally spoke with a manager .
negative	just to be blown off and told i was not getting my money back .
negative	thats when i disputed the charge with my credit_card .
negative	after explaining everything to my credit_card company .
negative	they agreed to dispute the charge .
negative	mid dec . the charge was returned to my account and the dispute was finalized , or so i thought .
negative	the rest you can call coincidence if you want but on christmas_eve , less then 0_weeks after the dispute was final and the first tim ei used my card since sept , my card was declined for a purchase .
negative	when i called they told my there were some questionable online charges that same day that were not mine , so they voided my card and are sending me a new card with a new number .
negative	since i rarely use that card it was easy to who might have had access to my information .
negative	of course i can '_t prove who did it and the attempted charges totaled less then 00 dollars , it seems like a feeble attempt done just to mess with me .
negative	i am also very confident that this review will get a response from ami a lot faster then any of my complaints that went directly to them .
negative	the reason is it say '_s you will deliver the ink in two_days , it took 0 your ink is already running_out i only had it one week
negative	poor service and poor quality this is not the first time this is my 0nd
negative	this website is a scam !!
negative	bankrupt !!
negative	!
negative	since august_0000 i bought 0 bags for 0 . 000 €, which they never sent !!
negative	i tried to contact them by email , they took so long to reply , and only to tell me they were available and going to send them .
negative	so i waited … after a long while , i decided to cancel my orders and pick some other bags instead .
negative	i did this 0 times from august_0000 to now , mid - february_0000 , more than 0 months !!!!!!
negative	and i '_m a good client , i spent more than 00 . 000_€ in a year and they sent me most of what i ordered , even if it took 0 months for some !
negative	but since august , whenever i sent them emails , when they replied ( half of my messages were never answered ), they gave_me partial answers .
negative	on the 00 / 0000 i asked them to send me the bags or let_me choose some others instead .
negative	they told me they cancelled the orders so i could pick something_else .
negative	they didn_'_t reply until the 00 / 00 to tell me they would check again .
negative	but i got sick of waiting so i asked my boyfriend , who is italian , to have a look , as his father is a police officer and he knows people in italy that could help me , so he called some governmental office to ask them about fashionqueen . net , and guess what ?!
negative	fashionqueen doesn_'_t exist !!!
negative	it is not registered , the p . iva it00000000000 doesn_'_t exist !
negative	!
negative	my boyfriend wrote an_email to fashionqueen to ask them to send me the bags and reply to the many emails i sent them , otherwise he would sue them in order to get a refund .
negative	and guess again ?!
negative	here is the answer :

negative	meanwhile , be very careful !
negative	i will sue them and call the italian authorities + i already have a lawyer there … let '_s see ...
negative	i received the wrong part and in order to return it i have to hurdle through their website and possibly pay restocking fees regardless who '_s fault it was , they titled the merchandise correctly they obviously don_'_t stock their merchandise correctly .
negative	unable to get through by phone after on hold for 00 plus minutes .
negative	that '_s not right , i will never do_business with this website again .
negative	the first bag didn_'_t do any good but thought i would give it a chance and try again , the second bag nothing .
negative	good morning , i would know how long it will take yet ?
negative	the data regarding purchases are .
negative	the application number 000000000 and the number of screening gm000000000000000000 .
negative	i was told in march_0000 that i had a year to use the credit i had on a return flight i cancelled .
negative	i knew you all would find a way to deny me my credit and you did ... i found out , when i tried to use it that it was a year from when i booked the flight ; which was january_0000 ... i will never use travelocity again and i will advise all friends against it as well .
negative	i was extremely disappointed with the delivery of some fence panels that i had delivered .
negative	as i write this i am still_waiting for their delivery .
negative	these were ordered on the 00th of may .
negative	todays date 00 may .
negative	i phoned selections on the 00th to enquire where they were .
negative	i got a silence then i got we have been busy , so they may take longer to get out to you , even_though i had received an_email_stating they had been dispatched on the 00th , then another on the 00rd .
negative	i then got as there was a short stock the could of sold out .
negative	they said they would look into it and call me back .
negative	i was told they had found the panels and they would package them up and send them out that day , so i would get them on the 00th .
negative	what a surprise no panels .
negative	so i hope i will get them tomorrow ??????
negative	?
negative	i purchased tailgate cables for my 0000 tacoma from parts_geek .
negative	the part was listed to fit 0000 - 0000 .
negative	i received them and they were 0 / 0 inch too long .
negative	i contacted both parts_geek and dorman to verify if that was the correct_part and both stated yes .
negative	i went to my local toyota dealer and purchased one cable and it fit .
negative	it was 0 / 0 inch shorter_than the one from parts_geek .
negative	i got my rma_# from parts_geek and they stated they would not refund the original shipping cost because dorman says they fit .
negative	the part does not fit and toyota looked at it and verified that it was too long .
negative	so i got screwed on 0 . 00 shiping and 0 . 00 to send it back .
negative	pg said too bad for me .
negative	they suck !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i was not happy with the teds socks that i received .
negative	i ordered a medium and received a small which did not fit .
negative	i will return them when i get a chance
negative	i placed an order in nov 0000 ... nov_00th i received an_email_stating my order had shipped .
negative	today is jan_00th 0000 and i am still_waiting for my delivery .
negative	i have sent numerous_emails , faxes and unanswered phone_calls .
negative	this company frustrates me to no end !
negative	i place my first order on sunday , 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	today is wednesday , 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	only now do they decide to ship my order out to me !
negative	the time it will take to ship my order via ' smartpost ' still remains to be seen so , this is still an undecided total failure to me .
negative	all in all , a very dissatisfactory transaction for me .
negative	i suppose that i '_ve been completely spoiled by ' amazon_prime '_s ' efficient shipping methods .
negative	' nuff_said .
negative	ami has the worst customer_service .
negative	returning / exchanging item is the biggest hassle of all time .
negative	they do not even let you receive a refund .
negative	only store credit that does not even deduct right_away at check out .
negative	horrible getting through their phone system .
negative	u will never get through so don_'_t bother .
negative	they also try to rip you off by not even showing the price of the item on your order sheet .
negative	doesn_'_t even show you how much you paid for anything on the invoice they ship .
negative	clothing quality is very cheap and poor .
negative	they photoshop too much so you can '_t even tell what kind of material the item is .
negative	they don_'_t even state what size model is wearing .
negative	i just received my ink_cartridges .. two black and one color in a set .
negative	installed the first black_cartridge this morning and got an immediate alert on my computer that the cartridge was depleted .
negative	when i checked the ink level it shows 00_%.
negative	terribly frustrated .
negative	not sure if i will trust them with another order .
negative	i have had issues rebooking my flight , actually being_able to speak with someone , and so_far have still not gotten it fixed after being transferred to several people .
negative	i will never purchase anything through them ever again .
negative	the only way this is being resolved is by united which has had wonderful support .
negative	i would advise to not support priceline .
negative	i sent you a check at the end of april , which i knew would take some time for you to clear it and get the order out , but then about a month_ago you sent this note indicating you had sent the ink ... and i still do not have my $_00 worth of ink !
negative	i am retired and don_'_t have lots of money , so i trusted you .
negative	i have needed this ink for some time and cannot_afford to go and buy some until yours comes .
negative	my order number is 0000000 .
negative	i would like some kind of a response , please .
negative	my address is 000 betts rd ., orrington , maine 00000 .
negative	beware .
negative	i booked one room at a great rate but was only allowed to book one at a time .
negative	i needed two rooms for my family , but when i immediately went back for the second , the same room had gone up 00 %!
negative	i haven_'_t received the product yet , hence i can '_t rate the service .
negative	i have been using priceline to get rooms due to relocation for my job .
negative	this past week my job told me after i booked a room that they didn_'_t need me .
negative	i attempted to get a refund for the room i booked and was told there was no way to get one .
negative	so i ended_up spending 000 . 00 for a room for a week that i didn_'_t have to spend .
negative	i think the policy needs to be revisited for occasions such as the one i stated .
negative	i have used this site on several_occasions but will now consider other avenues .
negative	i will not recommend this site to any of my business partners nor friends .
negative	jeg_havde bestilt en computer ved proshop med forventet levering inden for 0 - 0 dage .
negative	da de dage er gået ringer jeg til deres kundeservice der fortæller mig at den kommer om yderligere 0 dage .
negative	jeg_har nu efter yderligere 0 dage kontaktet , hvor jeg spørger ind til problemet og hvorfor jeg_er_blevet lovet noget de ikke kan holde .
negative	medarbejderen beder mig om at lade være med at være flabet og fortæller mig at det_har de aldrig sagt .
negative	altså er jeg både flabet og en løgner .
negative	de må åbenbart have kunder nok når de behandler dem på_den måde
negative	ja så nu har de mistet en kunde der eller har_handlet ved dem i 00 år som privat og nu skulle have første bestilling som erhverv .
negative	men ak ja det blev_så den sidste og_varen er nu også afbestilt
negative	my order failed to arrive at its_destination on the specified date , which was crucial .
negative	then when i contacted iflorist about this they failed to respond twice to my enquiries , even_though they promised to .
negative	when i sent a letter to the company with photocopied evidence of my communication with them i received notification that my order would be delivered the next_day - 0_weeks late .
negative	quite_frankly what was the point in doing that ?
negative	the intended surprise for our daughter '_s celebrations was lost .
negative	it would have been far better to have received my money back .
negative	very disappointing experience .
negative	i had trouble accessing the completion part of my order the last two times i tried to shop online .
negative	i requested assistance , got none , wrote and said you needn '_t send me any more great deals online , as i wasn_'_t going to go to all the work of getting my order ready , then being_able to do nothing with it .
negative	so , friend to friend , goodbye nygard !
negative	no phone_number , complaint made via_email , received a reply but didn_'_t address the complaint at all , poor quality merchandise , am one step away from reporting this company to trading_standards , will never use again !
negative	whilst the product itself once eventually delivered was perfectly acceptable , the delivery was poor .
negative	i ordered premier delivery , and was advised delivery would be between_0am - 0pm , so i ordered it to be delivered to my work address knowing anybody would be there to take delivery as my daughter was dying to get her product .
negative	the product was delivered at 0 . 00am therefore the reception was closed even_though i start work at_0am .
negative	so ... rather that ring the number given - my mobile the delivery company took the product away and instead of ringing they sent me a letter , hence delaying the delivery a further 0 days .
negative	never again !
negative	!
negative	i '_ve just ordered flowers for a friend in lancashire and the prefer confirmation_email looks like it is coming to me in edinburgh instead .
negative	i definitely put her address in of 00 lancaster gate , fy0 0aw .
negative	when you look at previous_orders you can only see the billing_address and not the delivery address or indeed the person you are sending them to .
negative	help
negative	i need to the flowers to go to her not me .
negative	still after all the phone_calls and my detailed review your company still does not get it !
negative	yes i am aware about proof reading my own custom card . this huge error had nothing to with mispelling or anything i myself could contol .
negative	this was a huge printing error that never should have been sent out . instead of blaming the customer take ownership you are ones advertising custom printing on greeting_cards . not me !
negative	i paid to use your service . what i received was not perfection or anything close .
negative	your printing machine put a huge bar_code through all the names across the signature line . the bar_code does not go on the inside of any greeting as i am aware of ? also when i previewed my custom card there was not any bar_code ... this was smeared and you affixed the gift_card on top of the error as to hide it . if i did not peel the gift_card off i would not have seen it . also addressing a customer the way you just did on a public forum shows me once again ... you do not comprehend the issue that occured , you have no remedy in sight . nor do you have plans of addressing the fact that the whole_process the printing of the card and gift_card is automated and entirely executed by a machine including putting the finished printing project into an envelope .
negative	yes ... you give the customer a chance to poo roof read theirnprinting lay out however .... you have no one in your company over seeing your printing for errors by your machines . if you did this card you sent out would never have been sent out . i have no control over bar_codes .
negative	nor is their an option to place or removeca bar_code . do you even understand the problem ?
negative	because the reply you offered was disappointing and appauling . blame the customer for your ineptitude ?
negative	again the customer has no control over your malfunctions of your machines .
negative	hire a proof reader . treat your customers with some respect be empathetic of the issues you create . think about what you reply to your customers . that is if you want them back . i wont be back . i own a real_estate and a construction company for 00 years . i have never blamed a customer for my failings shame on you !
negative	i ordered my order 0_weeks_ago and it hasnt even shipped yet !!!!
negative	they already took my money but they havent shipped my vitamins !!!
negative	its absolutley riddiculous !!
negative	!
negative	placed an order on 00nd may as i was going away on 0nd june .
negative	i paid for priority postage because of the bank_holiday_weekend .
negative	left 0 messages on an answer phone and sent three emails ( including a request for a refund of postage ) and there was no response to any !
negative	in desperation i ordered from a competitor on 00st may and received the order the following_day - post free .
negative	i received my order from zest on 0nd june - 00 days after paying for priority postage .
negative	now 0th_june and i have still not received any response to any of my phone_calls , nor my emails .
negative	zest '_s customer_service is absolutely disgraceful .
negative	i ordered 0 items from the store only got 0
negative	i ordered a part , got it in 0 week , wrong one , i had ordered the wrong one , i then shipped back at my expense then finally got the right part , 0 days_later .
negative	still all in all very bad_experience , and my last with them .
negative	absolutely the worst .
negative	unless you consider " fast " 0_weeks +.. also , the repair job was terrible .
negative	i had two arms replaced on a pair of chanel frames .
negative	when the estimate came through about the repair they asked if i wanted new reading lenses put in .
negative	i chose the lenses and paid for the amount and was told they would be mailed out quickly .
negative	when i finally received them the two arms were attached differently and were " floppy " - cheap workmanship , and there were no lenses that i had paid for , and they charged me $_00 shipping .
negative	the online_chat person arial was unhelpful and would not let_me speak with a manager .
negative	a wholly awful experience after waiting almost 0_weeks .
negative	i called amex and disputed the charge and they found in my favor , refunding the full_amount .
negative	so , buyer_beware .
negative	go elsewhere .
negative	never use these_guys .
negative	they made several errors during the processing of my visa that delayed me .
negative	someone wrote in an_email , " will someone please contact this lady ?
negative	she '_s a real pest ."
negative	the email string got back to me .
negative	i was simply asking questions which is what visa agents are meant to do .
negative	then , they got the dates wrong about my return home .
negative	nobody answered my emails in a timely way .
negative	while i was away they sent somebody_else '_s passport to my house .
negative	luckily my family is honest and sent it back but these people are incompetent and not to be trusted with secure information !
negative	first two times i shoped with them they were fast , the products were good and i had good price .
negative	so , they asked me to give a good review to their company here .
negative	i did .
negative	after i had somee trust and kept buying from then and they never sent me the products .
negative	i have lost around 0 thousand euros with them .
negative	some orders , like the 0000 / 0000 was made almost 0 months_ago .
negative	others had many itens , but they just sent me the cheapest product and no explainations .
negative	for this they have good prices , because must of the orders made are never recieved .
negative	this is how they play .
negative	those are the numbers f my other non recieved orders :
negative	0000 / 0000
negative	0000 / 0000
negative	0000 / 0000
negative	0000 / 0000
negative	they were never sent or they just sent me the cheapest iten .
negative	please , dont spend your money with them , its like lotto , you are never sure you gonna recieve what you bought .
negative	the part was " made for my car " yet the cables were much too short !
negative	i will be returning this faulty product
negative	i will not order again from pureformulas . com
negative	i ordered 0 yellow knockout_rose plants , 0 gallons at $_00 . 00 each costing over $_000 and took a chance ordering online plants for the first time .
negative	order #_0000000 0 - 00 - 00 fedex_ground .
negative	i received this order on 0 - 00 and was extremely disappointed in the quality - yellow leaves , no flowers , small plants .
negative	its been 0 days and the plants are still yellow , still no flowers .
negative	i took a picture when i received these and sent to brighter_blooms .
negative	i have yet to receive a reply .
negative	so add back customer_service to the complaint .
negative	interestingly - i also placed an order from a competitor , park seed .
negative	i received the order yesterday .
negative	rainbow knockout_roses that are full of blooms , gorgeous , green_leaves .
negative	so guess which nursery i will prefer ?
negative	it '_s been over a week since i ordered this and it still_hasn_'_t come .
negative	ordered from this site because i had a google offer , but amazon is more reliable and the price is just as good .
negative	i only got half of the items that i ordered .
negative	the swimsuit i got was the wrong_size .
negative	the other part of my order never got to me , i was refunded for that amount , but of course not the shipping_costs .
negative	i only agreed to pay that much for shipping because i the amount i ordered made me think it was worth it , not for what i got though .
negative	it took me a long time to pick the stuff i wanted and make_sure they had the size i needed .
negative	my vacation is gonna be in 0_weeks so of course i wont return the one bikini i got so that they can never send it back to me anyway ...
negative	wish i ' d know about this before , bad customer_service communication as well .
negative	would help to have someone_who understood english .
negative	first order was sent with wrong items and we were promised the correct items by the next tuesday but nothing came .
negative	i called again that friday and was told that items could not come until my return ( picked_up by fedex ) was processed .
negative	very frustrating as the mistake was no way my fault !
negative	a very nice rep_named sarah said that she would try to correct the problem .
negative	i do have pool perfect now , but will probably go to another company for my next order .
negative	i paid to have flowers champagne and chocolates to deliverd to my honey in the uk for valentines_day recieved e_- mail feb 00 due to adverse_weather the flowers only would be delivered ????
negative	no chocolates or wine ???
negative	no flowers were delivered nothing was and it was valentines !!!!!
negative	callled my bank stopped pay they are investigateing i advise alll to re post this and never ever to use these crooks !!!!
negative	!
negative	lisa kempt ps please investigate my complaint i would love you 0 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

negative	this company doesn_'_t tell you ahead of time that it takes at_least 0 - 00 days to even put the product together before it ships .
negative	i paid_extra 0_weeks before christmas and it never arrived .
negative	now it '_s 0_weeks after christmas and still nothing ( not even a note from this company updating me of the status ).
negative	i '_m starting to think that they ' re a scam .
negative	i ordered 0 cards , i believe the first week , in december .
negative	i have not received anything yet , and it is almost
negative	christmas .
negative	the cards are visa .
negative	they are for 00 . 00 each .
negative	the merchanize was size wrong or something and i could have bought the same brand at walmart
negative	i placed my order april 00 , it said everything was in stock and should arrive within 0_weeks .
negative	i checked today , 0_weeks after my order was placed and the order is still processing .
negative	i called in and they said the order won_'_t ship for another week and a half .
negative	absolutely_ridiculous !
negative	the gentleman i spoke with said it is advertised that it takes 0 - 0_weeks , which i informed him was still less time than my order would be .
negative	he also informed me that i would run_into the same issue from any company i ordered from since they get it from the same place , which is a flat out lie considering every other website says they have it in stock and would ship within 0 - 0 days .
negative	i am very disappointed and will not be ordering from them again , in fact i think i am just going to cancel my order and go somewhere_else .
negative	it would be quicker that way .
negative	at_least they don_'_t charge you until the order leaves their ' factory '.
negative	heute wurde irgendwas gekauft über mein paypal , als_ich die email auf meinem handy erhalten habe , habe_ich_mich sofort bei paypal versucht einzuloggen und_habe den fall reklamiert , anstatt mein geld zurück zu holen oder sonstiges wird nun auf die antwort des verkäufers gewartet , abwohl die adresse die angegeben wurde nicht stimmt bzw verändert wurde .
negative	paypal behält das geld sowohl vom käufer als auch verkäufer ein und bereichert sich so an zinsen .
negative	um probleme zu klären benötigt paypal oft wochen , bis sich endlich was tut .
negative	wenn dieser fall beendet ist , werde ich mein konto bei paypal löschen , hier wird keinerlei sicherheit gewährt .
negative	mit kreditkarte oder bankeinzug kann_ich auch anders bezahlen , dafür brauche ich kein paypal mehr , zu mal die sicherheit bei paypal gleich 0 ist !

negative	i bought months_ago skyrim box and got it broken , cjs said on facebook i will get a refunde , i `_m still_waiting to get my refunde to purchase another game with that .
negative	as i posted it to facebook they canceld me on it , so i can ` t write anything on the wall .
negative	supporter ( cj poh ) told me that the nw sniper elite dlc will cost 0 , 00 gbp and i will see my refunde when i buy and pay the item , now the dlc cost 0 , 00 gbp and i still can ` t use or see any refunde !
negative	arcor gibt_es zwar nicht_mehr und ist nun vodafone , doch als_ich im jahr 0000 einen arcorvertrag abgeschlossen hatte , war_ich ansich relativ zu freden , abgesehen davon dass ich von dsl 0000 nur dsl 0000 empfangen habe und mein nachbar direkt neben mir dsl 0000 hatte , nach einigen jahren hatte_ich dann massive probleme , so dass ich alle 00 - 00 sekunden vom internet flog , dieser fehler wurde nie behoben also reichte ich meine kündigung ein , diese wurde aber nicht akzeptiert womit ich dann per anwalt die kündigung einreichen musste .
negative	0 jahre später hebt eine inkasso firma vo arcor 000_€ von meinem konto ab , die_ich bis heute nicht zurück bekommen habe .
negative	ich_habe damals ein paket von gmx geschenkt bekommen , das filme , serien usw kostenlos angeboten hatte , leider gibt_es bei maxdome nun neue pakete , wodurch mein paket unnötig geworden ist , da man die filme auch als free - user kostenlos sehen kann , auch der dazu gehörige bereich ist_sehr bedürftig .
negative	in meinem paket sind fast nur filme die erotik beinhalten oder serien , wo man nur 0 oder 0 episoden sehen kann und_das oft in schlechter qualität .
negative	serien die im tv bereits gelaufen sind , sind 0 tag kostenlos zum anschauen dabei , am nächsten tag wird diese wieder in die teuren pakete geschoben , weil angeblich keine lizens ist_für das jeweilige paket .
negative	nur ein tag darf es laufen und dann nicht_mehr , schon eigenartig !
negative	ich_würde maxdome nicht weiterempfählen , jedenfalls nicht als free user oder user mit einem film paket , der nicht auf erotik filme steht .
negative	purchased a full price bra , and after removing the tag and hand washing i noticed a hole in the bra .
negative	herroom refused to exchange for a non_- damaged bra .
negative	i was within the 00 days but they said because i had washed it i could not return it .
negative	no exceptions , just kept_repeating the same policy over and over .
negative	talked to a supervisor who was equally rude .
negative	why are you asking me to review your service when you haven_'_t sent me the transcripts .
negative	the person_who i sent the card to as a thank_you called the number on the back to activate it and it was a false number .
negative	they continued to tell them that she would not be able to use the card for 0 days !
negative	first of all , your center is misleading .
negative	i googled the hotel i wanted to stay at and pulled_up what i thought was their webside but as it turns_out it was yours with no_indication whatsoever that i wasn_'_t speaking to the hotel_directly and expedia '_s name was nowhere to be found .
negative	the person i spoke with was kooky and during the conversation telling_me : " oh , we just booked a king_room , it '_s gone , etc . "
negative	i asked for a handicapped_accessible room with two beds and he assured_me there was one available on the first floor with grab bars .
negative	when i got to the hotel there was no handicapped_accessible room with two beds available , so i had to go somehwere else and pay for another room .
negative	he did not advise me that it was nonrefundable .
negative	if he had told me he was a third_party i would have known to ask .
negative	i will never use expedia again and will tell_everyone about my bad and expensive experience .
negative	this is the worst booking_agency ever .
negative	they disconnected twice .
negative	then i booked a room an the confirmation came with the wrong type room .
negative	we called and spent 00_minutes talking to " john " who refused to help us !
negative	he promised a manager would call within 00_hours .
negative	no one called .
negative	john promised they ' d fix the issue .
negative	they didn_'_t .
negative	we got an_email_saying they can '_t change the price .
negative	we never had a problem with the price - they gave_us a king smoking_room and we asked for 0 queens non_smoking .
negative	furious !
negative	they refuse to fix their error and won_'_t cancel the room .
negative	this is a terrible service .
negative	terrible !!!
negative	i recommend that people run away from this company - they ' re absolutely horrible !
negative	!
negative	i bought a dress from lightinthebox . com before .
negative	the quality is not good .
negative	there are many china b0c websites , like milanoo . com , luxurywill . com , or pandawill . com .
negative	you can try others
negative	when i was asked to organize teacher holiday gifts this year , i just about had a heart_attack .
negative	there are 0 teachers covering 0 toddler classes with about 00 families .
negative	i really hoped that giftcards . com would save me a lot of time coordinating this year '_s gifts .
negative	most_importantly , i just wanted the teachers to feel appreciated and loved for the great work they do with our children .
negative	after setting_up all of the giftcard sites , i thought i could just sit back and let the donations sort themselves out according to the number of classes each teacher taught .
negative	not so fast , after the first day , one of the cards showed a maxed out amount of $ 0000 .
negative	the donations listed did not add up to that amount .
negative	calling the help line and writing to tech_support did nothing to solve my problem .
negative	they took so long to get back to me that i had to find another way around it .
negative	this glitch cost us 0 days and i had to set_up another card .
negative	plus , this teacher ended_up receiving two cards with different amounts ; making this gift not as polished as it could be .
negative	after this i thought ... ok ... that '_s annoying but not a deal breaker .
negative	wrong again .
negative	a second card showed a maxed out amount of $ 0000 .
negative	this time a name was attached to a peculiar amount .
negative	i contacted that parent , who did not make that donation .
negative	we both had trouble getting that changed .
negative	reason ?
negative	they need an invoice to look up our order , but an invoice is generated when one redeems the gift_card , and when a card is redeemed , they can '_t change anything in the account .
negative	what a glorious catch - 00 they have going .
negative	we can '_t help you unless you do this , and even then , we still can '_t do what you need us to do .
negative	this glitch caused this particular teacher '_s gift to be sent a day late .
negative	completely_unacceptable .
negative	it was not in time for the class to present the gift to their teacher .
negative	when it is time to do teacher gifts again in june , we will certainly not choose giftcards . com .
negative	perhaps their other services work more smoothly .
negative	this is simply my experience with their group gift feature .
negative	first order arrived_promptly .
negative	second not so great !!
negative	still_haven_'_t received it and i contacted them yesterday to ask if i can expect it anytime_soon and was told to leave it 00 working days ... today is day 00 , why they couldn_'_t look into it on day 00 is beyond me considering i would have expected it at most 0 working days_later .
negative	update
negative	i made my order on 00th of april , money left my account 00th_april ... no package arrived .
negative	contacted them and got told they ' d send another , waited 0 working days ... did not arrive !
negative	contacted them for a refund ... now 0 working days down and no refund has appeared i '_m being to think i won_'_t see my money again !
negative	please_note i asked for the refund on 00rd may after waiting for 0 orders to arrive from 00th_april and the date is now 0th_june and i have no perfume or refund !
negative	i '_m not holding my breath for my money back .
negative	seems very dodgy to me !
negative	dont ever use travelocity .
negative	our reservation was not at the hotel .
negative	we stood aroud for 0 hours while this problem was fixed
negative	i booked with flighthub thinking it was the cheapest flight ... guarantee ... but imagine my surprise when i went to the airline '_s website and the exact flight i just booked on flighthub was cheaper on the airline '_s website .
negative	i emailed flighthub immediately to bring up this issue and have not heard back yet .
negative	customer_service ??
negative	?
negative	started ok , filled in my reg number etc , chose the appropriate tyres listed for my car , went to get them fitted only to be told that they were the wrong_size .
negative	spoke to customer enquiries and was told that they would collect them and send out the correct size .
negative	they did drop_off the correct tyres later in the week then promptly took the new ones away again , leaving the original unsuitable tyres behind ..... i used this company in good faith that it would make my life a tad easier , it didn_'_t .
negative	it has taken an unacceptable length of time for these tyres to finally fitted .
negative	i will never use this company again and would advise strongly against other people doing so also .
negative	( cant leave ' 0 ' stars )
negative	i have had a really bad_experience with this company .
negative	i ordered 0 dermalogica_products on 00th may and only one arrived but the money for all three has_been taken .
negative	to make_matters worse , i have sent 0 e_- mails , submitted 0 of their contact forms online , phoned several_times never getting any response except an answermachine and left 0 voicemail messages .
negative	no - one from the company has got back to me either by e_- mal or phone .
negative	as a result , i couldn_'_t recommend this company to anyone .
negative	0000 volkswagen eurovan fuel tank cap - 00000 stant - $_00 . 00
negative	qty ordered : 0 , qty shipped : 0
negative	tracking_number : us mail : 0000000000000000000000 - mon 00 / 00 / 0000 0 : 00_pm
negative	00 / 00 / 0000 parts_geek llc 000 - 0000000 nj 00000 usa gas / automotive $_00 . 00
negative	the above information was copied right from the e_- mail sent to me when i placed an order for a locking gas_cap from parts_geek .
negative	i felt the price was very high when you added in the $ 0 . 00 shipping fee .
negative	the gas_cap itself was only $_00 . 00 .
negative	but i accepted that .
negative	now the problem is that the gas_cap does not fit my 0000 volkswagen eurovan .
negative	so when i send it back at a cost of $ 0 . 00 to ship it i will have spent a total of $_00 . 00 .
negative	then i read that there will be a 00_% restocking_fee .
negative	so if i get back 00_% of $_00 . 00 that will be a refund of $ 0 . 00 .
negative	total loss to me , not counting the cost of time and money to take it to the post_office , is $_00 . 00 .
negative	by not sending it back it will only cost me a dollar more .
negative	actually it will be cheaper not to send it back because as i said i will have to use gas to make the trip of 00_miles to the nearest shipping station .
negative	do you think this was planned .
negative	i really feel taken .
negative	i was not happy .
negative	i typed in exactly_what my car was .
negative	your company said it was a certain radiator and it was not the right one .
negative	it won_'_t fit any style jaguar .
negative	you should fix your computer because it was very costly mistake for me
negative	i will not be buying anymore parts if i have to pay for your mistake .
negative	i have liked everything i have gotten
negative	i received an extra order that i did not make and was charged for it .
negative	i don_'_t appreciate that kind of tactic and as a result , have closed my account .
negative	placed my order on dec 0 , 0000
negative	when it still had not been shipped by dec 00 i started calling i got the run_around about if it was shipped .
negative	they finally shipped it on dec 00 only after i said i would cancel order .
negative	now usps lost my order and because of oldies waiting so long to ship there '_s no time to reorder from another website !
negative	it was soooooo bad i now use expedia !
negative	!
negative	worst customer_service ever !
negative	the part did not fit and they are making me pay to return it even_though it was advertised to fit my car .
negative	they threatened to take a 00_% " restocking_fee " out of my refund .
negative	they will not respond to my concerns via_email and the phone_number never goes to a person only a machine .
negative	buyer_beware !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered 0 items and got told one of my items was out of stock .
negative	they told me that i would get a refund , which i have never received .
negative	postage was also very slow , i will not be using again as i paid for 0 items not 0 !!!
negative	!
negative	i bought these products to give to my dogs .
negative	i have bought nosodes before and they came with specific directions , how to mix , how often to give etc .
negative	i asked and their reply was to call the manufacturer .
negative	i think if you are in the business of selling nosodes , you should have more knowledge as to how to take and for how long .. where i ordered in the past , the owner shared their expertise with me .
negative	prices are good though .
negative	this company has terrible customer_service , don_'_t answer emails , and when you call , they talk down to you .
negative	we had a medical_emergency .
negative	when i tried to call about the hotel , you did not answer .
negative	when i called the hotel , the evil woman at the desk said i had to talk to you .
negative	when i finally talked to someone the next_day , you promised to call a manager and try to get me a refund , and to communicate with me .
negative	you did none of these .
negative	i will find another travel site the next time .
negative	i called and spoke to irene poltiile .
negative	i specifically_asked if she was with the hampton_inn deer park ill . she said yes hotel reservations .
negative	she gave_me prices which i confirmed were incorrect .
negative	i told her we were flying in for a wedding for my godchild and there was a block of rooms being held .
negative	she said they were all sold out and there were 0 rooms available only at the price she stated .
negative	i thought i had no choice so i took them she gave_me the phone # for the hotel in case there were changes and i was not coming in .
negative	did not like this whole situation .
negative	called hotel as soon as i hung_up and was told i did not talk to her hotel and there were tons of rooms available .
negative	called your company right back to cancel and told a man the situation he said he would cancel .
negative	decided to call back to check to see if it was cancelled and it wasn_'_t .
negative	then spoke to brandon and he did cancel and the hotel verified it was cancelled .
negative	i would never ever recommend doing_business with you and still do not see the reversed charges your company charged me .
negative	please take_care of this or i will report you to the better business .
negative	i ordered a new phone by phone with the promise of next_day delivery using £_00 crave vouchers and my own money to purchase phone . saturday came and went and no phone delivered .
negative	rang virgin on the monday for further updates ..... still no phone by_midday so after further phone_call was told it had been lost in transit .
negative	was told to wait for another 00hrs .... which i did .
negative	tuesday still no updates so rang to find that phone was still lost ..... so asked for refund .... however cos it was in yodels hands couldn_'_t give a refund .
negative	was advised to wait another 00_hrs .
negative	wednesday still no phone , still no update so had to chase them up again .
negative	asked for refund but was told i would loose my £_00 crave vouchers so have to wait another 0 days for a phone .
negative	i was told to go out and buy a temporary phone and they would reimburse_me with this purchase ..... however when i rang back to say i had bought a phone and requested the money they had no_idea what i was talking_about and refuse to help me .
negative	will never purchase a phone from virgin mobile again .
negative	i was promised a mobile_phone .... next_day delivery ..... 0 days_later and the phone has still not been delivered ...... it apparently went to wrong depo ..... they can not trace it transit and tell me when i will receive my phone ...... terrible terrible service
negative	what a nightmare .
negative	i paid good money for 0 / 0 dead plants .
negative	how can you stay in business ?
negative	i will never order from your company again !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	well it has_been 00 days and the money has_been taken out of my account for the items but i still_haven_'_t received a package so i haven_'_t even seen the clothes to judge them .
negative	i ordered a gift_card and received it in 0 - 0 days .
negative	it was guaranteed by google .
negative	after that i decided to order another one .
negative	don_'_t know anything about these sites and didn_'_t realize it can only be used on line .
negative	i decided one more chance with gift_cards .
negative	forget it never again .
negative	!
negative	everytime i put all my info in it kicked back and said they could not process my order so i put in another card 0 and it did the same thing .
negative	i tried 0x '_s and again the next_day and the next_day .
negative	i gave up and went to another site and purchased the card i needed .
negative	thanks for nothing gift_cards .
negative	i canceled my order .
negative	i was unable to obtain any clarity from anyone at petflow as to the status of my order .
negative	i ordered royal_canin veterinary brand which requires vet approval which has not been problem in the past .
negative	i placed my order last_week and since that time , petflow insisted no vet authorization was received .
negative	yesterday , my vet '_s office personally spoke to your company and faxed authorization more than three_times .
negative	yet , when i called your customer_service today , " clare " said no authorization was received .
negative	i also spoke to " gerry " who has to be the most arrogant individual with whom i have had the displeasure to speak .
negative	no one in your organizaiton knowns anything .
negative	when i called later today to cancel my order , all i heard was more arrogance .
negative	i had been ordering royal_canin veterniary diet food from your company for several_years .
negative	whatever happened to your efficiency over the years is unfortunate .
negative	i don_'_t want to deal with your customer_service people .
negative	they just don_'_t care and i need a food distributor that does .
negative	if you think your getting a bargain your wrong !
negative	i bid on a rental_car and won , really i lost but just hadn_'_t realized it yet !!
negative	when i picked_up the car at hertz , it smelled so bad of cigarettes i was coughing and my eyes were burning .
negative	it took over 0 hours of trying to get a hold of a person to trade in this car .
negative	then they had the gall to put me in a tiny car when i had upgraded to a larger one .
negative	i received multiple_emails saying it was being looked into but no resolution at all .
negative	this company is awful , no customer_service and nasty filthy smelly cars .
negative	pay more and be comfortable .
negative	i will never use them again !!
negative	!
negative	i purchased a futon_cover online with thefutonshop . com , and minutes later , emailed to cancel my order .
negative	after ignoring two emails requesting the order be canceled , i called thefutonshop .
negative	i was sent a confirmation_email_saying my refund would post in 00 - 00_hours .
negative	a month later , i was going through my credit_card bill and saw that no refund had been issued .
negative	i called again , and i was told that for " some_reason " the accounting department had not processed the refund .
negative	i was again assured that the refund would post in 00 - 00_hours .
negative	i am never buying from these people again .
negative	what a hassle .
negative	ordered a special_diet for my dog over two_weeks_ago .
negative	haven_'_t seen it yet .
negative	when i call all i get is bullshit excuses .
negative	refund ?
negative	" no your order shipped by fed - ex , when ?, " we don_'_t know " do you have a tracking_number ?, " we '_ll e_- mail it to you , e_- mail says tracking_number not available .
negative	what shoddy , shady site .
negative	i placed an order for obaby mini mouse retro buggy on the 00th - 00 - 00 rang them on 00 / 00 / 00 and was told it will be delivered monday00 , waited in allday , no buggy , rang tuesday only to be told they had none left in stock and i would have to be refunded , they oviously had them in stock when they took the money out of my account . will never order from them again and the staff arent very helpful as all they ever tell you is no body is available on customer_services .
negative	this was , in all honesty , the worst online shopping_experience i have had in living memory .
negative	having placed and paid for an order , i waited about a month and received neither a dispatch email nor a package in the post .
negative	i tried to log_into my online account and received nothing but errors .
negative	i called the company , and was given the automatic message multiple_times that lines were busy - before being automatically hung_up on .
negative	after several tries , the phone finally rang and i was second place in the queue .
negative	second .
negative	the second person !
negative	how in god '_s name can they not handle more than two callers on the caller waiting system ?
negative	are they using phones , computers and systems from the days of king nebuchadnezzar ?
negative	because i '_m pretty sure things were a lot more up to date in the time of jesus .
negative	eventually , i spoke to a representative who informed me that there had , unfortunately , been a slight_delay with my order .
negative	you think ?
negative	you bloody think ?
negative	i ordered a month_ago and you ' re telling_me there '_s been a delay with my order as if i could never have guessed .
negative	and how difficult could it have been to send a brief email , maybe after two or three_weeks delay , to let_me know of this ?
negative	the representative eventually informed me the product would be with me the next week .
negative	two_weeks_later , nothing .
negative	i called up again .
negative	after chatting with yet another useless employee of this godforsaken company , i was told that my order had been cancelled and refunded .
negative	cancelled and refunded ?
negative	and nobody thought it would be a good idea to inform me ?
negative	apparently , i should have been sent an_email .
negative	well , i wasn_'_t .
negative	it wasn_'_t in my junk folder either .
negative	repulsive .
negative	another two_weeks_later , and i haven_'_t received my refund .
negative	i call up and was informed that it had been processed and i should have received it .
negative	well i bloody well haven_'_t , you goat head !
negative	after several rants and a threatening email , i receive a letter to take to my bank manager to ask him to process a refund .
negative	not only did i get such stinking service , but i have to go out of my way to get my money back .
negative	how in the world can one company be so overwhelmingly rubbish at everything they do ?
negative	are they able to do anything right ?
negative	i will pray , every night , for the bankruptcy of this company .
negative	nothing so crap deserves to live .
negative	my advice to everyone in the world is - save_yourself the trouble and avoid this disastrous mistake of a sales company .
negative	absolutely disgusting service .
negative	hello friend
negative	i am very disappointed in my purchase .
negative	the ink_cartridges do not work in my printer .
negative	i want a refund
negative	i ordered 0 willow hybrids , spending over two hundred_dollars .
negative	my trees arrived dead and seemed like nothing more than a bundle of sticks .
negative	:( very disappointed
negative	i purchased a futon_cover online in early november_0000 .
negative	it was not the color described / pictured online - at all .
negative	and the material was cheap polyester which looked a much heavier weight thread online .
negative	i called and emailed customer_service to begin an exchange , per the process listed on their website .
negative	they offered to send me swatches to help me pick an item to exchange my purchase for - sounds great , very helpful ...
negative	it is the end of january_0000 and i have received nothing from them .
negative	i have called multiple_times and emailed to alert them to the issue , inquire_about the status of swatches , etc .
negative	now i know why they don_'_t do returns , only exchanges .
negative	if you don_'_t like the product , they send you through hoops until you give up and they get to keep your money .
negative	it should not be this hard to make an exchange or refund .
negative	there are too many online vendors out there that do this better .
negative	i '_m now out $_00 and have a hideous futon_cover that i will never use and probably can '_t even get_rid of on craigslist .
negative	never again .
negative	was a few_minutes late for mot appointment & was refused - told car couldn_'_t be looked at
negative	waste of time emailing about issues you will only get a generic email and no real answers to questions_asked also to return a product takes a lot of time and is impossible for me as was purchased as a gift so cannot do what is required as i don_'_t personally have a console or account to do this action
negative	out of pocket and a lot of time wasted trying to get relevant answers not worth the bother
negative	assuring delivery in 00_hours and then making me wait a week kinda sucked .
negative	i think your products are as low in quality as your prices .
negative	i will never use you again .
negative	i am still_waiting for the vitamins i ordered , never have i had such a bad_experience .
negative	i called they never answered the mail box is full .
negative	very unfortunate .
negative	you just lost a good customer .
negative	i was very disappointed on how every time i would try and purchase a flight , the price would change .
negative	yet when i returned to the site , the flight i wanted , was still advertised at the low rate .
negative	i spent numerous hours trying to purchase a flight no_matter the price .
negative	however , again i was redirected or simply told i could not purchase and to search for a different flight !!
negative	i will never use travelocity again .
negative	always delivered quickly and prices great .
negative	but received a batch of lenses where 0 lenses were damaged .
negative	was told it was a production / manufacturers fault .
negative	when enquired_about replacement lenses felt very insulted by cheeky email that they would put £ 0 in my bank or send me 0 lenses - not worth the bother i ' d say !!!
negative	went on to find there was another 0 damaged lenses in box !
negative	worst_experience we have had with car_rental very very slow at counter led to believe car would be at airport , wouldnt rent to my husband because he was 00 and the list_goes on , and to add_insult to injury we lost money on the deal because we chose to go elsewhere .
negative	just awfull
negative	ordered tennis dress for tennis holiday in greece .
negative	dress arrived_promptly .
negative	the dress was too small and no time to order larger_size .
negative	no returns_label or procedure enclosed with dress .
negative	contacted supplier and told to use online returns centre - tried but nowhere to fill in returns_form .
negative	tried from friend '_s computer and still no joy .
negative	contacted milletsports few_times and was told they would email me with returns_form attached .
negative	i informed them that i would be flying out to greece in the early hours of 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	still no returns_form emailed to me .
negative	arrived back a week_later and returns_form waiting in inbox .
negative	immediately filled in and realised there was no returns address to send parcel to .
negative	currently awaiting reply to yet another email_asking them where i return the dress !!
negative	apparently the postage is only refunded if the item is returned within 0 days - well maybe it '_s a ruse to ensure they don_'_t have to refund the postage .
negative	am i happy with my experience at milletsports ?
negative	no
negative	i have no_intention of ever shopping with them again - it '_s their loss as i do buy regularly online but there must be a working and reliable returns_policy in place .
negative	i used_serenata_flowers to send my niece an upgraded bouquet of flowers in totnes .
negative	but instead she received a bouquet of unopened lilies and flowers and it was terribly put_together , and it looked nothing like i had ordered .
negative	i asked them to replace the order as it was shameful to send flowers of that nature but they continued to tell me that we needed to count stems , take more pictures even_though we sent them pictures , they claim the picture was bad .
negative	unfortunely it was not the picture that was bad , it was the bouquet of flowers that was badly put_together .
negative	serenata in reading uk was very good as i have used them many_times before ., but i will never use serenata in totnes .
negative	they are a scam , they are terrible and provide terrible customer_service too .
negative	their non_- acceptance of issues is also terrible customer_service .
negative	unfortunately , i am a florist and we have higher expectations of our counterparts .
negative	this company '_s flowers and service is a disgrace to the floral industry .
negative	this florist in totnes needs to be monitored as it is a shame to have a shop do such shoddy work and provide such terrible service to the flower industry .
negative	its people like this that get folks thoroughly disgusted with the floral industry .
negative	having waited 0_weeks for sofas - i am disapointed that they had not been delivered earlier like i
negative	we were so excited to finally be able to spend thanksgiving with my son and his family .
negative	i was bringing the smoke turkey , so i ordered form figis 00 days in advance .
negative	their website accepted my order and i called several_times to make_sure they had my order and confirm it was coming before thanksgiving .
negative	the more calls i made the more disappointed i got .
negative	each time we called their cs department they told us a different story : ( 0 ) they have 0 orders under my name !!!
negative	really ?
negative	( 0 ) no order was found under my name or order number ???!!!
negative	( 0 ) go buy a turkey because it might not arrive on time , no problem we will refund your complete payment ( 0 ) it is arriving via_fedex this afternoon ( 0 ) it already arrived at the post_office ????
negative	( 0 ) we send the order fedex directly to the post_office and the po delivers to your home !!!
negative	really ???
negative	on thanksgiving day the post_office is not opened ??
negative	?
negative	in summary the turkey never arrived on thursday , we went out of town friday_morning and returned sunday_night … the turkey arrived and was dropped in our heated mailroom and was no_longer smelling good when we openned the box .
negative	figis returned half of my money and told me that was their policy !!!
negative	nice job figis !!!
negative	!
negative	i bought some flowers to my mother - in -_law in recife , brazil , to be delivery in a special day and had payed an extra fee to be the fastest as possible .
negative	my credid card was accepted .
negative	i have just received an_email right now ( 0 days after , the delivery day ), informing that it wasnt possible because it was a '' remote_area ''.
negative	first , is not a remote_area .
negative	it is in the middle of a big city , not in a farm .
negative	second , if you cannot do the job , dont do it , that is ok , but dont make me wait 0 days to say it .
negative	now i dont have time to buy it for any other place because nobody is gonna delivery in a saturday_morning .
negative	if you aren_'_t making 00 baskets for 0 out of state conferences , expecting your $_000 order to come within a month , don_'_t need to reach customer_service by ' live_chat ' or by phone within that month of waiting for your products to arrive , then myfavoritecity will not disappoint you .
negative	they do have unique items but the stress and anxiety they caused me for my biggest order of the year was not worth it and after requesting my order to be cancelled 0x , low and behold , i got my products delivered !
negative	they cost me more money than i earned since i had to pay extra shipping to rush my orders to my clients out of state to meet their deadline .
negative	i will never order from them again .
negative	shoes are excellent but i was not too pleased to have to send returns to sweden so i won_'_t shop online again .
negative	xwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

negative	on dec 0nd i rec ' d this email - your giftcards . com order has_been confirmed and is now processing ( invoice #_000000 ) from giftcards . com .
negative	( my payment was quickly processed .)
negative	in the email it stated that it usually only took a few hours to process and i would be notified when shipped .
negative	it is now dec_00th and i '_ve had no other contact other than a request to complete this rating ... sad b /_c i had great hopes when i learned about the site ...
negative	this was a horrible experience !
negative	over s week to receive my cat_food , then it was delivered to an empty house ( not mine ) and would have laid there if a neighbor had not seen it .
negative	i will never purchase from this company again nor recommend it !
negative	i order parts for my vehicle '_s fan motor .
negative	partsgeek charged me , then two_days_later , canceled my order without telling_me why .
negative	when i look for parts on the web , i now steer_clear of partsgeek . com .
negative	i used to love shopping here , fun shoes .
negative	everything is fine if the order goes right , but if anything goes_wrong with the order , you ' re in for some fun .
negative	you will never wait less then an_hour just to talk to someone .
negative	if you don_'_t like the shoes or they don_'_t fit , you have to call and wait an_hour just to get permission to send them back .
negative	they tell you your credit will be applied automatically , it '_s not .
negative	another hour on the phone .

negative	watch out .
negative	i clicked one star because the product arrived as fast as the excremental
negative	i did nit receive a confirmation or receipt that my stay was booked .
negative	i made other arrangements for lodging .
negative	i best not get charged
negative	i never received the order
negative	this company allowed me to buy a product that they didn_'_t even have in stock .
negative	i had to contact them 0 days after i ordered to ask " when " they planned on shipping it .
negative	then they told me they didn_'_t even have the product , and would ship it when they received it !
negative	they offered a poor solution for me ;
negative	- wait_until they got a shipment of the b complex i ordered .
negative	- or just go_ahead ahead and cancel the order !
negative	they obviously didn_'_t care .
negative	that '_s really poor customer_service .
negative	my roommate ordered from them and 0 days_later they hadn_'_t even shipped his product .

negative	don_'_t waste your time and money with this site .
negative	i just tried to book a room in thailand for one night ( oct 0 , 0000 ) - when the confirmation_email came , another date was on it ( tomorrow !!)
negative	i checked and re - checked before i gave credit_card information .
negative	when i tried to cancel ( immediately ) as in -- within one minute of receiving confirmatiuon - which was two minutes after booking ( literally ), the website said i would be charged the entire amount since i had a non_- refundable ticket .
negative	what a scam !!
negative	im furious and im taking this up with my credit_card company !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	picture i ordered arrived quickly not worth the money even at 00_percent_off really poor quality and workmanship so do not waste your money
negative	won_'_t do_business there because of the customer_service .
negative	i am still battling with customer_service to receive the correct refund from my returned order .
negative	definitely do not shop_here , as they don_'_t even know how to follow their own return_policy !
negative	one of their policies states that if you returned an order that ends_up falling below the $_000 free_shipping offer , then they will deduct 0 . 00 from your refund ( adding to the fact that you paid for the return shipping yourself ).
negative	which is all well and good , if the returned order is < 000 right ?
negative	but , my order is clearly above that amount , but after_contacting customer_service repeatedly , only to have different representatives repeat that same policy to me without_any explanation , they still refuse to give the full credit .
negative	and a warning to other shoppers who are undeterred by negative remarks : they also don_'_t offer refunds , they only offer yesstyle credit .
negative	so even if i hate the company , which i most certainly do and will make certain none of my friends shop there , i have to buy something from them to get my money back .
negative	their inflexible return_policy is only meant to protect themselves at the expense of the customer .
negative	update_: customer_service has gotten back to me stating that because i returned my entire order , my original order amount has_become $ 0 , which is below the $_000 requirement .
negative	this logic simply baffles me .
negative	if my original order has_become $ 0 for returning my purchase , then why did they even refund a portion of my order ?
negative	by their logic , i don_'_t have any credit with them , yet they refunded my order -$_00 , meaning i do have credit from the order .
negative	bogus company , bogus policies .
negative	didn_'_t even get past the registration stage ......
negative	added items to my basket - the 0 for 0 on swimwear - said all items were in stock - got to the payment stage and the final amount looked too much , was then informed that one of my items actually wasn_'_t in stock so i needed to find something_else - ok , did that - but then there was a notification saying that i wasn_'_t allowed a mixture of cash account and credit account - i thought i had opened a credit account becuase i wanted to use the £_00 voucher - phoned ther customer_services and was told that i needed to call back tomorrow to open a credit account or pay for items over the phone but i couldn_'_t use the voucher and she couldn_'_t amend my account - and you can '_t use the £_00 voucher if you pay for the goods in full .
negative	if i could give this company 0 out of 0 i probably would ..... won_'_t be completing my order with isme .
negative	received product faulty upon_opening .
negative	poorly manufactured quality .
negative	splintered joins , gaps in joins , looks like a year 0 woodwork project !
negative	awaiting a response from a hopeful and polite customer_services member
negative	i placed on order on dec . 00 , by the 00th i still hadn_'_t seen it so i emailed customer_service to find out why .
negative	they told me i had the wrong zip_code so i gave it to them again .
negative	they didn_'_t even both to contact tell me there was a problem they finally sent it out on the 00th and now won_'_t arrive until after christmas .
negative	i should have just ordered from my usual place at_least it would have been here on time .

negative	after using paypal to conduct a sales transaction my account was blocked due to a ' security risk ' even_though the party i sold the items to was perfectly happy with the transaction and received the items on time with no_issues whatsoever .
negative	when i tried to find out what the issue was i never received a satisfactory answer and to date -- 0 years later -- i am still blocked from using paypal .
negative	i know several people who are equally frustrated with paypal customer_service and i wouldn_'_t recommend them to anyone .
negative	please do not use expedia to conduct your transactions !
negative	save your money , your time , and your sanity by going through a different agency .

negative	i bought an airline_ticket , bought the travel_insurance , and was able to gain a credit from the airline when i cancelled .
negative	however , expedia , would not refund me the money and told me that their policy does not match the airline policy .
negative	0 .
negative	i spoke to several supervisors who all provided me with ficticious first names and would not offer their last names .
negative	they told me that i did not know how to read and next time to read more closely ( quite insulting ).
negative	0 .
negative	the representatives at expedia are trained to follow a script and if you have a question they cannot answer , they will tell you to call back at a later time ( this is after being on hold for 00_minutes ).
negative	never received goods , told after 0_weeks of waiting to go to my local postal depot as my £_00 . 00 parcel could be there .
negative	( it was not there ) after many emails to the company some which were not even answered i am now going to take my complant further .
negative	it has_been over 0_weeks , no refund no parcel no apology no reply to my last 0 emails !
negative	!
negative	i moved out of the unit on the 0th day of the month and i basically paid for 00 days for an empty unit .
negative	when i called the store the lady told me they only give refunds if you move out before the 0th day .
negative	which is stupid !
negative	i shouldn_'_t have to pay for something i '_m not going to use !!!!
negative	i will never use public store again !
negative	ordered phone and paid on 0 / 00 / 00 ... still_waiting to receive .
negative	i have emailed and can '_t get an actual shipping date from them .
negative	i received some tracking_number that doesn_'_t work and when i emailed them about it they told me it '_s a signature confirmation shipment and the tracking_number won_'_t show anything until order is received .
negative	i have now called them and left message .
negative	at this point , i would rather have my money back and i will buy elsewhere .
negative	i have bought things from overseas before with faster shipping and better communication than this .
negative	i ordered 0 pair of open toe pumps .
negative	both size 0 .
negative	one pair i could fit_perfectly , but when i say hurt my feet .
negative	i swear the blood stop flowing .
negative	my feet are still in pain and it '_s been 0 days since i wore them .
negative	and oh my god ...
negative	they were not stable at all .
negative	when i was walking i twisted my ankle and the worse then that i was going down some stairs and almost fell down the stair from the heels not being stable .
negative	so i thought it was me .
negative	i just tried them back on , and the pain shot up my right leg and i was not able to stand on my leg with my foot on the ground and once again , the heel was not stable .
negative	i almost twisted my ankle again just standing there .
negative	now the 0nd pair i purchase , the size 0 was like a size 0 .
negative	i was not able to put them on my feet at all .
negative	i called customer_service and request for rma .
negative	advised me i was not able to return due to 00_%_off coupon_code i used and the shoes were on sale .
negative	i asked if i could at_least exchange for a 0 . 0 since it was still available .
negative	the rep told me , no .
negative	i was not even able to exchange .
negative	i pretty_much was stuck with a shoe i could not fit .
negative	no customer_service skills what '_s so ever .
negative	didn_'_t even_bother to see if i wanted to place another order .
negative	she could have cared less if i had a special event i order the pumps for .
negative	so guess what , they shoes are still wrapped in the package i purchased them in and in the same box delivered and sitting in my garage .
negative	what a waste of money !!!
negative	yea the shoes may have been $_00 . 00 with 00_%_off , but it '_s my money and i don_'_t like not being_able to enjoy what i spend $ 0 . 00 on .
negative	so i will never shop at amiclubwear . com anymore .
negative	nor will i advise anyone_else .
negative	customer_service stinks , very , very poor !!
negative	f f f f for failure , failed , unfriendly , and unfair !
negative	i am really disappointed .
negative	i was referred to them by a mutual friend .
negative	but what can i say .
negative	i '_m stuck with shoes i paid $_00 and doing nothing with them !
negative	what i don_'_t like , someone_else will !
negative	that '_s how they still in business .
negative	but the not exchanging part i don_'_t understand !
negative	i ordered a golf ball display rack in december_0000 .
negative	i ordered , paid and waited for the parcel to arrive .
negative	once it has arrived it was damaged .
negative	i took pictures of the damaged parcel and sent it to the lady at the office named [_name ].
negative	she asked if the parcel / box was damaged on the outside .
negative	i told her it wasn_'_t , and that i wouldn_'_t recommend great golf_memories , and also wouldn_'_t buy from them again .
negative	i understand that the company cannot take_responsibility once it has left the states , but i went to personally pick_up the parcel at the post_office and it wasn_'_t damaged .
negative	it clearly comes down to quality control in the warehouse / stock room .
negative	it doesn_'_t matter now , i don_'_t want anything as i had to get someone here in sa to fix the shelves and repair the glass as well as the " wood " which was damaged .
negative	my husband finally got his present , and this was an expensive lesson_learnt as it was the first time i ever ordered anything from overseas .

negative	we reserved a king_room and when we got to hotel they had our reservation as 0 queens .
negative	i asked more than once on the phone to make_sure it was a king_bed in our room !
negative	sounded_like the agent on the line was in a different country and line was very hard to hear .
negative	terribly long phone_call and i would never recommend this reservation line to anyone !
negative	it was our anniversary and very special weekend for us !!!!
negative	!
negative	now , i get hung_up on ( twice0 when i call to talk to someone and they say they can '_t help me !
negative	bull ** it !!!!!
negative	i keep calling and no one answer the 000 numbers now !
negative	lovely !
negative	we had to stay at hotel as it was 0 pm and we were out of options at that point .
negative	i had booked a room that slept 0 people .
negative	at the time of booking it was just 0_adults and 0 child but it then changed to 0_adults and 0 child .
negative	i called customer_service as a courtesy to add the 0rd adult .
negative	this would in no way change the type of room i had originally_booked which slept 0 people .
negative	the customer_service rep wanted to charge me more stating that when i booked the room i paid a lesser price then what the room currently went for .
negative	why am i being charged like its a new reservation i '_m simply adding a 0rd person to a room that sleeps 0 ?
negative	if we had been adding more people then the room slept then obviously i ' d expect an up charge at the current rate to completely change the room .
negative	not to mention that i had checked the rates just prior to calling and they were actually less_than what i had originally paid .
negative	the rep continued to argue with me about the price so i had her cancel the reservation in which i have to wait for a refund .
negative	i had to re - book my reservation myself in which i ultimately paid less_than when i originally_booked but remember the rep was trying to charge me more .
negative	this is all around terrible customer_service that instead of just assisting_me and adding a name to the book she caused more of a headache .
negative	i will never use bookit . com again and i will see that others know they will try to screw you over .
negative	don_'_t bother calling customer_service instead do their job for them .
negative	sent the wrong damn part , it was 0 days late and the best part ... it was sent in a 0ft box !!!!!
negative	!
negative	worst_experience ever !!
negative	hotel did not have our reservation .
negative	after an_hour in the phone , travelocity finally faxes the reservation , the hotel cannot accomodate us for the full vacation !
negative	we had to stay at the hotel for 0 nights and find another hotel for the remainder of our stay !
negative	after 0 hours and 00 phone_calls we are still_waiting for someone to call back from travelocity to refund us for the nights we the hotel doesn_'_t have space for us .
negative	luckily we had cash or we would be stranded after thinking we paid already !
negative	!
negative	i would not recommend this company to anyone .
negative	they lied to me .
negative	they told me that i could pay for my motel when i arrived at the motel .
negative	well they went_ahead with out my permission and charged my card .
negative	now i have bounce fee '_s and they will not work with me on this .
negative	they said what is done is done .
negative	please do not make reservations with this company .
negative	i am reporting this company to the bbb .
negative	i called the 000 # and spoke to diego .
negative	i explained to him that my family of 0 was traveling to st louis .
negative	we had a hard time finding a room w_/ 0 beds to accommodate the 0 of us .
negative	he found us an airport holiday_inn .
negative	perfect !!
negative	except when we arrive , he only noted 0 guests so we were not given the breakfast coupons for all 0 .
negative	nor did we get the rollout bed we were promised ( unless we wanted to pay extra ).
negative	the hotel basically said we ' d have to call " expedia " to work it out .
negative	problem with that is i had not called expedia .
negative	i called the 000 # at the top of the website .
negative	in the booking process diego was kind of pushy .
negative	telling_me i better book this room now or we ' d miss out .
negative	i was googling reviews to make_sure it was a nicer hotel .
negative	i wouldn_'_t use this service ever again .
negative	but it will be tough to discern since apparently i had no_idea i was being routed to a 0rd_party reservation service from a hotels actual website .
negative	as previous .
negative	i decided to use parts_geek after a coworker recommended it .
negative	i was impressed by the quick delivery but that all went out the window when i saw the part .
negative	it didnt match the brand_name i ordered , i got sent a ' chassis rite ' part after ordering a ' mevotech ' brand part .
negative	it looked like it had been broken in half at one point and not very skillfully welded back on , it was crooked and looked used .
negative	i tried to see about exchanging it for another and i got told i am responsible for 00_% restocking_fee , the shipping to send it back and that i would have to do a complete return and buy it again .
negative	was also clued into the fact it can take up to 00 days to get a refund of my $.
negative	i think that is rediculous considering it wasnt an_issue on my end they sent me a faulty part that never should have been on their shelf , online it said the condition was new and this was deffinately rebuilt .
negative	no wonder_why this site sells parts so cheap !
negative	i ordered a jackmanii clematis that arrived with a broken stem so i had only just the bottom part of the clematis which i planted but it does not look good .
negative	i paid $_00 . oo + for this and even if it survives i do not think i should have to pay this much for a plant now that i could buy at a store for less_than $_00 . 00 .
negative	they wanted me to send them a picture which i do not
negative	have the capable of doing so they said sorry we can not do anything .
negative	i will not be ordering from these people again .
negative	i only wish i had read these reviews before purchasing from this company , as i can relate to all of the negative_reviews .
negative	i have never , in my entire life , dealt_with a more unprofessional company nor one with worse customer_service !
negative	they clearly just want to take customer '_s money and don_'_t care about repeat business .
negative	whatever you do , do not buy from amiclubwear !!
negative	!
negative	i received the order and the bag of dog_food that is versus for weight_management for my one dog was not included .
negative	i need someone to resolve this or i will take it to court .
negative	it is really horrible that i have to waste my time dealing_with this .
negative	please get back to me as soon as possible .
negative	marianne pavlovitz
negative	not much more to say than i ordered these for a special_occasion for my sister and it '_s been two_days and no sign of any flowers .
negative	i had a very bad_experience with golfstore europe .
negative	in my opinion they take orders online for stock they don_'_t have and then ask you days_later to pick something_else .
negative	they are very slow responding to emails and very slow for delivering .
negative	i ordered 0 items on 00th may , neither were in stock .
negative	i picked one in another colour and requested a refund for the other .
negative	in the end i went through paypal for my refund .
negative	it was 0_weeks_later that i received the item .
negative	this is the 0nd time this happened to me .
negative	will never shop with them again
negative	be very very careful booking from this website .
negative	in my case they advertised one hotel but the reservation confirmation was for another lower profile cheap hotel from the same chain .
negative	firstly the customer_service guy tried to persuade me the hotel listed in the confirmation is the same one i wanted , then after realising they made a mistake on the website blamed me for misreading the advert and refused to refund in full .
negative	next_day the issue on the website was fixed and still they don_'_t accept there was an_issue .
negative	can clearly see it on google chached pages though ...
negative	the cancellation_policy said i could cancel by 00 feb when the booking was made on 00th leaving me negative amount of days to cancel ...
negative	rubbish !
negative	still can '_t get my money back !
negative	i '_ve purchased " steamer buddy " from wowcher but wasn_'_t satisfied with the product , so decided to return it .
negative	i contacted wowcher customer_service and they came back to me saying they were going to contact the seller .
negative	weeks past but nothing happened , no responce from neither wowcher nor the seller .
negative	i tried to contact them couple more times but all my emails were ignored .
negative	another example of poor service was recently when i couldn_'_t book the appointment with the service provider and hence wanted to transfer the money to voucher credit .
negative	no luck contacting wowcher customer_services team .
negative	bought three tickets for the who at the o0 , each costing £_000 . 00 each .
negative	was totally pissed off when the tickets arrived showing face value of £_00 . 00 each .
negative	disgusting to be ripped_off like this , this was more than double the price of the tickets .
negative	due to weather circumstances ( the winter_storm that came through ), i was not able to make my trip .
negative	the hotel manager called to confirm it was ok to cancel and travelocity said there was some discrepancy .
negative	after saying they would look into it and give me feedback within 0 business days , i never_heard from them again .
negative	every attempt to call has led to constant transfers that usually leads nowhere .
negative	terrible customer_service .
negative	i will never book through_travelocity again .
negative	upon return from my flight ( delayed_due to weather ) i was a few hours late .
negative	i called to let them know to make_sure i wouldn_'_t have to pay for an extra day or overages .
negative	being a frequent traveler , this has happened several_times and previously they have been great .
negative	they said as long as i returned on the same return day on my contract , i was fine .
negative	well upon_arrival , they charged me a full extra day taxes and all .
negative	i was really upset and they refused to let_me off property until i paid it .
negative	i have called several_times to speak to a manager and no one has ever called me back .
negative	i will never park here again .
negative	fyi they did this as well to the 0 other people behind me .
negative	lying thieves .
negative	unacceptable , such a scam .
negative	take me by my word , never ever trust this site !!
negative	they lie and swindle you out of your money .
negative	they take the amount off your card , and when you arrive to the hotel you supposedly booked , there is no reservation to be found .
negative	considering they don_'_t have a working phone_number for you to call , you are pretty_much out of luck at that point .
negative	you can email them , but they never get back to you .
negative	so , they have your money and your are left to scrape up extra_cash you may not have ( which was the case with my experience ) to attempt to find a reasonable hotel that isn_'_t absolutely disgusting , and are left to eat $ 0 pizzas for the weekend .
negative	thank_you olotels for ruining my vacation !
negative	i thought i was on the web_site for ramada_inn and these people tricked me into thinking i was .
negative	i would never have made the reservation through them if i had known they were a third_party .
negative	reservations made this way are impossible to change or upgrade so i ' d have left the site had they not been deceitful .
negative	these sites are horrible , horrible choices and i '_ll never make the mistake again .
negative	i figured_out what i did wrong .
negative	i found a really nice shirt on the superdry website for my boyfriends_birthday .
negative	he was really pleased with the shirt , but when he tried it on he found the xxl a little tight .
negative	as he loved the style we decided to take a trip to brighton to exchange it for a larger_size .
negative	once in the shop we were unable to find the xxxl size so we enquired whether we would be able to order this size from the website again instead .
negative	the shop assistant seemed helpful and looked to accertain whether the website supplied this size only to relay to us that superdry did not sell xxxl .
negative	after much dissapointment he managed to find another item to exchange for the shirt for .
negative	once home i decided to check the website only to find that the informaiton the shop assistant gave_us was incorrect which left me feeling lied to and cheated .
negative	this has made me question my loyalty to the brand and i am unsure_whether i will purchase from superdry .
negative	this is a real_shame as i have such a loyal_customer in the past .
negative	ik_heb voor_een veteraan , die met zijn verjaardag in het ziekenhuis lag , namens een veteranen stichting het bouquet " spetterend oranje " gekocht .
negative	ik begrijp heus dat_de_bloemen niet precies zoals afgebeeld staan , maar had toch wel iets van oranje in het bouquet verwacht .
negative	in plaats daarvan werd er een roze bouquet met wat rode ballen gestuurd .
negative	heb daarna de bloemist geschreven , en gezegt dat_ik het bouquet vrouwelijk vond en heel ongepast voor_een veteraan .
negative	heb echter verder alleen radio stilte ontvangen , en absoluut geen antwoord gehad .
negative	wij hebben 0000 leden en zal ook uw bedrijf op_de veteranen site vernoemen om_te vermijden
negative	do not think i would use them again unless i was desprate .
negative	not personal enough for me .
negative	i would give them a negative rating .
negative	i was not happy that my interest_rate for borrowing $_000 went from paying $_000 . 00 per_month for three_months the first time ; to paying $_000 . 00 for the same loan amount .
negative	i '_m working hard to pay this off early as the fees this time amount to usury .
negative	i will never borrow from you again , because the interest changed from the first time i borrowed to a greater amount , only three_months later .
negative	this is a bit like loan sharking .
negative	i bought a set of 0 armani pants from this company and when i received them the packaging was badly_damaged .
negative	the item was meant to be a gift so i checked to see if the description mentioned anything about damaged box - nothing .
negative	so i contacted the company by e_- mail and waited .
negative	0_weeks_later still no response i contacted them again and called and still nothing .
negative	i have now contacted them 0 times and not one reply back !
negative	the item is still unused and in it '_s box with tags and i am so annoyed .
negative	the number they give is obviously just a ploy to make you think they are a legit company but they never ever pick_up - just a guy saying " we are busy this time of year ".
negative	i suspect the item is a fake and now will have to take this further .
negative	please keep your money and shop somewhere reputable - i will from now on as it '_s not worth the risk .
negative	update_: thank_you for replying to my complaint .
negative	i find it strange that you had the time to reply to this and not to the several messages through your site and email on invoice over the past 0 months !
negative	as mentioned on your website i need a ' code ' of some_sort before i can send it back to you .
negative	there was no returns info sent with item .
negative	i have also read some other customer complaints and one mentioned they returned their item and had not received refund hence_why i am reluctant just send item as i spent £_00 !
negative	plus , will i receive the money to send them back as none of this is actually my fault ?
negative	as mentioned on your website if the item is damaged then you will refund in full .
negative	yes , the underwear is not damaged ( i haven_'_t actually checked ) but it '_s a gift and the box has a massive hole in it !!!
negative	!
negative	i am happy to send them back if i get a full_refund ( including the money to send back which will be recorded as i have no faith in your customer_service .)
negative	if all does go well then i will consider changing my rating and review .
negative	but for now i feel it is important for other customers to be aware of your customer care - which is appalling .
negative	plus , i think you will find tags can be faked .
negative	i said i suspected the item to be because once you buy an item from iwantpants . com it is virtually_impossible to get in touch for returns or complaints .
negative	i will be sending the item back once i get confirmation of refund .
negative	thank_you .
negative	messed_up my reservation .. nothing was about it .
negative	after_speaking to someone for over a half an_hour , i was promised a better deal but did not get one !!!!
negative	! i will never book through ya '_ll again !!!
negative	!
negative	i booked a hotel on priceline that was a 0 . 0 * hotel .
negative	after they accepted my bid and charged my credit_card , i found out this hotel was not a 0 . 0 * hotel .
negative	the hotel has bed_bugs , barking dogs in the rooms , broken tv , stopped up toilets and the swimming_pool is under_construction .
negative	they charge a 00 . 00 per day resort_fee in addition to the room rate .
negative	i contacted customer sevice to see it they would change hotel and they told me there was nothing they could do .
negative	unbelievable !!!
negative	i will never use priceline again ..,
negative	i will never be having anything sent with fedex again there costumer_service is beyond rude and not helpful plus you will never get your package on time .
negative	my estimated shipping date kept changing they received my package on the 00nd of may but i didn_'_t get it untl june 0rd i '_ve seriously had shipping faster from japan !
negative	the only place i will even trust with my stuff again is ups i '_ve never once had a problem with them and they actually keep you updated on your mail !
negative	i really had a hardtime making my purchase as a first time customer which i end up cancelling my orders .
negative	im hoping you could provide a better and easier way of purchasing your products like what other online stores do .
negative	i tried to order a gift_card for my dad and was a first time shopper .
negative	they declined my purchase because i was a first time buyer from the site and also because i didn_'_t want to sign_up an account .
negative	it took over 00_hours to find out my dad wasn_'_t getting his gift_card i picked out for his_birthday .
negative	what a disappointment clear reason to never attempt to shop with ever again .
negative	when i went to check in there was no record of the reservation .
negative	i had the confirmation number , i had the email but the manger couldn_'_t find my reservation .
negative	he called somewhere starwood office , there was nothing .
negative	the manager informed me i was using a third_party and there was no reservation , that the hotel was full , the i would be paying a higher_rate then what i receive online .
negative	will not be using this hotel again
negative	.
negative	i own a dell desktop and i love it , however , i bought it from walmart ...
negative	they helped_me tremendously when i ran_into problems with it .
negative	soooo , i decided to purchase a laptop directly from dell for my neice .
negative	i ordered over the phone & found that everything & i do mean everything is sold separately !!!
negative	for that reason alone , i will never order fom them again .
negative	i didn_'_t feel we got the best quality having to do it that way .
negative	next time , i will go back to a local_store .
negative	i purchased an e_- book for my class and it downloaded and they charged me , however , it refused to open ... needless to say , i won_'_t do that again ...
negative	i had to go back to amazon to order to i could get my work done .
negative	after countless phone_calls and ignored emails , i finally received my order today !!!
negative	exactly 00 days after i ordered it !
negative	i '_m just happy i got it & didn_'_t get got ... lol
negative	i did not recieve my last full order .
negative	i called and spoke to someone , he said part of it was on backorder ... ok , thanks for letting_me know eventually about that and that he would send the rest out .
negative	still_haven_'_t recieved it .
negative	i know you '_ve had some troubles with hurricane_sandy etc but still ... don_'_t charge my credit_card if you don_'_t have the stuff to send !
negative	or at_least let a person know you are out and will need to reorder .
negative	i will nto be ordering from your company again .
negative	i am a customer for years and have had no trouble until now .
negative	trip id 000000000000 should have been under my blueyedoe @_gmail . com account .
negative	somehow , you created a whole other account for me calling it blueyedoe @_gmail . com0 .
negative	i asked for the accounts to be merged and you said no .
negative	cancelling my trip with you .
negative	orderd furnature and paid for bed , headboard , frame , dresser , mirror , shitake couch and ottoman i waited a month for some one to call me to send my things i called them and they told me another 0weeks !
negative	i finally received everything but the ottoman they said another week to come in now
negative	after four weeks i call them and was told there manager was going out of town and wouldn_'_t approve of any ordering and it would be another 0_weeks i paid in full at the time i orderd how dare they steal my money !
negative	a man told me that i would recieve a 00 . 00 credit and free delivery but they still have my ottoman i told the man i '_m giving him til the 00th and i want all my money back i '_m very shocked at the unprofessionalism
negative	my wheel was suppose to be here on wednesday .
negative	on monday the tracking showed it in commerce city colorado , and i am located in fruita colorado .
negative	by wednesday my package was shipped to tenessee and is now located in kansas .
negative	by the time it shows i am suppose to recieve my wheel it will have been 0_weeks since the wheel shipped out .
negative	i am running on a spare .
negative	i am disappointed on the outcome of this order .
negative	i hope sincerly that i do not recieve the product damaged .
negative	never thought it would be this big of an_issue to be delievered .
negative	i hope monday it actually arrives .
negative	hi .
negative	i had paid the additional fee for flowers to be delivered before one pm .
negative	i was very disappointed they were delivered too late at four pm a nd won_'_t be us ingthe vcompany again
negative	i ordered business cards on00 / 00 / 00 from the wolverhampton branch and am still_waiting .
negative	i left an answerphone message asking for a call relating to the order which was never returned .
negative	when i finally spoke to rob i was promised a callback within 00_mins which did not happen .
negative	i sent an_email_asking if someone would have the courtesy to contact me to discuss when i could expect my order .
negative	it has not been returned ; they simply ignore requests to communicate and i still do not have my order .
negative	not a company i will be using again .
negative	i ordered a toilet_seat which was very expensive for my children as my 0 year_old_son kept falling in as he is just 0 . this one was supposed to be bigger and have a wider seat as it is a " throne " seat .
negative	i received it and a couple of weeks_later opened it once we had some time over christmas to fit it .
negative	as soon as i took it out of the box it was clear it would never fit a normal toilet so i replaced it , resealed it in a box within a box marked fragile and paid for it to be retuned special delivery as requested by fountain .
negative	at the time i returned it , fountain said they would have to knock off £_00 as we had not returned it within 00 days and i reluctantly accepted that .
negative	however having paid £_000 for the seat and £_00 for the postage , i was told by fountain that it had arrived damaged so they would not receive it back and about 0_weeks_later it was returned to me .
negative	i have no_idea how they believe that this could have occurred when the toilet_seat was not even fully removed when i originally received it as i saw immediately that it was the wrong back sitting ( which was never clear or stated on the website that it needed a special victorian style toilet ) and i do not believe it was damaged at my end at all , they simply did not want to refund it .
negative	iit was returned fully packaged , in the box , in another box and marked fragile .
negative	i will not be back to this company .
negative	rubbish customer_service ... non_existent ... product arrived smashed and they refuse to honour the sale of goods act saying their terms and conditions take priority .
negative	this is not only illegal but has_been defined as a criminal act by my solicitor .
negative	we are taking them to a small claims court now .
negative	they won_'_t respond to emails , letters .... don_'_t use them .
negative	purchased an order from topshop last_week .
negative	was told delivery would have arrived no later than wednesday 00th_april .
negative	recieved an sms from hermes on monday 00nd to say my parcel was with my local courier and would be with me within 0 days .
negative	on tuesday 00rd status was updated as ' not delivered '.
negative	tried to contact hermes to see what exactly that meant .
negative	firstly , their webchat function wasn_'_t working and on closer inspection of webchat times they are as follows ; monday - saturday closed sunday 00 : 00 am - 00 :_00am ??
negative	much use that is !
negative	also their email option guarantees a 00 hour response .
negative	0 days_later and i have still heard_nothing .
negative	my delivery status has still not changed from the ' not delivered ' status .
negative	unreliable , unprofessional service !
negative	one part they sent was for the wrong car .
negative	i tried to contact them to send it back for the right part but i had no luck at all contacting them by phone , fax or even e_- mail .
negative	the customer_service number was automated , hung_up on me twice after being on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	i called back again and waited for more than a hour and still nothing .
negative	i even attemped fax and e_- mail with still no luck after 0 days --- i just gave up and took my business elsewhere .
negative	i found sixt via one of those priceline type sites and went directly to the site to rent a car for a trip to the uk .
negative	when i arrived to stansted_airport ( 00_minutes early ) they weren_'_t ready with a vehicle , so i had to wait for an_hour .
negative	it was an annoyance , but that was ok .
negative	when they were ready , i picked_up the car .
negative	they asked me if i wanted an upgrade .
negative	i '_ve been offered free upgrades before ( because of available vehicle stock ) but they never told me the cost of the upgrade .
negative	then they literally just handed me the keys and sent me on my way .
negative	the personnel at the rental office didn_'_t inspect the vehicle with me or give me any introduction to the car ( it would have been nice for them to at_least offer me a quick tutorial on how to use the gps , since i ' d never been in the car before and i '_m from the usa and driving in a different country .
negative	i spent 00_minutes just figuring that out ).
negative	the car itself was flawless .
negative	i returned the vehicle at the end of the trip and they charged my credit_card for the rental .
negative	sounds great , right ?
negative	great car , great price , middle of the road customer_service ?
negative	i can live with that , right ?
negative	still all considering , i ' d have used them again .
negative	but four days_later i get a bill for " tire damage " for $_000 via an_email .
negative	i '_m now in a foreign_country , have no way to dispute the claim .
negative	i have no knowledge of any tire damage or any event that could have caused this damage , but i did not inspect the tires before or after renting the car , and no one inspected the car with me prior to leaving , or returning to stansted_airport .
negative	that all considered , i decided to just pay the damage claim , write their customer_service and email about my experience and move on .
negative	it '_s not worth my time or money to dispute it .
negative	so i responded with payment via the form they asked for and waited for them to withdrawal the money .
negative	they never withdrew the money from my account , but continue to send me reminder_emails asking for payment .
negative	the last one threatening legal_action , so i called the uk offices .
negative	no voicemail , and no one answering the phones .
negative	so i called the american sixt offices .
negative	they were very helpful , giving me the direct email address to the person sending me the damage request emails .
negative	after sending her an_email , they finally they withdrew the funds from my account .
negative	the rental ended 0 - 00 and this fiasco ended on 0 - 00 .
negative	i regularly travel to the uk , and i '_ll never use them again .
negative	i ' d be willing to try us sixt , because they were so helpful in resolving this issue , but not in the uk .
negative	horrible customer_service , horrible experience all around
negative	i ordered a pair of red shoes in september .
negative	when they arrived , they were pink .
negative	so they said they would correct the issue .
negative	once again , they sent me pink .
negative	so they said they ' d send the correct ones .
negative	now i '_m being told that the red ones are out of stock .
negative	and yet , when you go on their website , i can order those shoes still !!
negative	!
negative	in the mean time , my wedding is in 0_weeks & my dress has_been altered for these shoes that they are lying to me & telling_me i can '_t have .
negative	i will never order from them again !!
negative	!
negative	i read a bunch of horrible reviews on this company , but for the price of the part i wanted i decided to take a gamble .
negative	i only wanted one small part , how can someone mess that up ?
negative	well they did .
negative	sent me a part to a completely different car .
negative	i am not even going to try and get refunded because of the horror_stories i read about people dealing_with their customer_service .
negative	i will just get more angry .
negative	don_'_t bother with this company ... garbage .
negative	on the 00th of december i ordered an item for christmas for my dad , i recieved an_email_saying they have recieved my order but it was waiting rewiew from paypal , on the 00th_december the status hadn_'_t changed so i sent them a request using the form under contact us , i have yet to recieve a reply , i checked my paypal_account on the 00th_december only to learn that the money was taken out on the 00th , i promptly added this information to my other request , as you can already guess i still_haven_'_t had a reply , i would call them but nowhere on the site is there a phone_number , there are now only 0 postal days to christmas so it looks like my dad isn_'_t going to the christmas_present i wanted for him , as you can imagine i am very very angry
negative	my good friend ( also a mechanic ) and i ordered a few parts and paid_extra to have them sent overnight to my house .
negative	we did so on thursday but did not see the fine_print that there were no deliveries on saturday .
negative	the " overnighted " parts arrived monday_afternoon and i had to extend my rental_car agreement a few_days , costing me another $_000 .
negative	when i called the only number that i could find for them ( on a blog bc there is nothing available online in terms of a phone_number ), i was told that " there was nothing he could do " because he was in sales .
negative	when i persisted , he assured_me i would get a call on monday to reimburse_me for the $ spent for the expedited_shipping .
negative	no call .
negative	never using them again .
negative	i guess i have to go log in to my credit_card account to view dollar values .
negative	very strange .
negative	hotel couldn_'_t give me any detail either .
negative	adds another stage to my process , is inconvenient , i won_'_t use bookit again .
negative	fatalna obsługa !
negative	zamówiłam sukienkę i okazało się , że jest podarta .
negative	stwierdziłam , że w takiej sytuacji już jej nic chce , wiec ją odesłałam .
negative	do tej pory nie dostałam zwrotu pieniędzy :/
negative	i don_'_t know why anyone uses these people .
negative	worst reliability i have ever_seen .
negative	when i went on site to view the marriot hotel in hartsville , sc to book a reservation , i though that i would be talking to a marriott rep .
negative	the person never identified that he was from some other company .
negative	anyway , as we went through the reservation process , i asked that my marriott rewards numbers be put on the reservation .
negative	i was told then that i was not talking to marriott , but to a booking_agency and that the rewards number could not be put on the reservation .
negative	so i opted to say that i would call marriot to reserve the room .
negative	before i could get that number , my phone rang and the gentleman said , " my supervisor said that we can put the rewards number on the reservation ", so i proceeded with the reservation .
negative	when i got to the hotel , the rewards number was not on the reservation .
negative	also , the rep did not make it clear that my card was charged up front .
negative	not that it was a problem , he just didn_'_t make_sure that i understood that process .
negative	it so sad that we will do anything these days to get a sale or get business .
negative	the rep name was zack .
negative	we had a business conference and shipped all our printing over using ni_parcels .
negative	when we got there 0 day before the event we saw that our parcel had been ' re packaged ' and 00_% of our documents were wrecked .
negative	we were in a remote part of northern_ireland on st patrick '_s day weekend ... so we had to have the hotel re print all of our documents .
negative	the printing had foot prints on it , crumpled and ripped .
negative	if a box breaks i can understand but what is unforgivable is someone knew about it and could have made contact with us to let us know .
negative	we were put in a very embarrassing position which could have been avoided .
negative	vetting new shipping companies in time for our next conference .
negative	the web_site is easy to access and follow and you get your supplies within a week .
negative	i will go to them whenever supplies are needed .... never had a problem
negative	an absolutely appalling company with little or no customer_service .
negative	i recently took delivery of a faulty electrical_appliance and in spite of 0 telephone_calls it has not been collected and replaced .
negative	i have now referred the matter to trading_standards .
negative	dont be scammed into purchasing travelocity '_s flight insurance .
negative	it is extremely difficult to change flights or get your money back regardless of the emergency .
negative	the customer_service is very poor with travelocity .
negative	they are extremely_rude and unhelpful .
negative	they kept telling_me to call the airline .
negative	then one calls the airline , and they tell you to call who you booked through .
negative	i didn_'_t save any money by booking through_travelocity .
negative	i booked throught them to utilize the flight insurance due to health_issues .
negative	however , this was a waste of time and money .
negative	bought a paddle board , they have all over the website free_shipping above $_00 . 00 but yet i was charged shipping , apparently in a disclaimer .
negative	they sent me the wrong board , so another person was given mine .
negative	then days_later it just showed_up , i had a competition i was in so i had to rent a board for the houses mistake .
negative	all i wanted was a refund in shipping and no one acknowledged me , so never got it .
negative	got a sappent watch in the order broke the first day !
negative	over it , horrible customer_service .
negative	on saturday , 00th of october , i purchased a ticket for the killers at the secc , at glasgow .
negative	i have yet to receive an_email indicating my ticket was shipped and the gig is in three_days !
negative	unless it is posted tommorow it won_'_t arrive on time and i paid 000 £ just to be sure i woulld have a ticket no_matter what !
negative	i have emailed viagogo twice , never got a response and when i called them i was told they would contact the seller and email me by the end of the day .
negative	still no email .
negative	i am panicking since i will travel all the way from athens to go to this gig !
negative	!
negative	orderid :_0000000
negative	update_: unbelievable !
negative	have spoken to three agents so_far , getting the same reply that they have to get in touch with a separate department in order to reach the seller -- by email !
negative	!
negative	they have emailed me back twice with the exact_same automated email on how they are working with the seller to ensure that i receive my ticket in time .
negative	they obviously never read my actual email !!!
negative	!
negative	i have never_experienced worse service in my life and i have bought various tickets for concerts abroad .
negative	steer_clear .
negative	i ordered a part , was sent the wrong one finally got it sent back after 0 months of correspondence can not speak to anyone , tried_calling no one answers .
negative	all i wanted was to fix my car and have had nothing good from from your end .
negative	your customer_service is non existant , you told me i need to learn how to speak with people you need to speak to people period .
negative	i want my full_refund back and i expect it now .
negative	you keep saying 00 - 00_hours well it '_s way beyond that .
negative	i am pissed !!!!
negative	i had to click a star for your rating , you don_'_t deserve any but had to click one .
negative	i placed an order for a 00_lb .
negative	bag of verus dog_food , a red kong squeak toy , a kong giraffe toy , and a kong monkey toy .
negative	i specifically advised that i did not want any deviation from my request , and if they could not honor my request , they were to delete that specific aspect of my order .
negative	i e_- mailed twice and called twice .
negative	i spoke with a young_woman and i spoke with a young male .
negative	neither of these two people told me that they could not provide me with my specific request .
negative	obviously , the pet_flow people did not have a red squeak toy , because they sent a blue one .
negative	they did not care that i had to have a red one .
negative	they sent any color that they chose for me to receive .
negative	their disregard for my needs created a real mess for me !
negative	i work night shift .
negative	i work from 0000 until 0000 , ( 0 :_00pm ‘ til 0 :_00am ).
negative	i had to stay up almost twenty - four hours to shop at local_pet_store to locate a red kong squeak toy .
negative	pet_stores do not open until 00am , so by the time i found a red kong squeak toy , drove home , and got in the bed , i only had three and one half hours to sleep before it was time to get up and go to work again .
negative	i shop on - line because i must .
negative	i have to make a living , and i make my living by working on thirteen - hour shifts at night .
negative	i don_’ t have the convenience of stopping to shop after work , as the only place open to shop is wal - mart .
negative	department_stores and specialty_stores , such as pet_stores , do not open until half of my sleep time is gone .
negative	i am extremely disappointed .
negative	i was unbelievably inconvenienced by the pet_flow company .
negative	drive time has taken money out of my bank_account , not once but twice .
negative	i paid $_000 of my down payment on my debit_card in november , they took out $_000 in december_0000 and in march_0000 .
negative	the first time it took a few_days to put the money back on my card .
negative	this time i have to wait on a check .
negative	dont_know why it changed .
negative	i had to go back and forth from my bank to the dealer , i got transferred from one department to the next .
negative	this happened on march_00th ... it is now april 0 and i still don_'_t have my cash .
negative	they mailed the first check to the wrong_address and as of today my check is still not in the mail .
negative	i ask for the inconvenience could i get a few free car washes or maybe a gas card , the operator act like she couldn_'_t_believe her ears .
negative	no was my answer .
negative	they said this happens alot in ohio .
negative	the dealer told me the problem was fixed in january . this is march .... and i have to borrow rent money because drive time took my cash .
negative	i bought a wowcher recently .
negative	i tried to use it .
negative	i contacted the merchant and got no reply to a telephone_call .
negative	the voucher expired i contacted customer_service as it wasn_'_t my fault and i '_m still_awaiting a reply speaks_volumes .
negative	i ordered some items back in september 00 .
negative	i sent them several e_- mails .
negative	according to the tracking_numbers they provided , my items were delivered in il and or .
negative	i live in ca .
negative	" alice " said she will look into it .
negative	i never received the items i ordered .
negative	now that i sent another e_- mail , their account is closed .
negative	their webpage it '_s also closed .
negative	total scam !!!
negative	!
negative	i have yet received my order yet i ordered on the 0 of may .
negative	when looking at facebook people who ordered after that day have received their order .
negative	i have called several_times with no answer .
negative	i have email several_times , with no answer .
negative	so at this pointn i do not a nice review at this time .
negative	too slow sending the free post envelope out , the payment for the phone was even slower , would not recommend ..........
negative	let '_s put a stop to their scamming .
negative	report them to the authorities .
negative	i will not be ordering again .
negative	our experience of this company was extremely disappointing .
negative	we certainly won_'_t be using them again and i have warned our friends nd acquaintances to avoid them too .
negative	in short , the products that we ordered ( dual fix stair gates ) were not as_described on the web_page and could not be fixed safely using the pressure mounting without drilling the pressure cups into the wall (!).
negative	we contacted the company to advise them of the issue and , although very polite and ' sorry for any inconvenience caused ' refused to allow us to return the gate that we had opened because the packaging was opened - although we couldn_'_t have found the problem any other way .
negative	they would take back the second , unopened gate , only if we paid a £_00 . 00 courier fee .
negative	we have been left with a gate that is of absolutely no use to us as well as being £_00 out of pocket for the privilege of bing able to return the other one .
negative	having just had twin girls we have one a great deal of on line shopping for baby products and have never had such a negative experience any where else .
negative	given the plethora of similar companies around i would advise you to look elsewhere and find one of the many
negative	other_firms that actually understand the concept of customer_satisfaction .
negative	they presented themselves as the hotel itself instead of a booking agent .
negative	we travel with our dogs and requested a pet friendly hotel .
negative	after a 00 hour day we went to check in and there was a huge sign saying " no pets ".
negative	we could not get_ahold of anyone at their customer_service line in an effort to switch hotels using the " non_- refundable " room staying .
negative	we ended_up at a hotel that cost an_additional_$_00 which was not in our budget .
negative	the only_reason we were able to get a room was the help of the front counter woman at the no pet hotel .
negative	this reservation company is horrid on all fronts .
negative	avoid them like the plague .
negative	why is this taking so long my dog needs this food
negative	absolutely awful experience .
negative	the only_reason i bought from this website is because they had sent me an_email for 0 %_off so i figured why not .
negative	i have completed my 0nd week of my summer classes and i have yet to receive one of my books .
negative	it has_been extremely difficult to be able to complete my class without a textbook and has only been an inconvenience for me since the beginning .
negative	i will never buy from this website again .
negative	i ordered 0 cases of merrick cat_food over 0_weeks_ago .
negative	i got an_email message_saying that the cat_food was not in stock .
negative	so i wait and wait .
negative	no word from anyone about the shipment .
negative	i finally email them and there only response is they are checking but have no_idea when it will come in .
negative	they did get their money .
negative	now when will the food come in ?
negative	this company has the worst business_practice and customer_service of any company i have had the displeasure of dealing_with .
negative	danielle , a representative of optics_fast , refused to refund my money when i cancelled my order because the glasses i wanted were on back order and it was going to be weeks before they could be shipped .
negative	i was not told this up front and could not wait weeks for a pair of eyeglasses .
negative	please do not consider buying glasses from this horrible company .
negative	i would not recommend the use of this service .
negative	i was told my credit_card would not be billed , that is was just to hold and it was .
negative	i was told the hotel only had one non_smoking_room left and it had 00 .
negative	i was given a much higher_rate then i did with the hotel_directly .
negative	i would never use this service again .
negative	i am so surprised by all the good reviews as it is honestly a terrible website .
negative	my dress looked so tacky and it had ink stains all over it .
negative	i will never shop_here and i recommend others look at other forums for accurate reviews about this site .
negative	they said free_shipping then i had to pay $_00
negative	i will never use book it again , for the amount that was paid i should have never had connecting_flights , i don_'_t know who did that but it was horrible
negative	i order a queen_bed from them , huge mistake .
negative	i tried to place the order online but the promotion they had at the time ( spring sale 00_%_off ), and it wouldnt accept the code at the checkout .
negative	i called them and had to place the order over the phone ( felt very shady ).
negative	they charged my cc immediately but i did not recieve my bed till nearly 0_wks later .
negative	futonland tried to blame everyone but themselves .
negative	i would call and ask where my bed was and no one would tell me and say they would have the manager call me back that day .
negative	someone would eventually call me back several days_later .
negative	the manager made a racist comment about the shipping company and placed all the blame on them awful !!!
negative	the usps made 0 attempts to pick it up from them .
negative	dont shop_here .
negative	horrible service and not even an applogy
negative	i would not recommend this place to my worst_enemy !
negative	i got a lemon and lost everything i put down for the car !
negative	their so called warrenty is a bunch of bs nothing seems to be covered_under it .
negative	i got the car , 0 days_later it started turning off on me when i called them because they said if i have any_problems just bring it in anytime well i had to make an_appointment to bring the car in which wasn_'_t for a few_days so i was left with out a working vehicle .
negative	i took it in for a " 00 hour diagnostic test " which actually took 0 days for them to tell me they would only be fixing one of the many problem and with refurbished parts at that .
negative	the final straw was their rude customer_service and them laughing in my face saying that was just my luck , it just happens sometime !
negative	i terminated the contract and lost everything i put down , a months worth of insurance plus i had to pay for the stupid diagnostics test because drive time nor their warranty company would pay for it .
negative	the most expensive regret of my life is going to drive time !
negative	i asked about my cards that should have arrived but no one got back to me
negative	still have not received 0_weeks_later
negative	laptop arrived , webcam was not working and still is not working . emailed at_least 0 times and got no response except to say they would look into it and nothing more . i couldn_'_t try and download drives for webcam myself , as no one seemed able to tell me the exact model i had been sold .
negative	invalid phone_number and customer_service
negative	when the cartridges were installed the printer stated ink level low .
negative	i have returned
negative	we will wait and see your responce
negative	i am dissatisfied with the order because of the postage .
negative	the item arrived within 0 days of me ordering it , i paid £ 0 . 00 for delivery yet the item arrived via_royal_mail , second class at the cost of £ 0 . 00 ... this is nothing short of daylight robbery !
negative	i am happy with the item , it was as_described on the website what i '_m not happy with is the delivery service & the cost of it .
negative	based on this , i will not be using this website for future_purchases .
negative	when i first looked at ex - tech i was of the opinion that this was a product made in usa imagine my disappointment when i read made in china .
negative	i '_m not sure it is accurate .
negative	my lumber was in a heated garage all winter , yet it read 00_%
negative	i purchased a sunpak pz00x flash at b_&_h in nov 0000 .
negative	the image displayed a flash stand with it and there was no text whatsoever saying that , " accessories are optional ".
negative	i made a claim with customer_service and all they can say was , " oops , sorry about that , is there anything_else i can do for you ?"
negative	worst customer_service ever !
negative	on top of that i got different answers from phone reps , which have 0 knowledge on products ... basically , this is the last time i would purchase anything at b_&_h .
negative	imagine if they would screw something up like that on a product worth $ 0000 .
negative	i ' d_rather put my money with adorama , never had any_problems whatsover !
negative	if i could rate this a cero i would , but i only have a 0 option ...............
negative	we booked a room about ( 0 ) months in advance .
negative	my niece in arkansas was getting_married .
negative	we arrived at the rogers inn , located in rogers arkansas , immediately we realized that the pictures online didn_'_t look anything like the actual facility .
negative	we checked in and were given a room , the room looked run down , the furniture was cloth and had stains ( who_knows what ) all over them , there was no way anyone should be setting in them , the room smelt so bad that you couldn_'_t breath .
negative	i started crying , we had booked this room for a week .
negative	my husband went to the front_desk about the condition and the smell in the room , he was told we could be moved to another room .
negative	all the rooms would have been the same !
negative	my husband asked if we could get out of the weeks obligation , he was told we would still have to pay for ( 0 ) night and asked us if we would be occupying the room for that night .
negative	my husband told them that we would pay for ( 0 ) night but would not be staying .
negative	not only would the week previously booked but another night would be added to it charged to my credit_card , even_though it was credited to my credit_card it stayed on there as used for up to ( 0 ) days .
negative	we also had the charge of another hotel charged to our credit_card as well .
negative	i am not sure if i will ever be comfortable with booking something thru this website again .
negative	having placed my order , and received an_email_confirming despatch four days_later , the trouble really began .
negative	there was a link in the email to track the parcel .
negative	it said to wait 0 - 0 hours to track , so that parcelforce could enter it on the system .
negative	three_days_later , still no tracking , so i call them .
negative	no , apparently too early to do anything , and told to call back in two_days .
negative	i call back in two_days .
negative	before i even speak staff hang up , but eventually i get through and manage to speak to what i think was the world '_s rudest man .
negative	he has no_idea why i was asked to call back on monday - tracking_information can , he says .
negative	take several days to be available .
negative	he had no_explanation for why the email said the information wold be available in 0 - 0 hours , and i have been waiting over four days .
negative	he then_proceeded to insist that the 0 - 0 days it takes from despatch for delivery , should read 0 days at_least .
negative	he refused to acknowledge that the website says it takes up to 0 days for delivery ( from order ), and insisted this was from when it arrived in the uk - even_though plainly it does not say this .
negative	he repeatedly argued , shouted me down , spoke over me and told me if i could not understand the simple terms , perhaps a manager could explain it to me so perhaps i could understand .
negative	he then told me i should have paid for an expedited service for delivery !
negative	he refused to acknowledge that the six days has passed , and there is still no tracking .
negative	he cannot say when a manager will call me , he can do nothing for me if i don_'_t understand he said , and maybe a manager will call today , but maybe tomorrow , but they are very busy .
negative	aaarrrgghhhhhhhhhhhhh .
negative	and i have no parcel .......
negative	my order of dried animal food arrived slashed open inside the parcel ( no damage to mail bag ), and it was not what i needed .
negative	i contacted pet_supermarket to ask what to do and how to replace the order with what i did need .
negative	i stated it was urgent as my 00 year_old cat must eat a special_diet for kidney disease .
negative	i got a standard email that i would get a response within 00_hours .
negative	this was .
negative	followed_up 00_hours_later with a standard email_saying they were sorry for delay and would revert .
negative	after 0 days of nothing i left my complaint on the facebook_wall .
negative	this got action and i got a replacement parcel swiftly .
negative	thank_goodness because pet_supermarket then , after 0 days , responded to my complaint to tell me the date my original order was delivered ( not at all what i asked them to do and no mention of the fact i had the wrong food or a damaged parcel ).
negative	i told them this and got yet another standard email that they would respond within 00_hrs , with a follow_up email_stating sorry for the delay .
negative	a week further on and i have not heard a peep .
negative	the customer_services are an utter shambles .
negative	i cannot begin to say how angry it makes you to complain_about something , wait forever for a reply , and then get a standard response not at all appropriate to the complaint .
negative	it seems you will be ok unless things go wrong .
negative	when they go wrong , pet_supermarket clearly have not invested any decent staff or resources to deal with things .
negative	you will tear you hair out and give up .
negative	the exception is the facebook service , because of course they are less_than pleased to see a complaint so publicly and they manage to deal with that !!
negative	unfortunately for pet_supermarket they have lost my business forever as i am still so furious that they care so little for the welfare of an old cat and their customers that they take_forever to respond and then give you a standard unhelpful email , and never actually respond to the complaint .
negative	i am extremely dissatisfied with smartbuyglasses !
negative	i ordered costa del mar sunglasses .
negative	i received bifocal sunglasses .
negative	i immediately tried to call the phone_number on the invoice , only to find that it was not a working number !!
negative	so , i emailed customer_service and explained that i received bifocal sunglasses .
negative	the representative emailed the next_day .
negative	disappointment ( because the sunglasses were a christmas_present ) soon turned to frustration and finally anger after
negative	emailing back and forth for a week with representatives who insulted me by saying sbg did not make mistakes and they insisted that i take the sunglasses to an optician to prove that they weren_'_t bifocals !
negative	again , i sent more pictures ... i knew what i had received and they insisted i did not receive the wrong glasses !!
negative	when i emailed that i wanted a phone_number so i could talk to someone , i was informed that there was not a contact number !!
negative	this company claims to be an american company , but this is false !
negative	and the customer_service reps are most definitely not americans !
negative	i will never ever make this mistake again and i will inform others also .... so they don_'_t experience what i have !!
negative	!
negative	it was my first time using this website and i wasnt very happy .
negative	the flowers were for my grannys grave for christmas .
negative	she died 00 years_ago i live far away from home and every year i order flowers to be sent to my mother so she can put them on my grannys grave for me .
negative	they didnt look anythinng like the picture on the website to . me .
negative	i asked my . mother to send me a photo . of what arrived .
negative	the colours didnt look the same and . some of the flowers looked like theyd be . dead in a day or two .
negative	not happy .
negative	when i tried to book a hotel room on this site , i was sent two confirmations for two rooms on the wrong date .
negative	when i tried to call their offices - located in europe - they were closed .
negative	when i tried to leave a message , it told me the voicemail was full .
negative	i tried to email customer_service numerous_times and kept getting an_error_message .
negative	so i called back at 0 : 00 am , when their offices should have been open and i got a message that said , " due to unforeseen_circumstances , our customer_service office is closed ."
negative	i have tried every extension option and either get this message or endless ringing .
negative	almost 00_hours have gone by , and i cannot contact this company in any way .
negative	i will be disputing the charges on my credit_card as soon as they post .
negative	what a pain !
negative	stitching was poor .. the lining was not sewn evenly on gathered dress .
negative	will not purchase here again .
negative	i got a " wowcher " for a spray tan in april and made a booking for may , in neal st london .
negative	the company are not there ' apparently have moved ??'
negative	i did not get told i have sent emails to both wowcher and the company carlinii ?
negative	?
negative	yesterday the promotion is still being advertised !!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	beware i think my next step is trading_standards .
negative	i recently purchsed a great deal ... 0 nights in newcastle , a place i have always wanted to go for just £_00 . 00 !
negative	bargain !
negative	so i ring my friend all excited about our girly weekend ... and then i recieve an_email from wowcher stating that the hotel has made a mistake and there is a £_00 . 00 supplement to pay for a saturday_night_stay and there were actually exclusion dates that were not mentioned .
negative	o . k so its now £_00 . 00 for a 0 night_stay ... still a bargain !
negative	what really angered me most about this email was the fact that not just had i got an increase but i also had access to another 00 + email_addresses after we had all been copied into this email and not blind copied !
negative	my email then went mad for 00_hours as everyone was replying to all !!!!.
negative	i would have hoped that an organisation such as this would have used basic privacy settings and email ettiquette when dealing_with customers email_addresses .
negative	the glasses i ordered were the zac masons advertized as having a 00mm wide by 00mm height lens . after a excessive shipping delay 0 days after the tracking_number was posted , i received the pair of glasses the lens size is 00mm wide by 00mm height - not as_described !!
negative	!... i recommend avoiding this slipshod company and buying some place else like zenni optical as i have had positive results with them three_times in the past ..... no thank_you , global optical .. not reccommended .
negative	horror began with purchase and shipping .
negative	after purchase , company missed a friday_afternoon ups shipping deadline and equipment arrived within 00_hours of my departure .
negative	everything was working nicely on the first few connections in germany .
negative	however , when i tried to connect from my hotel in prague , i was unable to do so .
negative	i thought it was a bad connection , so i tried searching for other_providers .
negative	access was denied and i was forced to purchase internet service through the hotel .
negative	i was unable to connect for the remainder of my trip .
negative	after arriving home , i got phone and email messages telling_me i had massive usage and i needed to replenish my account to the tune of almost $_000 .
negative	i contested the amount , but was told that , after they checked with t - mobile in the czech republic , the usage had been verified .
negative	hotel and t - mobile verified my version when i made inquiries .
negative	i was lucky as i had used paypal and they couldn_'_t get to my money without authorization .
negative	so , stay away from mobility pass .
negative	if you do_business with them , use paypal so they can '_t just deduct money from an account or charge you for services they don_'_t render .
negative	while trying to book a reservation we were routed through this company , unknowingly .
negative	the correct city , state , and all other info was in , exactly as we wanted .
negative	the page flipped to the site where we were to pay .
negative	when the confirmation was printed it had the wrong state .
negative	this company ( the phone_number on the confirmation page ) was called and we were assured that we would be refunded the charged amount in approximately 0 days .
negative	the representative that assured us of this stated that this did happen at times , they were aware of this problem , and apologized .
negative	he asked if we would like to book where we initially wanted to stay .
negative	this time he booked us in the correct state just 00_minutes from where we wanted to be .
negative	this was not seen until we printed the confirmation page -- as the representative verbally confirmed the correct place , address , to include city and state while on the phone .
negative	the company was called again , this time they did cancel the charged amount to my credit_card .
negative	we ended_up calling the hotel and making_reservations directly through the hotel .
negative	to date i have called and spoken with a company representative and a company supervisor .
negative	i was told there is nothing they can do and nothing they will do .
negative	i was put in the system as a " no show ".
negative	i told them of course i did not show up , they booked me in the wrong state !
negative	i have also emailed the company to try to get this resolved - nothing .
negative	so they stole $_000 . 00 -- yes i say stole because we called and were guaranteed they would cancel this charge and they did not .
negative	and yes , we were within the cancellation time_frame .
negative	there is no excuse for this kind of poor customer_service .
negative	i would never book through this company and hope that anyone reading this will not take a chance with their hard_earned money .
negative	i had a 00x00 saved on 00 / 00 / 00 and called 0 / 00 / 00 and it was gone .... i should have gotten a phone_call ... i found a unit but along way from where i wanted a unit .... i am still shopping
negative	the flowers i ordered for my mum came on great time for mothers_day but look nothing like the picture , deluxe opinion was extra money for nothing and the card i picked was a different card .
negative	i '_m really disappointed , i could of got nicer ones from my local shop for £ 0 .. thought by spending £_00 they ' d be good but some of the flowers was dead before they even got into my mum '_s hands !!!
negative	only_thing right was the mothers_day balloon .
negative	also the customer_service by mail is rubbish as i received emails about 0 different peoples orders ...
negative	totally_unprofessional .
negative	ordered the pool in time for delivery for the long memorial_day weekend .
negative	it is going on three plus weeks and we are still_waiting .
negative	just ( while i '_m typing this ) received a phone_call from doheny '_s that the manufacturer is waiting for the walls and that they are expecting to be able to ship .
negative	i mentioned that i was expecting the pool today ( possibly ) as i was told last_week that it would be shipped on monday / tuesday of this week and to " now " receive a phone_call that it wouldn_'_t be shipped for another week .
negative	understand , my credit_card has already been charged .
negative	very , very disappointing .
negative	i order parts online all of the time with no_problems .
negative	i have been a mechanic for over 00 years ( i know my parts and cars ).
negative	i carefully placed an order online for the exact part i needed for my 0000_dodge durango with a 0 . 0l engine .
negative	there was no option other than ground shipping , so i accepted that .
negative	there was also no comment field for shipping instructions .
negative	a couple of days_later i was notified via_email by ups that my package was being shipped via_ups / usps combined shipping .
negative	that created a problem for me .
negative	i do not receive any home mail delivery from the usps .
negative	i had to make a special trip across_town to the usps carrier annex to put in another change of address form so that i could then drive across_town and pick_up my package once i got the delivery notice in my p . o .
negative	box .
negative	that was bad enough .
negative	then , when i got the package and opened it , i found out that i had received the wrong part .
negative	partsgeek has a policy that they charge a 00_% restocking_fee for returned items .
negative	you ( the customer ) have to pay the shipping_charges both_ways .
negative	this would have been almost as much as i would have gotten back on the part itself .
negative	as soon as i find out what this part fits , i plan to sell it on ebay .
negative	at_least i can get back most of my money ( minus the original shipping_charges ) even if it takes even more of my time .
negative	i am sticking with rock auto from now on .
negative	i have never had a problem getting parts from them .
negative	sometimes the lowest_price isn_'_t the best price .
negative	never again !!!
negative	buyer_beware !!
negative	!
negative	i cant even begin to figure_out how to use the product i purchased .
negative	there was no information on returns .
negative	i asked for information and have not had a response in addition it is made of plastic and i am allergic .
negative	i saw nothing indicating that before i placed my order .
negative	have been waiting for a parcel today but had to be at docs for 00 . 00 so left a card to suggest a safe place if i missed them .
negative	so i left my house at 00 . 00 to see courier sat outside the house in his van .
negative	are you delivering to me ?
negative	yes he says but i am early , i can '_t deliver until 00 . 00 .
negative	so can i have the parcel now ?
negative	no you cant not until 00 . 00 .
negative	what !
negative	excuse me are you having a laff ?
negative	i said i need to be somewhere at 00 . 00 and need to go out , but no , would not hand over parcel .
negative	in the end when i said i need to leave now he said he would leave my parcel in a secure place , ( i . e after 00 . 00 )... so he got out his van and i showed him a place he could leave it , after 00 . 00 , excuse me but surely my house is the most secure place to leave it , not outside ...
negative	he walked past my front_door to observe safe place !
negative	it was a ps0 from currys long awaited for as xmas_present or would have told him to return the parcel was so mad ... jobsworth !
negative	hi i dont_think we have received the futon_cover yet
negative	i purchased a bug shield for my husbands jeep as a gift for him .
negative	it arrived in a lovely non damaged box , but the shield was broken in several pieces .
negative	now i . am supposed to ship it back and pay for the return postage .
negative	of course there is no phone_number to call so i may speak to someone .
negative	we are very senior_citizens and are not computer_savvy , now i must take this very long box to the post_office and wait 00 days to get my credit .
negative	not happy
negative	not delivered today .
negative	first_impressions last !
negative	i purchased a pen which really wasn_'_t suitable for engraving and i should have been told this .
negative	they engraved my graphite and silver pen with gold leaf and it looked shocking .
negative	the after sales service i received was poor and the attitude of staff in customer care terrible .
negative	i wouldn_'_t use them again
negative	ordered part then got email_saying it was on back order and they would not be able to fill order .
negative	of course i was able to order the part from them for a few extra dollars ... of course i chose to order from someone_else .
negative	i have waited 0 months for a cash_back amount , and the customer_service is not worth having , also any opinion you have via the facebook_page if not favourable is just deleted
negative	how can you move forward when they don_'_t reply to your emails ?
negative	i am constantly chasing them for replies .
negative	infact i am still_waiting for a reply to my email sent to accounts @ workwearexpress . com on the 00 / 00 / 0000 , i was sent an invoice to be paid but it was already paid .
negative	they have good products at cheap prices but the staff let you down with a lack of prompt service .
negative	it said that i could pay on arrival then all of sudden i got an_email_telling_me that i had to have a credit_card , no i dont have one so to be onest you was not at all help full for me .
negative	you provide an excellent way to ship dog_food to my home .
negative	but i was horrified that the trusted website " www . dogfoodadvisor " is now listing about 00 recalls of different brands of dog and cat_food , mainly surrounding the presence of salmonella in a south_carolina diamond dog_food plant .
negative	( other brands were also manufactured in that one facility .)
negative	i understand you could say your business is to ship food , but could you somehow agree with dogfoodadvisor to at_least add a warning box at the top of your website , when the recalls total so many , that owners need to check .
negative	animals are dying !
negative	the prescription in these glasses are way off .
negative	makes me feel dizzy .
negative	not happy .
negative	they cancelled my reservation because " the price was too low ".
negative	it was a special_offer so i don_'_t understand_why they cancelled .
negative	don_'_t plan your vacation with booking . com !
negative	!
negative	i have emailed back and forth with smartbuyglasses several_times .
negative	i have asked on numerous_occasions for them to call me , and have provided both my order id and my full contact info .
negative	i even emailed the servicemanager @ smartbuyglasses . com address , and still have not received a phone_call .
negative	i have had a similar problem as the majority of the poor reviews .
negative	the glasses i ordered were out of stock in the warehouse , and they were checking with the supplier , but they suggested that i choose a different pair .
negative	i sent an_email_saying that if the original frames i wanted were not available from the supplier , then i would like to switch to a different frame .
negative	after no response for 0 days , i checked my order status .
negative	it said the stock of my original pair had been confirmed .
negative	whew .
negative	then i got an_email from them saying that the back up pair i ordered were not in stock , but are through the supplier .
negative	wait ... what ?
negative	so i immediately went back to my order status page .
negative	they have now added the second pair of glasses to my order .
negative	they have not charged me for them yet , but my total on the website has changed to show charges for both pairs .
negative	i understand the wait time , but i still have not received my glasses , nor a phone_call to straighten everything out .
negative	i cannot even get a straight answer form the famed "< private_data_removed >" who seems to be the only rep they have .
negative	all i want is to have my original order , and a phone_call .
negative	ordered tyres through black_circle , i was changing from run_flats to standard tyres on a bmw which i have done on two previous occasions .
negative	i booked in at the local_garage for fitting who refused to fit the tyres due the them not being car manufacturer recomendation .
negative	on phoning black_circle the same morning it was stated the garage had agreed to the job and it was out of their hands .
negative	the solution was ' could we go and collect the tyres and take them to a garage 00_miles_away ?'.
negative	no thankyou - we cancelled the order and went elsewhere .
negative	ordered two_pairs of curtains - identical in every way , size , colour , make , etc .
negative	well they couldn_'_t manage to get this order right .
negative	courier delivered order : one pair as ordered , the other completely wrong .
negative	when i rang customer_services they were very rude and unhelpful .
negative	escalated the problem to head_office .
negative	cannot_believe this - they will not send a courier with a replacement pair and take the wrong pair away .
negative	they want me to take the curtains back to one of their stores ( nearest shope 00_miles_away ) or post them back to them via_royal_mail ( quite a heavy parcel to carry ).
negative	this is not my error debenhams - it '_s yours .
negative	don_'_t see why i have to inconvenience myself because of your mistake .
negative	amazon can manage it !
negative	be warned .
negative	don_'_t shop online at debenhams .
negative	never again will i - never !!!!
negative	!
negative	i placed an online order on cyber_monday , received my item in a timely_manner .
negative	my son really wanted this jacket and was excited when it arrived .
negative	the jacket didn_'_t fit ( the arms were too short ) and needed to return the item .
negative	it '_s too bad because he has the windbreaker in the same size and it fits fine .
negative	the fit seemed irregular so we wanted to get it replaced as soon as possible .
negative	well , i found out it will cost me $_000 to ship a jacket i paid $_000 for !
negative	i have made several_attempts to contact someone , anyone to assist me in returning the jacket via_email .
negative	no one has responded ( not even an automatic reply ).
negative	i am now stuck with a jacket that doesn_'_t fit and out $_000 . 00 us dollars .
negative	i made my reservation about 00 months before i booked my trip to mexico .
negative	now though hotelclub offers another credit at our resort in the amount over $_000 . 00 .
negative	so my sincere advise is as follows : don_'_t book with hotelclub early or ever because hotelclub won_'_t give us the resort credits they now offer ...
negative	wait_till the last minunte to book with hotelclub or i would never use this travel site again , we got ripped - off !!!
negative	now we are bummed because we booked a three week vacation in mexico , sure could of used the resort credits ... also without telling us , hotelclub charged an extra $_000 . 00 in mx fees , that were never disclosed , and it was a separate charge to my credit_card a month later .
negative	do !
negative	not !
negative	use this travel website unless your so desparate , nver again , hotelclub has some phoney club point membership ...
negative	suddenly we don_'_t have our 000_+ points anymore , what '_s up !
negative	rip - off .
negative	this is gail regan of rhododendron , or u . s . a .
negative	blumenwaren nicht wie abgebildet und eine blume war sogar abgebrochen !
negative	i had to cancel my plans and your hotel took my money as soon as i made the reservation from my bank
negative	when i made my reservation , i specifically_asked for a room that was approved for a pet .
negative	i was told that was not a problem .
negative	however , when i arrived at the hotel , the room that was reserved for me was not pet acceptable .
negative	luckily the hotel had an extra room available for my first reservation .
negative	however , my 0nd reservation had to be canceled due to this mistake and i had to find other accomodations at the last_minute .
negative	i had a terrible experience with expedia !
negative	i '_ve worked with them before and they were good .
negative	it '_s been a while since i traveled , but based on my previous experiences , i trusted expedia .
negative	they have changed !
negative	this is what happened : i am planning a vacation in the uk and i wanted to stay in london for 0 nights .
negative	i booked 0 rooms for 0 nights at tune hotel - paddington .
negative	later that day i found out expedia over charged me by $_000 , plus , expedia charged a $_00 fee for each room each night .
negative	the tune hotel website charged less .
negative	so , i thought i would take_advantage of the " best price guarantee ".
negative	i called them up and my booking matched all the criteria accept the tune website did not covert british pounds to us dollars .
negative	they would not cancel my booking either .
negative	so , i '_m out $_000 !
negative	travelers beware !
negative	expedia wants to rip you off !
negative	never book a hotel with them without researching your choice thoroughly before hand !
negative	then , my advice is to make_sure you can cancel the booking for a full_refund just in case !
negative	..... the reason_why is because you never followed_up when i had to cancel .
negative	after three ( 0 ) phone_calls waiting for a confirmation showing the reservation was cancelled we finally went to the credit_card company .
negative	this note doesn_'_t even rate a star .
negative	when i put in the new cartridge from printerink the machine showed black_ink low and printing quality is of a very low standard cartridge it showe
negative	still_waiting for a refund , no reply to my numerous_emails
negative	i booked one of expedia ' hidden value ' rooms and selected ( 0 ) adults and ( 0 ) children .
negative	my room came back as either ( 0 ) queen or ( 0 ) twin beds .
negative	obviously not enough room for 0 people .
negative	i then was required to pay an extra $_00 to ' upgrade ' my room to what i originally requested .
negative	customer_service kept subtly blaming me for their system malfunction .
negative	" did i select right ", " sorry it '_s non_- refundable ".
negative	they did offer me a $_00 coupon - but i '_m all done with my travel booking so i '_m not sure when i can use it .
negative	plus i am forced to deal with them again .
negative	lost my documents and tried to blame me for their screw up !
negative	i will be disputing all the charges with my credit_card company .
negative	i had a problem with my flight i booked through_travelocity .
negative	after several phone_calls and several_times being frustrated i got absolutely !
negative	nowhere !
negative	very frustrating experience i will not be using travelocity in the future !
negative	very friendly management ... but very fast talking , manipulative sorta arrangement that was too good to be true .... but of corse i fell for it .
negative	i ordered a leathermen coat from them dec 0 .
negative	the first email states my order was placed and says i '_ll receive my shipment confirmation .
negative	after a day of not receiving the email i called because they had already taken the money .
negative	i sat on hold for 00_minutes and hung_up and just called the next_day .
negative	the representative said she ' d send me a new shipment confirmation .
negative	i didn_'_t get one but i was not in the mood to cuss anyone out so i waited .
negative	after 0_weeks , i received an_email_saying a portion of my order couldn_'_t be fulfilled so i would be refunded .
negative	what portion ?
negative	the sleeves ?
negative	it '_s a jacket .
negative	the item isn_'_t marked out of stock nor on backorder .
negative	also , how was she sending a new shipment confirmation_email when the item is out of stock ..
negative	i called to see when i would be receiving my refund and was told 0 - 00 days .
negative	so i ask 0 - 00 days from the day you guys took my money and pretended like you had this item in stock or 0 - 00 days from when you guys fessed up to never having it , of course the latter .
negative	it '_s been 0 days since they emailed me and on the 00th day , i '_ll be d **** d if i don_'_t see my money .
negative	quick to take money but not give it back ?
negative	i don_'_t think so .
negative	absolutely disappointed .... booked a two bed room for my family of four only for the company to book in error a king_size bed ... no one will help me and the hotel is sold out ... worst_experience ever and i will never use this site again
negative	my order was placed 0wks ago and i still_haven_'_t received what i ordered .
negative	unhappy customer
negative	on 00 october i ordered a kitchen bin (£ 00 ) from scotts of stow .
negative	it arrived 0_weeks_later with one side missing .
negative	i rang and was told that within two_weeks i would receive the missing side .
negative	two_weeks passed - i rang again several_times and kept being told it would arrive .
negative	the supervisor would not speak to me so no support for her customer_service agent who was very nice .
negative	apparently there is nothing they can do to contact their suppliers to ask them to treat a customer with an unsatisfactory order as a priority .
negative	after waiting 0_weeks for the missing side , i was told by the supervisor that i ' d been misinformed - it is not possible to send out missing bits of an order .
negative	so on 0 december they ordered me another kitchen bin .
negative	i was promised this bin between 00 and 00 december .
negative	they wanted to send me vouchers but i said i would not buy anything_else from scotts of stow .
negative	i asked for money off the bin and received a cheque for £_00 .
negative	i phoned again on 00 december because it still hadn_'_t arrived and was told by another customer_service advisor that i shouldn_'_t have been told to expect it on that day .
negative	unbelievable .
negative	it arrived on 00 december and several of the screw things broke as we were putting it together .
negative	never use this terrible company .
negative	the quality of their products is very poor .
negative	customer_service advisors give out wrong information .
negative	the supervisor was unavailable to speak to me even when she had just spoken to her advisor .
negative	when she said she ' d phone me back , she didn_'_t , i phoned and she said she was just about to phone .
negative	this lack of concern for customers is truly amazing .
negative	i would never use this company if it was the last one standing .
negative	called 0 - 000 number and no response ( the call drops ).
negative	requested refund via_email and have not heard_anything back yet .
negative	will never order from petflow again .
negative	i purchased a wine glass last_week from this shop and i wish i hadn_'_t .
negative	when it arrived it had big scratches down the side .
negative	normally , i probably_wouldn_'_t have been bothered but it '_s an xmas_present so i can '_t accept anything less_than perfect .
negative	i called customer_services to explain ( i called because they are unbelievably slow at reaponding to online requests , but more on that later ) and the lady i spoke to said that not to worry a replacement would be sent out that day on a next_day delivery .
negative	i thought this was more than acceptable and so happily thanked her and waited for my replacement to be delivered the next_day .
negative	sooooo you can probably guess that the next_day came and went and no delivery !
negative	i called customer_services again ( premium_rate phone_number ) and i was told by a vicky that she needed to speak to the warehouse and would get back to me .
negative	well , that was 0 days ago ( as of now ).
negative	i have sent another two messages online which have not been responded to .
negative	what an_absolute joke .
negative	i have never ever_experienced such terrible customer_service .
negative	this was supposed to be a secret_santa present and we are giving them on thursday and i can guarantee that this issue will not be resolved by then judging_by their previous track record .
negative	then they had the cheek to send me an e_- mail asking me to rate them and my experience .
negative	well , it was absolutely awful .
negative	they claim to be some kind of directory enquiry service but they charge you as soon as you click on a link to their site !!
negative	no authorisation process or acceptance process it appears to be immediate and is astronomical prices !!
negative	£_00 for 0 days access and immediately added to your mobile bill !!
negative	no answer at their offices either so no chance of a refund .
negative	i shall be contacting the police as i feel this may be some kind of internet / mobile scam
negative	the shower_enclosure and tray that i purchased from bath_empire resulted in me having to replace a large part of my kitchen ceiling !
negative	the waste pipe supplied was faulty and resulted in a large leak and i was unable to use the shower until it was fixed , which approx 0_weeks in total .
negative	i found this extremely difficult as i initially had the shower installed due to being heavily pregnant and with an existing disability found bathing difficult .
negative	the added stress and expense at this time was extremely upsetting .
negative	i contacted bath_empire sales_team for a response but was totally ignored !
negative	if you ' re looking for quality products and service you '_ll not find them with bath_empire , steer well clear !
negative	!
negative	talk about hard_sell .
negative	i was told by the rep checking in that i had to have their insurance .
negative	i never purchase additional insurance anywhere i travel ( even south_africa ) but was told in glasgow , that i had no other choice .
negative	the rep wouldn_'_t let_me leave without calling my insurance company to verify i would be covered ( which i declined given that it was a 0 hour time difference and the middle of the night in texas where usaa is located ).
negative	all this , because i was planning to take a car to the republic of ireland .
negative	she insisted on giving me paperwork that she said would be demanded when i took the car out of northern_ireland and on the ferry .
negative	we took ferry_crossings 0 times , and the paperwork was never requested .
negative	she may have made a sale that day , but i will never use national car_rental , or europcar ever again .
negative	i was sent a wrong item twice .
negative	i went to the trouble of explaining the error on their website but was ignored .
negative	when i eventually received a refund it was for the wrong amount .
negative	out of time , out of pocket , out of patience - never again !
negative	scam !
negative	how are they even in business ?!?!?!
negative	it seems like there are very few good reviews that are probably written by the employees / employers at the place ... not cool guys , not cool .
negative	i ordered ( 0 ) pairs of tiffany glasses , they arrived so stretched out to the point that they wouldn_'_t even fit / stay on my head !
negative	i paid for the glasses up front before they shipped , i paid to return the damaged glasses and i received ( 0 ) additional payment notices that i would have to pay more to get the replacement glasses made and shipped ...
negative	i wouldn_'_t pay more as they shouldn_'_t have sent me damaged glasses to begin with !
negative	now they won_'_t even respond to my requests for a status_update !.
negative	i finally had to put in a dispute with my credit_card company to try to get my money back .
negative	terrible experience - so not worth the $_00 i saved !
negative	!
negative	our goods where due to arrive for our company launch ; needless to say it didn_'_t arrive . when i called the where unable to find it and no apology .
negative	looking at the shipping details the delivery detail where printed at 0 . 00pm on the agreed delivery date clearly they had no_intention of meeting the agreement .
negative	blatant disregard for customer_service and rude driver .
negative	now looking at the other reviews i can see this is a company that good at failing ;
negative	i placed a telephone order for 00 boxes of tiles , the delivery was due today and a courier turned_up and has placed them in the street leaving my 00 year daughter in tears with his rudeness .
negative	speaking to orderline street delivery is part of the terms and conditions , it was not mentioned when i placed the order over the phone or when i received the confirmation_email these tiles now sitting in the street in the middle of london are according to the wickes my responsibility even_though my daughter refused the delivery and the driver left them with telling her . i will not be home to 0 . 00pm .
negative	needless to say i do not expect them to be their when i get home .
negative	i will be cancelling my kitchen order this evening with wickes because i would like a safe delivery of my goods and will be taking wickes to the small claims court for these tiles which i suspect i will never see !
negative	we had good feelings about the whole_experience , until we dropped the car back to gatwick airport .
negative	when the agent checked over the car he said we had damaged the car which we had not .
negative	so our experience changed , several points that we had issue with are as follows :-
negative	# when we arrived to collect the car we found that the hours we found on line for operating on saturday were different to the hours at kingston on thames depot ( luckily we arrived before the depot closed )
negative	# the car was still being prepared when we arrived .
negative	# the lady_who served_us was a little rushed as she had another two clients arrive just after us .
negative	i must_say she did her best and we thought she was helpful .
negative	# she showed us the previous damage that was on the panel of the car and we walked around to check for any other damaged panels .
negative	we found no more damage on panels .
negative	# no one told us to check tyres or windscreen ( which was the advice we were told we needed to look for at_gatwick .)
negative	# the agent said there was windscreen damage on the car and that we were responsible for it .. we denied any damaged caused while we had the car .
negative	he proceeded to show us the damage on the windscreen , where the patch of blackened glass , where the rear vision mirror sits , there was a small chip .
negative	we certainly had not noticed it when we checked the car but then , we hadn_'_t looked at the windscreen and you could not see the damage from the inside of the car at all .
negative	we barely saw it when he showed us , as it was on this blackened part of the windscreen .
negative	# we still maintain that we did not do the damage .
negative	we asked the agents to please forward our complaint to the next level and asked for them to contact us through our email address before applying any charges .
negative	this was not done .. we were subsequently charged the very next_day aud 000 . 00 .
negative	we have to date not received any explanation as to what the charges were for fuel , repairs etc .
negative	# we will in future be more careful checking our hire cars as this is the first time we have had this problem .
negative	it was too bad that the people at kingston were not as " picky " as the people at_gatwick .
negative	# we will never use europecar again in australia or uk as we have in the past .
negative	we take exception that they did not contact us at all .
negative	hi
negative	i live in portugal and we have great difficulty getting good tennis skirts so we choose to shop online .
negative	we all buy nike_tennis skirts - i recently put in an order for 0 club nike_tennis skirts - what arrived got immediately sent back .
negative	we did a full comparision from last years skirts to this years skirts .
negative	the quality is gone .
negative	when i returned the skirts i did explain that the waist band is narrower - definitely the quality of the fabric used is not as good - i can appreciate lenght is shorter maybe thats fashion but at club level they are too short .
negative	it has made us all in vale do lobo to rethink how we purchase our tennis outfits .
negative	i look_forward to your response .

negative	i have been ordering from 0 sites for renting_textbooks , the only one i have issues with is bookbyte .
negative	their shipping time is way too long .
negative	i '_m still_waiting for a book that i ordered at the end of 0000 .
negative	they aren_'_t very customer_service oriented , i asked for compensation from my last order and they said no .
negative	i don_'_t think they realize how important good customer_service is .
negative	i won_'_t be using them ever again .
negative	the parts i ordered were not packed correctly and arrived in multiple pieces .
negative	according to partsgeek they are not responsible for items that are broken in shipment even if their employees incorrectly packed the items .
negative	this will be my last time purchasing from partsbreak ...
negative	it hasnt arrived yet !!
negative	!
negative	never going to order from this site again because their return_policy on bathing_suits is a rip_off .
negative	i ordered two bathing_suits and wanted to exchange one and they would not do it even_though it was brand_new and still had all the tags and everything on it .
negative	hate this site .
negative	waste of money .
negative	having never flown spirit_airlines before , i had no_idea the ridiculous fees they charge to make up for their low fares .
negative	travelocity needs to do a better job disclosing that info or stop selling spirit_airlines tickets all together .
negative	personally i would choose the latter .
negative	if i had known that you would be charging my card * at the time of booking * and i could not cancel for free -- i would not have booked this room !
negative	that information needs to made available to customers before they book the room !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i will never use this website again !
negative	had not realized i had been transferred to their site from the marriott site ... saw that they charged more per_night to stay three versus two .
negative	when confronted they said tough luck it is what it is .
negative	i immediately cancelled the reservation called the hotel direct and got the same room and dates for almost $_000 less_than reservation_counter was gouging me for .
negative	i can '_t wait to see that credited to my american_express .
negative	ae will not cover the charge !
negative	bought a camera , sandisk 00gb and a camera case ( x ' mas promotion one package ) price £_000 . 00 - brilliant !
negative	!
negative	wrapped the present for hubby , he_loves it .
negative	then we found out the case doesn_'_t fit the camera .
negative	went back the next_day ( boxing_day ) to complaint and hoping to get a case that ftt - but no currys customer_service on that day ( fair enought ).
negative	went back after our holiday to ireland and guest what !
negative	!
negative	they charged me an extra £ 0 . 00_pounds to have the right case when it was suppose to be a package !
negative	what a fraud !!
negative	no more of this crap !!
negative	will buy from somewhere_else .
negative	btw : currys customer_service - not much of a service , some doesn_'_t have a clue what they are doing .
negative	no proper training given .
negative	failed big time !
negative	!
negative	i ordered a ps0 controller for my grandson for christmas .
negative	it was ordered on dec_00th .
negative	my credit_card was charged on dec_00th and i still have not received the order .
negative	my daugher and i have called several_times and have not been able to talk to anyone .
negative	they tell us all reps are busy and to leave a number and they will call back and they never due .
negative	i am ready to cancel this order and never do_business with this co . again .
negative	i thought i was getting a great deal for my husband only to find out from my bank_statement i was charged $_00 .
negative	for something that i thought i was getting for $_00 . 00 .
negative	i made a few inquires and was told that i was charged for turning my american $ into british pounds even thou i clicked on the american flag in the top right corner .
negative	so i have asked for a refund and i will get what i need from someone_else .
negative	nearly every time i use wowcher i have problems ordering the items .
negative	am going to cancel my account with them and stop making any further_purchases .
negative	i am sick of the hassle i always encounter .
negative	i ordered products .
negative	i only got a partial shipment without an explanation .
negative	when i inquired_about the remainder of the order , i was told the product was out of stock .
negative	i would have preferred to know when ordering , or at_least be informed as soon as the incomplete shipment went out .
negative	the lack of info is not ok
negative	the part in the picture is not the part i received a complete rip_off ...
negative	i had i go re find the part ...
negative	thanks for wasting my time and money !!!!!!
negative	i will never shop_here again and i will warn all of my friends !!!

negative	aldrig før har_jeg oplevet så utroværdigt et forløb .
negative	mine møder med sf syddanmark bærer kun præg af_en inkompetent sagsbehandling , en såkaldt mægler med høreapparat som slet_ikke hørte halvdelen af mødet , gik midt i det_hele for at skifte batteri , - en inkompetent jurist som konstant var konflikt optrappende på alle områder .
negative	barnet bliver ikke hørt , og først efter klage til familiestyrelsen blev det hørt , der lyves , bøjes regler og undgås at træffe afgørelser som følger lovgivningen , skilsmissebørn er retsløse med de statsforvaltninger der_er i dag .
negative	i order 000 bussiness cards and i paid online with my debit_card in that moment its been a week already and i still no have the cards or the confirmation order , its a plus to say that they took de . money out of my account
negative	have returned damaged part .
negative	no one has contacted me yet !
negative	i ordered roses to be delivered today .
negative	it is now 0 pm and i have not received them .
negative	i have called the call_center 00 times ( no exaggeration ) and cannot get a human_being on the line .
negative	after a couple of minutes the line says the wait time is longer_than usual and hangs_up on me !
negative	i have emailed them twice and have not received a reply to those either .
negative	i have no_idea where my flowers are or if i am even recieving them anymore !!
negative	this is not okay for the amount of money i spent on them !!
negative	still_waiting !!!
negative	beyond upset !
negative	i will never order from avas again !
negative	i really enjoy how low their prices are , however their policies are out of this world .
negative	first , they never have anything in stock and you don_'_t find out about it until a few_weeks_later when you get your refund .
negative	second , i ordered a small in a dress and they shipped me a medium .
negative	i had originally used a free_shipping promotion_code and they refused to go_ahead and send me the correct size with a prepaid return_slip to send the medium back .
negative	they said their policy is for me to pay to send it back and then they would ship me the correct size ... all charges on me .
negative	this is ridiculous and i '_m reporting them to the bbb .‎
negative	we ordered parts and received wrong parts that are damaged .
negative	we can not get_ahold of anyone on the 0 - 000 number .
negative	the only way to communicate is through e_- mails that do not get answered for 0 days .
negative	then they want us to pay for shipping the damaged wrong part back in the same box that all the parts came in , that is very damaged too .
negative	the box is over sized and that is probably why the part was damaged .
negative	we still need the right part , so we can finish the customers truck and return it to them .
negative	i placed an order for 0 nucs to be shipped the 0nd week of april .
negative	it is may_0th and i have yet to receive them .
negative	when i called to cancel the order i was told i could not without losing half of my payment even_tho they had failed to deliver .
negative	then they told me i hadn_'_t actually paid for them .
negative	i spent a day trying to prove that i had indeed paid for them by debit_card over the phone . after leaving several messages and not getting a call back , my call was finally answered on the second day of calling .
negative	at this time lori said that they had the record of my full payment and told me my bees would be shipped that week .
negative	it is now a week_later and i still have not seen the bees or heard_anything from pmtc .
negative	i am very disappointed in the whole deal .
negative	update the bees arrived today may_0th .
negative	i am satisfied with the bees .
negative	i just wish someone had told me they had been shipped .
negative	if i had not been home this morning they would have stayed in the post_office til monday .
negative	they are light compared to the package bees i buy from simpson '_s but they had a low mortality count .
negative	that is always a good thing .
negative	do not recommend to use this for reservations of any sort !
negative	a family emergency came and they would not change the date to accommodate for this reservation and family emergency .
negative	i was so disappointed that they coldly told me that it '_s a policy .
negative	use another travel site for reservations .
negative	website stated would not be sent to the warehouse for shipment readiness until the date i told on my order and they actually sent it the day before so it cost me 00 . 00 in overdraft fees .
negative	will not be ordering any time soon .
negative	they have fake reviews ....
negative	must read ... they will scam you !
negative	cheap fabric !
negative	no returns !
negative	beyond disappointed with overall purchase !
negative	they will take your money
negative	will not buy again !!!
negative	!
negative	i bought the oratene antiseptic gel & maintenance gel - there are no cautions for diabetic animals !!!
negative	!
negative	this contains dectrose and cellulose basically straight sugar !!!
negative	i want a refund due to no cautions for diabetics on the product information .
negative	thanks you could have killed my dog
negative	i was in a hurry for a teacher gift .
negative	book plates sounded_like a good idea .
negative	should have looked a bit more closely , as i received what i could have done myself .. a few sheets of a template ( think avery sticker sheets ) for a personalized book plate .
negative	i could have printed these out on a color printer myself .
negative	presentation is awful .
negative	i was expecting a booklet ... or something like that .
negative	i was embarrassed to give the gift .
negative	i was more embarrassed by the cost .
negative	print quality was good .
negative	they arrived on time .
negative	i was very happy to quickly make a reservation , but then made the mistake of purchasing the additional insurance .
negative	the website claimed i could get 000_% refunded for it if i chose to cancel the insurance .
negative	this is not true .
negative	i sent an_email to the person responsible for insurance and they responded with a 0 - 000 number that informed me they couldn_'_t help me since my confirmation number didn_'_t work for their system .
negative	i then called the rentalcars . com website 0 - 000 number only to be transferred to 0 different people .
negative	the last person was located in the uk and had no_idea how to help me since all the people of in the us have had the same problem .
negative	their answer was to cancel the whole reservation and re book .
negative	the problem with this is that the price has increased from when i first made the reservation .
negative	not that i really think anyone there will actually read this , but i would just like to say i hate your service .
negative	i could have given it five_stars .
negative	you have a really nice site .
negative	the cost of acceptable .
negative	your customer_service reps are nice .
negative	which is where the problem comes in .
negative	i have to call in to confirm myself every freaking month .
negative	every time i want to see my credit_score i have to call in .
negative	why ?
negative	i still have no clear answer .
negative	last time i asked i was told it was because of all the times other people have screwed_up my last name , making the public record which has nothing on it fail to match up in your system .
negative	other people screw up and i '_m the one that has to pay for it .
negative	it ticks me off more every_single time i have to go through it .
negative	the moment i find a competing site that offers their service for the same or lower price , i '_m canceling this account .
negative	and fyi , your hold music sucks too .
negative	it wouldn_'_t kill you people to update it once in a while .
negative	they are the worst ... i order a product on jan_0th it is now jan_00th i still have not received it a guy name michael x . contacted me to make me feel better stating the usps dont_know the actual date and to following the tracking website he attached .... this is bs ..... i will never , ever in my life order nothg frm these ppl nomore .... i tell they are the worst .... if somebody on this website is giving them a 0star trust me they work for the company ...... if it was a rating for no rate i would have clicked that one ......
negative	i ordered 0 shirts from this company and paid $_000 .
negative	i placed my order on 00 / 00 and was promised to receive the order between 00 / 00 - 00 / 00 plenty of time for christmas .
negative	when my order came i was so disappointed .
negative	i only received 0 shirts correctly .
negative	0 came blank and 0 did not come at all .
negative	i used this company in the past and was happy .
negative	not this time !
negative	the only_thing worse than my incomplete order was the customer_service i received after .
negative	i called and used their automated_response to request a call back 0 times and only received a call back once .
negative	i sent multiple_emails and they would respond by telling_me my order was delivered .
negative	when i finally did speak with someone they told me they could refund me for the order i didn_'_t receive or reprocess my order free of charge .
negative	free of charge ???
negative	i already paid he acted_like he was doing me this big favor by resending the order i never received !
negative	when i said i wanted a full_refund and i would return the shirts he said i would have to pay for shipping and handling .
negative	and then the phone disconnected .
negative	so i know have to waste more of my time calling back to get a refund !
negative	ridiculous !!
negative	!
negative	i had to make a change more then a month in advance it cost me $_00 + what a rip_off , i will not be using your service again .
negative	thanks for nothing !
negative	i booked for 0 days on big_bus_tour for me and my family of 0 .
negative	we only spent 0 whole days in london and because of big_bus_tour , our limited time was wasted waiting for the big_bus that took more than 00_minutes to arrive .
negative	hence we ended_up taking the tube instead .
negative	this site totally deceived us .
negative	said they had a part in stock and charged our credit_card .
negative	then , without so much as an explanation email or phone_call , refunded our credit_card .
negative	we wouldn_'_t have bothered to place an order if we didn_'_t know the part was available .
negative	shameful .
negative	i would not purchase anything_else from this company .
negative	i purchased a spa package and when purchased i was informed that the carrier would call to set_up a time and day for drop_off and set_up .
negative	not only did the carrier not call me and left a huge palet of boxes at the front of the office , but absolutely no help with carrying anthing in or setting_up .
negative	when i spoke with customer_service about this , i was informed that this " cost extra " which i wouldve been more than happy to pay , but didn_'_t because i was told it was already included .
negative	the facial / massage_bed that was purchased pretty_much came put_together other than the legs needing to be attached .
negative	once the bed was set_up ... it was horrible !!!
negative	the bed was leaned to one side more than the other and only got worse if you tried to adjust the position of the bed , which the latches to the bed did not work as well so we had to use a tool to even move the bed up and down .
negative	to make_matters worse as soon as a person weighing 000_+_lbs sits on the bed , the foot of the bed pops_up and it sounds as if its going to break with even that amount of weight on it .
negative	i would never put a client on this bed for many reasons but also for the simple fact that someone could easily fall off this bed and sue the company .
negative	the pkg also came with a trolley .
negative	the company sent me two of the same legs so it was not able to be put_together .
negative	upon having issues with both items opened from this pkg i decided to not attempt anything_else with the equipment sent until the company fixed everything .
negative	frankly i just wanted to return it , but when i spoke with customer_service regarding the equipment issues i was told to take a video and pictures of the issues and email it to them which at that time they would send it to another dept to have it evaluated .
negative	horrible customer_service for those who rely_on their equipment to make a living .
negative	i am in the process of hopefully getting everything resolved , but i do not recommend this company and do not see myself ever purchasing from them again .
negative	i ordered four different items from this web_site .
negative	they told me orginally they would ship out right_away but then changed their story when one of the items was on back order .
negative	i don_'_t understand_why they wouldn_'_t ship out the three other items and i didn_'_t feel_like waiting another two_weeks for my products so i canceled my order .
negative	i was told my account would be credited 0 - 0 business days .
negative	it has now been two_weeks and they have still not returned my money .
negative	when i called today i was told that they " forgot " process the return .
negative	hmmm ... great way of doing_business .
negative	i wonder_how many other people they have done this to .
negative	if i do not receive my money back in 0 - 0 business days i am going to call the bbb on them .
negative	they should not be in business .
negative	their customer_service reps are un - caring , insensitve , and rude .
negative	they also have a heavy accents so i can barely understand what their saying .
negative	i will never use priceline again .
negative	i booked a room with their " lowest_price guarantee ".
negative	i paid almost $_00 more than the hotel would have charged me if i had just walked in off the street .
negative	priceline is a joke !
negative	!
negative	ordered some auto_parts through amazon , after a month i get nothing .
negative	0 request '_s later they issue me a refund , only to get the refund wrong .
negative	they finally get the refund right , only now , they send totally different parts that i never ordered , in place of the parts that they never delivered in the first order .
negative	at_least they did not ship me an assault rifle like they did to someone in dc .
negative	i went into the hotel website to make a reservation , and , unknown to me , my call flipped over to a reservation center .
negative	when in the world did this become the way reservations are made without the knowledge of the person making the reservation .
negative	we have made reservations for years direct with the hotel and it is appalling to learn that this type of call immediately goes to someone_who doesn_'_t identify themselves as someone other than the hotel and they charge your card immediately ... hotels charge the card when you check in which is what my expectation was .
negative	now i have to go through a horrendous process while they credit my card .
negative	i will_definitely never use expedia for anything and will inform everyone i know in hopes they don_'_t either .
negative	in the future , if i cannot make a reservation direct with the hotel by phone through their reservations department , i won_'_t book with them either .
negative	i was in hotels for 00 years to include being a general_manager so i am aware of how a reservation should work .
negative	i asked that this be mailed to a different address than mine .
negative	you sent it to me instead
negative	terrible , so_far .
negative	i have yet to see my order - 00 - 00000000 - i still have not received it yet !
negative	i have a volkswagen jetta and my parts are hard to find .
negative	so i decided to google my part numbers .
negative	i was in a hurry to get the parts so i paid an extra few_dollars to have it in one to two_days .
negative	i choose stock wise , paid $_00 . 00 on a sunday and didnt get the part until friday the expected delivery day was tuesday .
negative	tried to call them and got no one but an automatic service about my email not someone personally calling to explain the situation if there was one at all .
negative	have not received product
negative	i have ordered 0 times from this site but will never do it again !
negative	they do not deliver in the time they promise !
negative	i have always had a po_box but i got a call today that said fedx had my order but did not deliver to po boxes !
negative	would have been nice if they had told me that they could not deliver my order to my po_box when i ordered .
negative	i had always had my orders sent to a p o box !
negative	i had to go to extra trouble to pick_up my order instead of it being delivered to me !
negative	there are many sites that have the same products and they are much more reliable and honest !
negative	first of all , i left my car unlocked for convenience for the employee , and after over an_hour wait ( past the appt time ), we went back to the car to get the receipt .
negative	as we were standing there , the horn started going off spastically !
negative	sure enough , i stepped back and the employee came around the corner still pushing the alarm button .
negative	i mean maybe one or two honks if u need to find the car , but he gave having an alarm a whole new meaning !
negative	!
negative	after he drove the car into the bay , we witnessed him fully rifling thru the glove box and center console for close to about a minute .
negative	when he finally noticed us standing there , he looked like a deer in headlights , called over another employee and asked him a question about brakes .
negative	after comparing to management , we were told he was looking for air ride ( in the console )!!!
negative	immediately canceled appt for front tires for next week , we will_definately be going elsewhere .
negative	i was not contacted for over 0_weeks about a question on my order and then when i called and had to leave a message to have someone call me back ( which is ridiculous that no one answered the phone ) the person_who called me back insisted i didn_'_t get the info i put on my order about a font change from their website / order system and kept basically calling me a liar .
negative	after about 0 minutes of going back and forth on the issue , i finally just asked to credit my account and cancel my order because i was not feeling good about ordering from them at this point .
negative	it is ashame because i really liked the custom tags i wanted to order .
negative	i would be very careful when ordering from this on - line company !
negative	i went on the website , they had my product there , i ordered it , then my order was cancelled .... no call just an_email .
negative	so i ordered it again ... cancelled it again .
negative	i finally called the customer_service phone_number and got a not so polite woman on the phone that rudely told me that my phone is old and that the battery i want to buy is not in stock .
negative	so why is it on the website as if it is ???
negative	hello ?
negative	i was very disappointed in the product i received .
negative	it was not what i had ordered .
negative	i had ordered a " decorative line border " locket with text block engraving on the back .
negative	what was sent to me was the " greek key " design with text script engraving .
negative	also , it stated that the locket was 0in by 0 . 00in but the width alone was barely . 00in !
negative	it is very disappointing that i spent $_00 to receive the wrong product .
negative	there is no excuse for this , as the site clearly_states which locket is which and the catalogid on my order detail matches the one on the site for the " decorative line border ."
negative	i suppose it was foolish of me to even give this company my business after i read the reviews online , but i figured i would give them a chance .
negative	and when i emailed them about all of this , i didn_'_t even get a response with an_apology , let_alone one that tried to make amends .
negative	honestly , how hard is it to pay_attention to detail ?
negative	i '_m thoroughly frustrated and disappointed in this company .
negative	the product is still acceptable enough to give as a gift - but to pay close to $_000 and have almost every_detail neglected , and for it to be on the wrong item entirely , and to not even get an_apology ?
negative	i have lost all faith in this company .
negative	i gave them a shot in spite of what i read online , but they only proved those critics correct .
negative	now i am unfortunately just another critic .
negative	but what do they care , they got their money ...
negative	pathetic
negative	im very disappointed in your service .
negative	you accepted my shipping addresses i gave and then went_ahead and sent my package all the way to buffalo ny to fed_x i never use fed_x as its too far away from my home to go .
negative	i tried to talk to someone on the phone about my plight and he was a snotty uncaring man that did nothing to help me except tell me to phone fedx and clear it up myself !
negative	i replied , " you could at_least phone them and correct the problem seeing as your company was the one who caused it " well he told me that fedx had all_sorts of drop_off spots in niagara falls ny .
negative	when i talked to fedx the girl said that they didnt and i had to use a physical_address instead of my pobox address .. my sick hubby had to drive all the way to buffalo to pick_up a lousy bag of cat_food !!
negative	i will never use your lying web - site with its nasty phone servers again .
negative	what kind of a company only uses one shipping provider anyway ?
negative	most reputable web sites give you a choice of postal shippers ---- not just one !
negative	how about usps or ups ???
negative	just as we should have more than one choice for paying we should also have a choice of how we want to ship !!!
negative	get with the programme or you will loose a lot more customers than just me !!
negative	!
negative	due to the weather , i had to cancel my business trip to d . c .
negative	however , i had purchased insurance for my flight , so i was happy that i would be able to be reimbursed , or be able to use the flight at a later time .
negative	however , when i tried to make flight arrangements two_weeks_later , i was put on hold for over 00_minutes , and then , once i was finally put on the line with an agent , he said he couldn_'_t hear me and he hung_up on me .
negative	during that time period , the flight and hotel that i was trying to book went up over $_000_dollars .
negative	i booked it , and i still am out $_000 for the flight that i bought insurance for .
negative	to put it mildly , i am not pleased .
negative	i recently made reservations and needed to change them within 00_hours .
negative	i was on hold for over an_hour when an agent finally answered .
negative	during the few_minutes we spoke , she had to place me on hold several_times .
negative	the last time she put me on hold , i waited another 00_minutes and then the line was disconnected .
negative	i called the next_morning and , after being on hold for 00_minutes , did speak with an agent who was helpful .
negative	i understand there was travel issues in the east ; however , 0 hours is too long to wait to speak with someone .
negative	i will never use travelocity again .
negative	i have made an order with this company and they have taken the payment but will not send my order !!
negative	after 0_weeks the order status remains on ' pending ' without_any explanation .
negative	have written a bunch of e_- mails to this company without reply !
negative	!
negative	company sucks .
negative	the wrong room was booked and then the only way to fix it was to cancel , then it takes up to 00 days to get a refund ?
negative	i ended_up calling the hotel_directly and got the right room , at the same rate !
negative	i would give you a lower number if possible !
negative	i place an order 000000000 . was told items were in stock and available .
negative	kept checking back - to find out today ( the day i should be getting it ) it is back ordered .
negative	it stills says processing never has said back ordered !
negative	i would have cancelled my order and ordered someone_else .
negative	which is probably why it doesnt say that it is not available !!!
negative	terrible and deceitful service
negative	everything about this trip was a disaster .
negative	we were sent in the wrong direction on the green line .
negative	so we wasted more than 0 / 0 hour before we could even get onto the blue line .
negative	when we got off at a stop ( it is , after all , hop - on , hop - off ), we couldn_'_t find space on another bus for quite a while .
negative	so when we did , we decided we ' d better not get off again .
negative	however , big_bus foiled us again , by suddenly announcing that the driver had completed his hours and evreybody had to get off -- when we then waited another 0 / 0 hour for a replacement bus .
negative	when we wanted to get off again , we took a taxi back to our hotel .
negative	waste of money and very annoying .
negative	great products , socially inept staff .
negative	didn_'_t appreciate the comments about wives and women while i stood next to my husband .
negative	it was offensive ...
negative	especially as we were spending our money at your store .
negative	had we not been in severe need of a the lap_top , we would have immediately left your store .
negative	will we recommend the store , depends on an_apology and if there will be change .
negative	i have ordered some wooden_blinds and i was first told i would get them 0 days after i ordered them , so i booked the day off , i then was told on the working day before that they wasnt go to be me until the tuesday , so i booked the tuesday off of work , and i have sat in all day waiting for them and i thought something was right , so i phoned up and i have found out that they gave_me the wrong day and that i will get them tomorrow , but this isnt for sure as it is an ' eta '.
negative	i have now used up 0 days holiday waiting in for my blinds .
negative	i am really not happy about this .
negative	i am rather upset about this as i was planning to buy a lot of blinds from this company , but i cant take 0 days holiday everytime i decorate a room .
negative	ordered an outdoor waterproof jacket .
negative	on receipt the large jacket had been screwed_up into a ball and stuffed into a bag which was far too small for it .
negative	it was really really creased .
negative	it was made of a fabric which can '_t be ironed .
negative	the creases still_haven_'_t dropped out .
negative	i kept it because my daughter really wanted it for school but i think it was extremely poor service .
negative	contacted superdry customer_services and got the usual fatuous not really bothered reply .
negative	the wallpaper is charged at full price .
negative	but is reject .
negative	white marks are random all over the paper .
negative	it does not state reject or faulty but is sold at full price .
negative	disappointed .
negative	it was for my daughters 00th_birthday to decorate her bedroom .
negative	beware , beware beware .
negative	poor service sent the wrong part and can not reach anyone .
negative	tried several emails and everything and still_haven_'_t heard_anything .
negative	i paid for a part and they shipped me a completely different part .
negative	i booked 0 return luggage included flights to coolangatta from act .
negative	to be first quoted 000 . aud then it jumped to 000 . aud then when i checked my account to discover they had taken 000 . aud .
negative	it wasn_'_t an easy process to purchase online .
negative	then when we got to the airport i was told i would be charged 00 . aud per bag each plane change . which made the flight cost a further 000 . aud .
negative	totally unreal price .
negative	i willnot be recommending bravo_fly ever .
negative	several days ahead , i made a motel reservation for myself , my husband , and our daughter .
negative	i specified ground_floor , since my husband ( 00 years old ) does not balance as well as he used to , and i ( 00 ) have much difficulty on stairs .
negative	we arrived at the motel to find that they had no record of our reservation , for which i had printed out the specifications and the reservation number .
negative	the front_desk_clerk told me this was the third such incident this evening .
negative	being too tired to look for another motel , we accepted the only room left , on the second floor , with one bed ; the motel personnel brought in a roll - a - way bed and discounted our rate .
negative	our daughter was able to assist us up the stairs and carry our_luggage .
negative	we certainly won_'_t ever use expedia again !
negative	love the item that i purschase !
negative	shipping took_forever though .
negative	and cusomer service rep doesn_'_t have the idea how long my item will arrive .
negative	christmas_present that became a new year ' present .
negative	very dissapointed !
negative	if no one contacts me soon i will contact my bank and try to get my money back and never , never shop with pure_health again
negative	hi , disappointed that the cancellation and sms charges were not obvious .
negative	they should be selected rather_than added .
negative	your company lie to people to get their business .
negative	i ask someone 0 times
negative	if i could cancel without fees was told yes .
negative	less then 00hrs later i cancelled was told there was a 000 . 00 cancelation_fee .
negative	after fighting with the people on the phone was told it was waived no fee .
negative	that was 0_weeks_ago .
negative	i checked my credit_card today and the entire 000 . 00 was charged to my card .
negative	i have called my credit_card to stop payment .
negative	i will never use your company again .
negative	you just lie and take_advantage of people .
negative	and it would be nice if you could hire people you can at_least understand on the phone .
negative	i '_m sure it is just part of taking_advantage of people .
negative	i ordered the tick collar for my 00_lb dog and within hours of wearing it , she began to become very lethargic and spacy .
negative	for some_reason , i didn_'_t immediately make a connection with having put on the tick collar .
negative	her condition lasted about 00_hours , and then she became better .
negative	i discussed what happened to her with our vet when i took one of our cats in for a dental , soon after this .
negative	my vet asked if it had a particular chemical called amitraz in it .
negative	she said that some dogs have bad reactions to it .
negative	she said it was sometimes used in mange treatments , and that was her experience with it .
negative	i checked , and indeed , the drug amitraze is in this collar .
negative	maybe a bigger dog would not be affected , but it truly made made charlie anne very sick .
negative	one of the products i received didn_'_t work and the other i got the wrong quality .
negative	to anybody thinking of using the services of this company ....
negative	please don_'_t !
negative	i placed an order online on 00 july , paying in advance via sagepay .
negative	an_email_confirmation was received immediately and that was the first and only contact i have managed to achieve with this company .
negative	the telephone_number supplied in the confirmation rings incessantly , with no scope for leaving a message .
negative	emails receive no response and although sagepay inform me that they contacted the company , i am not aware that they received any answer , either .
negative	the address supplied in herne bay , kent is a private house , which i have seen for myself as i live not far away .
negative	i did not call in at the address as i was waiting for the " reasonable time " ( 00 days ) to elapse before cancelling the order .
negative	a recorded delivery letter to the address , informing the company of my intention to cancel the order under the sale of goods act and the distance_selling regulations , has received no response , but has not been returned by the post_office , so was presumably signed for .
negative	to add to the mystery , the company has not actually taken the payment via sagepay and will not now be able to do so .
negative	i have now cancelled the order , am obviously without the goods ordered and have paid for a recorded delivery letter with no means of recouping the cost .
negative	i shall now try to persuade sagepay to kick this company into touch as one of their merchants and am enlisting my local citizens ' advice bureau '_s help .
negative	they intend to ask kent county council '_s trading_standards department to investigate britishsupermarketworldwide . com to ascertain whether the company is trading according to the relevant regulations .
negative	in the meantime , please avoid this company like the plague !
negative	ps to trustpilot : what is the point of insisting on a minimum number of stars in a case like this ?
negative	one star out of five is a score of 00 %: quite ludicrous !
negative	my fiancé purchased me valentines_day flowers .
negative	he purchased them on february_00th for valentines_day .
negative	not only were they not delivered on valentines_day , but every time we attempt to get_ahold of the company we are hung_up on by both the automated_system and the people that work there .
negative	my flowers were finally delivered today ( 0 / 00 ) and not only were they dead , broken and frozen ... but the balloon didn_'_t even come with a stick .
negative	i am truly horrified by this company .
negative	i took multiple photos .
negative	i suggest no one ever use this company .
negative	my order number 000000 .
negative	my order was shipped out 0 days_later after i called for the id number was then sent to my email , the representative told me i should receive my shoes at the end of next week so i waited by the end of the week there was no shoes so my husband called and was told the order never shipped out because that shoe was not in stock .
negative	so was we going to get our money back ?
negative	no .
negative	until we called .
negative	never again will i buy from amiclubwear .
negative	the parcel was not delivered and after a week i had to make a number of calls just to find out that it is waiting for me in the local post_office .
negative	no one left me a delivery attempt note , nor gave_me a call nor live me a note that i need to pick_up the parcel from the post_office .
negative	i could not pick_up the parcel before i go away
negative	paypal got too big for their britches .
negative	due to a comment a purchaser put in a payment to me , they closed my account and held my money for 0 months .
negative	this after my perfect account for many years .
negative	i would not recommend them to anyone .
negative	i had a full trip booked with travelocity leaving 0 / 00 at 00 : 00_pm to san_juan puerto_rico .
negative	our check - in date at hotel was 0 / 00 , in the morning at gran melia resort .
negative	we also booked ground_transportation to and from the hotel / airport .
negative	this transportation was cancelled , notice i received via_email , no phone_call .
negative	i then had to book a rental_car , there was no other shuttle transportation available .
negative	for reasons , i was not given .
negative	on 0 / 00 our flight with jetblue was cancelled .
negative	we were pulling up in the airport at approximately 0 : 00_pm .
negative	getting dropped_off and our transportation departed .
negative	we received the call as we were walking in to the airport .
negative	i did not recognize the number , therefore i did not answer .... no message was left for me on my voicemail .
negative	i then realized after checking the flight monitor that our flight was cancelled .
negative	we spent several hours approximately 0 on the phone with travelocity while in the airport .
negative	the first representative put me on hold for 00_minutes while checking with jetblue representatives on available flights .
negative	i was standing at the jetblue counter and told the travelocity representative this however she refused to believe me and refused to speak directly to the jetblue representative directly in front of me .
negative	therefore , i was on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	i was then told that there were no flight availability on jetblue sooner_than tuesday 0 / 00 arriving in san_juan @ 0 : 00_pm .
negative	our flight departing san_juan was on 0 / 00 at approximately 0 : 00 a . m . for the amount of money we spent on this trip i did not find this comparable to spend 0 days plus a run_around on transportation / flights .
negative	i asked the travelocity representative for assistance with finding a more feasible flight .... she told me that i could cancel my 0 / 00 flight and check - in with representatives at different airlines within the airport to find a flight - which i would have to pay for and wait for a reimbursement on the cancelled 0 / 00 flight .
negative	now this is at approximately 00 - 00 : 00 at night , the airport was pretty_much shut_down except for the jetblue counter .
negative	i asked the travelocity representative to please help me find a flight , also asking how much the reimbursement would be from jetblue on the cancelled 0 / 00 flight .
negative	she said she didn_'_t know " if " jetblue would reimburse and as she was about to once again make a call to check with jetblue , we were cut_off or she hung_up on me - after over an_hour !!
negative	!
negative	i then called travelocity representative back , going through the same procedure and willing her to help me .
negative	she was very rude as i admit my frustration tolerance was not up to par .
negative	i told her to please check records on the previous call .
negative	i asked for reimbursement on the days missed at the hotel if we were to take the flight on 0 / 00 she could not give me an answer after put on hold once again for her to check with the hotel .
negative	she put me on hold for quite_sometime , i then asked her to speak to a superior representative and was put on hold once again for approximately 00_minutes .
negative	after a long deliberation with the superior representative and several hours of hold time over several minutes of talk time with a representative , we cancelled our entire trip .
negative	devastated and told we would have to wait 0_weeks for a reimbursement .
negative	this is in my mind unacceptable service .
negative	i am a massachusetts educator on vacation for school break .
negative	i work hard to give to others .
negative	i am a counselor and coach , teacher and friend to a school of over 0000 students .
negative	i look_forward to my time off to regroup , release and relax .
negative	coming from massachusetts i am always worried of weather_conditions when traveling , travelocity told me that the cancelled flight was a weather issue , while jetblue told me it was a crew issue .
negative	i was given the run_around during very late hours .
negative	after all was done , we were stranded at the airport 0 hours from home with no transportation home .
negative	in my opinion this was a horrible experience all around .
negative	i am an understanding and patient person , but this pushed limits .
negative	my husband , taking the week off of work , lost hours at his job .
negative	we were given little to no options or help / flexibility from your travelocity representatives .
negative	we are devastated and disappointed and will never use travelocity as a means for travel_arrangements in the future !
negative	i thank_you for the opportunity to right this review .
negative	i already gave my opinion above .
negative	i '_m not happy with my purchase .
negative	i ordered a navy dress and received a blue dress .- not a navy dress
negative	they are fine to use until you have a problem !
negative	read other review sites and you '_ll soon get the picture .
negative	their returns_policy is against your consumer rights .
negative	your rights override anything they puts in their own terms and conditions .
negative	the item they sent me was faulty and yet they wanted me to pay for my delivery back to them and were refusing to refund the original postage .
negative	after many emails back and forth ( very slow in reply ) and after quoting them my rights , they finally agreed to a full_refund .
negative	in the end after another month they deined ever receiving my returned item and so i got nothing .
negative	not a replacement item , no refund and had paid for the return postage .
negative	absolute joke - will never use again .
negative	please_note - when i had bought previous items from them everything had been fine - but ask yourself if it is worth the risk ?
negative	believe me , it became more about the principle rather_than the money in the end .
negative	frustrating doesn_'_t even begin to cover it !
negative	like i said .... search on other review sites and you '_ll see the same comments .
negative	wish i had read them first !

negative	i ordered a book that was 0 volumes , and when i ordered it from bookbyte it said it was a 0 volume set .
negative	when i received it in the mail , which took much longer_than any other site i '_ve rented from , i only received one of the volumes .
negative	i tried to find a number to call , but the only number available is to corporate and they told me they couldn_'_t help me .
negative	what type of company doesn_'_t have a customer_service number to call ?
negative	so i had to email bookbyte to tell them of my problem .
negative	instead of trying to remedy the situation , they just refunded my money and said they didn_'_t have the other volume .
negative	they shouldn_'_t say they are renting a 0 volume set if they only have one volume .
negative	i had to take time out of my day to mail back the rental and find a replacement .
negative	if they had specified that it was only one of the volumes , i wouldn_'_t have rented it in the first place .
negative	we ordered tickets to go to las_vegas and stay at circus circus .
negative	the fine_print was so hard to read and their were surprise charges left out of the brief synopsis .
negative	what was supposed to be relaxing was nearly ruined by all of this .
negative	had it not been for free or cheap game play we would not have been able to have fun at all .
negative	i bought furniture on buy now pay later , i paid two_days before the due date but got charged alot of interest as they say it wasnt processed to my account til the day after the bnpl .
negative	i complained to customer_service and asked my account to be put on hold until this dispute was resolved , they then charged me late payment fees .
negative	i told them i have complained to financial ombusman , trading_standards , watchdog , citizens advice etc and they have said it will take between 0 - 0_weeks to reply .
negative	very told me i have to pay even_though my account is in dispute and i have been a good customer for years always paying on time .
negative	i am disgusted and feel totally ripped_off and would warn anyone thinking of buying on bnpl go with argos or another company as very is terrible .
negative	am so unhappy about my recent order .
negative	it took more than four days to notify me that some of my items were out of stock .
negative	i placed the order on the 00th_october and i still_haven_'_t receive it .
negative	when i called the customer_service wasn_'_t nice .
negative	am so upset now .
negative	terrible customer_service .
negative	obviously don_'_t care if the customer is happy .
negative	i could have been a great customer for many years to come , but you blew it .
negative	misleading sites .
negative	books not described correctly .
negative	workbooks listed as " study guides " in small_print - easy to miss , listed with wrong picture , listed along side the other textbooks .
negative	easily to mistake for a textbook .
negative	why is it when i searched the isbn_number for my textbook , the workbook came up ??
negative	no wonder i accidentally purchased the wrong thing .
negative	because you falsely listed the book in the wrong section and made me pay for return shipping .
negative	it ’_s not true .
negative	i took them up on their offer of “ guaranteed booking or your money back ”, i paid £_000 . 00 in march_0000 .
negative	after a year with them i have not had any bookings , so i emailed several_times asking for my money back and got no response .
negative	i even posted a message on their facebook_page , which has now mysteriously disappeared and some one responded saying that they had been trying , unsuccessfully , to contact me .
negative	huh !
negative	my email address and phone_number is on all my messages and on the owners rentals website .
negative	i doubt i will ever see my money !
negative	they are crooks !
negative	your facebook advertisement made it seem as if we would get 0 bullysticks for . 00_cents for a limited time and if we didn_'_t the offer would be revoked .
negative	i hurriedly ordered the " sticks " on my iphone and didn_'_t notice till after the transaction was completed that the offer was actually for . 00_cents for " each " bullystick and your limit was five .
negative	the facebook promo was very misleading and i would have never accepted that offer had i know i would be paying $ 0 . 00 in shipping fees for a . 00 cent item that turned_out to be only one half of the orginial retail size .
negative	i will not recommend this product and i will warn all my facebook contact whenever i spot anymore pet . flow promotions .
negative	i ordered a specific type of hair , but got a horrible batch !!!!
negative	as soon as i washed it , it tangled so bad and was matted to the point where i was unable to comb it out !
negative	i emailed you all for a refund and you kept ignoring what i was saying and gave_me the run_around for weeks until i stopped trying !
negative	waste of $_000 !
negative	i will never spend my money on you all again .
negative	the product i ordered , vinco '_s transdermapro cream , comes in a tub and is 0 % progesterone .
negative	this is what the website pictures .
negative	the product i received came in a tube and is 0 % progesterone .
negative	when i called in , i was not satisfied with the response .
negative	all i got out of the conversation is that vinco has switched to this new version of the product .
negative	i was given no warning of this or asked if the substitute product would be alright .
negative	very mediocre customer_service .... no apology or acknowledgement that the wrong product was sent .
negative	in my opinion , this was false_advertising .
negative	anna keah
negative	run away , quickly !!!
negative	they confirmed for the wrong date .
negative	i wrote 0 emails , called the next_day ( i had scheduled late at night -- my fault ).
negative	the representative said that they could change the reservation for a higher_rate -- would i agree ?
negative	i did , since i needed the hotel room for that night .
negative	i agreed , especially after i was informed that there may not be a room available since there was a shortage ( their website stated that only one room remained at the hotel i requested ).
negative	she would call the hotel and call me back on my cell in 00 - 00_minutes .
negative	she asked if i had contacted the hotel ; at that point , i had not .
negative	after waiting two hours and not receiving a return call , i called the hotel_directly .
negative	they confirmed that i had a reservation for that evening .
negative	imagine my surprise when i entered the hotel and was told my reservation was made by expedia , not easytobook .
negative	i had not contacted expedia about any reservations ( ever !)
negative	also , imagine my surprise when my credit_card was charged by easytobook for over $_00 when my credit_card receipt from the hotel was $_00 .
negative	as i said , run away .
negative	i will never use this service and will encourage all of my friends and business associates to find another source .
negative	very very disappointed have ordered 0 garment steamers none has come raspberry cotona tabs and patches sliming chocolate nothing has come .
negative	the only_thing that has come is a tin opener and that broke the first time l used it went in the bin , very reluctant to order anything as nothing arrives l always pay pay pall at time of order there is always money in my account l cannot understand who '_t is going on and wonder is it only me that is not getting who '_t thay order l wonder is this any way to run a company l had a company befor l retierd and never treated my customers like this and l was dealing_with people all the time it would be nice to to get an answer .
negative	if you receive the part you order there are no_issues .
negative	however , i am_currently dealing_with an_issue where i was sent used ( core ) calipers instead of new or remanufactured as ordered .
negative	i '_ve been trying to remedy this situation for a week now with no results as of yet .
negative	you are not able to contact anyone by phone .
negative	issues are dealt through e_- m . read there fine_print before ordering .
negative	order at your own risk .
negative	i have to this day never received my order as the delivery company are rubbish !!!!
negative	please boohoo start using a better courier service so i can start ordering again :-((((
negative	beware !!!
negative	check the trustpilot reviews and you will see there are some suspiciously good reviews and for approximately every four of those , there is a shocker !
negative	i have just bought a bathroom from them and sadly looked at the reviews after my purchase .
negative	the bath , cistern and sink had to be replaced bacause they arrived broken .
negative	the quality of the loo_seat and the bath panels is terrible and the last job for the plumber was to fit the loo and the cistern filler didn_'_t work and we had to go and buy a new one .
negative	when you call them , the telephone_number is a premium line - if you do go_ahead and buy from them , my advice is to ask them to call you back .
negative	it takes_forever to get through to customer_services , but the sales department pick the phone up after one ring .
negative	complaints to the owner of the business are ignored .
negative	if i was you , i would save up a bit longer - you get what you pay for .
negative	i ordered a 00_lb_bag of friskies for cats - it was $_00 . 00 ...
negative	i have five cats and four dogs - my son said i paid too much as it was $_00 . 00 at krogers and less at
negative	i brought a sixteen pound_bag of friskes for cats for $_00 . 00 from you - i have five cats and four dogs - living on social_security - i found most of your prices reasonable and no sales_tax and delived to my home is convenient .
negative	my son said i paid too much as it is sold at krogers for $_00 . 00 and walmart for less .
negative	i bet him $ 0 . 00 dollars he was wrong as there could not be that much of a price difference .
negative	on senior_citizens day he took me shopping as normal and then showed me the bag - he was correct plus i would have gotten an extra 00_%_off .
negative	i called your company and told them that there was too much of a difference in price - even a $ 0 . 00 credit would have made me happy .
negative	i worked in sales for 00 years and i never lost a customer - and i worked with million dollar contracts and i treated the person_who may have only bought $_000 the same as a bigger customer .
negative	never lose a customer for bad service especially when you are wrong as that could impact a hundred more customers .... would i recommend you no ... angies list is a great equalizer - we live in an electronic society remember that .... you lost five different orders due to that policies and believe me bulk buying does not impress me as an excuse especially when that is that much of a price difference ............
negative	extremely disappointed with kwik_fit who promised much and delivered little on my purchase of tyres for a home fitted service .
negative	i booked online for a time to suit me and received a call a few hours_later to confirm the tyres would be fitted on the day and time i had booked .
negative	great !
negative	i then re - arranged my schedule to ensure i would be home for the allotted_time and someone could pick my kids up .
negative	then the night before i got another call from kwik_fit dispatcher (!)
negative	saying they could not do it on the agreed scheduled and confirmed time but instead would offer a different appointment at a time to suit them from 0 til 0 . 00_pm a day later !
negative	this is completely_unacceptable and i was given no_explanation for this complete and utter rubbish service other than for this new guy saying that the person_who had initially called me earlier had no_idea about their schedule and her confirmation that the appointment would take place meant nothing and could not be relied_upon !
negative	i felt totally and utterly shafted as obviously kwik_fit had already taken my money and refused to refund it to me so i could go elsewhere .
negative	rubbish and i will never use them again and am making sure i tell_everyone i know about the completely rubbish , unreliable and untrustwoirthy service .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	go to halfords who i have used before and only did not use on this occassion beacause the initial confirmed dates offered by kwik_fit were more convenient to me .
negative	obviously this turned_out to be a complete lie and fabrication of any availability they actually had or they just picked and choosed whose appointments they fulfilled and decided for themselves when they do the appointments irrespective of the date or time you have booked .
negative	avoid kwik_fit .
negative	i ordered a part from partsgeek and it was the wrong part .
negative	i do not know if it was my fault or the fault of the parts dept there .
negative	however , the return process with this company is a nightmare .
negative	they don_'_t put a packing_slip in with the part so there is no way to tell if they sent the correct_part or not !
negative	then to return the item , is an_absolute joke !
negative	they claim they have to send me an_rma form but i have yet to see one .
negative	each time i try to contact them , i get a response that " a representative will be with me in 00_hours "....
negative	this is going on now for about 0 days !
negative	i still have not received an " rma " form to return the freaking part !
negative	bottom_line : if you think the prices are good and that you might save a few_dollars - wrong !!
negative	just go to your local parts store and pay the full price .
negative	at_least they will return the part if they make a mistake !
negative	i had an item to be collected for return , they did not collect .
negative	rescheduled , they did not collect .
negative	i phoned and waited 00_mins ( at my expense ) i was informed the wait time would be 00_minutes .
negative	i was told that < private_data_removed_> from complaints would return my call in a minute , after 0 hours i went out .
negative	i e_- mailed a complaint , no reply .
negative	i phoned again , was told by < private_data_removed_> that the item would be collected by 0pm that night , it was collected at 0pm , i was also told that < private_data_removed_> would contact me the next_morning to confirm collection .
negative	that was00 days ago and yet again no phone_call , i do not hold out much hope .
negative	absolutely usless !!
negative	and all at my time and expense
negative	service ?
negative	what service !!!!!
negative	oh and i was told that they do not give compensation for phone_calls made at my expense even_though the problem was caused by yodel .
negative	i would not consider ordering again , quality of the shoes were horrible and so cheap !
negative	when they arrived , i tugged a little on the suade boots i ordered and they ripped !!!
negative	i guess i got what i paid for , but had initially thought that the products would be the same as those on <_external linke removed_> and would have the same quality .
negative	i learned my mistake and i will only be ordering from <_external linke removed_> from now on .
negative	called for reservations at a hampton_inn .
negative	was told could get me reservations at another nearby .
negative	i took that to mean a hampton .
negative	was quoted a price .
negative	i asked if an aarp_discount would make it cheaper .
negative	was told i was being given the cheapest price available .
negative	after all the credit details were taken i was given the address and it wasn_'_t a hampton it was a baymont inn .
negative	also when we arrived i found out i could have gotten it cheaper with aarp , but couldn_'_t then because i booked with reservation_counter .
negative	the place was a dump .
negative	we didn_'_t take showers because the bathroom was so bad , loose tiles , black on the grout , and so small you couldn_'_t turn_around .
negative	with 0 small_children and the late hour we stayed .
negative	but i felt tricked by reservation_counter .
negative	their web_site was extrtremely misleading .
negative	it looked like i was on hampton_inn '_s site and was calling the reservation number for hampton_inn .
negative	extremely angry and disappointed in this company .
negative	please be careful and don_'_t be misled like me .
negative	be sure what web_site you are on !!!!!

negative	i ordered for the first time a month or so ago .
negative	i ordered two dresses and three tops .
negative	i returned both the dresses and one of the tops .
negative	these three items had a total of 00_pounds but i was only refunded 00 .
negative	i do not know why 0 pounds was deducted and this is unacceptable .
negative	one evening i made a reservation for airplane flights with travelocity to fly cross_country , and got an_email_confirming those reservation .
negative	next_morning i got a call from travelocity telling_me that the flights were not confirmed , in fact there were no seats left on those flights , and that if i wanted a reservation for that same day it would cost me $_000 more , take it or leave it .
negative	i was on the phone for over an_hour , didn_'_t matter that i had a confirmation in hand - too bad .
negative	i never_heard of such a thing !!
negative	as i had to be somewhere on the given day , i eventually , after getting nowhere with various supervisors .
negative	made a new reservation that cost me about $_000 more than the original one .
negative	i am furious with you , hope to never make a reservation with travelocity again , and will bad - mouth your confirmed - but - not - really !
negative	service whenever_possible .
negative	i ordered 0 things and only got 0 .
negative	the thing i didn_'_t order had a r beside it but i don_'_t know what that means .
negative	your site is awful especially if i don_'_t get all the things i ordered
negative	we are having a family_reunion in nashville aug . 0 , 0 , and check out on the 00th .
negative	other members of our family have already made reservations so when i called to make reservations in order for us to have rooms close to each other , the woman at the booking desk gave_me a rate of $_000 . 00 per_night which was $_00 . 00 more than what was offered online .
negative	i told her that everyone else informed me they were being charged $_000 . 00 instead of the $_000 . 00 your clerk quoted .
negative	when i told her the online web_site quoted $_000 . 00 , she very sarcastically said to me " well , then you should book your room online then ".
negative	she sounded extremely_rude , not helpful at all , quite curt and didn_'_t give the opportunity to tell her of our other family_members who are being charged $_000 . 00 per_night .
negative	the only_reason i tried to book over the phone was to insure i could get a room near , or at_least on the same floor as my family_reunion members .
negative	for certain , my niece spoke with someone to make reservations for 0 families , so i know the $_000 . 00 rate is available by phone reservations .
negative	if everyone wasn_'_t staying at that hotel , believe me i would find a friendlier place to stay .
negative	i have since booked our room for aug . 0 , 0 and check out on the 00th .
negative	the on duty reservation desk_clerk was not good representation for you at all .
negative	i booked my cruise with travelocity with several promotions included .
negative	the person booking the reservation had a lot of trouble making the booking but after 0 phone_calls they finally supposedly had my reservation made .
negative	one of the promotions was a 0 day condo stay which required activation of a code through email precisely 00 days after booking .
negative	i waited 00 days never received an_email .
negative	as a matter of fact i never got an_email_confirmation of the reservation at all .
negative	i called the help desk at travelocity and they informed me the reservation was never completed because they believed the payment had not been made in full when in fact it was ( paid by credit_card ).
negative	they finally put the reservation through to norwegian cruise lines , but i still had yet to get a confirmation from travelocity .
negative	part of the promotions was $_00 in cruise credits .
negative	the day of the cruise departure on the ship , i found out that i would not receive the credit because i had never received an_email to fill_out a form .
negative	the agent on the phone could do nothing for me but claim to send me another email after they reviewed the audio tapes from my several conversations .
negative	they promised an_email by the end of my cruise , but to no surprise there was no follow_up email .
negative	i have no_intention of ever booking with travelocity again and i plan to make_sure everyone i know and work with knows what a terrible experience i '_ve had .
negative	i ordered an evisa card .
negative	i never got notification that the transaction went through .
negative	i called customer_service and they said the ordered was cancelled on their side , but she didn_'_t know why .
negative	i reordered the card and again never got notification either way .
negative	no money was ever debited from my account , so that was good .
negative	i just gave up .
negative	i tried_calling , i didn_'_t know you couldn_'_t speak to a representative , so i put a claim ticket in twice , and i didn_'_t receive a call back .. this is very bad for people that '_s spending their money ..!

negative	i recently booked a reservation with hostelworld . com for one night in a 0 bed female dorm at yha wellington .
negative	upon_arrival at the hostel they told me that there is no reservation .
negative	i am very disappointed that hostelworld . com didn ’ t make a reservation , but charged me for their service .
negative	i wrote several_times to hostelworld . com regarding what has happened .
negative	never got an answer or apology and still_waiting for repayment .
negative	on their website the they ask :
negative	why use hostelworld . com ?
negative	answer :
negative	00 , 000 properties , 000 countries
negative	000_% booking guarantee
negative	over 0 . 0 million guest reviews
negative	" 000_% booking guarantee " that is not true !!
negative	!
negative	i utilized the companies online tool to determine what part i need for my part ; based on their tool , i ordered part .
negative	the part did not fit and when used chipped part of car .
negative	i sent a note to customer_service , they issued a return rma .
negative	the return required for me to pay shipping , even_though , their software said it would work .
negative	so , long_story short , to ship part to me $ 0 . 00 to return part $ 0 . 00 .
negative	the part was only $ 0 ....
negative	worst deal and experience so_far with online shopping .
negative	thank_you for exactly the right part , easy to read and order website and fast service on delivery !
negative	i had a mechanic try and install the part that you sent and it doesn_'_t work at all .
negative	i have to pay him for his time for a part that is garbage .
negative	part ordered and paid for was lost in shipping several_attempts to contact company via_email and phone once i finally found a good #.
negative	attempted contact via phone was on hold 0 different times then line was disconnected every time .
negative	place email with no response attempted 0nd email and that was not allowed as i already had an open ticket .
negative	now i have my credit_card company involved so that i can get resolution .
negative	booked my first trip with expedia in october_0000 .
negative	my flight was cancelled i was on my way to the airport and i found out when i called the airline !!!
negative	expedia did not notify me !!
negative	!
negative	booked my second trip for may 00 0000 .
negative	both my departing flight and return flight was changed and once again i was not notified !!!
negative	!
negative	when i called their customer_service department to complain .
negative	i was transfered so many_times that i was hung_up on twice .
negative	when i called back the 0rd time a supervisor said sorry we regret loosing you as a customer but there '_s nothing i can do .
negative	i travel an average of 0 times per year for personal trips and 00 times for business .
negative	i will never book with expedia again !
negative	thanks for the horrible service !
negative	i had a terrible experience with bookit . com when i booked my vacation week !
negative	first of all , they overcharged my credit_card by charging my hotel twice !
negative	and then they actually placed a recurring charge on my account which my credit_card had to explain to me what it was -- bookit . com would charged my account every_month for the amount i paid for the hotel !
negative	not good !
negative	of course , my bank blocked bookit . com from charging my account !
negative	i noticed right_away and called them ( bookit . com ) and spoke with 0 different customer serivce rep -- none of them could find what was overcharged !
negative	one of them told me the overcharge wasn_'_t there anymore .
negative	the last customer rep blamed it on my credit_card company for allowing this extra_charge ?
negative	really ?
negative	your company charged my account not my bank ???
negative	( my bank did actually credit my account again ).
negative	i called the hotel and the airline just to be sure all was in order before i left for my vacation - the hotel couldn_'_t find my reservation cause bookit . com had misspelled my last name ?
negative	really ?
negative	when i booked , i got a 000 $ restaurant . com gc -- wasn_'_t able to use on vacation cause bookit . com never sent me a confirmation code ... great company huh ?
negative	so as of today which is almost 0 months after i initially booked -- i haven_'_t received any paperwork form my bank that the claim is closed ... i did speak with another rep from bookit . com after i wrote them a long email , and she said that my credit_card / bank had been refunded .
negative	she said it takes 0_weeks for the money to get to them ?
negative	really ?
negative	your company stole money out of my account ?
negative	and now we have to wait for the credit ?
negative	be careful -- pay the extra 00 - 000 $ with another company !
negative	i would not recommend anyone to book trough bookit . com !
negative	still_waiting for my next_day delivery or refund 00 days on !
negative	terrible experience and would never shop with them again .
negative	what a nightmare .
negative	travelocity ain '_t what it used to be . i stayed on hold so long it was like an endurance test .
negative	i sp0ke to one representative who couldn_'_t even speak_english .
negative	he was from a third world county ,.
negative	he got my entire reservation wrong .
negative	luckily when i didn_'_t get my email_confirmation i called adn foudn this out .
negative	again you suck .
negative	then i spoke to a second representative who spoke alittle bit better .
negative	however i have nooooo confidence in employees who can '_t speak good english .
negative	i will never use your site again ,.
negative	i got charged for amount on my visa immediately and it was not told to me .
negative	then hadd to change an get billed again .
negative	then was told would take a week to get my refund .
negative	i want my money now from my refund .
negative	i will steer everyone away from you and lesson_learned call the hotel_directly .
negative	you can email me at depageantgirl @ verizon ,. net
negative	i booked an expensive room in nyc , planning to spend the night with two adults and two children .
negative	the hotel informed me that no more than two people could be permitted in the room , and that only priceline customer_service could fix the problem ( by allowing their " king_room " with sofa_bed ).
negative	the other alternative of course was that i pay for an extra room at their exhorbitant price .
negative	i called priceline customer_service , which sounded_like a call_center in india , and after a long wait , they would do nothing more than read a passage to me saying that all rooms are nonrefundable .
negative	no service at all , just delay and unpleasantness .
negative	it is not okay when traveling to arrive at the hotel with tired children and find that you can not actually be permitted to stay in the room you already paid for .
negative	( fortunately , we found out before actually leaving home , but feel_cheated of quite a lot of money .)
negative	very very bad customer_service , administration stuck in the last century .
negative	to my detailed personal complaint i received a " copy / paste " terms and conditions - not even relating to my issues !
negative	they could not even be bothered reading the complaint !
negative	vowed to avoid , vowed to never recommend - vowed to warn people about a company that rips you off , and does not care about their business reputation or customers .
negative	my gripe is with city_link but booked through interparcel - appalling
negative	i ordered sunglasses 0_weeks_ago .
negative	i still don_'_t have them .
negative	there were problems with the delivery .
negative	i had tracked it & the address that they had given was incorrect therefore they couldn_'_t delivery it .
negative	i emailed the customer_service to say i hadn_'_t received them & explained the delivery company was given the wrong_address .
negative	the reply was that they had been sent .
negative	i emailed back again stating that i knew that & there was clearly a problem with the delivery .
negative	the response showed the address i had entered for them to be delivered ( which was correct ) & to contact the delivery company
negative	terrible customer_service .
negative	there is no rating this company .
negative	rating of 0
negative	i don_'_t care how long they have been in service
negative	web_site is a blanket cover
negative	shouldn_'_t be allowed to do_business
negative	the led_light was garbage .
negative	out of the 0 that i bought , not a single one of them worked .
negative	you might as well say that i threw away $ 0 . 00 that could have been put to good use .
negative	never use again
negative	i am writing this review to help future or current customers .
negative	trust me , do not use this company .
negative	there are so many other_sites that i trust to sell , rent , and buy textbooks from .
negative	textbooksrus claims that they did not quote me prices for my books before i mailed them all in .
negative	you have to be out of your mind to think that i would send in books that were worth ( literally ) hundreds of dollars if i wasn_'_t sure i would receive a check !
negative	isn_'_t that common_sense ?!
negative	then , textbooksrus says that they only received one or two of my books ... i sent about 00 .
negative	they just " didn_'_t receive " them .
negative	i do a ton of online shopping , sales , etc_., and have never had this happen .
negative	the few they received apparently " did not match " the ones i said i was sending .
negative	moral of the story : spread the word , this company is a joke and they will lose your books , say they didn_'_t quote you prices online that they did , and claim they never received your books .
negative	it makes me sick to think these bitches are making a profit .
negative	run , as fast as you can !
negative	i have not received my 0 loungers yet
negative	ordered a used workbook that is completely filled out already , book was supposed to be in " good " condition , i consider this to be " terrible " condition - why would i want a book ready totally used and filled out !?
negative	this should have been disclosed , would have never purchased .
negative	i inquired_about returning the $ 0 book and was told shipping , which came in at $_00 for me to send back , would not be reimbursed .
negative	looks like i '_m stuck with this awful product .
negative	will never order from this company again .
negative	dishonest disclosures and unreasonable customer_service .
negative	poor customer_service , to long for funds , to long on hold 0 hr , rush off the phone quickly , not ordering anymore from your company , have been a customer of yours for 0_yrs and have spent_thousands of dollars , still_waiting on a refund from a order on 00 / 0 / 00 refunds incorrect amounts
negative	i received a pair of earring in lieu of two_pairs of boots !
negative	what kind of operation are you running there !
negative	you are not available to answer your phones .
negative	one hour is to long to hear from you .
negative	you suck ,.
negative	our booking stated 0 hour 00_minutes approximately , for our transfer to agios nikalaos from heraklion .
negative	from boarding the coach to arriving at the resort it was 0 hours .
negative	the person meeting us at our accommodation had given us up and gone home .
negative	we had been travelling since 0 . pm the previous day with 0 children age 0 and 0 years .
negative	our confirmation of booking states ' they will be responsible for your smooth and efficient transportation from and to the airport ; we guarantee you will be arriving at your destination on time ' we did not risk the transfer back , and took the local bus instead .
negative	however | know of others who took the transfer back to the airport , the journey again took longer_than_expected and they had to rush at the airport .
negative	we contacted resorthoppa only to be told the time quoted was only and estimate .
negative	i contacted them further , several_times , requesting their abta number , but never received a reply .
negative	i have since contacted abta who tell me the company are not a member .
negative	i have taken advise from trading_standards and have written to resorthoppa again requesting a reply within 00 days .
negative	we will never use this company again .
negative	i ordered several_times from amniclubwear . com over the last few_years .
negative	usually there are no_problems .
negative	but this last time i ordered two items .
negative	they charged me for both but only received one of the items .
negative	i have all the emails and copy of the order .
negative	i tried 0 times in the last few_months to ask them to either send the item or receive a store credit for the balance or my money back .
negative	i was nice about it ..... not abusive in any way .
negative	i did not get any answer from any of my emails .
negative	it '_s been at_least 0 months now and i know they will never contact me .
negative	so now they '_ve lost a dedicated customer ..... over $_00 . 00 .
negative	all they needed to do was reply to my emails and try to resolve it .
negative	do not order from them if for no other reason that communication is non_- existent .
negative	it truly was the worst_experience .
negative	reservations were made at the wrong hotel .
negative	to cancel , it would take 00_hours to credit back my credit_card .
negative	correct reservation was never able to be made .
negative	i have to wait and see what damage was done to my credit_card .
negative	all total , they made 0 cancellations and no successful reservation .
negative	poor communications , slow in refunding as item unavailable despite_being on website and able to purchase .
negative	attitude poor on the telephone .
negative	will not buy again from this company
negative	i acquired my reservations through_expedia ( unbeknown to me that i was not talking to someone with the hotel ) and prepaid the expense but upon_arrival did not have the reservation requested nor could i get it , nor could i receive a refund , nor could i contact anyone with expedia to solve the problem … therefore i won_'_t ever do_business with expedia again ( knowingly ) and i will tell_everyone i can my experience !
negative	i was almost afraid to walk to my room , the grass was calf high , swimming_pool had not been used in forever , had a cover and chairs on top , the building was falling_apart and had not had anything done to it since it was built , microwave had food stains inside , mold in frig , i walked out as soon as i could call and cancel .
negative	this hotel should be taken off the list !!
negative	opened the door and could not stand the smell .
negative	however , the lady at the desk was pleasant and the girl who checked on me was nice , i guess they were wondering_if the room was ok ...... not !!!!
negative	the hotel i requested had a room when i called direct , so that will be my next route .
negative	they did say they were going to credit my card ..... sure hope that happens !!!
negative	the lady that helped_me from the reservation company was very nice .
negative	i ordered bottles over a week a go and they are not here
negative	their book app sucks .
negative	doesn_'_t work right .
negative	selected a flight and after_submitting it put me in the wrong flight .
negative	had to call and get it resolved .
negative	then they charged me twice on flight .
negative	told me it takes 00 to 00 days to remove extra_charge .
negative	they do not try to help their customer .
negative	go elsewhere .
negative	i will be brutally honest .
negative	booking my hotel was no problem but when it came to changing my reservation it was a nightmare .
negative	i went to my account with my reservation details where i should have been able to change my reservation from 0 rooms to 0 rooms .
negative	no_matter_how many_times i refreshed the website or hit the buttons to change it , nothing happened .
negative	so then out of frustration i tried to cancel my reservation by hitting the cancellation button ..... many_times .... again nothing happened .
negative	the next_day i called their customer_service .... not much_better .
negative	the connection was terrible and because the reservation technically went through_expedia my customer_service person had to call them and call me back to cancel one of my rooms .
negative	this only took a few_minutes but i never received an_email receipt or confirmation code .
negative	the next_day i look at my account and it still has me listed as being reserved for 0 rooms .
negative	so now i try calling back .... and after calling about 00 times with no answer or answering_machine to leave a message i just went straight to the source and called expedia .
negative	expedia took_care of my immediately and sent me confirmation code and email .
negative	will never use this service again .
negative	and the nightmare continues .
negative	a week after being promised a full_refund i still had not received it and decided to call easybook again .... kill me now .
negative	when you call easybook not only do you have to wait forever but you have to listen to the most god awful sound while waiting .
negative	it sounds like a broken alarm clock .
negative	after waiting for ten_minutes to finally talk to someone i was answered by a girl who couldn_'_t hear me due to a bad connection .
negative	mind you i am calling from an iphone 0 that i never have problems with .
negative	then she has the audacity to ask me to call her back due to the bad connection .
negative	wtf !!!
negative	i finally got her to write down my phone_number to call me back .
negative	of course 0 hours_later i hadn_'_t heard_anything .
negative	then i called back and after waiting for 00_minutes and not being_able to handle the alarm sound anymore i hung_up .
negative	highly encourage_anyone thinking of using this site to think_twice about their decision .
negative	still_waiting for my refund ... wont hold my breath .
negative	truly the worst customer_service / difficult company i have ever had to work with ever .
negative	my girlfriend gave_me a gift_card to white_flower farms when my brother passed_away .
negative	she wanted me to purchase a plant for my garden in remembrance of him .
negative	i fell in love with the lungwort that i purchased locally for $ 0 . 00 , so i decided to give two other varieties a try .
negative	i purchased these other varieties of lungworts from wff with my gift_card and was extremely disappointed .
negative	they arrived root bound , yellow , near death and they were over priced .
negative	i have placed them in ground and can only hope for the best .
negative	signed ,
negative	disappointed in va
negative	this is messed_up man . waiting for a package that was said to be delivered and no package .... dont_know who to blame ?
negative	shopping like this is terrible
negative	delivered a broken controller and i have called and sent emails with no response ..
negative	i am very disgruntled with this company .
negative	i did not spend over $_000 for a controller for it to be broken .
negative	and with no response from the company .
negative	i was trying to change my flight return date which took them 00_minutes to understand what i wanted to do after being hung_up on once .
negative	after waiting for them to contact me back ( twice ringing the wrong number to whatt i gave them ) i am told that it is going to cost me an_additional 00pounds to change it .
negative	after looking online the flight was only 00pounds to book it all again letalone just to change the flight that i have already paid for .
negative	trying to book another person onto the same flight takes them 00 + minutes for them to turn_around and say it was unsuccessful and to book it myself online ( at 00ppm not acceptable !!!!)
negative	i will never use this company to book any flights again and would not reccomend anyone_else to do so either .
negative	not very impressed order number 000000 )
negative	address top flat
negative	000 fellows road
negative	belsize park
negative	nw0 0jj
negative	mandy nelson telephone no which was given with the order is 0000000000
negative	cell 00000000000
negative	i get getting confirmation that order has_been received it hasn_'_t . cost of flowers was 00 . 00_pounds
negative	verydissapointed customer .
negative	when i tried to call it said webpage cannot be opened
negative	have a volvo and can '_t get parts for it where we live i found this site and the part we needed was a heater core with o - rings some sites sell them separate this site said specifically it came with both .
negative	got the order no o - rings in box .
negative	contact them .
negative	them assume box damage .
negative	told them no , then instead of sending me the missing parts they want me to return the part at my expense !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	my experience was very disappointing .
negative	i had a reservation to park and shuttle to the airport unfortunately when i arrived at the hotel i was told i could not park in the lot because i did not stay at the hotel , subsequently i had to park at the airport and incur an outrageous fee !!
negative	i reported the incident to customer_service at global_parking and was told by two individuals , carolyn and amanda that unfortunately there was nothing that could be done about the expense that was incurred .
negative	as an individual who travels frequently finding a reliable parking service is important .
negative	when there is a break in communication with the hotel and the parking service the customer should be compensated for the inconvenience .
negative	the " little " inconvenience cost me a late arrival to the airport and a $_000 . 00 to park at the airport .
negative	definitely a horrible experience and poor customer_service !
negative	ok ... so i ordered over_£_000 worth of isme products , the delivery was super quick but half the goods werent great quality and i was extremely disappointed to find that when i phoned up isme to sort out the 00_%_off i hadnt managed to retrieve because of my bad connection ... they tried to tell me its not 00_%_off first time customers , its £_00 off your first £_00 ...
negative	i know what i can see thank_you very much so dont try telling_me i can see something_else .
negative	in the end i kept two products for covienience and wrote an_email to them for proof of what is on my samsung_galaxy
negative	screen but the connection was also bad it wouldnt send so i left it at that and can_honestly say im much happier with very and paying p_& p on call of duty black_ops 0 ... whats that about !
negative	its not a big product and should be eligible for collect +!!!
negative	!
negative	i hate the way they don_'_t pay their employees fairly , and the fact that they discriminate against women !
negative	also the fact that almost everything they buy comes from china !
negative	i live in billings , but manage several properties in san_diego .
negative	cox continually " mistakenly " overcharges my account month after month .
negative	their customer_service representatives are rude and their overall level of service is terribly unsatisfactory .
negative	go with at & t if the option is available in your area .
negative	i was sent a skirt and it was all ripped at the bottom .
negative	i have sent this skirt back to you and i still_haven_'_t received my money back ..
negative	i will never use priceline again !
negative	made reservations through them for a hotel in boston this weekend .
negative	when we decided to add a night and extend our stay directly through the hotel , we found out that we had saved very little money by booking with priceline .
negative	an_unexpected emergency arose , forcing us to cancel our plans .
negative	when we called priceline to try to exchange or get a refund , the answer was no , while the hotel very cordially canceled our reservations and refunded our money for the night we had booked directly through them .
negative	this has taught me a lesson , and i will be booking my reservations through someone_else next time .
negative	increasing my rent 00 . 0 % in one month with no notice , and when i called customer_service , they promised it might happen again next month !
negative	bad business_practice !
negative	terrible experience .
negative	was sent the wrong part ( without an invoice in the packaging ), so i had to wait a couple of days to be issued an_rma_number before i could return the part ... and i had to pay return shipping fees for sending the wrong part back !!
negative	now , i '_ll have to wait for them to receive the returned item and wait another 00 days for the credit .
negative	it may have been a good price for the part itself , but boy oh_boy do you pay for it in the end .
negative	we '_ve ordered twice from groupon and both_times we have been severely disappointed .
negative	the first order was for 0 x dehumidifiers .
negative	we had no communication to let us know that they had been dispatched and then when one of them finally arrived 00 days_later , we were left_wondering when or if the second would turn arrive .
negative	i called groupon customer_services to query ( if you want to waste an_hour of your life , call the groupon customer_service line !)
negative	the girl i spoke to on the phone would not confirm whether 0 or 0 had been sent .
negative	i told her my parcel said 0 of 0 so could only assume that only 0 had been sent .
negative	she asked me to wait a couple of days for the second one to turn up , so i did and no luck .
negative	i called back and requested a refund .... only to be told that they couldn_'_t refund my card , but could offer me the funds back in groupon credit !
negative	a few_months later and we saw a pair of ballerina pump shoes in a snake skin purple / pink metallic print , with 00_%_off .... who could pass up this opportunity !
negative	so we decided to give groupon a second chance ....( famous last words !)
negative	the shoes took around a week to arrive .... fair enough but yet again , no notification that they had been dispatched .
negative	when we received the item , the shoes were 0 different_colours !
negative	one was purple / pink and the other was green / yellow !
negative	we have learned our lesson - the deals may be great but the customer_service , delivery and general operations of this business are dire !
negative	for the sake of a saving , i ' d_rather spend a bit more and receive a good service than waste any more time with groupon !
negative	they charged my credit_card 0 times for the same part .
negative	you can not get through to customer_service and if you finally do , there is no response about taking_care of problem .
negative	if you call them , they will not call you back and forget the fax_machine .
negative	tried to get through for 00_hrs .
negative	if i don_'_t hear from someone today , i am contacting thr better business_bureau .
negative	i was sent the wrong shoes and still_haven_'_t been able to get someone on the phone after waiting 00_minutes on each_occasion for a leave a message recording comes on .
negative	left several messages and still_haven_'_t received a call back .
negative	never received a shipping confirmation either .
negative	will never order from this site again horrible service and poor customer_service .
negative	i ordered a mirror for my pt for the passenger_side and was sent a mirror for the driver_side .
negative	then i wrote to ask for returning information to exchange the mirror and was given a ticket number with the promise of 00 to 00 business hour response .
negative	it has_been 00_hours with out a response .
negative	the ups sent the mirror through ten different_cities .
negative	it was shipped without_any protection and had no packing_slip enclosed in the damaged box i received .
negative	how am i suppose to ship back a part without a packing_slip in a damaged box ?
negative	the glass frames were huge -- far too large for my face and the color was more zebra striped than grey tortoise .
negative	had no choice but to return them because of the size .
negative	returned them promptly , paid for the return shipping but received only a partial credit .
negative	will be less likely to " try " frames again from this website .
negative	i had ordered pads to absorb sweat under breasts andunder folds of fat under stomach .
negative	no way to aadhere to your body .
negative	this review is about 0 months late , but as i kept staring_at this email to write a review and putting it off , i decided i would .
negative	i have ordered from amiclubwear a few_times .
negative	i do like how the prices are competitive but the quality of some of the items are just down right horrible .
negative	i would rather pay extra money to have higher quality items that will last versus buying something that you only get a few uses out of .
negative	my last order was 0 pairs of boots .
negative	one for me and one as a christmas gift for my roomate .
negative	first off , the shipping was omg turtle slow .
negative	shipping is too high .
negative	so a big_disappointment with those 0 things .
negative	when i finally got them , i got excited .
negative	the moment i opened the box , i wanted to cry .
negative	first the smell .
negative	i don_'_t know how or why the smell was bad , but it was bad .
negative	second , the quality was just crap .
negative	one was a pair of fake suede boots .
negative	the black color wasn_'_t even black .
negative	the quality looked like cheap felt you buy in a dollar store and you could see glue where parts of the boots were supposed to be together .
negative	the second pair was fake leather but the shine on the boots was absolutely horrible .
negative	it looked like someone just vaselined the whole boots .
negative	the buckle part had threads showing and also glue showing and very very cheaply_made .
negative	unacceptable !!
negative	i called customer_service and spoke to a very rude lady_who said if i return them , there would be a restocking_fee ( what ??!!)
negative	and i could only get credit back and not my money back .
negative	unacceptable .
negative	plus she told me that all of their products are high_quality .
negative	umm no , they aren_'_t .
negative	obviously you could tell she was either having a bad day or she downright hated her job .
negative	very unprofessional !
negative	!
negative	i work in healthcare , and seeing patients every day , i know that i should always deliver high_quality care and professionalism at all times .
negative	and i do .
negative	so when i get crappy quality and unacceptable customer_service , i will say something .
negative	in hopes that other customers will know the quality and the business itself will actually change things .
negative	i am very very disappointed and will more than likely not recommend this website to others nor will i be making purchases as well .
negative	i would like a full_refund including shipping !
negative	!
negative	i ordered these pans about two and a half weeks before christmas .
negative	for a gift .
negative	did not receive them till january 00 .
negative	not impressed
negative	the customer_service of expedia is terrible !
negative	if you run_into problems they will not help you at all .
negative	after 0 hours on the phone talking to 0 different people , all i got was the phone_number for the airline '_s customer_service people !
negative	i have traveled using expedia several_times before .
negative	this was the 0st time i needed to use their 0 - 000 number .
negative	my flight was canceled due to weather .
negative	i called their number to find a solution .
negative	the agent on the other end told me that they would cancel my ticket if i found another flight .
negative	i found another flight and called back .
negative	after waiting on hold with the agent for 0 hours , i was told that , because of the inclement_weather , i needed to call back the next_day before_noon .
negative	i double_checked to make_sure that this would not be too late to cancel , but was assured that it would be fine .
negative	however , the next_morning when i called at 0 am , i was told that it was too late and that my original flight had been re scheduled .
negative	i was on the phone with the person for 0 / 0 an_hour explaining things before my new flight took off and i had to hang up .
negative	once i was back in cell service , i called the number again .
negative	this time i was told their system was down and that i would have to call them back in 0 hours .
negative	when i called them back i was on the phone again for another 0 hours until i was finally told that at no time could they have canceled the flight and that i should have contacted the airline_directly right_away !
negative	when i pointed_out that i had talked to 0 other people and none of them communicated this to me , i was told that they were sincerely sorry and that the people would be dealt_with , but that there was still nothing they could do for me !
negative	i will never use expedia for another flight .
negative	with all of the options out there , you can do better_than this site .
negative	don_'_t expect a refund or any further use of a ticket you purchase with these_folks if you should have to cancel your flight because of an_emergency .
negative	i read every word of the terms and conditions before i purchased , and nowhere does it say if you are travelling on two different airlines you will not be refunded or given the opportunity to reschedule in the future .
negative	they refunded the tax only ($_00 ) on a $_000 fare .
negative	pretty hefty fee .
negative	flyer beware .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	i ordered a trampoline for my sons_birthday_present .
negative	i ordered it 0_weeks in advance so it would get here on time .
negative	it never arrived and the blame was put on the courier company .
negative	its unacceptable as it states next_day delivery !
negative	i the customer had to contact sport and leisure to find out where my trampoline was .
negative	only then was i told that it was returned to them as the box was damaged .
negative	i have been cut_off by customer_services and nobody bothered to get back to me .
negative	i now have to wait even longer to have this delivered and have been told that i may not receive a refund or discount !!!!
negative	disgusting service .
negative	very unhappy customer :(
negative	had great prices but i see why , the customer_service and timing is terrible .
negative	what almost two_weeks to receive a part only to finally get a email_stating that the part was out of stock after saying on the web_site that it was in stock .
negative	i will never use them again
negative	agent was very rude when i was try to rebook a flight that the airlines cancelled .
negative	never buy the insurance ---- worthless !!!!!
negative	!
negative	when i received my rug , it had dirty spots all over it and no invoice to send it back !
negative	!
negative	yo puse la pagina para para reservar y pagar on usa dollares de estados unidos y agarre mi confirmation con otro diferente signo seguido de_la cantidad de cobro , y ahora no tengo ni idea cuanto me van a costar los ticketes y no puedo oencontrar un numero de telefono para hablar con alguien k me pueda ayudar .. serian tan amables de comunicarse conmigo por favor lo mas pronto posible ???
negative	mi numero de telefono esta en la reservacion ....
negative	i am in no way happy with this company and will not be ordering from them in the future .
negative	they are quick to charge you for the product but extremely slow to deliver .
negative	it has_been 0_weeks since i have placed my order and still have not received it .
negative	no one answers the phone or returns calls .
negative	save_yourself the stress and go elsewhere
negative	i was very disappointed in the service of printer_inks recently .
negative	previously they have been great , but last time i ordered a printer cartridge i also got a bill for £_000 of goods i didn_'_t order .
negative	i also ordered generic cartridges for my printer that didn_'_t work and wasn_'_t warned of that being a possibiltiy .
negative	i have asked for advice and have returned them for a refund , but in order to make my printer work , had to order an original cartridge .
negative	i was told that they would send this by the quickest possible means but was not told that this would cost me extra in postage .
negative	i have been offered no compensation for the cost of phoning printerinks premium_rate number although i have asked for this .
negative	nor have i had any satisfaction or reply from the customer e_- mail complaints service .
negative	i intend to find another cartridge provider .
negative	what a shame !
negative	signed_up for auto delivery on first order .
negative	was so excited about the program .
negative	my first order qualified for 0 - day shipping and i was confident that my 0 day supply would last .
negative	however , my shipping changed to 00 day with cavalear attitudes and nonchalant approach to my issue .
negative	nothing on website says " you may get 0 - day shipping " or " free 0 - day shipping when possible "!
negative	i was left to scramble to find my food locally and can '_t cancel this order unless i '_m home the very moment it arrives and refuse delivery !
negative	if i had that kind of time i wouldn_'_t be attracted to this type of service .
negative	sorry , but it '_s never good to over promise and under deliver .
negative	i use a number of delivery sites ranging_from seamless web , to eat00 , freshdirect , etc .
negative	delivery . com has by_far the worst customer_service .
negative	they never resolve the issue at hand .
negative	the response time to very slow .
negative	i have come to them multiple_times now with the same issue regarding a coupon that should technically qualify at a specific restaurant but does not .
negative	as nobody answers me i eventually apply it , reluctantly , elsewhere .
negative	they then point me to the fact that i used it .
negative	great .... really great .
negative	however you seem to be missing the point that i only used it elsewhere because the place i wanted to use it at didn_'_t work on numerous_occasions .
negative	also , if you inquire as to a slow / late delivery no actions is actually taken with the restaurant .
negative	not pleased ,. did not receive what expected .
negative	i appreciated your very prompt service when i ordered recently .
negative	items arrived quickly and in good condition .
negative	i do not do facebook so i wonder_if you extend this offer and don_'_t try to foist fb on potential_clients .
negative	thank_you .
negative	i love the products and the price , however , when my items were lost in transit customer_service was very poor .
negative	they were rude and sarcastic and not just one customer_service agent .
negative	i made several_attempts to resolve the issue and was treated the same every time !!
negative	after the first correspondance they closed my case even_though it was unresolved .
negative	their suggestion ?
negative	check with my apartment manager , case closed !
negative	what ??
negative	no thanks i wont purchase there again because they do not guarantee delivery of your items and if it gets lost in transit then your out the money you spent on items you will never get .
negative	poor poor poor customer_service !
negative	i purchased an item on oct . 00th .
negative	my credit was approved .
negative	they never said they sent my item .
negative	i emailed them a couple days ago to find out if they have mailed it .
negative	i have an order number which i included .
negative	i bought it as a gift for a grandson and plan to drive out of town to his_birthday_party in two_days .
negative	i get no response from them .
negative	i have wasted 00_hours of my life that i can '_t get back waiting in for a courier who never arrived .
negative	the live_chat was a waste of time , the girl was obviously used to refunding people .
negative	as if i was going to rebook for tomorrow and waste another 00_hours of my life .
negative	stay away from this company they are useless .
negative	j ’_ai passé ma_commande le 00 mars et presqu ’ un mois plus tard je_n ’_ai toujours pas reçu mes lunettes de soleil .
negative	easylunettes a répondu à mon premier e_- mail , mais pas le deuxième ni le troisième .
negative	easylunettes m ’ a dit il_y a deux semaines que « nous estimons qu ’ il faudra 0 à 00 jours supplémentaires pour que votre produit nous arrive .
negative	» et « soyez assurée que nous continuons d ’ insister quotidiennement auprès de nos fournisseurs afin qu ’ ils nous livrent votre modèle .

negative	i ordered a coat or my partner which had to be returned for a smaller_size i found them extremely_rude ad it has taken rather a while for them to receive it when i rang to ask someone she was extremely_rude but it was diffent when i was spending money !
negative	tried ordering .
negative	calles back and pushes on me accessoried .
negative	cancellec immideately .
negative	after a month my order hadn_'_t come .
negative	i inquired , they sent an_email a few_days_later saying everything was on back order and was going to be at_least 0 more weeks .
negative	they said i could request a refund since everything was on back order , so i did .
negative	another month went by and another , they said it had to be processed a certain way then i would see it in my account after a couple statements .
negative	after filing a claim with my bank and printing all my emails from them , it took about 0 months to finally get my money .
negative	it was about $_000 . 00 .
negative	it was my bank that finially got them to refund my money .
negative	be careful , i will not order anything from my vitanet . com ever ..... no stars
negative	shockingly bad service .
negative	first of all wrong_size trainer sent .
negative	then i was told on the phone they did not have the size i wanted ( did they know this first ?
negative	), even_though it said online they did .
negative	rudeness experienced from customer_service .
negative	i emailed to see if they did have right size , they emailed back it was not .
negative	i decided to order online to see if it would come_back as available as so much wrong information was given i wouldnt be surprised if they got this wrong too .
negative	the goods arrived in the right size - no confirmation_email , or tracking_number .
negative	i sent an_email to customer_service to tell the tale and they sent an_email to say that they would respond - have heard_nothing !
negative	very poor .
negative	i ordered ink ( black and colored ) for my hp_printer and called to inform customer_service that i had received the wrong number .
negative	without calling me , another package arrived in the mail .
negative	this time , it contained the correct cartridges .
negative	however , when i installed them and began printing , these , too were faulty .
negative	i had to remove them from the printer , shake them several_times and reinstall them to get them to print only a couple of pages .
negative	i have had to repeat this several_times ( whenever i want to print something )!
negative	!
negative	i have not called back , because i do not want more ink -- i want my money back !
negative	!
negative	first time buying from this site and completely regret it !!!
negative	the only_thing i didn_'_t have a problem with was the shipping because i actually received the product before the estimated shipping date .
negative	but , of course the actual product was horrible !
negative	0 .
negative	site description of the material was completely off !
negative	0 .
negative	picture on the site was also different from the actual item .
negative	0 .
negative	buttons were not even sowed on .. they were tied on -.-
negative	i booked a room at cleveland clinic to take my mother to a heart specialist .
negative	the date of our appointment changed and i called expedia to modify my reservation .
negative	the representative who answered spoke little english and i have to believe the call was routed overseas .
negative	i was told that the computers were down and that i would have to call back .
negative	over a two day period , i called nine times and was told each time that i would have to call back .
negative	i explained that i was trying to modify the reservation by six o ' clock and was advised that there would be no problem .
negative	when i finally was able to get though the next_day , i was advised that i would be charged for that night and for a block of four nights even_though we were only staying for two .
negative	i will never consider_using this company again .
negative	i paid for one month and do feel that i should have to pay until i get my cards .
negative	awful ..
negative	i have tried to call and have not received anything still
negative	thanks alot !!
negative	!
negative	i was relieved to learn that partsgeek had my difficult to find part .
negative	i placed my order online and the funds were extracted from my account the following_day .
negative	five days_later i received an_email indicating that i was being credited for the part .
negative	there was no notification explaining why or what happened .
negative	i tried_calling customer_service numerous_times , only to be put on hold for hours at a time .
negative	i finally stopped calling 0 days_later when the funds were back into my account .
negative	i still have no_idea why the order was cancelled .
negative	this process cost me 0 days delay in getting my car repaired .
negative	over all a very disappointing experience .
negative	my advice is do not order a part from this company unless it is not urgent .
negative	i uploaded 00 files and after 0 days still had not received all of them .
negative	they were only 00_minutes long .
negative	i should have received them after 0 days .
negative	i called support and they were sent right_away .
negative	but still late .
negative	apparently everything i ordered was no_longer available but no one let_me know until i inquired_about why it had not arrived .
negative	very poor customer_service .
negative	i was very excited to finally find a frame i liked that was reasonably_priced so i ordered from selectspecs right_away once i made my decision .
negative	that was 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	they shipped out in a reasonable time but now have sat in the sorting_office of usps for 0_weeks .
negative	selectspecs will not inquire with usps to find the source of the delay .
negative	and i have been told that i will get them " sooner or later ".
negative	when i asked what would happen when i didn_'_t receive then they said that they would remake them after 00 days and then ship them out again .
negative	with the same shipping service that lost them in the first place .
negative	unless i want to pay more for them to ship fedex or dhl .
negative	no , i am not responsible for the package being lost , i will not pay for the shipping that is guaranteed .
negative	these are prescription_glasses .
negative	these are a different prescription than i have had before because my vision is worse .
negative	not having the new prescription is costing me work .
negative	and again they will not even make a postal inquiry .
negative	i '_m now at the point of dispute for non delivery of goods as my only recourse .
negative	your order is still not recieved or refunded and this is from august_0000 . this is such poor form get your act_together and contact your customers !!!
negative	!
negative	poor show
negative	didn_'_t confirm delivery address when i paid through paypal clearly enough ,
negative	tried to change address , took 0 days for them to come_back to me , in a week it still_hasn_'_t arrived and now my dad has no xmas_present as we leave tomorrow .
negative	thanks a lot gadget_grotto .
negative	i recently ordered several items from petflow online .
negative	it was the first time i have ordered from this company , but they were advertising an item called pet_corrector that i wanted to try to get my dog to stop_barking every time someone came to the door .
negative	then because they also advertised free_shipping for an order of $_00 or more , i ordered a couple of additional items that i thought i could use as well .
negative	when i went to click to confirm my order , the total reflected the discount for free_shipping , but then after i clicked confirm , the total indicated that i was being charged for the shipping .
negative	i tried to call the company and after being on hold for a long time , i then was told by a recording that they could not take my call at that time .
negative	so i contacted the company by email and received an_email response that told me that i did not receive the free_shipping because my order was not an auto_ship order !
negative	so i will not be ordering again from this company in the future .
negative	this site said they were la_quinta .
negative	we booked two rooms for one night .
negative	when we got to the hotel we learned that was not the case .
negative	when i received the receipt at the end of our stay and compared it to the charge on the credit_card i was shocked to find that i was charged an addition 00 . 00 above the price of the rooms for using this site .
negative	i will never use them again .
negative	i find the cost outrages .
negative	my story short .
negative	in the end of may 0000 we contact customer_service with uredanmark . com .
negative	i ask about delivery of a ferrari watch which our son was surpose to have for a pressent .
negative	a watch that i cannot purchase in denmark .
negative	customerservice asures me that they have the right watch in stock and that we have no reason to worry , because they have no reason to desive us .
negative	we transfer money by west union , after checking ofcourse that everything is in order .
negative	we then writte back to uredanmmark that we have transferd the monney .
negative	they reply that they will send the watch quickly .
negative	after getting the wrong track and trace number and waiting for serveral weeks we finely recieve the watch in the mittle of july .
negative	unfortunatly it is not the rigth watch but a cheap eiky watch with a stell wristband .
negative	i writte to customer_service again , who tells_me not to return the watch since it will be very expensive and if i will be kindly anough to send them a picture of the wrong watch .
negative	i do that and they return to me on mail an regret what has happend and to compensate the mistake they will give 00_% on my next purchase .
negative	i respond to them that it is not my mistake and that i am sorry , but i will not purchase from them again and that since it is theire mistake they should just send me the right watch without charge .
negative	this last mail i got no reply on .
negative	after having send the same e_- mail til uredanmark . com i promised to montion my experiences here on the website .
negative	i allso contacted them customer_service by using another e_- mail and ask if they had my watch in stock and how long it would take to deliver and how to compare it to the eiky watch witch was send to us by mistake .
negative	they where very positive until i wrote who i was .
negative	since my last conversation with uredanmark i have send my e_- mail to them allmost every day and i still_haven ´ t recieved an answer .
negative	i hope that from this story you will be aware not to purchase anything from this company .
negative	i think that uredanmark . com , ureudsalg . com are related so i expect that you will experience the same treatment from them as well .
negative	we purchased a chain saw and was told it would be delivered in the week commencing 00th may .
negative	it was actually delivered a week early which_meant by the time we were home to look at it the 0 days for a refund had already_passed .
negative	when we put the chainsaw together it was faulty so we contacted ukhs and were told someone would call us back , after 0 hours we called again and were told the same thing and after a further 0 hours we called again and were yet again told someone would call , no one did .
negative	on saturday we called again and was told someone would call us back and after 0 hours no one had ( yet again ) so we called again and was told the people we would need to speak to would probably have gone home so we should call back on monday .
negative	i then logged a dispute with paypal as i had purchased the item with paypal and on monday was called by a very rude man_who said he wanted to sort out the issue and had the cheek to say we should have called before setting_up a dispute on paypal and then accused us of lying about the previous calls because in his words " he can '_t see why the message wouldn_'_t have been passed on "
negative	the man was most unhelpful and told us we needed to send the item back or he wouldn_'_t do anything ( which we obviously would have done but paypal were now dealing_with the matter so we waited for them to tell us to do so )
negative	paypal favoured me in the dispute and finally gained my money back however the service from ukhs was extremely_rude and unhelpful , they are interested in selling and nothing else so if you do decide to purchase with them ( which i wouldn_'_t recommend ) then you will need to hope your items aren_'_t faulty as they definitely won_'_t assist you in returning the item .
negative	paypal policy leave big loop holes for scammers to take_advantage of .
negative	it lets paypal not take any responsibility whatsoever .
negative	even paypal claim it '_s safe , don_'_t worry we will take_care of your money .
negative	00_dollar down the drain , that '_s all , and paypal suck .
negative	i ordered 0 extra large ink_cartridges from inkfarm because i got tired of paying high prices for ink at walmart , so when i recieved my ink from ink_farm , i had to print off some flyers and the brand_new colored ink only printed off 00 copies ... and the regular cartridge i purchase from walmart will do 00 copies .... very very upset and dissapointed in my purchase from ink_farm ...
negative	i had a very bad_experience with them :
negative	i was moving houses and wanted to sort out the internet_connection etc .
negative	i called 000000 to find out the phone_number to sky .
negative	i wrote the number down however the advisor i talked to offered me to connect me with that number , which seemed a kind gesture , since she did not mention any charge for connecting me .
negative	guess what , i got charged £_00 for the conversation - it lasted about 00_mins to order the internet , tv and landline from skype .
negative	when i wrote a complaint to 000000 since i obviously would not ask them to connect me if they told me how much per_minute it would cost me , they said that i picked option 0 and i was informed by an_automated service about the costs which is a complete lie , since i talked with a person , who ' forgot ' to mention the price of the further connection .
negative	it took me about 0 further letters to get in the end only half of the money back - 000000 kept blaming my mobile network for these charges , while the mobile network was blaming 000000 .
negative	the company is based on dishonesty and hiding the facts from customers , in the hope that people do not check their phone bills .
negative	stay away from them for a mile or recommend to your enemies .
negative	my worst_experience ever !
negative	does anybody even speak_english in that company ?
negative	they are just taking p ** s of customers !
negative	i was moving houses , wanted them to transfer the phone line
negative	to my new flat .
negative	0 .
negative	the did not cut_off the line when they promised - it took them a week longer to do that .
negative	they were saying via mobile that it is not working , when i went over to check , it was still working .
negative	0 .
negative	i arranged an_appointment with their engineer to come over to my new flat on saturday since i am out of flat any other day of the week as i work in another town .
negative	they sent me a confirmation via_text_message that the engineer will be in my flat on saturday between_0am and 0pm .
negative	guess what , i got a phone_call from the engineer on tuesday about 0pm , that he is at the door and no one is in .
negative	when i told him that i did not have any appointments with him for tuesday but on saturday , he said they do not do saturdays and he would not tell me which company sent him , i was hoping it is someone for my flatmate maybe .
negative	i called talktalk three_times that week so that they can double and tripple check if everything is fine with the saturday appointment , and they said yes ( and were quite impatient as if i was taking their time to check an obvious thing ).
negative	guess what , i was waiting all day for the engineer on saurday , called talktalk again twice , once at 00am and once around 00 , only to get told that i need to wait patiently .
negative	when the engineer did not turn up at 0pm , i called them again , only to be informed that the engineer was there and i was not at home !
negative	when i think about this i am still so upset , they did not give me any apology for wasting my time and for that dreadful experience , they lied straight into my face , so disrespectful for me , as a customer , as a human_being !
negative	0 .
negative	after that i decided i do not want to have anything to do with them .
negative	but guess what , it is not that easy !
negative	because they basically pretend they do not understand_english , when you say you do not want to be their customer any more .
negative	they were passing me over one to another asking to wait , till the last person told me that it is impossible , otherwise they will charge me a disconnection fee .
negative	i laughed at them , how can they charge me a disconnection fee if i am not connected in the first place ?
negative	the last guy i spoke to was so afraid to remove me from the customers list , as if they threatened him with something if he does that .
negative	the conversation was like this :
negative	- please remove from the customers list
negative	- no problem , but ..
negative	- i do not want any buts , remove me please
negative	- yes , but ..
negative	- no buts , remove me from the customers list please !
negative	- but ...
negative	and so on about 00_mins !!
negative	!
negative	to put it short - this company is a disgrace and i am happy not to have anything to do with them any more .
negative	i ordered the jessops photobook for a special_occasion birthday .
negative	i was not impressed by the product i received from jessops , the photos were poor quality and odd colours .
negative	the jessops software used to create the book was slow and frustrating .
negative	overall i was not happy especially_considering the price and i will never use jessops again .
negative	i shopped with beautybay recently .
negative	after more than 0_weeks i still_haven_'_t received my package , and they said it takes 0 - 00 working days for us orders .
negative	i tried to contact them so many_times ... no responses ever .
negative	i filed a dispute with my credit_card and they refunded my money .
negative	will never ever shop with them again and will never recommend this site to anyone !
negative	extremely disappointed !
negative	this was my first time using bookbyte to order a used textbook and i am very frustrated with the company .
negative	i received a notice through my email for my order being placed and a order number , when my textbook never showed_up in the mail i checked the website .
negative	my order had been canceled due to the textbook being sold out .
negative	bookbyte never gave_me any notification of this cancellation of my order via_email .
negative	this is unacceptable and inexcusable behavior for a company who wishes to service college_students who need these books to guarantee success in class .
negative	on friday 0th it will be 0 full weeks since i '_ve been taking 0 pill 0 / 0 hr before my meals ( 0 ) per day .
negative	as per dr oz television show .
negative	he said to look for everything you show plus make_sure nothing else is added , ( which you also state ).
negative	i haven_'_t lost one lb yet .............. not one .
negative	i don_'_t snack between meals , my breakfast is oatmeal with blueberries / almonds in water , lunch is norm raw veggies / yogurt dip , and maybe 0 pieces of cheese .
negative	and i have a filling dinner , not always with a starch .
negative	the norm is meat and 0 veggies or 0 veg and a salad .
negative	i drink water , or i might have 0 - 0 glasses of wine every other day . thats it , no soda or beer ever .
negative	i '_ll continue with the pills untill gone just to see how i do , then if nothing , i '_ll try to find a different brand .
negative	if you have any suggestions , i ' d love to hear from you .
negative	i booked my flight with expedia only to find out that my contact after booking the flight would be through hotwire and than the billing on my back account was with a company called traverse .
negative	no where was there any information_regarding the connection between expedia , hotwire or traverse .
negative	my flight had to be cancelled due to bad_weather_conditions which i completely understand .
negative	we were traveling as a family from burlington , vermont to jfk in new_york to send my daughter off to study abroad .
negative	we changed our flight due to the weather and received a confirmation of new travel_plans .
negative	i than followed_up with the air line as i viewed on line that the flight they put us on had been cancelled .
negative	over the next 0 hours " not joking " in the time_frame i remained on the phone line with a representative from hotwire to re - book a flight .
negative	to make it easier we decided to just have my daughter and i travel as we knew many people where looking for flights .
negative	it was sad not to have our whole family be able to send her off but we were trying to be respectful of mother nature and the challenges air lines have when bad_weather occurs .
negative	finally , the representative told me we could get a flight out for my daughter and i and put me on hold to arrange the confirmation .
negative	literally , in a three time_frame she got back on the line with me and told me there was only one seat available .
negative	i explained how could this be as she just told me she was going to make the final confirmation .
negative	furthermore , i gave up two seats to help the airline out only to have another seat taken_away .
negative	so alas , i continue to await four hours_later on the phone for flight .
negative	at this point it looks like we will cancel it all and drive .
negative	never , never , never use expedia .
negative	there company has to many affiliates which makes simple changes and communication basically impossible .
negative	very saddened and disappointed in their customer_service .
negative	it has taken three attempts to finally receive a duvet_cover that is not faulty !
negative	first order had a hole in it and the second a grease stain .
negative	although the helpline staff did apologise , they certainly did not put them selves out to offer an explanation even when i posted a complaint through care @ bedeck - i am still_waiting for a response a month later .
negative	bedeck do not offer a pre_- paid returns service for faulty goods and therefore postage_costs have to be paid up front by the customer and at £_00 x 0 this is a little annoying especially when i had to further chase the second postage_costs to be refunded .
negative	sorry bedeck i don_'_t rate your quality control nor your customer_service and would not recommend your company to anyone !
negative	i still have not recived my items as fedex delivered them to an unknown house 0 doors away and they are never home ... i am very unhappy
negative	i bought the one part black version for $_00 and had a really tough time getting it to not bubble .
negative	i build furniture so i am not new to paint , sealer , etc .
negative	but i couldn_'_t get this to work .
negative	i did not shake the can ; i stirred slowly for 00_minutes .
negative	after using the entire can without_success , i decided it must be user error and i ordered another can .
negative	i spoke to them on the phone to verify humidity and the type of roller i should use .
negative	i bought something to show the humidity in the room i was working in , and the conditions were good but i still got bubbles using their suggested roller .
negative	finally with the last of the second can , i poured it on a flat surface and slowly swirled it around so there would be no way that i was introducing the bubbles .
negative	minutes later , there were huge bubbles everywhere that never popped .
negative	i call them again , and they asked me to send photos which i did .
negative	i never_heard from them , and i wish i could get my $_000 back - it is a complete_waste of money .
negative	i placed a order for flowers and chocolates for a friend in hospital , however when i asked my friend about the delivery i found out it never arrived .
negative	i contacted iflorist first via_email and then live_chat , as no phone numbers , who confirmed order had not been sent .
negative	i asked why not sent and why did they not inform me .
negative	said problem with florist and didn_'_t answer on why did not inform me .
negative	it was agreed that the order would be resent to my friend , now at home , but order would be upgraded .
negative	so a week after original delivery date a order did arrive , but not with the chocolates as i had ordered .
negative	i have emailed iflorist about this , wrote on their facebook_page , but have has no response !
negative	very upset over my treatment from this company and their not only lack of customer_service but how they can get a order wrong twice and still not respond about this .
negative	would not ever take the risk again of using this company .
negative	first of all only 0 / 0 items that i ordered arrived ...... late at that .
negative	took a month to arrive .
negative	the rings came broken , i emailed them and to this day no response .
negative	don_'_t order from them .
negative	update 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	after leaving my review the owner of the store messaged me on trustpilot .
negative	questioning my authenticity of my review .
negative	after that i finally got responses in my inbox .
negative	their ' reasoning ' of not replying is because there was a " week long holiday " in their country .
negative	this was the 0th of october and we ' re almost reaching november and oh what a surprise .
negative	still no products .
negative	and another thing .
negative	don_'_t trust all these reviews ladies and gents .
negative	the ones that end with a silly plug of ' oh use my code for 00_%_off ' aren_'_t authentic in the least bit .
negative	they just want some money off on their next order .
negative	we gotta look out for each other .
negative	absolutely horrible customer_service .
negative	with products that are not worth it .
negative	i had originally wrote a 0_star response .
negative	because i cannot edit it , i '_m writing a 0nd review .
negative	i had said that i loved that they honored their competitors website prices .
negative	well this morning i got an_email_saying that the website i had used was not a competitors site because they had a processing_fee .
negative	i checked and the fee was only $ 0 .
negative	i saw nothing about any processing fees , only if you find it cheaper they will honor that price .
negative	i have responded to sw letting them know to cancel my order and i '_ll take my business elsewhere .
negative	sent a parcel via this company through p0d .
negative	the pick_up time was great and everything looked like it went well .
negative	until the parcel was received by my friend .
negative	they say they use ' machines ' so make_sure you parcel is strong and secure which i did .
negative	the box had a big rip in and most of the items i sent which were secure were smashed to pieces !
negative	also i wasn_'_t impressed with the tracking service which suggested my parcel had been sat in a van for hours .
negative	not really what i ' d expect from £_00 + secure postage !
negative	finally got my money back because of p0d but this took 0 months because the wouldn_'_t reply to emails or send forms back !
negative	the only_thing that was good was the time it took to deliver the item ... but when it '_s been smashed to pieces that '_s not much to rave about
negative	rentalcars . com are misleading and misrepresent the full cost of the car_hire abroad .
negative	£_000 was taken from our credit_card for damage excess refund in italy which we had already paid for in the uk .
negative	they say their mission is to make properly feeding your pet less_than a chore ... big fail !!!
negative	just a couple days ago , i wasted an entire hour of my morning trying to straighten_out their billing error !
negative	whatever you do , don_'_t give them your credit_card number !!!
negative	they will charge whatever they please to your credit_card , and when you call them to correct it , they will give you the royal runaround !!
negative	their customer_service dept .
negative	sucks !!
negative	i will never buy from them again and i tell all my friends to save themselves the headache !!
negative	!
negative	i will never use travelocity or united_airlines again !
negative	if i were stranded on a deserted island and a united plane flew overhead , i would quickly stomp out my firey help sign and wait for another airlines to rescue me !
negative	i almost missed my mother '_s funeral , then had to wear my dirty sweatpants i ' d been traveling in all day to the funeral because after united cancelled my flight at the last_minute and had no additional flights until the next_day after the funeral , they refused to give me my luggage that was downstairs so i could hitch a ride from total strangers who were also stranded by united .
negative	i had to travel onward to my destination with the strangers and one of their husbands who drove 0 hours to get us !
negative	then united sent my bag to my destination after i had left for my returning flight !
negative	i got a refund from united for the portion of my trip and a silly $_00 voucher to travel on their awful airline again which i will never use .
negative	i informed travelocity of this terrible situation and they said there was nothing they could do , including working things out with united to get the small refund i received .
negative	i even had to do that myself .
negative	travelocity is a lazy company and if you have a problem you will have to solve it yourself !
negative	i received my new sunglasses without a prescription .
negative	i then returned them with a copy of my rx .
negative	it has_been over a month and have received nothing .
negative	i keep emailing them but get nothing but an acknowledgement of my email .
negative	i will never deal with them again .
negative	ho_ordinato due capi il_giorno 00 agosto 0000 , pagati subito con carta di credito .
negative	dopo settimane in cui non_ho più saputo nulla sul mio ordine ho scritto al customer_service che_mi_ha assicurato che sarebbe stato fatto un controllo nel magazzino .
negative	dopo aver inviato alcune altre mail ( cui non sempre è stata data risposta ), finalmente mi viene confermato l ' invio della merce .
negative	aspetta e aspetta ... il_giorno 0 ottobre finalmente arriva un pacco contenente uno solo dei capi ordinati e una lettera che assicurava l ' arrivo dell ' altro nel giro di 0 - 0 giorni .
negative	oggi è il 00 ottobre e dell ' altro oggetto neanche l ' ombra !!!
negative	!
negative	l ' oggetto mancante era il regalo per_il compleanno di mio marito ( 00 settembre ) che avevo ordinato ben un mese prima della data ...... mi è stato promesso un dono per risarcirmi del disagio , ma anche quello sarà nel prossimo pacco ... sempre ammesso che arrivi !
negative	!
negative	gentile staff ,
negative	ho appena letto la vostra risposta e vi ringrazio per l ' attenzione prestata a quanto da me scritto .
negative	comprendo le difficoltà in cui incorre chi deve organizzare un lavoro complesso come il vostro , difficoltà di cui non avete mai fatto cenno nelle mail che_mi avete inviato .
negative	a proposito della lettera presente nel pacco e riguardante il capo mancante , devo far presente che_non avete richiesto alcun contatto da parte mia per organizzare la nuova spedizione ( ed è questo il motivo per cui non vi ho più contattati !)
negative	.
negative	la dicitura presente è la seguente " egr .
negative	cliente , la presente per informarla che l ' articolo mancante è in fase di spedizione da un altro nostro punto logistico e pertanto lo riceverà a breve ( 0 - 0 giorni ) in un pacco successivo .
negative	per eventuali informazioni rivolgersi a info @ fashionqueen . net " ( cosa che avevo già fatto più volte e che_non_ho ritenuto dover ripetere ).
negative	ringrazio ancora per l ' attenzione e spero che con il prossimo acquisto tutto funzioni alla perfezione !
negative	i contacted the toll_free number to book a room at the country inn and suites in clarksville , tn .
negative	the hotel was booked so the gentleman i spoke to told me he could book me in the same type of room at the candlewood inn and suites .
negative	when we got the hotel ( after driving for 00hrs with an 00yr_old and 00 month old ) i was informed that i was booked in a queen suite not a king suite and none of the rooms had the sofa_sleeper i had requested .
negative	after about 00_mins of trying to get everything straightened_out my family and i ended_up going down the road and staying at another hotel chain .
negative	i was very disappointed in all the miscommunication .
negative	the only_thing that was done right was my money being refunded back to my charge card .
negative	this was the worst_experience i '_ve ever had .
negative	i '_ve worked in the customer_service industry for over 00 years , these so called agents lack the skills and ideology to assist customers .
negative	never will i book through this sight again .
negative	paid $_00 for an overnight delivery and it wasn_'_t even shipped until a week_later completely missing my daugter '_s birthday !
negative	i usually go through hotwire .
negative	however , this time i thought i ' d try priceline because hotwire didn_'_t have the hotel i was looking for .
negative	the hotel was exactly as i expected , so that wasn_'_t an_issue at all .
negative	the issue was with customer_service .
negative	i called to ask if i could make_sure the room had two beds .
negative	long_story short , he told me the hotel would cancel it with a full_refund after_speaking to them with me on hold .
negative	he straight lied to me .
negative	i called the hotel_directly after the call with priceline and she told me that she never said anything like that .
negative	she added that she couldn_'_t do anything with the reservation and only priceline can change / cancel a reservation .
negative	she ended_up personally upgrading my room after all the issues with priceline .
negative	i decided then to stick to hotwire .
negative	after the trip , i called to complain_about the previous guy .
negative	i didn_'_t want to before it because i was concerned they ' d retaliate with an extra_charge or something .
negative	they seemed that low to me .
negative	the lady quickly listened to a little of what i had to say and then said " if that '_s all you have to say , goodbye ."
negative	she hung_up on me !!
negative	never again !!
negative	it confirmed that i am a loyal hotwire customer .
negative	had major issues with obtaining my rewards and i never received a refund on a damaged return .
negative	hurtig_levering , men manglende tydelighed rent prismæssigt .
negative	fx .
negative	fremgår det_ikke at der bliver tillagt et højt portogebyr i forhold til_den faktiske pris .
negative	desuden er bonruller meget mindre end ved andre leverandører .
negative	ordered goods and requested a change , they told me the goods have been dispatched already so i should re - order and simply refused the delivery for my first order .
negative	paid_extra for quicker delivery but it never turned , then all the goods from both orders turned_up together and the builder didn_'_t know what to return .
negative	" better " bathrooms then told me it was my fault and i have to pay for returning the products , absolutely disgraceful !
negative	!
negative	simply ... i ordered some flowers to be delivered on wednesday 00th - they didn_'_t arrive - i heard_nothing - i asked for them to be redelivered that week ..
negative	apparently you couldn_'_t ...
negative	they ended_up being delivered yesterday ( 00nd )- a tiny tiny bunch for £_00 .
negative	0 days late .
negative	completely missing the occasion they were intended for .
negative	utter rubbish .
negative	the african american male at the counter , began talking with an african american woman_who came in after me … she was going on and on about a $_00 .
negative	unit , it was obvious it would be an extended conversation so i went outside to my car to return calls while i waited for him to finish up with her .
negative	she finally walked out about 00_minutes later ( he knew i was waiting to rent a unit as i had already agreed to rent it - a $_000 . 00 unit )… when i went back to the office , the " closed " sign displayed and door locked .
negative	i banged and waited and about 00_minutes later i could see the man and young_woman ' strolling ' back …. obviously , his paycheck does not depend_on the profitability of this company .
negative	i was excited about booking with autoeurope because it seemed easy and quite reasonably_priced .
negative	unfortunately , when we picked_up the car at enterprise in scotland , we found out that there were a number of fees that were not included in the additional pricing .
negative	we knew there would be a few more charges , but it more than doubled the cost , which was quite a bit more than_anticipated .
negative	it was not an accurate way to price compare in advance , given that the amount of all of the charges was not disclosed .
negative	next time i would book directly with the carrier and bypass autoeurope .
negative	the book was very worn , not really useable and written all in .
negative	i knew the book was used but didn_'_t expect it to be so bad for the amount i payed .
negative	i did return it to receive my money back and have yet to get it back .
negative	not sure if i '_ll will use site again .
negative	i paid for the flowers (£ 00 ) on a friday_morning with extra for sameday delivery .
negative	on saturday_morning i received an_email_saying that the flowers had been delivered ( they had not ).
negative	it '_s now monday and the flowers still_haven_'_t arrived .
negative	on saturday i submitted a query to the email_enquiries to determine the whereabouts of the flowers .
negative	no response .
negative	no phone_number to call to progress the enquiry .
negative	in summary - paid money for nothing .
negative	not sure if i '_ve been conned or if it '_s just appalling service .
negative	either way , will never bother again .
negative	the package was not delivered to our address .
negative	it was delivered 00_miles down the road ( 00_miles round_trip for us to pick it up ).
negative	fedex is very bad about delivering to many people on this paved two lane road .
negative	the road services 00 families .
negative	we want you to send us another package or we are going to stop payment with our credit_card company for this undelivered package .
negative	it was the worst_experience i have ever had , i regularly hire cars all over europe for business purposes but it was the first time i had booked with you , and will certianly be the last !
negative	i booked a opel corsa to pick_up at bradford airport on the 00 / 00 and drop_off at_gatwick airport 00 / 00 but when i arrived at the hertz desk at bradford i was told there were no cars available and i should make a new request at another desk , with not onlyand enormous price difference but a loss of almost 0hour and 00mins .
negative	but what made it worse was that nobody had mailed or text me to advise of such a problem so the supervisor of hertz decided to " invent " the excuse of his email not working .
negative	so i luckily managed to get a car from avis and do the business i had to do .
negative	but believe me i was totally shocked to go to to pick_up my avis car and to turn to see that the hertz dock had 0 cars including an opel corsa , which i took a photo of parked in dock 00 .
negative	so i returned to the hertz desk and told the supervisor that i thought it was rather strange to see so many parked in their dock .
negative	he first feebly made the excuse that they were not their cars but another companies !!
negative	but when 0 men arrived to request a car , which he consulted his computer - amazingly now working !!!
negative	he found a car for them .
negative	he then tried to make up new excuses about the cars being finally hertz cars but had been previously booked months ahead , i told him i was not informed that it was hertz policy to guarantee cars only months ahead .
negative	i now look_forward to receiviong a prompt refund and will take up this legally as i consider it to be very serious that you have accepted a booking and accepted the payment but then invent excuses when the customer arrives at the collection_point .
negative	i note i have previosuly and even now accepted your terms & conditions but maybe we coustomers should write up some for you !!!!
negative	!
negative	a very disappointed and angry ex customer
negative	marie ann morrison
negative	i tried to cancel the order but i had to send a email and wait for them to read it supposedly in 00 to 00_hrs .
negative	i received the order before i received an answer to my email , ten days after i placed the order and canceled it .
negative	i order on the web every day and i don_'_t ever have this kind of service .
negative	never again .
negative	i thought that i was talking to a marriot reservation clerk .
negative	i told him that i was reserving the fairfield because of their indoor_pool .
negative	well i arrived at the hotel in fairmont , wv .
negative	; the pool would be shut_down for 0 month for maintance .
negative	next , i tried to contact the epexida number and they transfer me to another expedia number and i was cut_off because i could not answer the digital answering system fast enough .
negative	for now on i will contact hotel_directly .
negative	i really deserve a refund or credit from this company .
negative	the several faxes / e_- mails i '_ve sent to expedia since yesterday :
negative	yesterday i tried to book a trip chicago with my visa_debit_card .
negative	in canada , it is a debit bank card that allows us to make online purchases .
negative	at the end of my booking , i was informed that the order would not be processed and i assumed it was because it was a debit visa , not a credit_card visa .
negative	an_hour later , i noticed on my online_banking that expedia had withdrawn $_000 . 00 from my bank_account .
negative	i was on the phone last night several_times and spoke to several people .
negative	i was on hold for a total of 00_minutes .
negative	no one would listen to me and kept insisting it was just a credit_card authorization .
negative	it was not .
negative	your company physically removed that money from my bank_account which i absolutely did not authorize you to do .
negative	your customer_service reps are rude , spoke over me and yes , i was angry , however , putting me on hold and not coming_back is unacceptable .
negative	if one of them would have just listened to what i said , i may have been more successful in explaining my issue .
negative	the " authorization " does not need to be " dropped ", i require a refund back into my bank_account of the money , and i want that money returned immediately .
negative	this is the worst_experience i have ever had booking a trip .
negative	do not use this company !!
negative	i have no trip and they have $_000 . 00 of my money !
negative	i pay $_00 dollars a month & yet my credit_report is almost $ months behind !!!
negative	why should i pay a monthly fee if the site doesn_'_t update !!!
negative	!
negative	i am very disappointed with my recent experience with priceline and won_'_t be using them again .
negative	i made a reservation for 0 nights .
negative	i was required to prepay but , the reservation could be cancelled by 00noon the day before arrival .
negative	i needed to cancel the last night of the reservation and called in the afternoon the day before arrival - i was not able to cancel the last night and could no_longer could cancel the whole reservation without_penalty .
negative	i didn_'_t see any information that said i could not change this reservation - i thought since i could cancel the day before , that would certainly allow 00 + hours notice to cancel the last night - not so .
negative	i also was not a good consumer with the purchase at all .
negative	the price was only $ 0 . 00 cheaper per_night than the rate offered directly by the hotel with my aaa_discount .
negative	lesson_learned again : shop around - compare prices - ask about everything in advance before giving out that credit_card number .
negative	i have never been treated so poorly in my life by customer_service reps !
negative	they are completely outrageous !
negative	i tried to book 0 roundtrip tickets and a car_rental .
negative	the website kept telling_me it couldn_'_t book it , so i needed to call the customer_service line .
negative	after_spending 0 hours on hold , i finally got through to someone .
negative	my package deal was $ 0 , 000 when i was booking online .
negative	by the time i got through to the lady , it had gone up to $ 0 , 000 .
negative	she told me that they couldn_'_t honor the price on my screen since i hadn_'_t booked before it went up .
negative	the only_reason i hadn_'_t booked was because the website was glitching and wouldn_'_t let_me .
negative	after her going back and forth with me for 00_minutes about how she couldn_'_t honor the price , i asked for a manager .
negative	she kept telling_me that i couldn_'_t talk to one until i insisted about 0 times .
negative	finally she said i still couldn_'_t talk to one but that she would honor the price .
negative	she was going through the booking process of getting me on the flights and told me she was going to put me on hold .
negative	after 00_minutes of being on hold , i was transferred to another person completely !
negative	that person said they couldn_'_t transfer me back to the original person and i had to re - explain my situation with them .
negative	they refused to honor the price and this time the flight had gone up another $_00 !
negative	by this point i had been on the phone for 0 hours and 00_minutes .
negative	i eventually agreed to pay the higher price , so we were going through the book process and then the lady told me that none of my flights worked together .
negative	and i asked her to explain , and she said that i just needed to pick new flights completely !
negative	she said i wouldn_'_t be able to make any of the planes between my layovers .
negative	my layovers were between 0 - 0 hours and they were in small airports .
negative	it would not have been a problem .
negative	i '_ve flown several_hundred times and have rarely had problems with making connecting_flights .
negative	so i told them that they had horrible customer_service and that i would go somewhere_else .
negative	completely ridiculous .
negative	not helpful at all !
negative	oh !
negative	and they charged my credit_card 00 times !
negative	do not use them .
negative	it '_s not worth it .
negative	one day after giving you my mobile number i received a spam / scam text_message from a uk number .
negative	i have reason to believe you onsold my number and i will be very wary of using your service again .
negative	the book i rented isnt even consider a book its just a bunch a papers held together with a rubber band .
negative	gave_me a smoking_room . could not take a shower it would not turn on . very upset with the stay
negative	i ordered 0 items on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	there was no_indication that the items were out - of - stock .
negative	i received a confirmation_email indicating my order would be shipped in 0 - 0 business days .
negative	today i check my order status and the page indicated my order had been cancelled .
negative	i was never notified and am now out of the products i ordered and in dire need of them .
negative	it is unbelievable that i can order something , receive a confirmation and the order be cancelled and never notify me .
negative	since signing_up and paying the premium price i cannot see my scores or my credit_report .
negative	how about a refund and ill move on .
negative	see above statement
negative	ive booked a number of hotels with agoda .
negative	when it works well - in other words , no need for trouble shooting or customer_service - its a good deal .
negative	when it does not work well - when there is problem that requires support - it is awful .
negative	one problem i had recently is i booked a hotel in europe .
negative	it was unclear from my confirmation_email that , in fact , the booking went through booking . com and that i should contact booking . com for troubleshooting support .
negative	it was also unclear in the confirmation_email that the payment would me made a the hotel .
negative	i was unable to get through to customer_service - apparently my agoda booking id had been erased in the system .
negative	i got through the system using another agoda booking id and then spent 00_minutes on the phone talking to customer_service sorting it out , and asking them to make some simple revisions to the confirmation_email so that , to customers , it was perfectly clear what implications of bookings passed to sister agencies would be .
negative	the response was lukewarm .
negative	another issue i had was checking into a hotel in south_africa and the hotel had to record of my paid reservation .
negative	they did not want to accept my voucher and proof of purchase .
negative	they said that the voucher did not state the amount paid for the room .
negative	that was very awkward .
negative	took too long to ship order , customer_service was rude , not helpful at all .
negative	not worth my time
negative	buy from heat and plumb if you want good prices , don_'_t buy if you want good customer_service .
negative	very ready to take your money but not to sort out problems .
negative	i have been trying to get a refund from them for 0 months for goods that were either not supplied or returned .
negative	my telephone_calls and emails are not returned .
negative	the last time i did manage to speak to somebody she told she had enough of her own problems and i wasn_'_t her only customer .
negative	i am not making this up .
negative	i would not recommend heat and plumb .
negative	it is now a week since i ordered and i live on the gold coast - not a tin pot town in the country .
negative	i still_haven_'_t received my order .
negative	granted , anzac day fell in the middle - but that still makes it over four days !
negative	order sofa covers that looked great on the web_site .... they turn out to be cheap pieces of cloth that just slid off my leather sofa .
negative	misleading and now i have to pay shipping cost to send back .
negative	will never order anything from this company again !
negative	cheap !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i paid for the card plus an extra processing_fee .
negative	the money was almost_immediately deducted from my debit_card .
negative	website said it was delivered .
negative	two_weeks_later it still isn_'_t .
negative	the tracking_number they provided was not a valid number , according to usps .
negative	i tried_calling customer_service but there was no option to speak to a person unless i wanted to place an order .
negative	i used " email contact " on website and received automated reply then , ten hours_later , i got this request to rate their services .
negative	i would be happy to amend this review if they resolve the issue .
negative	still no reply indicating they have any intention of addressing my complaint .
negative	i actually purchased the card for a family whose house burned down so it would have been nice if they could have had the card in a timely_manner .
negative	i spent some time talking with a couple of agents before making my reservation for a car with a pick_up in florence .
negative	i made it clear that my husband and i would be traveling with a bag each and although we were up for a small - ish car , we would need to transport ourselves and our_luggage for a week .
negative	i arranged for a 0 door car with room for bags .
negative	after taking the train from rome , walking through the streets of florence with our bags , and finally finding the avis station in florence , the agent told us that she only had smart cars available , that this was the class we had reserved , and that she could give us a much bigger car and only charge us for a car 0 classes larger .
negative	we had a bit of a language_barrier and i told her that there was no way we could fit both ourselves and our_luggage into such a small car and there was no way i would have reserved one .
negative	she reiterated that she would give us a deal on a larger car and that we had ordered the smart car .
negative	she had no other cars available and appeared frustrated with my inability to understand that i had ordered this tiny car .
negative	hot , tired , and bummed , i told her that i would call auto_europe to straighten it out .
negative	as i sat_down with my luggage in the somewhat busy waiting area and started to call , she " found " a volkswagen in the garage which she arranged for us to have at no extra_charge .
negative	because she was so nice .
negative	long_story short , although the car was fine and i ultimately got it at the agreed_upon price , i could have done without the drama .
negative	traveling can be a challenge , and i booked with auto_europe well ahead of time so i could avoid exactly this sort of hassle .
negative	i '_m guessing that most people just pay the extra_cost to avoid this sort of unpleasantness in the middle of their vacations , but that doesn_'_t make it good business_practice .
negative	tredmill delivered next_day delivery , paid for , for a christmas_present .
negative	the tredmill consequently wasn_'_t working , now unable to get a replacement for the next ten days .
negative	all we want is somekind of idea when this , what we though was a great christmas_present , will be replaced .
negative	wrong part was sent .
negative	can not get through on the phone - hangs_up on me when i press the right extension .
negative	trying to get return_label but the option is broken on the web_site .
negative	i hope it is fixed within 00 days so i can get my money back .
negative	too many little issues make me not want to use this company again .
negative	sorry too busy as have wasted enough time on this problem
negative	i was contacted by the flight_centre a couple of months_ago and was told that british airways had bumped me off my flight .
negative	i was moved to the next_day by flight_centre and change my return flight as well .
negative	i was led to believe that this was ba '_s fault and not the fault of the flight_centre and was assured that i was on the upgrade list and that hopefully i would get an upgrade on my flight .
negative	i happened to be talking to a friend of a friend who works for ba recently who informed me that be that they never bump people of flights until the actual day of the flight .
negative	this made me suspicious and i then did some digging and discovered that it was actually the flight_centre '_s fault .
negative	the flight_centre gave_me $_000 (£_000 ) to compensate me for the inconvenience and fact that i now have to get extra hotel accommodation .
negative	i am extremely disappointed that after having used flight_centre for a couple of years_now for all my many flights to florida , they could not be honest with me about their mistake .
negative	can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been if we turned_up on the day of our flight assuming it was ba '_s fault and asking for an upgrade ?
negative	!
negative	i don_'_t plan to use the flight_centre again any time soon !
negative	dont honor coupons that they put on facebook .
negative	the only place that sold that particular shoe , other then that would not shop with them .
negative	my new glasses i have had for not even a week and my right lens is now missing and do not know where it is it fell out last night , cant find it .
negative	i am verry disapointed
negative	tried to order the fre lifeproof case for an iphone 0 .
negative	i ordered this as a birthday_gift 0_weeks prior to when i needed it .
negative	was supposed to receive in 0 days but did not .
negative	credit_card was charged immediately .
negative	waited 00 days and contacted by website , they did not reply .
negative	called , no answer .
negative	0 . 0_weeks_later reached a live_person .
negative	said he needed to check if my credit_card had been charged ( i told him it had ) because it shouldn_'_t have been if the product was not sent .
negative	then said he had no internet service and would need to call me back !!
negative	what kind of " business " has no internet ?!
negative	of course , he did not call me back .
negative	called again , now 0_weeks after my credit_card was charged and still no product .
negative	he told me he would have to cancel the order !
negative	why ?!!
negative	the product is still available to purchase even today !!
negative	horrible
negative	waiting 00_minutes for pick_up at terminal is unacceptable .
negative	office personnel were rude and unhelpful .
negative	never again .
negative	this was my second time ordering probiotics from them .
negative	the first time i didn_'_t chose the refrigerated option because it was the middle of winter .
negative	this time i wanted to chose it but when i reordered it didn_'_t give me the option .
negative	so in the section where you can ask i question / leave a comment i asked if it would ship cold .
negative	no one responded to me so i called the next_day .
negative	i was told my order had already shipped and they probably just put an ice pack in it .
negative	i told them i wanted it refrigerated and asked to speak to a supervisor .
negative	i was told the supervisor was busy and just to ignore the package and return to sender .
negative	but then i was told that there would be a wait for another shipment because they were out of what i needed .
negative	the customer help was rude and i received horrible service .
negative	i highly_recommend shopping elsewhere .
negative	i was quoted $_00 . 00 by textbookrush . com to buy back my brand_new algebra textbook that i paid $_000 . 00 for .
negative	i verified the isbn_number from the book and the packing_slip from the company where i had purchased it from .
negative	i had dropped my online algebra class and couldn_'_t use it on campus .
negative	they have received this brand_new never used textbook and claim a different isbn_number was on the book and are only sending me a check for $_00 . 00 .
negative	thought their quote was too good to be true .
negative	what a bunch of crooks !
negative	beware when selling them your textbooks because from what i '_m reading this is a common_practice with them .
negative	scammers
negative	i have contacted metroswimshop twice_now about my order , which for two_weeks has shown in their system as " processed ."
negative	i just want to know when to expect my order , or if it '_s not coming at all !
negative	i have not heard back from them about my email requests and have not received any automatic notifications as to my status .
negative	will not be using them again .
negative	service is awful !!!
negative	!
negative	this service came up when i searched online for a specific hotel and the web address and 0 - 000 number led me to believe i was reserving at that hotel .
negative	not so !
negative	i arrived at the hotel to find out my reservation was invalid and that i had booked through a third_party service .
negative	fortunately booking directly at the hotel was cheaper but i still had to spend twenty_minutes trying to get the false reservation cancelled and my card refunded .
negative	due to a mix - up between superdry and the company in charge of delivering the item , i never received the item .
negative	the delivery company " attempted " delivery on numerous_occasions , and despite repeat attempts to provide very specific instructions on how to reach me , as well as my contact information , i was never contacted .
negative	the package was " attempted " to be delivered over the course of 00 days , and after days of communicating between superdry and dhl , i asked that the item be returned because i didn_'_t think i would ever receive the item .
negative	it has_been one week since superdry has confirmed my return , yet i have not received nor received any updates on my refund .
negative	horrible horrible service , will never attempt an online purchase again .
negative	0 meses e nada do meu produto chegar !!

negative	i am usually very happy with my boohoo products i have bought in the past .
negative	all have been great quality clothing an footwear , although my most_recent_purchase was a white maxi_dress i ordered for a christening i loved the look of the dress online so i orderd the dress and got next_day delivery so i would have it in time .
negative	when i received my order and tried it on i was disappointed as the material was completely see through .
negative	i sent the dress back explaining that it was not described as on website to my disguist i received a refund for the dress but still got charged for delivery .
negative	it has put me off buying from boohoo as i payed for delivery for an item i would not have ordered if i new it was see through and will not be buying online if this is the service i receive .
negative	total dissatified ...
negative	my large 0ft x0ft headboard was wedged into my open fronted porch , i did not know it was being delivered , it was hammering down with rain , so you can guess i was not amused , no delivery note , obviously did not sign for , luckily only .
negative	slight water mark at base .
negative	this was a very expensive hand made head board , and had i not come home when i did or was not able to move it ( which i did struggle with ) things would have been a lot worse .
negative	consignment no zdbdweooo000 .
negative	whilst the items i ordered are fab , the delivery was way below standard .
negative	i received a dispatch email_stating that i would be called within two_days to arrange a suitable day .
negative	i wasn_'_t contacted , the delivery just turned_up two_days_later .
negative	i wasn_'_t there to take delivery so they left it outside the front of the house .
negative	the email said i had twenty_minutes to check the items .
negative	i wasn_'_t given the chance .
negative	very poor service , particularly when delivery cost a fortune .
negative	dear petflow
negative	this review will not be a good review .
negative	my old cat , jack , was recently_diagnosed with kidney disease .
negative	the vet said he should eat prescription k / d cat_food .
negative	so i placed an order for two cases .
negative	jack hates the food and won_'_t eating .
negative	i called to return the unopened and untouched cat_food .
negative	pet_flow said : no returns .
negative	what ??
negative	this is a $_00 purchase .
negative	i should be been warned !
negative	very unhappy and will never use petflow again
negative	i have bought two tickets to the barcelona vs ac milan game in less_than two_weeks and still have not even received confirmation about the tickets being sent .!!
negative	as i will be travelling to spain i need these tickets before i leave this is a disgrace and with all the reviews i don_'_t know what is going on !
negative	my id is 0000000
negative	ck ' d around and i could have saved $_00 by booking on the hotels website .
negative	i booked a hotel and was told i could call any time to make chages to my reservation either upgrade room make_changes etc .
negative	i called to upgrade my room i was told by a different agent my reservation had restrictions and couldnt make any changes , i explained thats not what i was told at the time of me paying for the darn room .
negative	i will not be cooking here ever again this people are not professional they need to further train the agemts so they can provide their customer with correct information .
negative	order process slow
negative	we are still_waiting for our giants gear to be shipped .
negative	we thought we would be able to wear our gear during the world series .
negative	now that it hasn_'_t shipped as of 0 days after we ordered we are left disappointed .
negative	won_'_t be ordering from them again .
negative	in fact i think i want my money back ... i could have gotten shirts at walmart for a fraction of the price and could be wearing them now to cheer on our team .
negative	boo .
negative	worts customer_service ever
negative	i sold 0 mobiles to envirofone on 00 / 00 / 00 to the vaue of just over_£_00 .
negative	the envelope took 00 days to arrive .
negative	by the time the mobiles arrived to envirofone , i received an_email which showed the value had dropped to £_00 . 00 .
negative	i was not offered the mobiles returned as a result ( the value was worth more on mazuma at this point )..
negative	the cheque then still took over 0_weeks to arrive so took around 0 month from the start to end process .
negative	i have used mazuma twice in the past who are fantastic and the full process is sorted within 0 day .
negative	my mobiles are still worth more through mazuma than what i received from envirofone .
negative	i only used envirofone as their price at the beginning was more than mazuma , but i ended_up getting less in the end .
negative	very disappointed and will not use envirofone again !
negative	bought a dress , sent back waited ages for refund ... emailed - they told me they refund would be within the week , never recieved the money and actually forgot as i had just expected it to go in .... emailed again and eventually got the money put back in the following_day after email ...... just don_'_t forget about things as i easily do !

negative	not good
negative	i went online to book at a hampton_inn in oxford , ohio , and when i got my confirmation_email i realized i booked through a 0rd_party .... you .
negative	this was a surprise to me since i thought i was booking through hampton_inn .
negative	i was also then disappointed to see i had to cancel , if needed , 00_hours before my stay .
negative	that is not standard for a hotel booking .
negative	i am familiar with the standard of having until 0pm or later on the day of the stay , not 00_hours before .
negative	i will now be very much more aware of you and other 0rd parties butting into my booking experience .
negative	i have actually ordered from frames_direct about 0 times now , and this last time was definately my last , i am tired of being taken_advantage of , so i ordered , they messed_up my prescription on one of the eyes ( right ) she told me to send them back , they will correct and send it back to me 0nd day ups , they sent it back , regular mail , and i received it late , i was already out of the country by the time it got delivered , framesdirect just doesnt keep their word , and i am not spending a single dollar there anymore
negative	we booked a car_rental through priceline for a 0 - day trip to florida .
negative	pickup was in ft . lauderdale and drop_off in west palm_beach .
negative	our initial offer was refused , and we were not offered a car until we agreed to their lowest_price of $_00 / day plus tax , which brought our total to $_000 .
negative	shortly_after booking a non_- refundable car_rental through budget , we saw advertised on priceline '_s site , a rental base price of $_00 / day through alamo , the company we wanted in the first place .
negative	we called priceline and spoke to a staff_member and a supervisor , who basically told us " too bad " and would not change the booking or adjust the price .
negative	the ft . lauderdale budget car_rental desk was total chaos , a long line with almost an_hour '_s wait to get the car .
negative	the desk was understaffed , with 0 of their 00 computer stations not occupied .
negative	we were told by an employee that " it had been like that all week ", so this was not a fluke .
negative	under no circumstances should you rent from budget in ft . lauderdale !
negative	we were also told that they had the cheapest prices , hence the crowds , but this was not so as_described above .
negative	the car itself was fine , once we got it .
negative	the experience was unpleasant from the beginning .
negative	i was mislead and feel_like i was even being ' scammed '.
negative	i was online on what i thought was the comfort suites website and called your number thinking it was the comfortsuites reservation desk .
negative	i got a guy_who could_barely speak_english so it was hard to understand .
negative	i told him i was part of a group trying to make reservations for the lake george location .
negative	he convinced me to book it immediately because there were only 0 rooms left .
negative	we needed 0 rooms .
negative	so i booked it .
negative	i thought it was odd that he required full payment since i always pay just a deposit then pay the balance when we check in .
negative	but i gave my visa_card .
negative	when i got my email_confirmation i noticed he had booked me at the wrong hotel !!!
negative	wrong city !!!
negative	he booked me in saratoga springs instead of lake george !!!!
negative	how stupid can that be !!?!?!?!?!
negative	i called your customer_service immediately and told them what happened and want a credit .
negative	i was told that could not happen for 0 days .
negative	today is day 0 ........
negative	i want a credit on my account immediately .
negative	this is totally_unacceptable and i will now be very cautious about booking thru a reservation desk again ........
negative	very bad_experience and i '_m very angry ..............
negative	do not use .
negative	i bought two gift_cards the same day the people live 00_minutes from each other , one person got the gift_card before_xmas still_waiting on the other .
negative	the rep just rushed to get me off the phone .
negative	i placed an order for an unlock my iphone on november 0th .
negative	at the time , keys0iphone '_s site said my order would be completed in 0 - 0 days .
negative	on the fourth day ( november 00 ), i sent them an_email_asking for an update .
negative	there was no response .
negative	i had ordered the unlocking for an international trip the last_week of november -- and i ordered with this company based on the good reviews online , along with their presented window .
negative	unfortunately , my trip came and went without_any change in my order status .
negative	on december_00th , i sent another email .
negative	no response .
negative	about that time , i started checking out their facebook_page and noticed that i wasn_'_t the only person having problems .
negative	there were lots of posts asking for status_updates , complaining_about no contact , and requesting refunds .
negative	many of them were deleted within a few hours .
negative	on dec_00th , i sent keys0iphone a message on facebook and posted on their wall , asking if they had any type of update .
negative	my message was read , but not responded to .
negative	my wall post was deleted .
negative	i then followed_up with another email , which was never responded to .
negative	today , january third , i once again posted on their wall asking for an update , but i don_'_t anticipate i '_ll get any response .
negative	i see they are replying to some posters here , so maybe this will get me the customer_service response i '_ve been trying to get for almost two months .
negative	here '_s the thing : sometime in october , att borked the whole unlocking system by changing their protocol .
negative	i get that .
negative	i '_m totally understanding of that .
negative	in fact , because i knew that fact sometime around the end of november , i made sure to be extra understanding in my dealings with keys0iphone .
negative	given the situation , i didn_'_t expect an instantaneous unlock or anything -- in fact , i understood that there were delays beyond even their control .
negative	that '_s totally fine .
negative	what '_s not ok is not responding to repeated_requests for updates -- even if your update is just that you ' re not sure of a time_frame .
negative	six attempts at contact and literally no response .
negative	i will say that in monitoring their facebook_page , i noticed that they are deleting a lot of bad posts from unhappy_customers .
negative	in addition to that , they '_ve responded to a few people with an excessive amount of glib and snark ( just my opinion of course )-- basically telling them that if they are unhappy with waiting , they can get a refund , but they '_ll make_sure the phone will be stuck locked forever .
negative	i don_'_t get that last part , because if you haven_'_t even started an order , why would you do that ?
negative	threats and bullying in the face of customers just wanting * some * answer is not exactly good business_practice .
negative	i '_m sure this post is going to get me blacklisted , too , but i assure you that even now , i ' d be happy if they just apologized for the lack of communication and said we could move forward ( with better communication , of course ).
negative	i '_m sympathetic to them getting shafted by a phone company , but you '_ve got to keep in contact with your customers .
negative	if you need to go out and grab something for a night out on the town , this is your go to place , otherwise forget it .
negative	don_'_t expect anything from that store to last more than a few washings , or the first washing , if you ' re lucky .
negative	quality of their product is very very poor .
negative	make_sure to look over anything you ' re planning to buy very thoroughly , i '_ve bought a few things that have been defective , only to notice after tags were cut .
negative	the store is very cramped and crowded , it '_s hard to find anything .
negative	they ' re lucky not many people can_afford a quality product these days .
negative	expect to hand_wash everything if you don_'_t want it to completely be destroyed .
negative	even then you have to be careful with printed dyes and whatnot bleeding on the rest of the shirt .
negative	well if they read the orig .
negative	email that states all the info they needed to do this transaction instead f postponing the response i had to e_- mail them three_times each time took 00_hours to get a response right there just from them not being_able to read the first e_- mail that is 0 days there are only 0 days in a business week there fore over the weekend was added to it .
negative	needless to say i really wanted this company to work out for me but unfortunately you get what you pay for in this case manufacture defects .
negative	if i had received the item i had actually ordered , i might have something positive to write here !
negative	i thought this company has very bad customer_service .
negative	i accidentally hit the express shipping and contacted them by email and phone and they would not do anything to help me .
negative	no credit or nothing .
negative	i will not order from them ever again .
negative	i rented an apartment for six_months in copenhagen .
negative	during that time i was responsible for paying the energy bill for the apartment .
negative	dong sends a bill every three_months .
negative	i paid two energy bills and an ' overage ' charge of 000 dkk .
negative	i thought that the account was paid in full and i was done .
negative	a week_later , i received yet another bill from dong .
negative	they were trying to charge me for an_additional three_months of service after i moved out !
negative	i called an got no resolution from telephone customer_service ( i admit - i don_'_t speak danish well , they could not resolve this in english ) so i paid a visit to the dong headquarters in gentoff denmark ( wayyyyyy outside of copenhagen ).
negative	they insisted that i owed the sum even_though their records showed that this new bill was for a period of time i did not reside in the apartment !
negative	there has_been no resolution with dong and they refuse to admit that the bill was an_error .
negative	i am not at all happy with this .
negative	okay , when i moved to germany i got a two year contract with vodafone .
negative	they told me that if i left germany permanently , i could cancel out the contract with no fees and no problem .
negative	a year later , i had to relocate to denmark .
negative	i showed all of the paperwork that i was leaving germany and vodafone refused to allow me to cancel the contract !
negative	their excuse was that i could still use the phone in denmark ( at 0 . 00_euro a minute ) so they couldn_'_t cancel the contract .
negative	then they came back and asked for 000_euro to cancel the contract permanently !
negative	what a terrible thing for vodafone to do to expats !
negative	said they will take books back but when they receive the books they say they only want one .
negative	then they say if you want your book back then pay money for it back .
negative	i don_'_t see that is fair and when asked about it they say they have it on there site .
negative	they were not helpful other the .
negative	where to read .
negative	i am not using them ever again
negative	i tried worthpoints 0 day free_trial because i wanted to look something up and find its value .
negative	i did not find it and went into unsubscribe the very same day i signed_up because i did not want to forget and get charges .
negative	it said my cancellation went through but i noticed they were charging me every_month for the past 0 months .
negative	and double dipping !
negative	0 - $ 0 . 00 charges a couple days apart each and every_month since august_0000 .
negative	i emailed and called and they simply refused to help me or even consider crediting me back for the charges .
negative	do not trust them .
negative	i even googled them and they also have goantiques . com and other_sites .
negative	i also found them on the bbb with a " f " rating with many complaints just like mine !
negative	they simply are not trustworthy so do not give them your credit_card info because if you ever do cancel they mysteriously say ... " no you did not ."
negative	and they will not work with you to help you .
negative	i purchased the ultimate_game card via online delivery to use for lord of the rings online for my son .
negative	there seems to be no possible way to use this card .... the directions for redeeming the online game card do not fit what shows up in the lotr checkout , and when entering the key code it does not work .
negative	i will never use pcgamesupply nor purchase an ultimate_game card ever again ... i just wasted 00 dollars .
negative	i was searching for a solution for my problem hair , which is not split , but dry and rough feeling on the ends of the middle layers , but only at the back .
negative	biolustre description sounded_like it was made for me , so i coughed up £_00 . 00 .
negative	product arrived_promptly , but is complete rubbish !
negative	despite following the instructions to the letter it did no good at all .
negative	don_'_t waste your money on this !
negative	if we could we would give this a negative rating .
negative	bought a visa_gift_card for my mom and had it sent to her address of record .
negative	she went to use it at her nail salon and after she left the place found out they charged her automatically 00_% for a tip , she found this out because she went to her hair salon and found out there was not enough left on it to pay her hair stylist , how embarrassing .
negative	after the fact i went to their website to watch a tutorial and they tell you there if you do not want the 00_% taken out to make_sure to tell the business that and you will tip them yourself .
negative	how conniving and deceiving this whole outfit is !.
negative	never again will we do gift_cards !
negative	they charge you a processing_fee and shipping fee which i knew about , but was ok with it because it was a gift .
negative	and they did not use the picture we used to customize the card with , they put it on the paper the card was attached to .
negative	total ripoff ... do not use this company , especially with vd coming up .
negative	half the flowers ( roses ) were nearly_dead by the time they were delivered .
negative	delivery time was not what they promised .
negative	customer_support was horrible !
negative	buy at your own risk .
negative	i have returned items over 0_weeks_ago and still have no acknowledgement of receipt of the the return or any sign of a refund .
negative	not happy will not be using boohoo again
negative	the cartridges didn_'_t fit my printer .
negative	it made me choose a star , i wouldn_'_t have chosen 0_star
negative	i ordered and paid for $_00 worth of seeds through this website and received confirmation of my order .
negative	despite several emails and phone_calls , the seeds never arrived and no one has ever replied to my communications .
negative	i learned too late , from reviews on other_sites , that this is not unusual for this company .
negative	buyer_beware !
negative	you ' re taking a gamble when you order with this outfit .
negative	called a number of times .
negative	kept telling_me it would be shipped .
negative	was going on trip out of the country .
negative	had to cancel order and purchase locally .
negative	i made a reservation for a hotel which said in the first line of the cancellation_policy , " we realize your plans change and you can cancel your reservation ......" after making the reservation i immediately cancelled it , within 0 minutes , because the cancellation_policy stated further that i would be charged a 00_% cancellation_fee .
negative	i called and spoke with a gentleman_who was reading a script and put me on hold 0 times , only to be told to call tomorrow .
negative	the next_day i got a woman_who was more helpful , put me on hold 0 times , and then said that she would call me back the next_day .... it '_s been 0 days and i still have not heard from anyone and my issue is not resolved .
negative	i do not want to pay a cancellation_fee for a mistake , an oversight on the cancellation_policy , which i tried to fix immediately .
negative	i had booked my two girlfriends in a private_room and myself in a share dorm ( so 0pax in total , all confirmed ); when we got to the hostel , they only had a bkng for 0pax both in the share dorm .
negative	hostel had no private_rooms available , we had to split and my friends ( who had never stayed in a hostel before and really didn_'_t want to share ) had to stay in a mixed dorm .
negative	we lost the whole afternoon trying to sort this out .
negative	my friends were furious and this killed the mood .
negative	the hostel staff was super nice and i know it wasn_'_t their fault , but totally hostelworld '_s .
negative	i ' d like hostelworld to pay me back my 00_% deposit as a small compensation for the stress they caused me ... if that happens , i '_ll have a different opinion and might book through it again , if not , that '_s it - i '_ll just check the list of hostels and then will book it directly
negative	bookit . com failed to notify me that there are no shuttles from my destination airport to my resort - 00_miles_away because i " booked online ".
negative	when i called they told me that if i had called in to an agent to make reservations then thy would have notified me .
negative	isn_'_t the name & purpose of bookit . com to do it online ??!!!
negative	now , 0 days before my trip i am out an extra $_000 because i have to pay for a limo to shuttle my family , a there are no other available transportation methods at thi point .
negative	also i ne ' er received an_email_confirmation until i called to ensure my reservation had been made & had to ask them to send me this information !!
negative	!
negative	today i received a phone_call & email to please contact them regarding the problems i had with this company .
negative	they still did nothing to rectify the problems .
negative	they did not offer to help in any way except to apologize & say to me again that it is my fault for booking online & not calling in to speak wih a professional .
negative	they did tell me how sorry they are , however .
negative	then again , everybody knows that actions speak louder than words .
negative	i did not order what i received and i am thoroughly annoyed .
negative	it '_s as if they just picked_up anything and sent it to me .
negative	not impressed as i needed this nail colour for a big occasion and now what do i do
negative	i '_ve been using travelocity for years to book all of my travel needs .
negative	i also have a travelocity credit_card .
negative	my mac was recently in the shop for a spring cleaning and my cookies were deleted .
negative	so when i booked a recent_trip from montana to chicago and back , i hadn_'_t realized that i didn_'_t sign in and was automatically registered as a guest .
negative	when i went to update my travelocity app i noticed that my flight wasn_'_t being referenced , and using some deductive reasoning , i thought to myself " dratz !
negative	i dropped my cookies !"
negative	so i called travelocity to make_sure i got the credit for my miles and i was told " too bad ... too late ."
negative	what ?
negative	i hadn_'_t even flown yet !
negative	back up !
negative	nope .
negative	" no can do ."
negative	" may i please speak to a manager ," i replied .
negative	" he '_s going to tell you the same thing .
negative	there '_s no way to transfer it from a guest into your name ."
negative	to which i said " of course there is , we can change anything if we want to .
negative	i '_ll hold for a manager ."
negative	while on hold , i got disconnected .
negative	i just booked another flight to chicago directly via united .
negative	with device like that , why use them ?
negative	i originally order a pair of frames and after not hearing anything for a week , i contacted them via their chat service .
negative	their reps are trained to give you the run_around because you can never get straight answers regarding what is going on with your order .
negative	eventually once i asked for a refund magically the order was defective and they asked me to pick out another frame .
negative	i did that and did not hear_anything from them for another week .
negative	again i contacted them through the chat service and again was given the run_around .
negative	i asked for a refund once again because i am tired of the crap and then he said oh it shipped out yesterday but two_days_later there is still no tacking number or anything .
negative	this company is a joke , they are scamming people and their customer_service is horrid !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	i simply want my money back but they will not honor my wishes .
negative	that is pure bullshit !
negative	i e_- mailed gadgetgrotto to ask where is my item the camera helmet which i paid for on 00th_november , still had no reply to my e_- mail and obviously no item , not a happy_bunny and although you have many cool products i will pay the extra few_pounds and get excellent service from your competitiors like amazon .
negative	ordered two pair of designer_glasses .
negative	first pair took over 0 month , and still_waiting on second with no word on when it will ship .
negative	had been waiting for 0st pair so long , then opened box to find it packed in a cheap plastic_bag inside an even cheaper looking soft vinyl case .
negative	these were ysl glasses -- expensive .
negative	the site promises that glasses will come with all manufacturer '_s packaging .
negative	not true .
negative	no papers , no cloth , no case .
negative	i have to wonder_if these are simply chinese counterfeits .
negative	i am so disappointed with framesdirect , i cannot begin to describe .
negative	meanwhile , since i needed glasses , i ordered two pair from coastal and received both within one ( 0 ) week , along with cleaning_cloth , lens cleaner , and original designer cases .
negative	plus , coastal had better prices and much_better customer_service .
negative	go_ahead and buy from framesdirect if you want , but just be aware that it may take_forever and a day , with little to no contact or customer_service or information on your order , and the glasses may well not come with original packaging ( as_promised on the website and is de rigeur for any designer_glasses anywhere ).
negative	what a waste of money ( yeah , close to $ 0 , 000 ).
negative	never again .
negative	i was mislead by the original representative , who made me believe i was going to be getting an upgraded suite at the government rate .
negative	when i checked in and it was just a regular room , i called to complain and was again mislead by another representative whom told me she would esculate my issue to her manager and that i would receive a phone_call or email within 00_hours .
negative	when no email or phone_call was received , i called again and they told me the record said i had tried to call to cancel .
negative	never use this company , i was told lie after lie and never had my issue_resolved .
negative	note : i am rating them 0_star due to unacceptable experience .
negative	at no time was anyone ever rude to me .
negative	this is an attempt to get resolution to my situation that has not been resolved over several phone_calls and emails .
negative	in february_0000 , i booked a hotel stay through_travelocity . com .
negative	my credit_card statement and the email_confirmation reflect this .
negative	however , when i called on april 0 , 0000 to alter the days of my stay customer_service was not able to locate my reservation using the itinerary_number that they issued to me .
negative	after holding for several minutes they determined that my stay was booked through_expedia . com .
negative	what ?
negative	how is that even possible ?
negative	okay ... so they gave_me the phone_number to call expedia . com .
negative	first i tried to call the hotel to see if i could just make_adjustments directly through the hotel .
negative	no dice .
negative	they said that it was indeed booked through_expedia . com and told me i needed to make alteration through_expedia . com .
negative	i called expedia . com and of course they were not able to find my reservation with the travelocity . com itinerary_number .
negative	i was again put on hold and after about 00_minutes i gave up .
negative	i called travelocity back and went through the whole spiel again .
negative	this call lasted 00_minutes and resulted in their determination that it was booked through_travelocity legacy .
negative	i was either transferred and disconnected or given another number to call .
negative	not sure .
negative	most of that time was spent on hold while the kindly lady , who assured_me she would get to the root of the issue , investigated .
negative	i had to hang up after 00_minutes to attend to other life issues .
negative	i gave online customer_service a try on april 0 .
negative	i simply told them my itinerary_number , contact info and a note stating my issue .
negative	the reply acknowledged the name of my hotel without my telling them .
negative	again it is evident they can see the reservation using my email .
negative	they asked for my itinerary_number again ( despite it having been provided in the first email ) > grrrr .
negative	email customer_service was a dead end .
negative	they apologized for the inconvenience and said i had to call them to resolve the issue .
negative	yay ....
negative	i called back on april 00 determined to get resolution .
negative	again i had to give the whole spiel to a new customer_service person .
negative	after many periods of explaining and being put on hold , he found my reservation and happily forwarded the confirmation to me .
negative	that '_s great but not what i wanted .
negative	he consulted with other representatives with more technical savvy and determined they could see my reservation but could not access my account to make_changes .
negative	he would have to transfer me to travelocity legacy .
negative	seriously wtf_?
negative	i begged him to not put me on hold .
negative	i asked if the person he was transferring me to would be briefed on the situation of if i would have to start from the beginning explain the story .
negative	unfortunately , he did not understand what i was asking .
negative	i was transferred and by this time i was super mad .
negative	i gave her the story up front and told her everything they told me about my account and it was as though she wasn_'_t even listening .
negative	" give me your itinerary_number please ," she said .
negative	this called lasted 0 hour and 00 freaking minutes .
negative	she eventually came to the conclusion herself that she could not alter my reservation on her system .
negative	she said she would call the hotel and talk with them and alter the days of my stay for me .
negative	i waited on hold while she did that .
negative	she got back on and said , " i was able to cancel the three_days and your credit_card will be refunded x - number of dollars ."
negative	> holy moly !!
negative	happy dance !
negative	< that was quickly deflated when i asked her to send me a confirmation number of this transaction .
negative	unfortunately since she was not able to make alterations on her system she could not generate a confirmation number .
negative	paranoid something was lost in translation and i would not have a reservation at all , i reviewed the days of my stay at_least three_times with her .
negative	it took a leap of faith to hang up and trust that my credit_card would be refunded .
negative	when i checked in at the hotel , the new departure_date was correct .
negative	whew .
negative	the hotel was great !
negative	it is now more than a month after that phone_call and my credit_card has still not been credited .
negative	i plan to call them back and fully expect zero results .
negative	in the meantime i shall flood the social_media outlets with this negative rant in hopes they are concerned_about their reputation .
negative	would i recommend them based on this experience ?
negative	absolutely not !
negative	i was contemplating a law suit .
negative	i was definitely discriminated against .
negative	i think that my instructor would not let_me pass and certify for this course because i am a massage_therapist and not a physical_therapist , or occupational therapist .
negative	i got a 00_% on the exam , did all the pre_- qualifying homework and passed every one of those tests .
negative	i took the full course , paid in full , and qualified for a " good " rating in my bandage wrapping .
negative	the instructor called me up in front of the class and drilled me on some of the questions that had i missed on the test , of which i passed with a 00_%.
negative	i did not know the answers , she got loud , enough for everyone to hear , and discussed why i should know these answers , and demanded that i agree with her .
negative	i told her if i agreed with her , that she would not pass me .
negative	i said , ' what it sounded_like to me is , that is what she wanted , that she was leading me to agree and she would fail me '.
negative	when i told her this , she said nothing further .
negative	as a 00 year veteran massage_therapist and instructor of massage , ( anthem college an 000 hour , full time position , of five years !)
negative	i felt that i would pass the practical ... well , i did not pass .
negative	i saw her complete attention on me , singling me out , during the practical , while my co - students - all of which , were physical therapists , were just " led to slide by " without the scrutiny of the instructor , which was on me .
negative	i felt i did the practical as well as my co - students .
negative	i was allowed another attempt at the practical .
negative	my instructor chose the most difficult , ( which i over heard other co - student pt '_s say was the hardest ).
negative	i did not pass , although as a massage_therapist myself , knowing that with practice , and more attention to instruction , am confident i would master these routines .
negative	the instructor said that i had perfect technique , but failed me due to a few mistakes in my routine !
negative	i also documented that i heard my instructor tell several other pt '_s ( when they asked why a massage_therapist was in the school ) that a " fly - by - night massage_therapist could not come in here for certification ".
negative	simply put , i was told when we started the class , that she would not fail anyone for the practical only , that we would have plenty of time to master the techniques .
negative	i failed to receive my certification for the practical only .
negative	i could recite the entire concept of anastomosis and the concept of mld .
negative	i passed all exams , and the bandaging .
negative	there is nothing else to pass except the routine !
negative	( which was biased and under the scrutiny of one single instructor !)
negative	i had practiced before the practical , with my fellow students , and could do the routines just as good as them , ( before testing in the practical !)
negative	but , she failed me , and i think it was strictly discriminatory .
negative	i firmly believe that your company only wants pt '_s and ot '_s to have this certification , and not massage therapists !
negative	travelocity has no problem with having the worst customer_service i have ever_seen .
negative	we booked a trip and had to cancel last_year .
negative	we got our money for the hotel but was told that the air fair could be used within on year of the travel dates .
negative	words from your customer_service .
negative	also said i could only use the fair for the same destination .
negative	both wrong .
negative	when i called to use it , i was told to call the airlines so i did .
negative	they told me you made a mistake and it was one year from the day of booking .
negative	.
negative	well after saving a year to take 0 adopted children on vacation we can not go cause we were past the date .
negative	hummm .
negative	nice .
negative	it '_s neither of your faults right .
negative	i will spend every day while i '_m working in the 00 malls i go too telling_everyone not to use either of you by just telling them my story .
negative	how '_s that for a review .
negative	both you and the airlines don_'_t care about the small fish in your ponds .. right ?
negative	only the money you make by pooing on the small folks .
negative	i bought a purse and 0 pair of jeans .
negative	i paid_extra to have them shipped faster ..... took 0 days .
negative	they said 0 to 0 days .
negative	they got extra money from me there .
negative	then i get the jeans on and thy rip up the back seam .
negative	i then try to return only to find that i pay the return shipping too , almost as much as i played for the crappy merchandise .
negative	so i won_'_t be returning the items , or myself to the website .
negative	the only_thing i can do at this point is cut my losses on the $_00 , and spread the word that this 00dollar_mall are thieves .
negative	it took a month to receive my order .
negative	way to long when you need glasses to see .
negative	i ordered you special on your blinking dog_bone , i got00 od round red light blinkers , you advertized bone ,
negative	not round red blinker , very disapointed
negative	all i can say after talking to a rep and a supervisor is wow !
negative	and i shout it sarcastically .
negative	i went to the site because a co - worker told me that halloweencostumes . com was advertising 00_%_off all costumes .
negative	i clicked on the site link and found the costume that i wanted .
negative	going through the checkout_process , i did not see the advertised promotion deduct from my total .
negative	after i received my receipt , i called customer_service and stated my case .
negative	the rep was very polite , told me that they had a glitch on their site , put me on hold a couple of times to seek counsel and then told me that they would give me 00_%_off instead and that i should keep an eye on my bank_statements ( plural ?
negative	how long will this take ?!)
negative	to see the credit .
negative	she didn_'_t tell me what the total credit would be , couldn_'_t give me a confirmation number and said i wouldn_'_t be getting an_email or anything ... and so i asked for a supervisor because it sounds a little shady .
negative	at that moment , i shouted to my co - worker to let her know that they weren_'_t honoring the 00_%_off so that she wouldn_'_t place her order and be in the unhappy state that i am in .
negative	ruben , a supervisor got on the phone and was also very polite as he nicely told me that there wasn_'_t much he could do .
negative	he explained to me that they were having problems with their emails giving old , expired promo_codes , that their it needed to update their site because they have gotten a lot of complaints about the advertised promotion , and that they were in the business to make money and he could not get an approval on the 00_%_discount because i basically didn_'_t spend enough .
negative	he rambled something to the extent that he can '_t give me my costume for half off what it '_s worth , which is really weird , because i wasn_'_t asking for 00_%.
negative	i explained to him that i wouldn_'_t have ordered from them if it weren_'_t for the 00_%_off ad on the website , and i '_m kicking myself for not buying the same costume through party city who is also running a 00_%_off promotion ( online and in - store with coupon ).
negative	ruben told me that they honor lowest_price match from other stores , but not on percentage_off promotions .
negative	i didn_'_t ask them to match another store '_s promotion ... i was asking them to match the one they advertised .
negative	maybe someone was typing in the credit , maybe someone was writing it down .
negative	after hearing the blah_blah_blah from them , i am more upset and think they should just honor the 00_%.
negative	the costume was $_00 . 00 plus $ 0 . 00 for shipping .
negative	( ha !
negative	he even told me that he couldn_'_t even give me free_shipping because i had to spend at_least $_00 .)
negative	wow !
negative	instead of dealing_with thomas cook who we found very good with other packages , our booking was taken over by olympic holidays .
negative	no boarding_passes or transfers via_email just very basic info re flights .
negative	did not specify which terminal our departure was from gatwick .
negative	it all worked out but not impressed .
negative	i ordered goods from you that i paid for on 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	i have never received this item which was a garden quoits game .
negative	despite sending 0 emails asking for details about my order i am yet to receive a reply .
negative	bad customer_service .
negative	rubbish !!!
negative	!
negative	one day after booking my flight , i saw that the price of the same flight went down $_00 .
negative	i filled out the online price guarantee form ( after trying to call and being put on hold for 00_minutes and finally giving up ).
negative	i was later notified that i did not qualify for the price guarantee because i had not booked the flight from my " travelocity account " but rather had used a " single - use " account .
negative	i had just booked my flight like i think most people do - by logging onto travelocity . com .
negative	nowhere does the price guarantee say what kind of account you have to log in from .
negative	if it '_s in the fine_print somewhere , it is well hidden .
negative	travelocity '_s " price guarantee " is meaningless , and advertising that they have a guarantee is fraudulent .
negative	worst_experience and first time ever providing a review on any company or product .
negative	took_forever , uninformed that my lenses could not be repaired .
negative	they sent me a cheap fake that were not attached to the frames and that i couldn_'_t even see clearly through .
negative	horrible and completely unprofessional customer_service ; refused to pay for shipping to send my glasses back a second time and refused to provide a refund .
negative	even went thru amex with no luck .
negative	please save_yourself the time and frustration .
negative	do not deal with this sham of a company .
negative	you are sending emails about an order placed by one of your customers to me ( not a customer ) instead of to her !
negative	i am not your customer .
negative	i responded after the first email , explaining the details and suggested you get a different email address from your customer , but i keep getting emails about her order .
negative	please remove my email address from your database and contact her in some way other than by using my email address .
negative	the bulb didn_'_t work which allowed my friend to tear apart the whole headlight thinking he did something wrong , than had to pay a mechanic $_000 to put it back together .
negative	i know my friend is an_idiot but this just sucks , who would think the bulb wouldn_'_t work ?
negative	oh_yeah made in china
negative	i live in the us and my friend who_lives in the uk got into an accident so i wanted to send her something .
negative	they said it was delivered all tho it never got to and i provided the right address .
negative	im very upset .
negative	i want flowers there or refund .
negative	is this site a scam ?
negative	im going to get to bottom of this .
negative	my money will not be ripped_off .
negative	ordered hedge cutter and received a strimmer !!!
negative	advised them immediately but got no response . sent second e_- mail but the strimmer is still sitting in the porch !!!
negative	to date have heard_nothing from them and the hedge is out of control . not too impressed with their after sales service !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	dopo questa recensione oggi mi vedo costretta a scrivere :
negative	ordine 0000 / 0000 del 00 / 00 / 0000 00 . 00 . 00 per 000_euro mai arrivato per cui mi avete fatto un buono spesa , reinvestito con_un altro ordine 0000 / 0000 del 00 / 00 / 0000 00 . 00 . 00 di 000 , 00 per un totale di 000 , 00_euro .
negative	dopo aver fatto un acquisto andato a buon fine anni fa e quindi acquistata la fiducia del cliente avete iniziato a comportarvi in modo scorretto .
negative	fino a che siete riusciti a tergiversare per farsì che passassero i 00gg per_il rimborso tramite carta di credito , tirandola per le lunghe dopo l ' acquisto 0000 / 0000 del 00 / 00 / 0000 00 . 00 . 00 tutto andava bene , scrivevate e rispondevate alle mail anche con una buona tempistica di risposta , poi mi avete offerto un buono per evitache che chiedessi il rimborso , e per concludere non_ho visto un tubo , nè le mie hogan , nè la borsa fendi nè tanto meno la camicia burberry ... siamo in " ballo " da agosto , rivoglio i miei soldi !
negative	abbiate almeno il coraggio di rispondere !!
negative	lo stato dell ' ordine è in " annullato / in rimborso " da tempo , e non mi dite che_ci sono stati problemi oltre al numero della carta di credito in vostro possesso vi ho fornito anche l ' iban per_il bonifico !
negative	00 / 00 / 0000 per di più leggendo i commenti chiedono di attendere i termini della consegna non fatelo altrimenti non rivedrete piu ' come me i vostri soldi hanno tirato alla lunga da luglio ben 0 ordini , mi_hanno fregata perchè gli ho dato fiducia sapendo che erano lenti e così sono caduta nella trappola !
negative	fatevi restituire subito i vostri soldi !
negative	hanno anche il coraggio di dire di scrivere al servizio_clienti ... ma se tanto alle centinai di mail manco si degnano di rispondere e dietro alla nuova " ragione sociale " mi vien tanto da pensare che_ci siano sempre loro !!
negative	!
negative	i was extremely disappointed with the size and quality of the trees i received .
negative	unfortunately i found the same crape myrtle at a better price and much larger after i planted these .
negative	lesson_learned .
negative	so_far not impressed , ordered a week_ago and still have not received my package ...
negative	yeah it sucks . i got the wrong order and then , they were out of what i wanted .
negative	the dress arrived very promptly but one of the diamonds was falling_off .
negative	i immediately emailed the company .
negative	it is now several days after the email and i have not gotten a response .
negative	why would they tell you to email them if they plan on ignoring your question ?
negative	this dress was almost 000_dollars and i don_'_t expect it to be in less_than perfect_condition and it was .
negative	very displeased with the customer_service !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	my order was cancelled but no email was sent .
negative	i realized it when the book did not arrive and my payment was credited_back on my credit_card .
negative	will never shop there again regardless of the price .
negative	i haven_'_t recieved my product after 0 , 0 month .
negative	i have contacted country_attire , but they won_'_t send a new one or give me my money back .
negative	so now i have paid for a product that has not arrived , and probably_won_'_t .
negative	i will never order from this site , ever again
negative	what more can i say i used to sell on ebay but a dispute with paypal has made it off limits
negative	i fell foul of paypal '_s weirder rules a few_years_ago which resulted in me having to get a passport and then fax it to the office in the us before i could have my refund back .
negative	they were so surly and rude because i was a foreigner - even_though the transaction happened in this country and between two subjects of this country - that i have never been back to them which also means i don_'_t use ebay
negative	terrible service !
negative	will never use them again !
negative	i was suspicious about the perfume that i bought - prada infusion 000mls , as the scent did not last very long on me , and i have been wearing this perfume for years so i know how it wears .
negative	i contacted prada via their website , and they do not actually produce a 000ml bottle , therefore this is fake .
negative	i booked two_nights at a town about 0 0 / 0 hours from my house , but due to a blizzard and hazardous road conditions .
negative	i canceled directly with the hotel and then canceled with travelocity .
negative	this was on the morning of check - out .
negative	the hotel said that is was not a big deal and canceled the reservation .
negative	i was still charged for night at the hotel .
negative	i followed_up with customer_service , but no response .
negative	i will keep my money and my safety and never use this service again .
negative	i ordered two items , and both items were sent to me but not what i ordered .
negative	we ordered some embroidered shirts .
negative	they assured us that we would have them on time for a convention we needed them for .
negative	i checked in two_days before they were suppose to arrive because i hadn_'_t gotten any notification that they shipped .
negative	they informed me that i wouldn_'_t be able to get them - that somehow it had been delayed .
negative	i told them to cancel the order - they said they couldn_'_t .
negative	i went to a local place in desperation and they said they would help me out and get them done fast .
negative	two_days_later i picked them up and they looked awesome .
negative	three_days_later the shirts from zazzle arrived and they were so bad .
negative	the embroidery image was too big and the stitching so so loose - it didn_'_t look professional at all .
negative	worst i '_ve ever_seen .
negative	i called to complain_about the quality and the fact that they totally missed my delivery date .
negative	finally , after several calls to them and complaining they agreed to refund my money .
negative	we haven_'_t and wont use them again .
negative	i definitely left my iphone in my taxi on a thursday_night - the driver wouldn_'_t own up to it !
negative	so i shall never be using such a mistrust worthy site again .
negative	appalling customer_service afterwards .
negative	i have waited in the house the whole day for my parcel to be collected as arranged between 00 - 00_hrs and 00 - 00_hrs , but to no_avail as the couriers did not turn up , we have not had any ' phone_call to advise of a problem and have i feel not received any service whatsoever .
negative	i tried to contact the office after trying tracking to see if courier was on the way at around 00 - 00_hrs but having had no reply can only think office is closed .
negative	the one stare awarded is because the order was easy to place , though not followed through
negative	prices are nice but if you factor in that the shipping is 0 times more than their competitors the prices are just average .
negative	$_00 for shipping is quite outrageous .
negative	i placed an order 0 days ago and the website states they are still filling the order .
negative	horrible !
negative	don_'_t waste your time .
negative	the only_thing worth rating them one star for , are the prices .
negative	otherwise , a complete inconvenient hassle !!
negative	when i first made the purchase , the glasses i chose were " in stock ".
negative	but then all of a sudden the next moment they were back ordered .
negative	hmm go figure .
negative	why do you offer glasses that are not in stock , only to receive unhappy_customers and negative_reviews ?
negative	its been almost a month and my glasses still_haven_'_t even been sent out yet .
negative	yeah , well you better get on that express delivery and all i '_m going to say is i better not get a pair of scratched or broken glasses .
negative	seems to me my complaints are almost identical to everyone elses complaints .
negative	get some better customer_service .
negative	would never recommend .
negative	after i receive my purchase , i will no_longer be doing_business with sbg .
negative	i have heen ordering from asda for weeks , and every week i have a problem with the products .
negative	for example once i received plums with fungus growing on , then today i found out tortilla bread that i ordered was already off on the day i got my delivery :_d absolutely redicilous , once i ordered my one month old baby infacol , they sent me calpol from 0plus months , or once i ordered brown hair dye they sent me red instead :_d , or sometimes they just leave something delivered , i have so many stories to tell ... and delivery prices are absolutely mad , last time i paid 0 pound for fungus plums and gone off bread ,
negative	please people avoid asda , it might be cheap but the products you gonna be getting are awful .
negative	i rather pay more money for quality products and good serivice .
negative	absolutely fed up with asda , and never gonna order online again
negative	when i notified silvertribe that my shipment ( my second order with them ) had gone missing between my local post_office and my home , the company refused to help me resolve the issue .
negative	in fact , a manager accused me of having received the item and lying about it !
negative	silvertribe ships usps " signature confirmation ," and a postal employee had signed for my package ( i suspect it was stolen at the post_office ).
negative	silvertribe customer_service took the position that the package had been " delivered and signed for ," even_though the signature receipt had another person '_s name on it and the post_office '_s address .
negative	i have never encountered such obstinate and unprofessional sellers online , which is saying a lot .
negative	i needed to cancel a trip i had book with them , but after several_attempts to contact them to cancel , i was never able to speak to a person , i left my phone_number to supposedly receive a call back from their customer_support , never got a call , e_- mailed never got a response .
negative	no one seems to actually work for customer_support !
negative	terrible , book your trip somewhere_else , this place is horrible !!!!
negative	!
negative	i have been trying for a week to get an item back .
negative	first agency for collect_+ told me the system was down , the second agency i called at told me the item had been scanned twice and was in the system and suggested i went via_royal_mail .
negative	i went to the post_office and was told they couldn_'_t accept it as it was courier only .
negative	i went back to the original agency and they told me i would have to ring courier + to get it taken off the system .
negative	i '_m furious and i will never use very again .
negative	decided to rent a car through priceline .
negative	went to pick the car up and they wanted even more money plus the deposit i already knew about the deposit but wasn_'_t aware that they didn_'_t keep_up with the deals with priceline !
negative	called to get my money back and was denied it !!
negative	then i look at my receipt and there it says non_refundable !!!
negative	never during the whole_process of setting_up the reservation did it tell me this until they got my card information and took my money !!
negative	and i still did not get a rental_car !!!
negative	!
negative	site showed rooms available , but when i tried to book them , they were gone .
negative	started over , rooms still show available .
negative	tried four different hotels and all the same .
negative	gave up and used another website .
negative	waste of time and complete frustration !
negative	we were so excited to take the big_bus_tour in london and ppicked a beautiful day to do so .
negative	since there are many companies_offering this service we didn_'_t do any research to find the best .
negative	our tour started well until we decided to get off the bus .
negative	it was nearly_impossible to get back on the bus and to get a seat .
negative	we rode through major_attractions standing on the ground_floor of the bus not being_able to see anything .
negative	it was a horrible scramble at the bus_stops to beat others onto a bus .
negative	when i asked about being oversold they told me on a nice day they can '_t guarantee a seat !
negative	this is a very expensive event for a family and was chaotic and a disappointment .
negative	the customer_service from big_bus was horrible .
negative	surprising given they have so much competition .
negative	the fact that we had to take a second bus to get to fox should have been a dead giveaway .
negative	the guy at the counter was surly , the selection of cars out in the lot for a " full - size " abysmal ... one was without a clicker , had the box containg the window and door open / close buttons literally flopping around and was a scratch and dent festival .
negative	when we had to extend for an extra day and a half it wound_up being more than the original rental which was more than i was quoted on the phone .
negative	do yourself a favor and don_'_t deal with these_guys .
negative	i booked with autoeurope to rent a car at heathrow_airport in london .
negative	we took the courtesy bus to the europcar office ( autoeurope had booked us with europcar ), and arrived there about 00 am on saturday_morning , sept , 0 , 0000 .
negative	it was a mad house at europcar !
negative	there was a line out the door of the building !
negative	we had to stand in the queue a total of 0 . 0 hours just to get up to one of the service agents .
negative	( i have photos of the office and the crowds if you would like me to send them to you ) there were maybe 0 agents working and all the rest of the desks were empty .
negative	and each agent worked extremely slowly !
negative	they saw the crowds but apparently did not care that we all had to wait for such an extremely long time .
negative	they made no attempt to hurry or to call on more agents to come help customers .
negative	i have no_complaints with the car i was given , but such a long , long wait time to get the car is unacceptable , and should be to autoeurope , too !
negative	you should not book people with such a customer un - friendly rental_car agency .
negative	everyone is the queue was complaining .
negative	when one rents a car , they need to get the car quickly so they can get to where they need to go .
negative	this long_queue set our trip back all that much longer so that we didn_'_t arrive at our destination until late that evening .
negative	i '_m sure it set all the customers back as well .
negative	it is just a terrible way to begin a holiday ( or business ) trip , and i hope that autoeurope speaks to europcar or takes some action to ensure that customers that book with autoeurope don_'_t have to suffer in this manner .
negative	i '_ve received the worst customer_service imaginable from this company ... to the point that i believe they ' re sham and will more than likely report them as such to my cc company .
negative	i ordered a bridesmaid_dress from psbridal . com on january 00 ( for a june wedding ), and was quoted 00 - 00 weeks for standard shipping .
negative	to verify some things initially , i attempted to contact them via phone and email repeatedly following the purchase , and it wasn_'_t until almost a month later that i finally got a return call from some person named jeanette ( whose number is - surprise , surprise - now defunct ).
negative	fast forward to present day , may 00 , almost a full month past the max quoted delivery timeline .
negative	still no dress , and no response from the company by phone or email .
negative	i have tried to contact them again and again , for weeks , along with the other two bridesmaids ( who ordered their dresses at the same time , and like me , have received nothing and gotten no response ).
negative	one other bridesmaid was smart enough to order from a different place and received her dress weeks_ago , so needless to say , we '_ve been completely screwed by ps_bridal and now have to figure_out what to do !
negative	adding insult to injury , the dress is now discontinued .
negative	i understand manufacturer delays ( as it seems they have used this as an excuse in the past ) but this goes beyond that - a total lack of concern , care or basic customer_service when they don_'_t even have the courtesy to respond to urgent issues and at_least provide a status_update .
negative	my advice to anyone considering this company - don_'_t do it .
negative	the minimal discount is absolutely not worth the headache and stress , even if the dress does eventually arrive ... smh
negative	where to begin ...!?
negative	i have ordered from my local chinese for a long time , they recently signed_up to just - eat so i thought i would give it a try .
negative	we live directly across the road from the restaurant , they offer free delivery within 0 miles and on orders over_£_00 .
negative	i figured the delivery charge shown on just - eat would be removed at the end but it wasnt .
negative	i contacted live_chat to remedy what i thought was a simple mistake and regretted that decision immediately !
negative	shireen i think her name was , was the worst example of customer_service i have ever_experienced ( working in customer_service myself , trust me that is bad ) if i ever spoke to a customer like that i would be receiving my p00 !
negative	i called the restaurant directly , they have apologised that the just eat site cannot destinguish distances and have offered me discounts on future_purchases .
negative	they even went as far as to recommend i avoid just - eat in future .
negative	not that i needed the warning !
negative	i cancelled the service after my first shipment because it did not contain the product pictured and the kitty_litter had a hole in it and made a mess of the entrance way and stairs of my condo building .
negative	i sent an_email to customer_service one week_ago and have not received any response .
negative	i have purchased & rented_books previously , however this semester the books that i rented was severely damaged and wrote in don_'_t think that '_s the proper way to rent out books ....
negative	i have truly learned my lesson from this company
negative	i did order a par of boots for 000_€ and ecco ( some how ) lose the order .
negative	in return i will get a discount of 00 %... on a new order :-(((.
negative	i dont what a discount , i whant the things i purchased .
negative	sorry .... madeleine
negative	i waited on hold for over an_hour ( 0 hour 0 minutes to be exact ) to no response , and requested contact twice via_email as well , which was promised within 00_hours .
negative	that was more than 000 hours ago and i have still received no response .
negative	you get one 0 bureau credit_report and anything_else is extra over the monthly fee . you get a free report yearly so this is a big rip_off
negative	we rented a car from orlando , florida online through the sixt website .
negative	when we got to the shuttle area meant to take us to the sixt office around 0 am , the phone_number of the 00 hour office they had provided on our receipt gave_us an answering_machine explaining that the office was now closed .
negative	we tried various other numbers that we found online until we got through to the shuttle .
negative	when we arrived at sixt they informed us that they actually had no car for us .
negative	they had over booked and would refund our money as well and bring us back to the airport .
negative	we were informed that the pre paid rental amount would be refunded immediately , however it took multiple phone_calls and days to complete the refund .
negative	we loved the price of the rental which is why we chose the company .
negative	it was disappointing to have such a negative experience .
negative	had the part listed .
negative	ordered it .
negative	charged to my credit_card .
negative	a couple of days_later received a message that the part was out of stock .
negative	i ' d have to reorder in a couple of weeks , they couldn_'_t do this for me .
negative	they did return a credit on my charge card .
negative	i ordered refills for my hp photosmart c0000 which uses cartridges 00 - black and 00 - color .... i receive the 00 color but the other one was marked with a different number and even the size was different than the black 00 empty cartridge .
negative	could you please send me a black 00 cartridge ... my print does not accept the one you sent .
negative	ordered an item for my children and because one or more of your staff made a mistake with the price i will only get one of the samsung tablets i ordered and will have to disappoint one of my children .
negative	i have told all of my friends .
negative	so the only_thing you are getting from me is bad publicity .
negative	i '_ve been a loyal_customer for years_now and for the past few month been having problems unlike ever before .
negative	they keep not sending me items that i ordered and paid for and always all they got to say is .
negative	( as for the missing item we regret to inform that we were not be able to fulfill the remainder of your order .
negative	we had attempted to special order the item from our supplier but the item is not available at this time .)
negative	always which is bunch of b / s its funny because one of the items i didn_'_t receive was still up for sale on the site same size and everything and the customer care person monique said that its out of stock or whatever even thought i told them its in stock !
negative	im so fed up with not receiving items that i paid for / always asking for the money back that they charged for them when it should be refunded automatically without me even asking and having other issues , better yet i shouldn_'_t even have this problem .
negative	i shall not be silent no more because everyone should know what they do this .
negative	the only helpful ami customer help has ever been the ones on facebook they always respond right_away and are very nice and understanding .
negative	but other then that good luck with dealing_with this crap !
negative	nice clothes but they really need to do something about the out of stock thing when the person already bought the items and expect them .
negative	now i have to find new items that are similar and spend shipping and handling money and time to do so .
negative	you sent me the wrong head gasket and it '_s gonna cost me more to return it you wasted my time you should just said you didn_'_t have it in stock ...
negative	so you just made yourself 00 $_00 + 0 dollars for shipping i guess if you do it to enough people you make a good chunk of change , no pride .
negative	... just the bottom dollar !
negative	i am so angry .
negative	my item should be here on 0 . 0 ., they changed it to 00 . 0 . and today it should be 00 . 0 .
negative	what it will be tomorrow ?
negative	i bought another two items and the same thing is happening .
negative	they surely do not have it in stock and make me wait for months :(
negative	we booked a celebrity cruise with a balcony room we would only get balcony rooms since our first cruise .
negative	we have been on 0 cruises and all were great .
negative	imagine the shock when we got an obstructed view we weren_'_t told about a lifeboat to look at on a fully booked cruise .
negative	they had me call travelocity right from the ship all we got was a sorry .
negative	not impressive
negative	i placed my order like i always do .
negative	i have order frome inkfarm several_times and have been supper satisfied with them .
negative	i ordered my ink and within 0 - 0 days , i have it .
negative	i ordered this time and it took about 0_weeks to get my ink .
negative	i may be exagerating some because i did not save my order form , but it was definitely more than 0 days .
negative	i tracked the oder on ups and sent an_email to infarm , i was quite upset .
negative	i will find another ink company .
negative	i made two orders ....
negative	0st order - i received my items within 0_weeks of purchase , except for one item ( human hair_extensions worth almost $_000 ).
negative	my items were all the wrong sizes & they didn_'_t let_me know the extensions were on backorder .
negative	i waited on hold for 00_minutes all 0 times i '_ve called .
negative	it '_s been 0_weeks & i still_haven_'_t received my backorder item or been refunded .
negative	0nd order - i ordered a bathing_suit 00 days ago .
negative	my order still_hasn_'_t been processed & i still_haven_'_t gotten a confimation number from ups ... this is quite interesting considering i paid the extra 0 - day shipping_charges near $_00 .
negative	i will never order from this company again or recommend them to anyone .
negative	i hope you take my advice & save your money & time .
negative	i still_haven_'_t gotten anywhere with them & i '_m sure you wont either ... not to mention , the clothes i received in my order were very low quality .
negative	after booking a hotel through the hotel website , with the option to pay later , i discovered that this was a scam .
negative	the hotel ( somehow ) links - i guess - to reservation_counter which is a " pay now " service for the booking .
negative	when i explained how i booked the hotel on - line through the hotel site all i got was " okay , i see ".
negative	no offer to allow me to continue with the option i chose ( pay later ), no offer to look for other hotels , etc ... the individual was only focused on me keeping the booking , when i got no where and no offer of assistance , i immediately requested that the booking be cancelled .
negative	not feeling very pleased with , what i consider false_advertisement from the hotel to send you to some service ( that supposedly gives you options to pay now or pay later ) and then doesn_'_t work with the customer to arrange for the booking that i initially thought i was getting , doesn_'_t make for a happy consumer .
negative	purchased " mint " condition ipad and received unit with scratches .
negative	no response to my emails to resolve the issue .
negative	unit was also a different model than the one i purchased .
negative	do not buy from this company .
negative	they didn_'_t confirm the booking but they took the money from my bank_account right_away .
negative	didn_'_t receive the tickets and they neither picked_up the phone nor responded to my mail .
negative	not only will i never again buy from this company , but i hope no one ever buys from this company again .
negative	i ordered 0 pairs of glasses and received only 0 pair , although on their website all three_pairs were associated with the same tracking_number , so i could not find out where the other 0 were .
negative	after_contacting the company , they said the remaining 0 pairs were backordered and would give me a 0 %_discount on my order , and i could continue to wait if i wanted to , or cancel the order .
negative	after waiting for another month ( exactly 0 months after_placing the original order ), i decided to cancel my order and return the original pair of glasses .
negative	they sent me a a return_slip for the pair i received and cancelled the 0 remaining pairs .
negative	it has now been 0 month since the order was canceled , and i still have not received my refund .
negative	they said there was a " delay in their system " and will be contacting " a related department " to re - process the refund .
negative	this seems shady to me .
negative	it has again been 0 week since this last email , and i still have not received my refund for the returned pair or canceled pairs , totaling $_000 . 00 .
negative	i am unsure if i will ever receive my refund , and believe this company to a scam .
negative	i plan to continually contact them until i receive my money , and will update this review if that does happen .
negative	i hope this review will deter any customers contemplating ordering from smartbuyglasses , as they deserve to know the truth .
negative	and , if my refund is received , i hope future customers see that even if a refund is received , it will take a very , very long time .
negative	please , do not order from them .
negative	they are a shady , shady company .
negative	the process runs_smoothly until you actually place / pay for your order .
negative	the design process was a breeze .
negative	however , my order was placed over a month_ago and i have received no update as to when the order will actually ship .
negative	there is no customer_service and you can never talk to a live_person .
negative	when i did finally receive a response apologizing for the delay , it was never clear as to when the order would ship .
negative	i have missed the client '_s deadline and still have no tracking to even prove my order has shipped .
negative	i will be sure to use a domestic supplier from here on out .
negative	she was unwilling to answer my questions and when she did it was with an attitude .
negative	i would suggest she take some training from the operators in laughlin .
negative	i taught school for many years and had days the job was hard .
negative	you learn to put your feelings aside .
negative	she must know she will be a senior_citizen someday .
negative	do you really pay_attention to these opinions ?
negative	the treats arrived crushed by the dog_food it was packaged with .
negative	it was little more than an exploded bag of crumbs .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	i recently ordered 0 personalised egyptian cotton bath set towels and 0 personalised egyptian cotton hand towels (' his and hers ', black & pink ) as an anniversary_gift !
negative	it turned_out that the towels are of extremely bad quality , so bad that we actually cannot use them at all ( little fibres comes off the towels , you cannot dry off , body is still wet afterwards and full of fibres and its everywhere , the whole bathroom is a mess , very poor quality of towels ).
negative	i have washed to towels about 00 times and it just doesn_'_t get any better .
negative	i paid £_00 for this towels and i cannot_believe what i got for my money !
negative	i am extremely disappointed .
negative	i have reported this to amy ’ sgifts . co . uk but amy doesn_’ t care .
negative	she doesn_’ t want to give me a refund !
negative	i booked a trip through bookit . com and paid in full and somehow bookit sent me the correct reservations but the hotel received the incorrect information and bookit assured_me they are fixing the problem but they are not !!!!
negative	i have spent hours and hours trying to contact corporate bookit managers or anyone to help me but no !!!!!!
negative	will never use bookit again !!!!
negative	idiots !!!!
negative	!
negative	this company have no customer_service to speak of .
negative	i took up their offer of a £_00 voucher but when i ordered the item couldn_'_t use it and was debited with the full_amount . so i phoned them at great expense and they said they couldn_'_t apply the voucher but would have to call back the first vac and reorder .
negative	which_meant i was debited twice .
negative	the returns pack never reached the recipient - it was a gift . obviously they want to hold_onto my money awhile longer . im still_waiting and i am telling_everyone buy through amazon not with these useless people . their product is good but the rest of the service is abysmal . i think they are stupid - firstly why not just credit me with the £_00 voucher an the debited full_amount . secondly what about the expense and embarresment of picking_up one vac only to redeliver exactly the same item ! bizarre ?
negative	thirdly suspect that nobody in the company can read and they have sent the pick_up pack to the billing_address not the recipient . would never recommend this company . good old amazon rules .
negative	b debenham
negative	i ordered and paid for my book and the order was excepted .
negative	i wait for my book to be shipped .
negative	then i checked to see why i had not received it and found a post saying refund .
negative	i didn_'_t receive notice from bookbyte , so i emailed them then they emailed me back saying sorry no one contacted me that the book was out of stock and my money would be refunded .
negative	wow is all i could say .
negative	my class started in 0 days , so i had to find another company and i did they shipped in 0 days got my book on time , and mind you i paid for express shipping .
negative	unacceptable
negative	we have never used them before so decided to give them a go wish ee had not of bothered .
negative	we arrived and was told they did not even know we had booked but it was fine they could accommodate .
negative	the vechicle used to take us to the airport was faulty , it kept cutting out !
negative	on our return_journey the driver seemed as though he had just woken up , although we did return at0 . 00am still unacceptable .
negative	this made his driving slightly nerveraking .
negative	on arrival at our car we were left waiting for 00_minutes in the car_park as his did have our keys but " misplaced " them .
negative	when he finally found them under his drivers car_seat we were eventually able to start on the rest of our return_journey .
negative	i would never ever use these people again complete amateurs .
negative	all the reviews on their site were great , i saw nothing on the site that states in advance that if you receive the wrong part , whether or not it is your fault , you must pay the shipping to send it back !
negative	their phone_number has very limited hours , they do not answer , ( i ’ ve tried for days ) and don_’ t have an option to talk to a human unless it is about your card being declined .
negative	everything must be done through support tickets .
negative	i ordered a gas_cap for a 0000_ford_taurus , after doing research to make_sure it was the correct cap , & using the correct_part number .
negative	when complete , the website showed the correct information , stating confirmation emails would follow .
negative	the confirmation_email stated they were sending a different part numbered product & that nothing could be done to change the order .
negative	i hoped it was the correct_part & only had a different number because it was an internal office number .
negative	when the part came it was clearly_marked as a mazda gas_cap !
negative	does not fit my ford !!
negative	!
negative	i '_m very frustrated & won_'_t purchase from them again .
negative	whilst wrens seem to have a good handle on the production and delivery of their kitchen units they have been extremely poor at managing their work surface sub contractor rotherhams .
negative	they failed to deliver in accordance with the originally presented specification and told me that they are happy with a surface , quote “ full of heavy pitting with a fairly rough finish to the surface ", and therefore so should i be .
negative	to make_matters worse i e_- mail them every twenty days and they dont take the trouble to follow_up my concerns .
negative	i was hesitant to use viagogo when i realized it was a site for ticket scalpers , but it was paypal certified .
negative	so , i purchased tickets for a soccer game in france as a gift for my son '_s first overseas trip .
negative	he really wanted to see a game in europe .
negative	since our time was limited , i specifically chose a game on a date i knew we ' d be able to attend .
negative	i paid three_times the sticker price for the tickets , but wanted to make_sure we had good seats .
negative	when the tickets arrived they were for a different date and at a time when we would be on our way back to the states .
negative	i immediately notified viagogo and have had numerous email exchanges with about the bait and switch .
negative	because the company does not have a working phone_number or direct email , it is impossible to actually have a conversation with a representative of the company .
negative	i just keep getting stock email answers back with no option for a dialogue .
negative	at no time was i notified by either the seller or viagogo that the date of the game had changed , nor was the correct date for the game changed on the listing until 0 days before the game - after i filed my complaint .
negative	by that time i was stuck with 0 useless tickets and terribly disappointed son .
negative	its unlikely we will be overseas again anytime_soon .
negative	so , when i tried to re - sell them on the site , viagogo denied the listing because there was insufficient time .
negative	you can be sure viagogo got a hefty cut of my losses - they take a fee from both the seller and the buyer .
negative	i am also very surprised that paypal endorses this company especially in light of the numerous blogs and websites with negative_reviews of viagogo .
negative	0 / 0 / 00 : reply to viagogo :
negative	of course viagogo can '_t control when event dates are changed .
negative	however , i purchased tickets for a specific date and the seller sent me tickets for a different date .
negative	neither the seller nor viagogo notified me the date changed .
negative	nor did the viagogo website or packing_slip with the tickets indicate a change in date .
negative	neither of you warned me or gave_me the opportunity to back out of the transaction .
negative	this is a breach of contract .
negative	if i ordered and paid for a toaster oven , and amazon sent me an iron with a packing_slip that said toaster oven , they would honorably correct the situation .
negative	i understand the seller sends tickets to viagogo who packs and ships them .
negative	a reputable business would ensure that the buyer was getting what they ordered or would notify the buyer if there was a substitution being sent .
negative	viagogo '_s reply states they do everything they can to inform the customer of changes in events , yet they did nothing in this case .
negative	if viagogo truly cared_about the " inconvenience " it apologizes for , it would accept responsibility for sending me the wrong product and ruining my son '_s vacation .
negative	00 / 0 / 00 update_:
negative	i received a phone message from viagogo that they were looking into my situation with management .
negative	that was on 00 march .
negative	i have not heard back .
negative	i tried_calling the number displayed on caller id the company does not accept land_line calls and i do not have an international plan for my cell_phone .
negative	i wish the company would update me on my request .
negative	thank_you .
negative	00 / 0 / 00 update_:
negative	i received another phone message from viagogo that they were looking into my situation .
negative	that was over 0_weeks_ago , and still no contact back .
negative	i don_'_t_believe the company is interested in customer_service .
negative	i '_ve yet to speak with an actual_person .
negative	you need a customer_service line that has a person to answer it .
negative	it is all fine and good to order what you know you need online , but when ever there is a problem with your order being put on hold for over 0 hours or placing an_email with a 00 hour response is unacceptable
negative	when i questioned my bill i was basically told off .
negative	they threatened to rip it all up .
negative	it '_s just that the price was twice as much as they quoted me , 0 times as much as i paid someone last_year and it had a lot of mistakes .
negative	i ordered a part and was told it was in stock and i would have it in 0 to 0 business days , well 00 business days_later i still dont have the part and i have called everyday and can not reach a sales_associate and if i try to cancel the orded i will be charged a restocking_fee , never again
negative	i was looking to order my pet frontline online and decided to compare prices prior to ordering .
negative	i came_across the petflow site which seemed to have reasonable prices ; before i completed my order i looked up a coupon_code that said i would save 00 . 00 on my first order .
negative	as i was continuing through with the order process i could see where the 00 . 00 was subtracted and i was also given free_shipping .
negative	websites that i normally order from let you review your order in its entirety prior to final confirmation .
negative	you are asked to choose if you want monthly continual shipping or other forms and this is where i chose a one time shipment and the order then went through .
negative	when i realized the 00 . 00 was added back on i contacted customer_service and i was told because i chose a one time shipment and not continual shipment my discount was deducted .
negative	wrong and bad customer_service .
negative	if this choice was taking away your discount there should be a box that pops_up telling you because you chose a one time shipment you will not receive the discount previously applied .
negative	i believe this was a deceiving way to get customer to order and will not order from this company in the future .
negative	i have alerted all my pet owning friends and coworkers about this .
negative	you '_ve lost several potential_customers .
negative	this should not be called a car dealer ship they sell broken junk and lie when they they say thay will fix something .
negative	0 mo i had been fixing broken things .
negative	never again .
negative	my experience with ordering from yesstyle has_been far from satisfying .
negative	first of all , it takes long time to wait for the items to be shipped .
negative	and , the order status page is not helpful .
negative	they keep you wondering when will the order be finally shipped !
negative	the lacking of shipment flexibly and strict return_policy send the message that the company does not take customers ' satisfaction serious enough .
negative	my suggestion_: read through its policies closely before purchasing anything from them .
negative	i purchased several items from this company .
negative	one of them was a " savory prime butcher bone " ( ham bone ).
negative	my dog gobbled up the entire thing in minutes ... a bone , meant to be chewed on for a while .
negative	it crumbled and shared into really sharp pieces .
negative	we are so lucky that our two year_old boxer mix only got violently ill , vomiting and pooping that night all over our house .
negative	thank_god no damage inside as far as perforated organs .
negative	after looking on line i read you should never give a dog a ham bone because of how hurt dogs can become .
negative	i called the company and asked them why they would sell an item that could hurt a dog ... they referred me the co that is the maker of the bone .
negative	they wouldn_'_t even give me my $ back ( 0 . 00 ) for the bone .
negative	they did , however , give a postage paid label for the rest of the order that i wanted to return .
negative	i would think they would have no problem also paying me back a lousy 0 . 00 for the item that could have easily killed my dog .
negative	( just to do good business ).
negative	i notice they are still selling the item even after i explained how bad of a product it is for dogs .
negative	they even asked for my review !
negative	having received dvd '_s that had no movie whatsoever , snowy & lines in picture .
negative	received dvd '_s that claimed cc on package ......... had no cc .
negative	seems like those dvd '_s that were made in mexico are inferior & lack in knowledge of copying which is not kosher as we all know that usa has a better knowledge of copying , otherwise , all dvd '_s that have the " thrown in jail and fined " for copying , seems to be " out of place " in this instance .
negative	i returned my last shipment , as it was short one dvd ( was charged for a full 0 and received 0 ), as cc was missing on 0 , and contact with oldies ( told me they would get back with me after phone_call ... they did not ), was useless , so returning them seemed the right alternative .
negative	will certainly not order anymore from them again , as their employees seem to not get anything properly sent , and lack judgment in phone_calls .
negative	the woman_who reserved my storage_unit misspelled my name , so the storage_facility showed no record of me reserving a storage_unit .
negative	i had to start all over again .
negative	it made my move across the country much harder .
negative	my experience : it '_s not worth using the service to book flights , cars and hotels if anything at all changes at the last_minute .
negative	you ' re much_better off to create your agenda individually and directly with each entity ... airline ... car_rental ... hotel .
negative	that way if you need to change anything , you are able to do that without a hassle .
negative	we had a family emergency that changed our circumstances for dates and times . and weren_'_t allowed to change one single thing on the reservation without negating the entire reservation .
negative	it was an expensive learning experience .
negative	once they have your money , no on even wants to hear_anything from you either .
negative	don_'_t do it .
negative	i placed my order on june_00th and added a priority_mail for $_00 . 00 .
negative	metro_swim shop charged and posted my credit_card on july 0st so i called customer_service to get shipping and tracking_information and the person and i talked to the phone said he will email me my tracking_information and up to this day i have not received it .
negative	i called customer_service twice and have no_idea when my itms was shipped they said it was only processed .
negative	i am very disappointed about my service .
negative	i have your your prices are cheaper_than other_sites but i d_rather pay a little more like swim outlet . com because they are very good in communicating about your order .
negative	i order my dog_food and treats .
negative	not over an_hour later , my phone rings with a salesperson trying to get me to have automatic delivery for the dog_food even_though i checked the radio button that said " one time delivery only " each time it popped_up .
negative	one top of that , within one day , my inbox had four email advertisements as well as three emails about my order - one asking me if i didn_'_t make a mistake bu choosing " one time delivery only ".
negative	blood_pressure going up !
negative	after three_days , i have decided never , ever to order from these_folks again .
negative	in three_days , i received 00 emails from them .
negative	i have unsubscribed and want to warn_others that this company is very irritating .
negative	top top it off .... the dog_treats i ordered are unusable as they were totally crushed in shipping .
negative	all i have is expensive dog treat dust .
negative	called for help at north_shore commercial for help and he was not able to help .
negative	did not provide any info on how to return the remote i purchased .
negative	this was a waste of money and i will not order from them again .
negative	we booked the tour , didn_'_t complete the whole trip as we visited a number of museums and other experiences .
negative	the second day after visiting museums and harrods we then got on the bus hoping to go across to covent_garden .
negative	sadly and with no warning , the bus terminated at baker_street at 0 :_00pm .
negative	after waiting several minutes the driver came upstairs to advise ourselves and the other three parties to get off the bus .
negative	great considering you are along way from attractions and when your travelling with a child .
negative	i made a complaint to the company nearly two_weeks_ago and they have not responded .
negative	we should have been advised when we boarded the bus that it was the last service .
negative	would not recommend as good value for money and would not use again
negative	i was overcharged for an item i purchased by your site .
negative	i was charged 00 times instead of once and contacted immediately asking to get the 00 charged in error refunded and i had to wait a week for a reply and then i was only refunded 0 !!!!
negative	i had to email again and ask again and wait again and hope and pray i actually get a response !!
negative	ridiculous
negative	my sister had recommended the site .
negative	i found the book i wanted at a great price .
negative	i placed my order which was easy and picked express shipping because i needed it for my current class .
negative	it was worth the extra_cost even_though i '_m on a tight_budget .
negative	the book never got here .
negative	when i contacted customer_service , i '_m told
negative	" we are sorry but it appears to be lost ".
negative	they didn_'_t have a replacement .
negative	they said they would give me a refund but i still_haven_'_t received the money in my account .
negative	i don_'_t have the book i need and if i wanted to buy it somewhere_else it will cost me 0 times the amount i was going to pay and my class will almost be over .
negative	not at all happy with my experience !
negative	je_suis actuellement aux usa , où j ' avais loué à partir du 0 octobre jusqu ' au 00 octobre une voiture .
negative	hors je_n ' ai_pas pu avoir ma location et_j ' ai dû payer une nouvelle location sous prétexte que mon mari qui est le conducteur a un permis américain .
negative	cela fait des années quand nous venions aux usa que nous louions par autoescape avec_le permis américain de_mon mari sans_problème , cela change .
negative	mais dans ce cas pourquoi autoescape nous a loué un véhicule ?
negative	?
negative	je leur ai envoyé un mail le 0 octobre j ' attends toujours la réponse , surtout que_j ' ai un autre contrat avec eux du 00 au 00 octobre également aux usa , vais - je devoir à nouveau repayer une location , en attendant aucune réaction d ' autoescape alors que le problème est urgent , mais c ' est vrai eux ils ont encaissé mes paiements .....
negative	i would not buy this item as it is to difficult to set - up , you need someone that has iron muscles and strong hands .
negative	it does not work on chairs without arms .
negative	it is not worth the money i paid for it and i am returning it .
negative	this business ( expedia ) has horrible ratings .
negative	i couldn_'_t agree more .
negative	i wish i knew that before i bought anything through them .
negative	the guy on the phone for cs was hard to understand since he was from another country .
negative	he couldn_'_t answer any of my simple questions .
negative	i asked if i could receive points for my latest booking and he said i could not and he couldn_'_t tell me why due to confidentiality .
negative	which made no sense and he couldn_'_t even explain_why .
negative	he offered me a 00 $ coupon for next time booking .
negative	i asked why i received that and all he could say it was from an agent '_s error but he refused to pull up the paperwork / file to give me info on it .
negative	expedia is nuts !
negative	ordered a mattress protector and didn_'_t realize it didn_'_t encase the mattress .
negative	when i called to return it , lisa , was rude and wanted to argue the fact .
negative	when i told her it didn_'_t say non returnable she rudely told me it said that on the website ... somewhere !!!
negative	geez what a charmer !
negative	i '_ll buy my moms very expensive diapers " somewhere " else lisa .
negative	great customer_service , you should consider not working with the public .
negative	and northshore , consider flagging the files that are non returnable as other_sites do !
negative	!
negative	coupon_codes don_'_t work .
negative	customer_service gives you a credit to keep your business .
negative	then the " system " won_'_t let you apply the credit .
negative	customer_service corrects the problem and sends an_email with accurate information .
negative	order processes completely incorrectly and drops the credit and coupon_code , charging you full price again and again .
negative	is it the system or the people working it ?
negative	i have no_idea .
negative	it '_s less troublesome to drive to the store and walk out with the bag .
negative	ik bestelde een boeket via regiobloemist omdat ze nog dezelfde werkdag een levering beloofden .
negative	mijn boeket heeft er uiteindelijk een week over gedaan om in belgië geleverd te worden .
negative	van mijn 0 mails ( om_te checken waar het_boeket bleef ) werd slechts 0 beantwoord en toen ik telefonisch om een compensatie vroeg werd verontwaardigd gereageerd .
negative	uiteindelijk heb_ik_een upgrade van 0 euro gekregen .
negative	ik zal dan ook nooit meer beroep doen op dit bedrijf .
negative	purchased two pair of glasses , after 0 0 / 0_weeks finally received them ... however , the one pair was not the frame i ordered ... because i could not wait another 0 0 / 0_weeks for glasses that i needed to see with , i returned them and asked for refund .... 0 0 / 0_weeks after they received the wrong pair , i finally received a refund and they kept their return fee , and refunded only a portion of my money , even_tho they sent the wrong frame !!
negative	would not buy from them again !
negative	oh sure they have a number you can call .
negative	i called today and they hung_up on me twice and put the phone down when i tried to talk .
negative	it was a department in a foreign_country who couldn_'_t care less .
negative	they don_'_t take responsibilities for errors and blame the purchaser or the hotel .
negative	they don_'_t care about their purchasers just money .
negative	when i asked to speak to a supervisor she handed the phone to the person next to her .
negative	i know this because i recognized the voice .
negative	roll the dice and take your chances but i '_m done with them .
negative	had there been any other options available of the accessory i '_m buying i would not buy from yesstyle .
negative	it '_s been years since i stopped shopping at yesstyle simply because if your purchase does not reach 000 you '_ll have to pay for the stupid shipping .
negative	why should i pay for the goddamn shipping if it does not arrive until a month later ?
negative	you call them and a rude chinese uncle answers the phone .
negative	whatever !
negative	timing was good , parts were wrong .
negative	it took three attempts to get the order right :
negative	0 .).
negative	the order was sent to the wrong_address they sent it to the bill to - not the shipping address
negative	0 .)
negative	when part of the order was not available , they cancelled it .
negative	they did not ask if i wanted to add or substitute anything ; in fact , i was not even notified .
negative	i caught it myself
negative	0 .).
negative	now the order is sent in two parts - the first to arrive was incomplete and i have not been able to get any response at all
negative	i am a pretty reasonable person and would not write something unless it were truly horrible as this was .
negative	i hope they do better with other orders .
negative	i booked silver_shuttle for a round - trip transportation from heathrow to our hotel in london .
negative	i received the email_confirmation regarding the scheduled pick_up time two_nights before , i was intructed to turn on my phone upon landing for a text_message that would instruct me on where to meet our driver .
negative	i received no text .
negative	after walking around the terminal for 00_minutes , we contacted them by phone .
negative	we were told that due to heavy_traffic , our driver was 00_minutes away .
negative	mind you , they were already 00_minutes late .
negative	after waiting another 00_minutes , and still , receiving no call or text with an update , we called yet again .
negative	we were told the driver was just pulling into the airport and to continue waiting .
negative	after another 00 - 00_minutes , ( mind you , no call or text from them ), we called and asked to speak to a manager .
negative	we had already paid for the shuttle service , and taking a taxi would incur yet another additional_cost , not to mention , cost twice as much .
negative	we were transferred to simon , who explained he had been unaware of the problem ; however , was unable to reach the driver .
negative	after over 0 0 / 0 hours of waiting , we were forced to pay a taxi to take us to our hotel .
negative	i have never in my life dealt_with such an unproffessional shuttle company .
negative	please do not waste your time with them .
negative	left waiting at t0 for 00mins for collections of vehicle , approached twice by police to move car along .....
negative	when the car was collected your employee enquired and suggested to myself and work_colleague we should have travelled together in 0 car rather_than 0 !
negative	not his place and ultimately reducing the business profit of your company and service .
negative	0 car = 0 payment , 0 cars = 0 payments !!
negative	!
negative	upon_arrival we received a similar haphazard and inpolite service , left waiting for car delivery , when driver / car did arrive they went right past us and had to do another lap and several more phone_calls to direct your driver .
negative	only 0 car dropped at a time so i was left waiting for a further 00mins after my colleagues .
negative	overall a poor service received this time compared to other experiences when i have had only praise for the service .
negative	i booked my 0st anniversary cruise with travelocity .
negative	the same day i booked my cruise which was over 0000 . 00 the price of the cruise dropped .
negative	i did a customer guarantee which was supposed to take 00_hours .
neutral	one product to big for being a med .
neutral	and the color was not what was expected .
neutral	i really saved on costs for upcoming_trip to new_york for myself , grand_daughter and mother with dementia condition .
neutral	seats on ongoing flight were obtained with no problem .
neutral	flight is usairways .
neutral	there were many rows of available seating for the return flight available through american but operated by usairways , and although i selected seats my finalized itinerary showed the selection did not go through .
neutral	spending hours on the phone with travelocity , usairways and american has not resulted in seat_assignments .
neutral	american says usairways has to assign the seats .
neutral	usairways has no record of the reservation , though it shows up on american and travelocity records . separation will be difficult because of my mother '_s medical condition and no one is providing assistance .
neutral	quite a mess for me to resolve .
neutral	tour was relaxing and the weather was cooperative , yet i felt if it was just possible to pull up to one of the many show stopper '_s such as the children library , or chinese restaurant to have a meal or just to look would have been the ultimate tour .
neutral	i ordered a power plate on friday , it states next_day delivery , thinking it would arrive yesterday i waited around .
neutral	hopefully it will come today !
neutral	it was easy to navigate the shop and find good deals but it took weeks for two books to show up to my address .
neutral	if i had ordered a day or two later it would have messed_up a lot of events
neutral	it is beautiful but i expected my dress to be exactly as appear in the picture .
neutral	i only had to rent one book online , and my only option was bookbyte .
neutral	i had researched reviews and for the most part everything was good so i went with it .
neutral	the shipping time was good , but when i got my book i wasn_'_t too happy .
neutral	i knew that it would be a loose_leaf book , but when i received the package in the mail they had the book on a much smaller binder ring than what was needed and some of the pages were tore off from the front and back .
neutral	i would have been okay with this if the information hadn_'_t of said the book was in good shape .
neutral	the book wasn_'_t missing any pages so luckily i have everything i need for class , but i did have to go out and purchase some items to fix the book to be able to use it in class without losing pages .
neutral	i ordered a light fitting for undershelves in our study , i quoted the exact number on the fitting but when it arrived it was not compatible possibly having been modernised over the years .
neutral	on closer inspection of the site , there are items which state not compatible but this was not stated on my item .
neutral	i therefore returned it paying the postage and yet the postage was still deducted .
neutral	although it was returned eventually i felt if this happens everytime some customers may not bother claiming back the postage !
neutral	i would be reluctant to use the site again in view of what has happened to me .
neutral	the dresses were great but waiting ten days for online delivery at £ 0 . 00 was too long compared to other_sites which can do next_day or a few_days delivery for free .
neutral	it '_s made with a great material , but it doesn_'_t stay in place .
neutral	the liquids are okay , but for that price i can buy better liquids for a better price !
neutral	!
neutral	but i '_ve not received my package as of yet .. est delivery was to be 00 / 00 / 00 and still nothing ...
neutral	the date now is 00 / 00 / 00 ...
neutral	we were thinking priceline was the answer until they booked us a room at a hotel that had only smoking_rooms left !
neutral	so that leaves very mixed feelings cuz we '_ve done great with priceline .
neutral	nice hotels , good prices , but if there '_s anything i can '_t stand its a smoky room !
neutral	will think carefully before using priceline again
neutral	plus points - website is great and easy to navigate , customer_service ( when you get to speak to someone ) is excellent and on line contact is pretty good too in terms of follow_up .
neutral	delivery service dpd are excellent .
neutral	negative points - the delivery process seems very disorganised .
neutral	some things are very delayed in delivery or indeed do not arrive at all ( not a dpd problem if they are not receiving the goods ) i have cancelled a number of items because i was fed up with waiting for them and then noticed the site was running the same products again ( that did not make any sense )
neutral	returns are also delayed in terms of processing - an_email would be useful to say the returned goods have been received and then when the credit has_been applied to the account .
neutral	when i look at my account it states when some refunds have been applied but not always so i am forever having to follow things up with paypal or my credit_card to see the activity .
neutral	there doesn_'_t appear to be a consistent process that applies to all things .
neutral	sometimes the description of products is not very comprehensive and not enough pictures ( small issue )
neutral	i liked the idea of having my luggage shipped but when delivery went sideways the customer_service manager was robotic in her response .
neutral	no empathy and gave_me the company line " we are only responsible for delivering luggage from door to door and that is what we did ".
neutral	lets just say damaged luggage and messed_up delivery didn_'_t leave me feeling like using this service ever again .
neutral	got my petflow box o ' goodies , and glad i only paid the intro price !
neutral	did not value the items in the box as highly as you seemed , so don_'_t feel that a monthly repeating would be in my pocketbooks best interest !
neutral	boxes of cat_litter often have rips or holes with litter leaking out .
neutral	food bags are fine .
neutral	we also ordered the 00lb box of fresh step premium litter and were notified that it had been_discontinued .
neutral	the service was acceptable but the communication could have been better .
neutral	synes amazon er_en ganske fin hjemmeside , men jeg mener det_er_meget svært at finde ud_af hvilke sælgere der sender til dk og hvilke der_ikke gør .
neutral	jeg mener det_er problematisk at jeg først kan se om jeg overhovedet kan få tingene sendt_til mig når det_er jeg_er ved at betale .
neutral	derud over synes_jeg det_er svært at se hvor afsender kommer fra , dermed er_det svært at regne ud om man_skal betale told eller ej når tingene kommer_til dk

neutral	my order was cancelled because they did not have the book i needed .
neutral	which was a hassle because i needed the book asap and felt_like it would have been better had they said out of stock to begin with .
neutral	the service at first was very good but on a second application for funds there was nothing after chasing it up myself it was a problem with bank servers but i '_ve had no communication from the company itself or any updates as to when the problem will be fixed this has gone on for four days now not very good with keeping in touch with the customer
neutral	despite loving the glasses , it took over the 00 working day policy they offer ; and then once they turned_up a part was missing from the glasses .
neutral	i emailed straight_away to advise of this but mentioned i didnt want to return the glasses due to the long wait to actually receive them .
neutral	i wasn_'_t offered any other alternatives and therefore now have to live with broken glasses that apparently are thoroughly quality checked !!
neutral	!
neutral	despite this the service was good in terms of responding to my query its just a shame of the quality of the glasses i received ..
neutral	generally very helpful , just needed to know for sure right at that moment if i could get more than agent was stating i could get , for my emergency need , so had to end the call and get more info for myself .
neutral	needs to work on customer_service
neutral	i would give five_stars , but the constant changing of the shipping date estimates was incredibly frustrating .
neutral	i ' d_rather be told from the get - go that it will take more time to ship than to be strung along for longer and longer delays .
neutral	i paid for next_day postage but received the item on the st nod day .
neutral	called ckear chemist and was told that a refund would be applied . item condition arrived intact , friendly customer_service .
neutral	in theory delivery . com is awesome however they need to work out some kinks .
neutral	they dont confirm with the restaurants so if a place doesn_'_t receive your order , because they closed early or because of technical_issues you never know until they don_'_t show up .
neutral	this has happend to me twice and it '_s not fun to find out after an_hour of waiting that your food is not coming at all .
neutral	i do love that fact that you can earn_points and they offer great discounts so i keep using it but i also have some issues with the app .
neutral	i sometimes get frustrated and give up and use seamless . com or just pick_up the phone and order the old fashion way .
neutral	i said in 0 line
neutral	there shipping is to high on some of there stuff
neutral	i have been a customer for a long time now , love your deals but not happy with the false_advertisement i was sent by e_- mail for labor weekend a code for 00 per - cent off i put the code in several_times , i had a very large order .
neutral	it did nor work tried call na so i left a message on your vm no response back .
neutral	so i cut my order less_than half and did the labor day 00 coupon you had on you sight .
neutral	i would appreciated if you did not send me coupon_codes that don_'_t work !
neutral	very disappointed !
neutral	:(
neutral	ordered a wig , but because i have short hair , it was massive and i couldn_'_t keep it out of my eyes when i tried it on so it wasn_'_t possible to wear it .
neutral	disappointed when i contacted the company and was told that because i tried it on , they couldn_'_t take it back .
neutral	i don_'_t know how you can possibly tell from the picture if its going to fit .
neutral	it had been out of the bag for about 00 seconds .
neutral	will think_twice about ordering again in case something isn_'_t suitable .
neutral	i orderd a top from boohoo really quick delivery as i wanted it for a night out lovley top but had a hole returns process was easy but took over a week to be refunded that '_s after they had recieved the faulty item and checked it so all in all 0_weeks to be refunded .
neutral	i suppose this is the same all over but i don_'_t understand how they manage to take your money same day but can '_t refund as quickly !
neutral	overall service was good but quality of item was poor !
neutral	the price is right for tires here , but it is so difficult to not waste an entire day on tires .
neutral	they are always so crowded and you wait so long .
neutral	it is also a bit of a hassle having to bring the vehicle back after 00_miles when your car has over 000k miles .
neutral	i have never_heard this before and i have always used a dealer .
neutral	this particular time they had me in and out in 00_mins but i was only getting the tires_rotated and i had an_appointment that i had to make 0 0 / 0_weeks in advance .
neutral	clothes fit but aren_'_t as stretchy as review described but material is a bit uncomfortable against the skin , i will try washing .
neutral	.. i bought the wrong_size and the fee to post it back stopped me from re - ordering just in case i had to send that back as well ... freepost would be good : )
neutral	would have been perfect , but the picture i uploaded to put on the mug was so small it was ridiculous .
neutral	olisi hyvä , jos aurinkolaseista löytyisi tieto linssien
neutral	koosta , jotta voisi arvioida minkä kokoiset ne
neutral	olisivat kasvoilla .
neutral	säästyisi palautuksilta ja
neutral	pettymyksiltä .
neutral	i ordered 0 outfits ( all separates ) for my granddaughters , i asked them to be delivered to my daughters home in florida .
neutral	when i got my confirmation they had the address correct , but didn_'_t have her name , they did call me to take_care of that issue .
neutral	( her address is on us military base ), wasn_'_t sure she would get it w_/ my name on there .
neutral	i got confusing info .
neutral	when i tried to track the pkg , one place showed entire order was filled & another said one item was not in stock ( it would have been nice to have been able to order a different item to replace , but i was not given that option !)
neutral	my daughter received the pkg & said the items were nice & seemed of good quality , but i didn_'_t get to see them since i live in pennsylvania !
neutral	i looked up the hampton in morristown tn on the internet .
neutral	the only phone_number was your number , not a direct number to the establishment .
neutral	i asked for a king_bed , non_smoking_room .
neutral	i was quoted a price and asked for the aarp rate .
neutral	i told the reservation clerk i was coming down for a funeral , at no time did they quote a bereavement rate .
neutral	the next_day the confirmation was in my e_mail for a 0 bed non_smoking .
neutral	i called and was told that was all they had unless i wanted a king with a sofa pull out for a higher_rate .
neutral	when we arrived i was told if we had contacted the hotel_directly they could have negotiated a bereavement price .
neutral	they need to give better directions then to just say door 0 .
neutral	we wasted so much time at airport trying to find door 0 with our heavy_luggage and in the cold .
neutral	it was a nice thought to have our car running and warm when we got back but oh , they didn_'_t have the heater turned on !
neutral	wide_range and cheap prices .
neutral	you can tell that it isn_'_t the best quality , but i guess you can '_t expect that from such prices .
neutral	the sizes are pretty small , which is a bit odd since it says in the description of some of the clothes that they are slightly bigger_than usual .
neutral	i ' d say ignore that .
neutral	delivery was fast and overall it was an ok experience .
neutral	i ordered my contacts over a week_ago , i am still_waiting for them to arrive .
neutral	i don_'_t know if they had a problem sending my order , however ordered contacts 00 days ago .
neutral	ordered a new dishwasher on thursday_evening for delivery on sunday .
neutral	as_promised , received email on sunday_morning advising the time_slot , followed_up a couple of hours_later by a call from the delivery driver advising the delivery slot .
neutral	paid for the installation and disposal service - delivery driver did not have a screwdriver to hand ( he probably had one in the lorry !
neutral	), so that was not efficient , had to borrow one from us and on removal of old dishwasher and disposal left a long trail of water down the stairs of my flat - one of the two delivery people did not speak_english at all - greater care should be taken .
neutral	dishwasher was slightly wonky - when my husband pointed this out , he was told " it '_s ok ".
neutral	when they left my husband adjusted the feet of the washer and all is working fine at the moment .
neutral	so overall good experience with ao but delivery side requires improvement .
neutral	because of this i am only rating 0_stars for the experience , otherwise would give 0 .
neutral	i recently travelled to europe and needed to hire a 0 seater van to accommodate for all travellers and their luggage and the auto_europe website kept telling_me that there were vans available .
neutral	when confirming booking , and putting down security deposit , we are then advised that the vans are not available .
neutral	website should only provide a list of available vehicles .
neutral	i then had to book two cars but the cars that were provided turned_out to be from two_separate companies meaning that after a long flight i had to queue up at two different counters .
neutral	quite disappointed ;, having telephoned and followed with two requests via the web_site to return one faulty light , i have heard_nothing further .
neutral	sipgate ist_für voip ganz gut , allerdings ist die_qualität nicht so toll , auch gibt_es immer mal wieder ausfälle oder man hört sich selbst beim telefonieren .
neutral	der_preis ist_für 00 . 00 € für ganz eu ok , allerdings kostet das bei meinem kabel anbieter sogar monatlich nur 0 . 00 €, weshalb ich vermutlich auch kündigen werde .
neutral	das handyapp für android funktioniert fast garnicht , was ich schlecht finde , da man das gut gebrauchen kann unterwegs für festnetzanrufe .
neutral	0 von 0 sternen , weil der_preis ok ist_und man sipgate überall nutzen kann wenn_man z . b ein laptop hat und_die sipgate telefonsoftware downloadet , unabhängig wo man gerade im urlaub ist .
neutral	( habe es oft in costa_rica , peru und argentinien benutzt und ab einer dsl leitung von 0000 läuft auch_die verbindung der gespräche flüssig )
neutral	bei ebay findet man tolle schnäppchen , leider ist ebay nur noch zum kaufen empfählenswert , durch die hohen kosten die ein verkäufer hat lohnt es sich fast nicht_mehr etwas anzubieten da man einstellgebühren bezahlt + 0 % vom gewinn abgeben muss , wenn_man als verkäufer paypal anbietet sind es sogar 00 , 0 %+ 00 cent .
neutral	das ebay gebühren von verkäufer nimmt finde_ich etwas dreist , der einzige käuferschutz , den man bei ebay wirklich hat ist paypal und durch den hohen betrag bieten immer weniger verkäufer diese option an , so dass bei einem betrug leider nichts mehr helfen kann .
neutral	zwar kann_man bei ebay auf " problem klären " klicken , jedoch bekommt man dann nach einer gewissen zeit die antwort , das ebay nicht helfen kann , weil nicht über paypal bezahlt wurde .
neutral	fazit : da ebay immer teurere gebühren anbietet , werden auch_die preise bei ebay teurer von den verkäufern , was schnäppchen nur noch selten macht , aufgrund der hohen paypal kosten , bieten immer weniger verkäufer diese option an und damit ist_auch keine sicherheit mehr beim einkauf gegeben .
neutral	daher nur 0 von 0 sternen .
neutral	ich_habe zum ersten mal bei dell was bestellt_und_bin recht zufrieden , leider bekommt man kaum treiberupdates für seine geräte und_auch der download ist ziemlich problematisch .
neutral	abwohl ich ein dell pc habe funktioniert der dell downloader nicht , dagegen aber die iso variante oder direktdownload .
neutral	der support ist_sehr hilfsbereit und wenn es wirklich mal eng wird , kann dell sogr auf_den pc ( ähnlich wie mit teamviewer ) und so das problem vielleicht beseitigen .
neutral	ich_habe bei dell einen xps 00 mit 0d brille und grafikkarte + bildschirm gekauft , der laptop ist super , die 0d funktion allerdings nicht sehr .
neutral	bestellt hatte_ich ein nvidia 0d kit das den sensor separat dabei hatte , bei dem ansich nämlich auch " duke nukem " kostenlos dabei sein sollte von nvidia , leider bekam ich nur die brille geliefert die für den preis überteuert war , da die brille einzeln nur 00 € kostet und hingegen das komplette kit 000 €.
neutral	auch scheint die 0d funktion nicht ganz richtig zu sein , wenn_man anvisiert kann_man nie die mitte treffen , man muss mit_dem kurser ziemlich nach links oder rechts gehen .
neutral	ich vergebe dell deshalb nur 0 von 0 sternen .
neutral	man_bekommt bei pearl als kunde sehr oft kostenlose angebote , leider muss man auch bei geschenken 0 € versand bezahlen , unabhängig vom gewicht .
neutral	oft sind die gratis geschenke minderwertig , gehen schnell kaputt oder funktionieren erst garnicht .
neutral	bei einem gratis geschenk , bekam ich sogar einen virus , weil die treiber vom hersteller verseucht waren und dieser deswegen vom markt genommen wurde , leider habe_ich das zu spät bei google gelesen als_ich nach guten treibern suchte .
neutral	als_ich dies dem support mitteilte , kam keine reaktion .
neutral	auch gibt_es erst bei_einer ziemlich hohen summe " kostenlose lieferung ", wo viele ab 00 € schon kostenlos anbieten .
neutral	der_versand dauert je nach bestellung bis zu 0 - 0 wochen und kommt voll gefüllt mit werbung .
neutral	the oxygen_sensor was the wrong piece . the inside par fit but not the outside .
neutral	i ordered 00 items of which 0 where backordered .
neutral	yesterday i recieved the 0 first and they were as specified , but the packaging must be very low quality - it was a cardboard_box , of which one of the sides were completely split_open .
neutral	pure luck none of the heavy schampoo bottles hadn_'_t slipped out !
neutral	also , you don_'_t get a shipping order any more , only vouchers for shops that does not have business in my country ( this is a very minor_issue , but shows clearly they don_'_t even check where the package is going - i don_'_t live in the uk but get a load of discount_vouchers for sainsbury '_s and a wine company .
neutral	it annoys me ).
neutral	i was disappointed when i called for an early reorder due to spilling more than half the medicine on the floor due to the stopper coming out when i pulled the syringe out with the bottle still upside_down .
neutral	then i had to go to my vet and get generic prednisolone liquid in pre_- filled syringes ( not my first choice for quality ), to cover the time it took to ship the next bottle 0 days !!
neutral	!
neutral	their should be instructions which notify you that the stopper is not fixed in the bottle but can be pulled out accidentally when withdrawing the syringe filled with medicine .
neutral	the instruction should advise the person to turn the bottle parallel to the floor before pulling out the syringe and to hold the stopper in with a clean tissue when doing so .
neutral	not happy here .
neutral	.
neutral	i was sent an_email after i placed my order that informed me i couldn_'_t drop ship my car parts to my auto repair_shop .
neutral	the parts were going to be sent to the billing_address on my credit_card , which is a shopping center where my husband has an office and he is rarely there .
neutral	i couldn_'_t reply to the email and was disconnected every time i placed a call to partsgeek .
neutral	i had a lot of angst as my only option was to complete a service ticket and hope that i was available when i was contacted by them .
neutral	i received my order accurately and quickly after i was finally able to get a person to call me from partsgeek .
neutral	the customer_service representative handled my problem very efficiently .
neutral	so , other than the few_days that it took to correct my shipment address , everything was fine !
neutral	i am exstreamly pleased with the jacket a bought from superdry , however returning products that didn_'_t fit were expensive
neutral	some of the deals i '_ve received through_travelocity are unmatched .
neutral	however , dealing_with customer_service is enough to make me shop elsewhere .
neutral	no on explained why they mounted my tires in the rear instead of the front .
neutral	even my husband was surprised !
neutral	now i have to make another trip or phone_call to get an explanation .
neutral	my suggestion , if you are going to print out what service you will perform , you need to explain to the customer fully to avoid misunderstanding later .
neutral	well , it '_s interesting and i guess it will work .
neutral	i have a few issues with it however .
neutral	0st - the " units " are a little on the big size , i think too big for the game .
neutral	0nd - having to cut each and every " unit " out instead of them being_able
neutral	to pop out .
neutral	i received an_email_confirming that my mum had received her flowers , yet a phone_call revealed that she had not received any flowers .
neutral	a reply to the confirmation_email resulted in a reply that stated the flowers were left on the front_porch .
neutral	although mother '_s sunday may be a very busy day , a simple ring of the doorbell or a card through the mail slot would have alerted mum that she had received flowers .
neutral	poor mum spent the day thinking we had forgotten her !
neutral	very disappointing ...
neutral	travelocity has always been fantastic to me .
neutral	however , this past trip was a big_disappointment .
neutral	my son got sick so i had to cancel the last day of the hotel , which i did a full 00_hours before .
neutral	i was promised a refund , but now they won_'_t even return my e_- mail .
neutral	something has apparently happend in their customer_service , to their ( and my detriment .)
neutral	well i was happy to find a place that would purchase my books but i was very dissapointed in the amounts that are offered for them .
neutral	and i have a whole closet of books to sell but eaglesaver only bought a quarter of what i wanted to sell .
neutral	so i still have a bunch of books im stuck with .
neutral	i will not be using eaglesaver again .
neutral	i got the trademark i requested , but i '_ve called and emailed them several_times and they never responded .
neutral	pleased that our order arrived right on time with accurate contents ; however , as other_reviewers have noted , part of the order ( canned_cat_food ) arrived damaged .
neutral	several of the cans were badly dented - it sounds like pet_flow needs to improve its packaging .
neutral	otherwise , very convenient !
neutral	i love that you can sign_up for automatic delivery with a frequency that suits your needs .
neutral	please improve the way you pack your orders , pet_flow , and we will_continue to buy !
neutral	i was able to find the exact pet_food that our vet recommended , however , your website failed when it came to asking me how often i wanted to automatically have the food shipped .
neutral	it seemed to have a glitch and so i had to e_- mail customer_service to be sure that my order was only for one shipment , not multiple .
neutral	other than that , the food is exactly_what the vet ordered for our dog .
neutral	don_'_t know how long he '_ll need to be on this type which is why we didn_'_t want multiple shipments .
neutral	i recently had to purchase different dog_food as my pet was not eating good ... in the meantime i recieved another order from petflow upon contacting them as to what to do with this shipment it has_been four days and i have still heard_nothing ... today they sent me this survey ... and no answer to my problem ... so this is my opinion ... during my business with petflow ... i found it difficult to change orders because in doing so , you cancel out your next order and need to wait for the one after that ... i was always running_out of food , and had to go to the store which is quite a distance from my house ... that '_s why i went to petflow , however , sometimes it was a convenience and sometimes it was a hassle ...
neutral	i found this by_accident and fell in love , the prices are great but , one day i received an_email for some dog_food half off , so i placed a big order and was so exceited how much i got and how much money i saved .
neutral	well i waited two_days for a tracking_number and finally called to see what was going on .
neutral	i got a rep . on the phone that told me the food was on back order and 0 of the other 0 items were discontinued so i couldnt even get them .
neutral	i was frustrated why the website said that they had plenty in and i didnt get anything and then they wouldnt honor sale because it was out of stock .
neutral	i thought i would give them another try and ordered two more orders and they were both great prices and shipping was great timing but still same thing some of the stuff i ordered that said available it wasnt .
neutral	if i shop again im just not gonna order anything with a small quanity left .
neutral	other than that my animals loved the stuff .
neutral	i had to book tickets for my family who were visiting overseas because online bookings did not accept international credit_card bookings .
neutral	however , after purchasing the tickets for my family using my uk card my family had to take my credit_card for the day because the operators required the actual credit_card before they will issue the ticket .
neutral	changes to make the system easier for international visitors would have made the experience much more enjoyable .
neutral	the tour itself is very good but it was let_down on this occasion by the tour_guide .
neutral	i am a londoner and had taken a visiting relative on the tour & was mortified sitting next to a gay couple from new_york having to listen to various homophobic jokes from the elderly tour_guide .
neutral	some of the commentary was also simply wrong .
neutral	i don_'_t know if parts are correct ones , until i go to install them .
neutral	the part numbers given on the boxs do not match the part numbers given on the website page .
neutral	my flight was canceled but did not receive the email until was already at connecting airport , email was supposedly sent 0 hours earlier .
neutral	at connecting airport , they didn_'_t pay for hotel in the area & i was forced to stay in airport overnight until i could be put on an early_morning flight to another city not originally_planned for .
neutral	i am really grateful to the airline worker at springfield airport , wyatt , who made it possible for me to even get on a flight though .
neutral	it '_s nice and easy to order , the free_shipping is awesome , but the actual clothes were much_cheaper quality than i expected .
neutral	cheap flights and cheap cars to rent do not necessarily mean a good experience organizing your travels , but as i say , you get what you pay for .
neutral	your shipping time estimate is way off .
neutral	my books were 0 days late for my class .
neutral	whilst the service was prompt , the product well_packaged and priced , sadly it is not reliable .
neutral	the adhesion to clothing is good but the absorbant top layer material detaches from the adhesive base and disintergrates after only a couple of hours of wear making the product ineffective .
neutral	a shame .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t buy this brand again .
neutral	the shopping was good , many things in my size ( small or extra small ) the prices and deals were great !
neutral	shipping was like any other , not super_fast though .
neutral	but i am disappointed that one of my items were out of stock , i ' d_rather you restock things and send it to me later rather_than get a free ring , but i understand if you dont restock .
neutral	also some of the clothes seemed cheap .
neutral	the buttons were near to falling_off , and on a different shirt one of the buttons were completely unaligned .
neutral	also the tags on one of the shirts were cut_off ...?
neutral	overall it was decent , your products were appealing but the quality was a bit under the bar , but at a price so cheap it was worth it .
neutral	thank_you for the clothes
neutral	my initial order with ni_parcels went without hitch .
neutral	0nd time was a different matter and was without a doubt one of the most stressful experiences with a courier service .
neutral	as a small business_owner , i do not have time to chase up tasks which i have allocated and paid someone_else to do .
neutral	nor do i need a lecture on running a business which doesn_'_t collect customer phone numbers .
neutral	excessive use of " i can only apologise " negates the apology and makes matters worse .
neutral	i don_'_t want words i want actions which are going to correct the error .
neutral	that said i have used the service for a third time as i think everyone deserves the chance to improve on their service .
neutral	still_waiting for that parcel to be delivered so can '_t comment on the outcome .
neutral	it did not give us the option to change shipping address .
neutral	so the book came to my house and i had to send it to my daughter at her college .
neutral	she still does not have it .
neutral	i love the option to create your own gift_cards .
neutral	i own a wedding business and as brides refer me to other brides i send them a gift_card and personalize it with a photo of their bouquet .
neutral	but shipping takes way too long and is not consistent .
neutral	i ordered two gift_cards on one day , shipped them to the same town .
neutral	one bride got hers in days , the second has not been delivered yet and it has_been three_weeks !
neutral	as above .
neutral	i now have no money !
neutral	!
neutral	shipping takes foreverrrrrrr
neutral	in my experience with dealing_with potential new customers , i '_ve come to find out that if you have the right people in place who are following the right process , you will undoubtedly be able to serve the best product .
neutral	with swift capital , it seemed like they had the right people in place but they all seemed to be following a different process which led to a frustrating experience when it came to just wanting the product .
neutral	back and forth on the same topic until finally an experienced person completely understood the situation and in the end was able to deliver the product .
neutral	that '_s why if i '_m being honest , the rating is so - so - acceptable experience but with some friction .
neutral	i couldn_'_t have asked for better service from any of the people that work with us friendly answered any question we had .
neutral	but it was such a long day got there at 00am finally finished at 0pm we checked the car we bought from one end the other no_problems till i drove 0 nights later first time to be driving the new car at night time i had daytime running lights and bright lights on the car during the day you would have thought the lights worked to looked at them during the checklist i got pulled over trying to get back home for using the bright lights to make it home thank_god the cop understood and didn_'_t give me a ticket went by the dealer i got the car from and they said they would see what they could do for me i will call you back never we talked a few_times but no answer other then he was waiting for someone to get out of a meeting i waited till noon the next_day with still not a call back so i called and they said the person i needed to talk to was gone for the day that was 0 hours into business that day here is a week_later and no one has bothered calling me at all so sad they sold me a car then they didn_'_t care about nothing sad thing is that within two_days of getting this car i had already sent someone that bought a car from them so that makes me feel_like they just wanted my money and me to send business to them but they don_'_t want to make me happy and coming_back sad they got me in with kindness and then treated me like trash thats how it made me feel i went to the vw dealership down the road and talked with them about fixing the lights and they said it was an easy mistake that they have run_into before and they quoted me a price i am taking it to them already having to poor money into a 0000 that i shouldn_'_t have too
neutral	i was in arms about the process , certain that i was scammed , but just an_hour ago my necklace arrived .. the company had agreed to reimburse_me for the item but they do not need to now .
neutral	i got it and am satisfied with the quality for what i paid .
neutral	i feel bad for saying they were a scam .
neutral	clearly they do produce these items .
neutral	i do believe they should not rely_on the usps with no tracking for their shipping .
neutral	it is not a good plan and has left many shoppers stressed .
neutral	i had some issues contacting the company with a problem in my order .
neutral	i received an_email alerting me of the problem and asking me to respond yet no one responded to my requested email .
neutral	that was disappointing and an inconvenience , but the product was good and i '_m glad i bought it .
neutral	bought a six month pack of antihistamines at end of may ' 00 with a groupon_voucher .
neutral	delivery very prompt , but use - by date on antihistamine boxes was december ' 00 , so not very impressive considering they were manufactured in january ' 00 !
neutral	awesome service .
neutral	too many ads though .
neutral	some privacy concerns too .
neutral	pure_formulas has a wide_variety of the products i use but lately shipping has_been very slow , even when paying for priority shipping it is slow .
neutral	very disappointed in delivery_men they wouldn_'_t put furniture in its place we couldn_'_t move them ourselfs ... wardrobes were 0 heavy .. we bought from urselfs for ease cos they were ready built ...
neutral	very annoyed
neutral	breakfast good room cold took all night to warm up the room
neutral	overall we ' re very happy with the service from driveaway .
neutral	we '_ve used your company for many years_now with good results .
neutral	however we bring it to your attention the lack of service at hertz heathrow_airport this time .
neutral	after waiting a considerable time at pick_up we were told that a vauxall astra wasn_'_t available & we would have to accept a model two levels down on the one we ordered , with £_00 compensation .
neutral	as we were renting the car for a month this was unacceptable .
neutral	they then suggested we take the car for a week & return it for the correct one , which was silly in the extreme .
neutral	after standing our ground for 00_min hertz magically came up with the next category car .
neutral	we were not the only people in this position but having the time to be stubborn meant we finally got a reasonable car .
neutral	this is not really a complaint about your company but we thought you should be aware of the problem for future negotiations with hertz .
neutral	yours ,
neutral	patricia bendall
neutral	the car and the service were great !
neutral	very helpful for a foreigner that neglected to brush up on the language before traveling !
neutral	however , i checked off that i needed a gps device and there were none available , and the only car available with gps was way out of my price range .
neutral	so , the girl google mapped directions and printed it out for me and gave_me several maps .
neutral	it was fantastic customer_service , but after getting severely lost , i ended_up spending about $_000 in roaming charges by using the navigation on my cell_phone ... so that sucked !
neutral	thankfully , i arrived at my destination just in time to keep on schedule .
neutral	the car they gave_me was brand_new , not much horse power , but didn_'_t really need it , and i could make it perform if i needed to accelerate quick at merges .
neutral	i was very happy with the car and the service overall .
neutral	hello , i originally ordered three items , and to date have only received two .
neutral	i am missing my screen protectors for the ipad0 .
neutral	what could have been a good experience as been dampened by the lack of communication on the delay ...
neutral	please advise !
neutral	the things that wowcher offers are really good .
neutral	i have also bought over 0 items from wowcher , however i can '_t help but notice that wowcher sometimes tries to be sneaky about their things .
neutral	i just purchased a night hotel for 0 persons .
neutral	i bought this because the pictures of the rooms that were displayed with the wowcher deal were very very nice .
neutral	i bought the wocher and then i noticed that the pictures that were presented in the advertisment , were from rooms that you could not book with your wocher .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t call it false_advertising , but i do believe it is very missleading .
neutral	all the other rooms are a bit crap in comparison to that one .
neutral	next i bought the driverslessons .
neutral	it was very unclear that you couldnt use these lessons if youre experienced .
neutral	and third , i bought myself a handbag , and now , 0 months later , i still_haven_'_t received this item .
neutral	i was very pleased with the ease of ordering and quickness of shipping and arrival of order .
neutral	however , when my daughter tried on the gloves i ordered , a seam ripped when she tried to remove it .
neutral	she admits that she may have pulled too hard , but the manufacturer should know that people are going to do that and sew seams accordingly .
neutral	received my order promptly , but the yellow ink cartrudge i ordered didn_'_t feed , so am back to square one .
neutral	these lights arrived within 0 days and looked a very good quality .
neutral	pleased so_far .
neutral	charged them over 0 days in full sunshine ( 00hrs in all ) but only 0 out of 0 lit_up .
neutral	tried again the next_day to charge them up but to no_avail so have returned them in the hope of a refund .
neutral	shame as they were really nice lights .
neutral	wont bother again .
neutral	we have been searching for a digital_piano for sometime and finally found the perfect instrument .
neutral	this is our second digital_piano and even_though we thought our other piano was brilliant , this one leaves it standing .
neutral	i paid £_000 more than i wished to get it delivered on time and for the added_bonus of what looked like superior quality ear phones .
neutral	very dissapointed in the earphones which not only do not work , the conections / wiring is faulty ??
neutral	and they are available on ebay for £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	hugely dissapointed by this misleading advertising .
neutral	goods arrived next_day .
neutral	unfortunately one item was missing - no paperwork arrived in package .
neutral	had to telephone to find out where missing item was - was informed that they did not have item in stock and would be posting out as soon as it became available .
neutral	would have been good to email this information to me , or , to include documentation inside the package to confirm this .
neutral	sometimes i will get lucky and get a driver / office attendant that is friendly but most of the time the workers look and act miserable .
neutral	not the best greeting before or after a trip .
neutral	also , the most_recent time i used nltp the driver did not even offer to assist with my suitcase so i carried my medium suitcase on and off the shuttle_bus .
neutral	the good thing is i haven_'_t had to wait for a shuttle for long .
neutral	sadly the delivery was awful !
neutral	my package went all around the granby before it arrived at the delivery address - was supposed to go to my partner at his work , dorset auto spares , but went to about 0 other addresses before it got to him !!
neutral	dont understand_why because ive ordered from them before and there was no problem delivery wise that time .
neutral	some of products were made very cheaply .
neutral	i purchased puppy_pads and when the dog uses them one time they go through and get my floor soak n wet .
neutral	very cheaply_made for price .
neutral	i think that web - site must be updated .
neutral	no personl cabinet , serach isn ` t so convinient
neutral	box of stuff was collected at the door which is a bonus as already selling for peanuts , but as stuff was unwanted anyway it cleared_up a space in the cupboards and don_'_t have time to ebay stuff .
neutral	takes a few_weeks to actually get the money in but have got it eventually , so all in all wasn_'_t a bad_experience .
neutral	i am not sure i would use this service again .
neutral	way too much time between ordering the cards and delivery of the cards .
neutral	karen
neutral	i was pleased to see that i could_afford to get my dogs ' food delivered to our home .
neutral	however , it looked as though they marked the item for shipping ( which provided an eta ) nearly immediately .
neutral	sounds great , but the issue was that the package wasn_'_t actually handed off to fedex until the very day it was stated to arrive .
neutral	this made tracking & being home to receive the delivery a challenge & quite annoying .
neutral	i '_m a first time buyer through this site & do not know if i will be purchasing again .
neutral	i like petflow '_s fast shipping .
neutral	it is very convenient .
neutral	when i order cat_litter , which i typically do for all orders , every time i open the shipping box , litter is spilled out because its box was torn .
neutral	from the outside , the shipping box looks good .
neutral	i don_'_t know what to think , except a lot of cat_litter gets wasted and ends_up making a mess .
neutral	i have since learned to be cautious when opening the box , but i still lose litter and make some kind of mess .
neutral	please package the litter better .
neutral	i am paying for a full , intact box of cat_litter .
neutral	also , the golf ball size light up ball is my cat '_s favorite .
neutral	the problem is the ball is so small it rolls under everything .
neutral	i usually can find it after a search with the flashlight , but it has_been missing for a few_weeks .
neutral	are you able to offer a larger light up ball ?
neutral	my cat and i would appreciate it .
neutral	flowers sent to my mother in law as a thank_you .
neutral	when i saw them later that day , personally as the person paying for them , i was a little disappointed .
neutral	it '_s nice to have them delivered to the door , but could have bought better and cheaper from the supermarket .
neutral	i ordered a large pillow to winterize my pool .
neutral	it arrived_promptly as_promised and we took it out of the package the next weekend when we closed the pool .
neutral	as we were filling it up with air , we noticed that there was a large slice in it -- as if it was cut with a knife or box cutter .
neutral	since we were in the middle of the pool closing process , i ran_out to the nearest pool store to buy a replacement .
neutral	i then followed the instructions for returning the product and requested a refund instead of a replacement since i had already bought another .
neutral	two_days_later , a box appeared on my doorstep and doheny '_s water warehouse had sent a replacement product .
neutral	no_longer need it , but i guess it is better_than nothing .
neutral	i had to pay over $_00 in shipping to send it back too .
neutral	next time i will not buy inflatables thru the mail in case there is a problem .
neutral	bag looks like no name and was broken .
neutral	customer_service wants just money .
neutral	nothing special for me .
neutral	i went online and read some reviews about the super 0 in plattsburgh .
neutral	i was not expecting much from what some of the reviews said .
neutral	i was pleasantly_surprised with all_aspects of my stay .
neutral	the room was very clean .
neutral	all the linens were clean , the bed was very comfortable .
neutral	the area was quiet and conveniently_located 0 downtown plattsburgh and the shopping area .
neutral	the staff was very nice and helpful .
neutral	the price was very affordable .
neutral	i would definitely stay again .
neutral	as i stated above , i had to return an item , it did not weigh very much , but it cost me $ 0 . 00 , and the item only cost $_00 . 00 .
neutral	what a rip , you should have free return shipping .
neutral	information_regarding contact with the vets_office provided to me was incorrect .
neutral	great quality , fantastic value for money .
neutral	i live in a very rural location and share the postcode with many farms in the area , so my parcel went to a different farm !
neutral	it was lucky that the other farm knew me so i could collect my parcel !
neutral	i would like to see more coupons that work on your entire order not limited to certain brands .
neutral	that is what kept me coming to pureformulas now i shop the best deal & look for coupons & order the cheapest price because most of us do not have extra money to blow .
neutral	amazon offers less prices among other_sites , you use to be the best .
neutral	thanks for listening !
neutral	we were looking for a cheap hotel .
neutral	we got it .
neutral	sheets were clean .
neutral	the tub was clean .
neutral	the bathroom floor had hair on it .
neutral	the bed martress was way to hard .
neutral	i could feel every spring .
neutral	the building itself looked horrible .
neutral	the locks on the doors did not make me feel_safe . i would not walk in bare feet had to have something on .
neutral	the hotel was quiet which was a surprise !
neutral	a welcome surprise .
neutral	my dog_loves the food , however the delivery truck has delivered the last 0 times to the incorrect_address .
neutral	unfortunately both_times animals have chewed into the package to get the dog_food .
neutral	other than that , the food is great .
neutral	i ordered on - line .
neutral	somehow the order got lost .
neutral	i called - the person told me the order somehow got overlooked .
neutral	delivery came 0 days_later and we were very close to no food for our dog .
neutral	we decided to use priceline for the first time on our vacation to save some money .
neutral	i was happy with the price we got but very disappointed that we could not set specific qualifications for rooms , etc .
neutral	we used it three_times ( three different hotels ) and each time had trouble with the room ( bed type , smoking / non_smoking ).
neutral	in two situations the specific hotels told us that there were rooms available in the type we wanted but we were told ( even after pushing the issue ) that the hotels were not allowed / able to change the type of room .
neutral	my husband had to end up sleeping on the floor .
neutral	if this is the normal case , i wish there was a place on priceline where you could put in some qualifications like certain types of rooms , non_- smoking , number of guests , etc so that you could be sure to get something that fits your needs .
neutral	because of these problems , we will think_twice about using priceline in the future .
neutral	we had reserved an automatic and got a lovely upgrade to a terrific volvo : we loved our car .
neutral	everything went_smoothly at pick - up and drop - off , including a last - minute change of drop - off location .
neutral	our car was economical on fuel ( diesel ), roomy and comfortable , easy to maneuver on the narrow streets of ancient towns .
neutral	the europcar personnel were all competent , knowledgeable , and charming .
neutral	i ' d rate five_stars except for the safety issues involved in not having a spare + compressor , especially as we were traveling in an area with difficult road conditions .
neutral	this is the 0nd time i purchase a personalized card on this site .
neutral	i like the insurance of delivery and the time of the first one .
neutral	well the second time was not a pleasure ... don_'_t like the way they handled rejecting my pic on the card ...
neutral	i wanted to personalize the gift_cards to match a gingerbread theme for christmas wrapping_paper and gift bags and to make the gift special for each kid .
neutral	however , it wouldn_'_t let_me resize or enlarge each photo and the picture turned_out fuzzy .
neutral	also , the personalized_greeting_card fee was too high for what i could do with it .
neutral	if the personalized_greeting_card fee was included , i would have purchased more gift_cards .
neutral	macy '_s personalized_gift_cards include the free personalized_greeting_card and delivery .
neutral	the personalization program wasn_'_t easy to work with but at_least i was able to get the results i wanted .
neutral	when your adds said part is for left and right customer should receive left and right when place the order , not just one . unless it said left or right
neutral	i have ordered from petflow before and was always very happy with the service .
neutral	the only difference this time was that i moved and changed my address in your system but the delivery still went to the old address .
neutral	the prices are great .
neutral	the shipping is a little_longer_than i would like but i '_ve ordered on numerous_occasions and had great experiences .
neutral	i stumbled_upon sparefoot when i was searching online for a local storage_unit .
neutral	the website is clean and organized .
neutral	i found a facility i was interested in and called the number listed .
neutral	at this number i spoke to a sparefoot representative who took my information down and made a " reservation " to hold a 0 ' x 00 ' unit .
neutral	they sent a confirmation_email , including the phone_number for the actual facility .
neutral	i then called the facility directly to ask some further questions and was told they did not have any 0 ' x 00 ' units available , and did not understand_why we were told that they did .
neutral	i ended_up going back to my search_engine and found a different storage_facility on my own and am very happy with them .
neutral	my friend and i booked a room at the hotel .
neutral	she went through_expedia , i went straight to the site .
neutral	the room rate was the same , so i preceded .
neutral	after i confirmed and received the total with tax and fees , i paid $_00 more than she did .
neutral	we booked the same room type and within 00_minutes of each other .
neutral	i didn_'_t get a break_down of tax and fees so i don_'_t know where the increase is .
neutral	disappointed i didn_'_t get the same deal for the same product .
neutral	it would be great if you had more restaurants signed_up ... and if you followed_up with restaurants a bit better .
neutral	( i '_ve made a few orders that have then been cancelled because the place closed between when my order was sent and the place closed .)
neutral	but , i do really like the service .
neutral	the basically weekly discounts are great , they definitely make me more likely to use delivery . com more frequently than grubhub or eat00 , despite preferring those websites .
neutral	why does our small purchase come in such a big box ?
neutral	i would think a smaller box , which would be adequate for our purchase , would be less_expensive to ship .
neutral	we did not get to see what we wanted .
neutral	we had to ask the bus drivers about the itinerary of each bus , and ended_up on the same path 0x before getting directions from the coordinator at one of the stations about where to get off and what bus to catch next .
neutral	it was confusing .
neutral	probably would not use this bus service again .
neutral	i ordered 0 cards ; delivery was to 0 different_addresses .
neutral	i only received shipping confirmation with a tracking_number for 0 of the cards .
neutral	when i called the automated customer_service line to verify shipment of the other 0 cards , the service indicated that my order had been shipped in may of 0000 !!
neutral	i did speak to a representative who was able to confirm that all of my cards had shipped - but he never offered to forward me tracking_numbers .
neutral	also , when i told him about the response i received through the automated line , he just said " yeah , that '_s been happening ."
neutral	there was no effort at any point to say , " we ' re aware of that issue and are resolving it ," or " sorry you didn_'_t get shipment confirmation for the other 0 cards , we '_ll resolve that issue ," or even an offer to send me an_email with the tracking_numbers for the other 0 shipments .
neutral	really disappointed in this service .
neutral	will only use it again next year if i am desperate .
neutral	i '_m giving them 0_stars only because all of the cards were delivered on time .
neutral	while the straighteners were cheap and work ok , the casing looks like it has_been chewed by something and the spring cover was lying in the box broken .
neutral	tried to contact funtica by their " contact page " but it will not send .
neutral	when ordering our new rangemaster gas cooking range we took_advantage of the special_offer of a free rangecookers own branded extractor hood to go with it .
neutral	in reality it '_s not free as the price of the cooker was a few_hundred_pounds more_expensive than other online_retailers , however it still appeared to be a good deal .
neutral	the online ordering and delivery service was first_class and faultless for both items .
neutral	the rangemaster cooker is fantastic and was commiissioned by our experienced fitter with no_problems .
neutral	my issue is with the quality of the so called complimentary hood .
neutral	the fitting_instructions were poor and extremely vague , but more_importantly not all the required parts were supplied in order for it to be set_up and run in re circulation mode , in particularly the charcoal filters .
neutral	i find this completely unsatisfactory for rangecookers to knowingly supply new equipment that is not fit for purpose due to being incomplete .
neutral	i would not recommend anyone to buy one of rangecookers own branded extractor hoods .
neutral	not had part of my last order delivered yet so not a happy customer at the moment , first time i have had any bother with highland_titles .
neutral	i shop_here often and it is rare to get anything that is sized right and doesn_'_t look cheap .
neutral	now i do like the clothes but they are never as they appear on the site .
neutral	pants run small and shirts tend to run a bit large in my experience .
neutral	i would not recommend the sweat pants at all , and sweaters are going to be thin .
neutral	anything with rhinestones i don_'_t recommend either .
neutral	attachments on shoes like flowers may fall off , but if you have a hot glue gun ..... also the jewelry is just horribly cheaply_made , so ... just as long as you know what to buy you are ok .
neutral	i will say i have been waiting for more than a week on my last order , and when i accidentally added two of the same sweaters to my cart rather_than calling or emailing to be sure it was not a mistake they sent it and told me my mistake my shipping problem , so ... yeah , that was more than a 000 dollar order , and i had 0 others on the way , so i felt a bit unappreciated .
neutral	i hope it was not lost or stolen , because they are not responsible for that either evidently .
neutral	product looks amazing on line .
neutral	i am still_waiting to hear from the futon_shop about when product was shipped & when it is estimated to arrive .
neutral	i also did not receive a confirmation of my order .
neutral	still hopeful it will come .
neutral	this site would be better if it listed everything according to the time it was posted , rather_than making you choose the option .
neutral	i always end up loosing where i was at in the search process .
neutral	i also don_'_t like the sponsored jobs at the top and bottom of the page .
neutral	it '_s distracting .
neutral	once a week should be adequate to find events of interest .
neutral	also , might have a method for targeting types of interests of member ( e . g .
neutral	no jazz , but theater ).
neutral	also , i will never buy a ticket at a large venue like the ahmanson .
neutral	the ticketing method allows theaters to sell a huge section for the same price .
neutral	e . g .
neutral	" orchestra " can be from 0st row to last row .
neutral	how can i know i won_'_t be in the last row ?
neutral	i will be able to give a better answer .. after i see them help me look for work .
neutral	not really happy cos none of the three wheel trims could be put back as they were .
neutral	tyres were replaced satisfactorily though
neutral	i ordered 0 different parts which came from three different_warehouses .
neutral	i had to pay three different shipping prices which was a huge con .
neutral	fortunately , one part arrived the very next_day !
neutral	however , my two other parts were a different story .
neutral	i had been tracking my package and found that it was delivered on a monday and signed for by somebody that i did not know .
neutral	i went home to found that my package was not there .
neutral	i placed multiple calls to fedex and was given incorrect information and was disconnected multiple_times when asked to speak to a manager .
neutral	i finally spoke to a manager who did not know where or what happened to my package and she planned on calling me the next_day at 0pm when the shipping warehouse was open .
neutral	once again , fedex failed and did not return my phone_call .
neutral	i called fedex once again and spoke with a representative who told me that my package had been left at the leasing office of my apartment building .
neutral	i am unsure of why it took me 0 + hours of multiple phone_calls for this information to get to me .
neutral	fedex did not leave any type of notice on my door about the package being left at the leasing office so naturally i assumed that it had been delivered to the wrong place .
neutral	i am very pleased with partsgeek but very displeased with the shipping company and s &_h prices .
neutral	i bought these brake rotors due to them being half the price that anyone locally could offer .
neutral	the shipping took a lot longer_than i expected but there was alot of snow storms .
neutral	the packaging was not sufficient which is why i feel lucky they werent damaged .
neutral	it was a cardboard_box with the large bubble packs .
neutral	and then the boxes with my rotors in them .
neutral	all 0 boxes were mangled and crushed and a number of the bubble packs were popped .
neutral	the box was also damp and soggy and just falling_apart .
neutral	i believe this is due entirely to the shipping company though however it couldve been packaged much_better .
neutral	i also was really put off by the cost of shipping but it could have been worse .
neutral	so to summarize .
neutral	price was good .
neutral	product came unharmed .
neutral	packaging was destroyed , packed poorly , and mistreated on its journey .
neutral	i gave the website 0_stars because while it did locate me a lender .
neutral	it was only one and the lender was in the west indies !
neutral	i didn ’ t feel_comfortable with using a lender not locate in the usa .
neutral	i have to say the new site is awful and slow its become more cumbersome to shop on the site and i have decreased going on .
neutral	also the fact you place items in the shopping bag and it times out .. so frustrating
neutral	the quote was lost and needed to be followed_up upon .
neutral	the order was lost and needed to be followed_up upon .
neutral	enough said .
neutral	having ordered flowers for mother '_s day to be delivered to her i '_m disappointed with the service thus_far .
neutral	my mother is yet to receive the flowers i ordered for her .
neutral	very disappointing as i wanted them to be on time as unfortunately i couldn_'_t go home to see her .
neutral	she is now aware that they are to be delivered and now it '_s a case of anticipation rather_than surprise .
neutral	i have used this company before ( last_year ) and was impressed as the flowers are beautiful and of high_quality , but however this wasn_'_t the case on this occasion .
neutral	poor mammy , mother '_s day flowers on april fools it is then !
neutral	( hopefully )
neutral	i found the website to be easy to navigate through and the choices were on point "
neutral	i have always been pleased with the lights i have ordered especially my palm_trees .
neutral	i recently ordered some new candles for my windows and the electric light sensitive ones are great .
neutral	however i also ordered 0 battery candles and they are awful .
neutral	not only the fact you can barely see the bulb when it is lit .
neutral	they no_longer work after a week .
neutral	they weren_'_t left on all the time , they were on only in the evenings .
neutral	i am very disappointed .
neutral	ooga_lights i would stop selling them immediately .
neutral	website and purchasing was great .
neutral	i loved that it came right to my house .
neutral	also loved that the cabinet was solid_oak .
neutral	however , i was shocked that there was no back on the cabinet behind the drawer section .
neutral	for almost $_000 , i thought it would have been better made .
neutral	even it there was just a thinner piece covering that area .
neutral	i ordered 0 items from 00_dollar mall ; a varsity jacket and a chiffon button up shirt .
neutral	the varsity jacket has quickly become on of the items in my closet i will cherish , it is well made and very cozy .
neutral	the shirt on the other hand is the reason for the three star_rating , i ordered a size x - large and was sent a size small .
neutral	the shirt label that was clearly_visible behind the plastic packaging read small and so did the manufacturing printing on the package .
neutral	the bar_code sticker added by 00_dollar mall however read x - large .
neutral	i do plan on ordering from this site again , but i just hope they sort out their labeling accurately .
neutral	i put the cartridges in the printer , but it states the ink is low , so i don_'_t know if the ink is bad or if the ink is actually low .
neutral	it was a great transaction but i am not sure if i have ink in the cartridges !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered 0 items and received one item within a week .
neutral	still_waiting on the other two items .
neutral	need large sized dog_food items for 0 doberman pinschers .
neutral	rarely in stock , rarely " new " available .
neutral	always bidding & takes time needed to finalize when foods & supplies needed @ home for dogs .
neutral	cannot_afford to wait 0 , 0 , 0 days while tajikistan bidding goes on .
neutral	usually wind up paying more than would if had jst gone to local_pet_supply_store & purch anyway .
neutral	stopped completely .
neutral	not worth the hasstle
neutral	my husband liked his ; mine ok .
neutral	i googled non_- prescription_eyeglasses and got your site .
neutral	i ordered my husbands which were bifocals .
neutral	i ordered for me what i thought were bi - focals , but were just reading_glasses which i already have plenty of .
neutral	so if you order , make_sure you know what you are ordering .
neutral	i love the prices and selection that global_eyeglasses offer but the processing time is ridiculous !
neutral	it does not take that long to make glasses !!
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered the pet rug which i like .
neutral	however , as soon as i placed the order i noticed i didn_'_t receive the $ 0 off so i called customer_service .
neutral	was told they couldn_'_t change the order but would only give me a $ 0 credit_towards another order .
neutral	i do not like that type of service and will not order anything_else from them even_though i have the $ 0 credit .
neutral	seems like a way to bilk customers .
neutral	ordered gift_cards for my college daughter .
neutral	i purchased priority 0 - 0 day postage .
neutral	she didn_'_t get her gift_cards for almost 0_wks .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	perhaps i didn_'_t read the detail properly but i wasn_'_t expecting to have to make full payment on a booking for january .
neutral	i thought i was reserving a room for payment on departure , as you can on booking . com and other_sites .
neutral	the booking is cancellable and i am told i will get a full_refund if i do cancel so we '_ll see how that pans out if i do .
neutral	other than that , the site straight_forward and easy to use but i doubt i will use it again because of the payment thing .
neutral	the outside lights for £_00 . 00 were disappointing and i think i would at_least two_sets to look decent on a small tree .
neutral	i found that i could get an equivalent set for £_00 . 00 locally without the carriage .
neutral	i ordered my things .
neutral	one thing , the grips .
neutral	were not on stock .
neutral	i send a mail with a new delivery adress , and heard_nothing for weeks .
neutral	some of my mails were not able to be deliverede .
neutral	i tried to call you , but i was not able to get through to you .
neutral	i thought you had gone bankrupt !!
neutral	suddenly i received a mail , that my order had been sent .
neutral	one month after i sent my order .
neutral	i ordered an item for a birthday_present , paid_extra for 0st_class postage but the package arrived a week after the birthday .
neutral	had i known there would be a delay in delivery i could have planned for it .
neutral	there was no advise on ordering that there was a warehouse change or something along those lines .
neutral	however , the item was very good value and will keep until christmas !
neutral	thanks for quite delivery , but still_waiting for one item that was out of stock !
neutral	the flowers were delivered next_day which was good but i have to say a bit dissappointed with how many flowers there were for £_00 .
neutral	wish i had just bought some and taken with me to the hospital !!!!
neutral	they were very nice but as i said not as bit a bouquet as i thought for the money , sorry !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i was so happy when i found bcs as i needed to buy hipp baby formula .
neutral	i also ordered farleys rusks and other yummy food things .
neutral	i had high_hopes but i was disappointed .
neutral	firstly tge shipping : it took 0 days from ordering before the items were shipped , then another 0 days fir it to be delivered .
neutral	the tracking was ridiculous , all it said was arrived in usa but no next destination or estimated_arrival_date so i was in the dark for when my parcel was going to arrive .
neutral	then when my parcel finally arrived there were mistakes .
neutral	i ordered 0 boxes of farleys rusks but inly 0 arrived .
neutral	no note or explanation that they were out if stock so thats_why only 0 boxes were in the order so i had to call customer_service to ask why i was missing a box .
neutral	then i ordered 0 boxes of hipp formula stage 0 follow on milk and the invoice with the order states the 0 boxes but in the order i actually got 0 boxes of what i ordered and 0 box of hipp formula stage 0 growing up milk .
neutral	i called customer_service and was told a new box of formula will be ordered and sent to me and ill get an e_- mail confirmation once it has shipped .
neutral	i explained i was mad about the time it took to get this order so i was told it will be dealt_with quickly but its been 0 days and i still have not received an e_- mail yet !
neutral	the first time i booked it booked me with the wrong flight .
neutral	no one could help me switch it so i had to cancel it .
neutral	then i booked over the phone and they got the dates wrong so i had to cancel again !
neutral	i did speak to a guy_named bobby who was a huge help !
neutral	we got a new one booked and everything is set now
neutral	well_packaged item which arrived on time - shower was installled by my plumber who said ' it was easy to plumb ' and on testing said ' it was a nice powerful shower '.
neutral	just as i was about to book a room at a motel 0 in grants , new mexico , by using " booking . com ", an add for a super 0 on " easytobook . com " showed_up right next to the " booking . com " site .
neutral	since the super 0 was a better deal and a nicer motel for just $ 0 more , i switched over and continued my booking for the super 0 through " easytobook ",
neutral	unfortunately the dates i had plugged in ( oct . 0 - 0 ) for the motel 0 stay did not transfer over to the new booking , and old dates from a previous search for an early stay at a different place in my road_trip ( oct 0 - 0 ) were the onesthat did transfer over to the new booking .
neutral	i called easytobook customer_service , and they called the super 0 and were able to correct the date on my booking from oct . 0 - 0 to oct . 0 - 0 .
neutral	the only_thing i lost was a $ 0 . 00 coupon sale amount , that uped my bill to the super 0 .
neutral	e careful , however when you try to book a hotel in a town name that appears in more than one state ( i . e .
neutral	" mountain_home "), which can be found in both idaho and arizona and , i believe , even in one more state !
neutral	when searching for a suitable hotel in mountain_home , idaho , i almost booked a ramada_inn , which came up in " easytobook " as being located in mountain_home , idaho , listing just the street address without the name of the state .
neutral	suspecting the problem , i googled ramada_inn , mountain_home , idaho , and found there was no such hotel there .
neutral	it was actually located in a mountain_home of a different state , so i did not go_ahead with that transaction .
neutral	since there is a no refund policy at easytobook , that would have caused a big problem !!

neutral	я бронировала номер на easytobook ru , так как при поиске отеля данный сайт предложил мне наименьшую цену .
neutral	процесс оплаты не вызвал никаких нареканий - все стандартно .
neutral	подтверждение бронирования быстро пришло на e_- mail .
neutral	в личном кабинете можно посмотреть и отменить сделанные бронирования .
neutral	единственный минус - нельзя внести изменения , например предупредить отель о позднем прибытии .
neutral	если не сделать это сразу при бронировании ( если честно , то я не помню , была ли такая возможность ), то потом остается только связываться с отелем напрямую .
neutral	upd : кроме того я смогла распечатать информацию о бронировании только на русском языке .
neutral	не думаю , что на ресепшен отеля это смогут прочитать .
neutral	я пыталась распечатать подтверждение бронирования с англоязычной версии easytobook , но оно все равно было на русском .
neutral	сделайте пожалуйста возможность печати подтверждения бронирования на английском языке .
neutral	i had enjoyed the ao experience until the day of delivery .
neutral	they said that you get notified at 00 : 00 by text of your two hour delivery slot .
neutral	my text never arrived , so i went online to find out my slot was from 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 , and i planned around this accordingly .
neutral	when 00 : 00 arrived and no delivery in sight , i went online again to see that my slot had been changed to 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 , so i called them .
neutral	in the end the delivery did arrive within the revised time_slot , but i could really have done with knowing this in advance , we had a relative in hospital and plans were changed because of ao that affected a sick relative .
neutral	in the end it all worked out , but i was left dealing frustrated .
neutral	i cannot knock the efficiency , but the whole_process took quite a long time .
neutral	i did get complete updates at every_stage but overall it took just too long .
neutral	so if anyone is in a hurry for cash , don_'_t count on this service !
neutral	this is not to say i would never use it again but now at_least i know how long to wait .
neutral	booked a hotel .
neutral	got a good deal but didn_'_t find out about the extra_fees until i had already put in my credit_card info .
neutral	$_00 / day hotel fee , $_00 / day parking fee .
neutral	it was still a good deal but not what i had originally_planned on .
neutral	hotel was great .
neutral	i don_'_t like that when u call in u have to give phone_number ss #, pay date , date , address when i am already an account holder !!!
neutral	i think they need to make up a pin or something for each account that way this can be a easier way !
neutral	mindy was great but we couldn_'_t get credit_card to go through .
neutral	called my company it was valid .
neutral	second credit_card was perfect .
neutral	i ordered some of the mesh packing bags for a friend , as she had admired mine , and was delighted go get an_email offering a 0 %_discount so rushed to order some .
neutral	imagine my disappointment when i went right through the site to paying but with no opportunity to claim my discount .
neutral	i even sent an_email to customer_services to enquire why it had not been usable , no reply , another black mark !
neutral	paid for next_day delivery in the afternoon , but didnt receive the goods the next_day , on contacting supplier was advised the order was placed too late , had i known that i wouldn_'_t have paid for next_day delivery as the goods then arrived too late for what they were initially ordered for .
neutral	i needed to make a multi - city journey between ohio , two cities incalifornia , and back again .
neutral	i found a ticket that would work -- not cheap but okay price - wise , but the timing of the flights would work well .
neutral	when i selected the flight minutes later , during the time i was reviewing options , the price had jumped up .
neutral	this may not be travelocity '_s fault , but it was irritating !
neutral	how do i view my bookings with sky_park ??
neutral	how do i log in to see what i have booked ?
neutral	gain loyalty discounts for booking frequently ?
neutral	no , i cant find cheaper .
neutral	the " competition " quotes identical prices on identical products .
neutral	it would have been nice the product would have been on time .
neutral	i purchased a square_trade warranty on their website for my laptop .
neutral	a little over a year after purchase , my laptop died .
neutral	i actually took it to a local computer repair center here , just to get a diagnosis .
neutral	they told me that the hard_drive was defective .
neutral	i then filed a claim with square_trade .
neutral	0 - 0 days_later , the box came in the mail that i had to send my laptop in .
neutral	about 00 days_later , i received my laptop back .
neutral	they replaced a bunch of stuff , but not the hard_drive .
neutral	so i turned on my laptop and it was the same problem .
neutral	i contacted squaretrade again , and again i had to ship my laptop .
neutral	so i sent it back .
neutral	00 days_later i received an_email_stating that the issue was a software issue and software issues were not covered_under the warranty .
neutral	they advised me to reinstall my operating_system .
neutral	when i finally got my laptop back , i couldn_'_t even turn it on .
neutral	i called yet again .
neutral	they stated it was a software issue .
neutral	i said no , i actually had it diagnosed , and it needed a new hard_drive .
neutral	they then told me at this point , i would need to take it someplace local , pay for the bill out of pocket , then get reimbursed .
neutral	i said , " absolutely not , i want a refund of the purchase price of my laptop ".
neutral	square_trade states that if they cannot fix your item , they will reimburse you the purchase price .
neutral	they said they would have to have a manager call me back .
neutral	i was never called back .
neutral	so i called back and said i needed to speak to a manager because i was either going to get a refund , or i was going to file a report with the better business_bureau .
neutral	after 00_minutes of being on hold , i was told i would receive a refund .
neutral	i needed to send them my laptop where it would become their property , then they would send me my reimbursement through paypal .
neutral	that is exactly_what happened .
neutral	i made a reservation with one company and then found another company with a cheaper rate for the same size unit .
neutral	however , i do not need the unit until the end of the month .
neutral	so i made another reservation with the cheaper company .
neutral	two_days_later the cheaper company said that he only had one unit and could not hold it that long .
neutral	isn_'_t this the purpose of reservations .
neutral	when i moved out , i had to go to two different places to pay a move out fee and they still_haven_'_t refunded the rent for the month i moved out .
neutral	the guys at the desk were nice , but said they ' d have to talk to their managers to get my rent refunded .
neutral	guess they forgot to talk to their managers .
neutral	to order the product , i was on hold for 00_minutes before finally getting through to an operator - from there it was relatively easy .
neutral	the item was despatched on time but unfortunately when it was delivered 0 days late by the carrier i was yet again on hold for a very long time waiting to speak to an operator at sport and leisure .
neutral	the final call to chase up delivery i had to wait almost 00_minutes in a queue - not good enough i '_m afraid .
neutral	item arrived just in time for christmas and is fine .
neutral	have any of your assistants actually assembled the larger items of furniture ?
neutral	we were told it was easy and i '_m sure it is if you have plenty of muscle handy .
neutral	my husband is 00 i '_m 00 we and my daughter struggled to lift the wardrobe onto the base and line it up with the pegs .
neutral	i '_m sure the experts assemble it in no time and without trapping their fingers underneath ouch !!
neutral	!
neutral	carpet right delivered and fitted the carpet , fitting cost us £_00 .
neutral	why do you not provide a fitting service we can '_t be the only elderly customers who don_'_t have the strength to lift solid_oak_furniture .
neutral	as for not damaging the packing maybe you should also demonstrate how one lifts a large heavy wardrobe out of a cardboard_box without_damaging the box or the packing_material .
neutral	having had my moan , yes you guessed i '_m a grumpy old woman , now it is all assembled together and in place we love it .
neutral	who_knows i might even be tempted to take a look with a view to buying another chest of drawers .
neutral	last night i booked two rooms at the peery hotel in salt_lake city , ut and i was so greatful for how easy it was and how nicely you presented the advertizement for the hotel ..
neutral	it was a great experience and i will use easytobook the next time .
neutral	i like the items on the site because i am shopping for a big man and that can be very difficult .
neutral	my complaint is that the website is difficult to navigate .
neutral	it '_s hard to find the items .
neutral	the " search " bar is not helpful if the item you want is not listed , e . g .
neutral	a jacket .
neutral	also , different manufacturers size differently so sometimes you need a smaller or larger_size than the size usually ordered .
neutral	returns are very expensive .
neutral	the site would be greatly improved if it offered free_shipping and / or free returns ( with a return_label ).
neutral	air service - the flight was delayed going there because they didn_'_t check the luggage door so we had to go back .
neutral	my seat did not recline at all .
neutral	that was uncomfortable .
neutral	coming_back we were delayed almost 0 hours .
neutral	no one was at the desk to ask questions_regarding the delay .
neutral	when she did arrive , she was a bit rude .
neutral	the hotel had damp rugs in the room which made it smell musty .
neutral	no extra pillows available until the last night ?
neutral	the smoke detector starting chirping at 0 : 00 in the morning the second night .
neutral	after an_hour , we took it off the wall per the front_desk because he couldn_'_t leave his post .
neutral	the breakfast spread was decent .
neutral	we were not able to enjoy the amenities because we had another engagements .
neutral	but the hotel seemed to offer a lot of things i contacted travelocity 0 times via_email because i had a voucher to use .
neutral	i never got the $_00 credit .
neutral	i asked for it to be applied to the credit_card ... still no response .
neutral	de nombreux modèles fashion abordables , service et_livraison_rapide , sav client aimable .
neutral	a conseiller à_mes amies !
neutral	i had originally_booked a flight to hawaii with 0 stops each way .
neutral	american cancelled the first flight which made me go to 0 stops .
neutral	i paid for 0 , yet did i get any $$ back ?
neutral	no .
neutral	did they care that i was traveling with an 00 year_old_mother ?
neutral	no .
neutral	they said they could not put us on any other flights but american .
neutral	really ?
neutral	you couldn_'_t change it to " work with all your carriers to ensure my satisfaction ?"
neutral	um ....... i '_ll probably go elsewhere next time .
neutral	i think you should be able to use your discount on top of your reward_points .
neutral	top part of light was squashed down , side panels were fallen_off and a light_bulb had smashed so i got glass in my hand !
neutral	otherwise once i had straightened if out and fixed if back up it worked okay and looks quite good .
neutral	i chose lensfactory to replace my eyeglass lenses because of their pricing .
neutral	they charge 00_% less_than getting my photochromic lenses replaced locally , so i went for it .
neutral	my eyeglasses took 0 days longer to complete than quoted on the website .
neutral	when they arrived , the left lens is distorted where it joins the frame .
neutral	it does not affect my vision so i did not file a claim with lensfactory , but i am giving the 0_star_rating because of the imperfection .
neutral	this is an obvious imperfection that i would not have accepted from a local provider , but i guess i got what i paid for ... cheap photochromic lenses that are less_than perfect but good enough that i am still wearing them .
neutral	the equipment was delivered quite slowly .
neutral	the box was damaged and split_open .
neutral	equipment was missing .
neutral	equipment that was there was of good quality .
neutral	informed tennis_nuts within 0 days subsitute equipment was sent .
neutral	chap was very helpfull , but as english was not his first language this delayed everything and so took much longer to find suitable flights & book them .
neutral	this seems a totally false economy & could even frustrate customers to the point of hanging up & trying online again later i was very close to ending the call .
neutral	please rethink this policy .
neutral	i ordered a start up kit on june_00th and as of july 00 i still have no products .
neutral	order number 000000000 .
neutral	customer_service has_been hit and miss .
neutral	some are helpful and some are very unhelpful and rude .
neutral	i bought the led harness for my dog and it worked great however , the led_lights came out of it and got lost during a walk - it was in the daytime so they were not lit and now we cannot find them ... now it is just a harness - maybe they should stitch the opening a little more so that the lights don_'_t come out so easily - other than that , it arrived to me very quickly so that part of it was good
neutral	i ordered a deep dish pizza from them along with the new jalapeno / cheese bread .
neutral	well , the deep dish seemed more like a hand tossed pizza and wasn_'_t all that great !
neutral	the jalapeno bread was good but wish their pizza was a little better !
neutral	this was my first and possible last time i order ... the company isn_'_t bad , but i was un - happy with a few things ... it took_forever for the package to ship out , i got the item today and everything but one i was able to keep .
neutral	i am a bbw girl and in 00_% of all clothing makers i am a true 0x women as far as tops go because i have a big chest .
neutral	i orders 0 of your 0x tops and only one was actually able to fit my chest size .
neutral	the clothing description should have stated that the fit on those are smaller then usual .
neutral	it could still pass for a 0x but it woud be tight on a women who wares a 0x ... it would be best for a person_who wares a 0x .
neutral	so in other words ... the clothing runs on a small sized of the stated size .
neutral	now , i have to ship everything , but one item back :( and the big diappointment is not only do i not get a refund for the shipping i paid to get he item , but i have to pay and not be refunded the shipping i have to pay to send the items back .
neutral	not happy about it .
neutral	we enjoyed the river_cruise included in the bus_tour , however the bus_tour itself was not well_organised at all .
neutral	we waited at the bus_stop by westminster bridge for about half an_hour before a bus finally turned_up that was heading west .
neutral	the crowd of people waiting there was so big that not everybody got a seat and the situation got worse as the journey carried on , people were complaining of overcrowding in the downstairs area and as it was such a hot day it was blisteringly hot in that section too .
neutral	when we got to park lane we were suddenly told that the tour was finishing there and i think that just because of the sheer amount of people complaining on the bus they had to finish driving the whole route .
neutral	not a great experience , probably_won_'_t do it again .
neutral	i ordered some items , received them last friday and 0 of the 0 were defective .
neutral	i wrote a nasty gram complaint and immediately received a response .
neutral	e_- mail stated gladly sending replacements .
neutral	i '_ll upgrade to 0_stars if received in a timely_fashion and these are not defective .
neutral	for first time purchase however , not impressed receiving non functional items that had the potential to harm my fur_babies .
neutral	willing to give another chance if this is fixed .
neutral	would have been happier if i could have had easy access to delivery times which would have reassured me that my good would be delivered in time for christmas .
neutral	worth trying
neutral	i have a delongi coffee machine and the capsules keep slipping through , i have to get them just in the right spot then push down the handle , unlike nespresso ones that just slot in .
neutral	the coffee however is comparable to nespresso .
neutral	price competitive shame about delivery driver who said " he hadnt got time to piss about " when delivering my garden furniture and left it wedged in my gateway promptly got back in his lorry and did indeed " piss off "!
neutral	nice service not !
neutral	i had to try and unwrap the large bundle and get it off the pallet on my own whlst it was stuck in my gateway .
neutral	on the whole i have had all the cashback i expected but a couple of times i have lost out .
neutral	most recently £_00 from waitrose .
neutral	promised on first online shop , but after six_months was told i went through another agent to site .
neutral	i didn_'_t .
neutral	so lost my cashback .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	i feel let_down and now wonder which cashback i '_ll lose next .
neutral	i booked a room for a colleague , donna liu .
neutral	the booking agent did not ask whether i was a marriott member , so i did not receive any credits for this booking .
neutral	this should be asked each time .
neutral	the booking agent was fairly slow , and it took a while for him to understand that i was booking this room for someone_else vs . myself .
neutral	it was hard to understand and hear the booking agent , he may not have been talking clearly , plus there was alot of background_noise ( other agents ).
neutral	it took about 0_weeks to get in , broke the first day .
neutral	i am keeping it on for now without the main charm .
neutral	i have no problem with the anything but your packaging is horrible .
neutral	the boxes you pack products in are way to flimsy .
neutral	this is the second i have received a shipment .
neutral	the first time the boxes were half opened and falling_apart .
neutral	this second time , as before the boxes were falling_apart and there was a gash in one of the litter_boxes and litter was flowing all over the inside of the packaging box .
neutral	if you are going to ship , use boxes that are sturdy .
neutral	if this continues i will rethink my business with you .
neutral	part came in great condition
neutral	hey if you are in amsterdam and would you like to have a nice and friendly stay in a hostel with direct park view and really kind and sweetheart management team
neutral	i will say
neutral	hostel sarphati could be cool for you .
neutral	i ordered before 00 . 00am for delivery next_day as_advertised .
neutral	waited in all day no delivery .
neutral	emailed next_day and was told it was on the van for delivery that day , but couldn_'_t give any indication what time of day .
neutral	we ordered a raspberry pi board which arrived quickly (!).
neutral	the price was the best we found , and it arrived in good shape ( we think so_far ), but i '_m a bit surprised that it did .
neutral	it arrived in a padded_envelope ( the kind with a layer of small bubbles ).
neutral	one of the pins was poking through the anti static wrapper , but it seems ok .
neutral	it was marginally ok .
neutral	the anti static wrapper wasn_'_t sealed and had no sticker !
neutral	i also thought it would arrive in a box with lots of padding .
neutral	well , let '_s say i always hope that online companies will pack fragile things sensibly , but they very seldom do .
neutral	about 00_% don_'_t .
neutral	i was pretty worried when i saw the awful packing job especially because it was a present for our son and we were presenting it the very next_day !
neutral	i thought there was no way it was going to be alright after all that .
neutral	so please take heed .
neutral	maybe there '_s a company out there that knows or cares how to pack things for shipping but i haven_'_t found one yet .
neutral	a small one person company or two i '_ve come_across knew how to .
neutral	thank_you for the opportunity to give my ( our ) input .
neutral	thanks for your quick answer !
neutral	i have found that the bonline team said what i wanted to hear yet did not deliver .
neutral	the process of setting_up my new website with them was not as easy as i thought and there were lots of mistakes made .
neutral	it took 0 days for the website to function fully and since then i have been happy with my website .
neutral	now that the hard work has_been done , i feel pleased with my website and believe that the bonline team will_continue to assist in making improvements .
neutral	i ordered 0 gift_cards on dec . 00th and they were not sent out until dec . 00th .
neutral	i have been a long time customer so there was no reason for it to take 0 days to process .
neutral	i may not use them again if i need a gift to take less time
neutral	just find the charges on paypal a little_steep - for this reason i avoid using it unless i have to .
neutral	three_times in one day we waited over 00_minutes for one of your buses .
neutral	in two instances , 0 green buses came by before one of yours showed_up .
neutral	your drivers were friendly and polite , but your buses don_'_t come round as regularly as you advertise .
neutral	my tuxedo cat has gained too much weight , and he is big .
neutral	i have tried other dry_cat_foods that are for the large cat .
neutral	the first one was so long ago , i think it worked but i honestly don_'_t remember .
neutral	the current brand i just purchased was science_diet & it might work ; will have to wait several weeks to see if there is some results .
neutral	one thing that does bother me is that in the ad for the science_diet cat_food , i don_'_t recall seeing anything regarding the ingredients .
neutral	what it does have or doesn_'_t have .
neutral	i should have caught it , but i didn_'_t .
neutral	the ingredient_list includes in the first five ~ is corn & wheat .
neutral	i didn_'_t read past that , i was a bit shocked , & i was mad at myself & at the online pet_supply company .
neutral	it seems that someone should have put in an ad or comment .
neutral	the cat_food bag has already been opened & the weight of it to ship back would be too much .
neutral	not sure if i will buy this brand or from this online pet_food supply again .
neutral	one last comment , i am glad that the cat_food was shipped to my door .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	i ordered the filters on line .
neutral	however when i finished the transaction , i realized that i had omitted to take_advantage of the 0 %_discount for orders over $_000 . 00 .
neutral	i emailed customer_service immediately , but it took almost 0 days to let_me know that they had credited my account with the 0 %.
neutral	i checked my credit_card for 0 more days , and the money had not been credited .
neutral	i emailed again and asked how the money was going to be returned to me .
neutral	i have since been credited the money , but no one got back to me answering my e_mail .
neutral	it was not a lot of money , but if you are that way over a little , how can i trust you with any more orders . the person the person that emailed me and i emailed was wendy woodard . hope this helps .
neutral	the major problem which i faced was with my credit cart .
neutral	wimdu says that supports american_express , but is not true .
neutral	the trancaction was unsuccessful but the bank constantly assured_me that my card was fine .
neutral	wimbu didn_'_t have a solution ( after a very long conversation , many many emails , phone_calls , and i don_'_t know how many different people ) and finaly asked me to contact american_express and ask for a special licence in order to complete my booking !!
neutral	at the end i made the booking via_paypal which wasn_'_t really my first choice ...
neutral	during this unpleasant situation , i never had the chance to use my promotional_code .
neutral	this kind of coupon is for one use only and expires right after , regardless if the transaction is succesful or not .
neutral	the system needs a lot of improvement in the booking area .
neutral	without the support of my host during this adventure , i was never able to make the booking .
neutral	i have to emphasise that the hosts who i made a deal with them until now are excellent and the houses were exactly as at the wimdu .
neutral	i ordered a super_cute dress that i wanted to wear for my first time out in vegas .
neutral	took me forever to go through all of the pages to find it .
neutral	the problem i had was when i received my order i noticed that the dress had a huge hole on the underarm part of a sleeve !
neutral	it was easy to fix myself , but was an inconvenience .
neutral	products should be checked before sent out to their customers .
neutral	other than that everything else was okay , i received my product a few_days before the estimated_date , so that was great !
neutral	so all in all , the website is a good place to shop for cute_clothing ... just don_'_t expect it to be in one piece .
neutral	the sight is very user_friendly until you get to the shipping portion .
neutral	there are only two options , send all cards to the same address or send cards to separate addresses .
neutral	it would be more efficient if you could select multiple cards to go to one address and add additional addresses as necessary .
neutral	the person helping_me constantly talked and repeted himself unnecessarily .
neutral	and , since he never quit talking , i had to constantly correct him bc he didn_'_t hear my answers to his questions at one point i almost hung_up to try again later
neutral	do not like charges to credit_card prior to shipping product .
neutral	shipping_charges way too high .
neutral	the flower_basket and ballon ordered for a cousin '_s 00th_birthday were delivered on time .
neutral	the chosen florist did not include the sender '_s name or their own details .
neutral	my very resourceful cousin managed to trace them by phoning several local_florists - who referred her back to iflorist .
neutral	they then phoned me for permission to tell her who had sent the flowers !
neutral	the florist '_s reason for not including their own details was " their labels dont stick to the baskets " - it was pointed_out that they could stick the label on the card .
neutral	i would hesitate to use iflorist again , which is a shame as the flowers are lovely
neutral	had ordered shower_tower and plumber came earlier_than_expected to install .
neutral	when delivery was received , packaging was damaged and since we had to purchase another tower , we wanted to return item .
neutral	several emails back and forth and we still do not have information to return product or refund .
neutral	for the record , the item delivered does appear to be acceptable in quality however there is alot of plastic components .
neutral	petflow has very reasonable prices for the products and on time delivery .
neutral	however , the delivery guy just dropped it over my gate , didn_'_t even_bother to open the gate to place the item
neutral	in front of my door .
neutral	because the box are thrown over the gate , some of the cans i ordered were damaged .
neutral	i don_'_t know if they have their own delivery man , but delivery needs improvement .
neutral	i placed two different orders ( unaware that my boss wanted two items from your company ) within minutes of each other .
neutral	when i asked if shipping could be combined and sent in one box , through customer_service , i did not receive a response until a few_days_later , letting_me know that once orders are placed they can not be changed or maniupulated .
neutral	the email also stated i could return if i wasn_'_t happy with the product .
neutral	i just wanted shipping to be combined into one box , we are happy with the products .
neutral	a long time is the premise !
neutral	always carry the day of departure !
neutral	00 / 00 / 00 i ordered a bag , and about the other day ( 00 . 00 . 0000 ) should get shoes !
neutral	i waited for six_months at_least some things !
neutral	pleased one they keep in touch !
neutral	always responded to the letters . i hope they fix .
neutral	no_problems with the company but the item looked larger in the photo - doesn_'_t look like it would hold much money for a money clip .
neutral	part of why petflow is great in theory is its ability to send heavy , bulky pet_food and litter to my door .
neutral	i am willing to pay for the expense of premium pricing as long as the stuff is delivered to my actual door , and not to the mailroom .
neutral	because the point is not having to actually haul this stuff all the way upstairs myself .
neutral	petflow uses fedex , who has_been absolutely awful .
neutral	they refuse to deliver to my door , and petflow '_s packaging has gotten destroyed by fedex several_times , and fedex has turned around and returned the items without anyone letting_me know what happened .
neutral	petflow accepted the return without letting_me know .
neutral	and what i needed was cat_litter , so this absence of a regular shipment means dire consequences for my kitties , who do not like a dirty toilet .
neutral	i think petflow is better in theory than in practice .
neutral	i will probably cancel because i '_m so frustrated with the lack of accountability in getting my stuff to me as_promised .
neutral	i am still_waiting to hear back from someone so that i can place my order .
neutral	was unable to access the " cleaning product " portion of your website .
neutral	thank_you ,

neutral	the service is excellent , we did get next_day delivery , and well_packaged .
neutral	sadly , the brushes are very stiff to get on and off our oral_b electric_toothbrush .... tricky for kids .... perhaps impossible actually .
neutral	the heads do not last along as oral_b , i had to change mine after 0_weeks .... the bristles had gone soft , and splayed , but considering how much_cheaper they are , possibly they will work out cheaper_than the branded replacements .
neutral	give them a try , and see what you think .... just don_'_t buy loads on the first ordere like i have !
neutral	staff were friendly and helpful .
neutral	the room was clean and neat .
neutral	for the price , though , it would have been nice to have had a microwave and refrigerator in the room .
neutral	also , the washcloths were thin and minimal .
neutral	one had a lot of eye makeup left over on it even_though it had been cleaned .
neutral	just wondering_if they need to use a little more soap in laundry .
neutral	i know that i rinse out my makeup washcloth but not everyone does this .
neutral	it was very handy to get to the steindler clinic - it was right in back of the hotel .
neutral	other_companies routinely deliver the same product in 0 days .
neutral	this took nearly a week , & i was without for 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i won_'_t be ordering again , unless it '_s not needed promptly .
neutral	things i did not like :
neutral	0 .
neutral	sim_card was loose , and phone did not work , at first .
neutral	0 .
neutral	phone_calls international had echo
neutral	i tried to order a large number of items but kept having problems with the shopping_cart function .
neutral	i was worried my on - line purchase might not go through correctly so i called customer_service about 0pm est . to place the order -- finally hung_up after 00 + minutes on hold and listening to their recording over & over & over .
neutral	prices - 0_stars
neutral	service - 0_star
neutral	if you have less_than favorable credit and need a quick loan they will hook you up .
neutral	the link to the site for your bought goods very rarely works , but most staff are helpful when ringing .
neutral	not quite as good as groupon but getting there .
neutral	had an upright freezer delivered admin was perfect but i explained to the delivery_men that i was now alone having recently lost my husband and did they not unpack it as the previous freezer i had delivered was unpacked for me .
neutral	i really struggled to unpack this freezer by myself being a small lady and a pensioner it was so difficult to lift it off the polystyrene on my own and then have to put it in the position where it had to go , it would only have taken the delivery_men about 0 mins to do the job for me .
neutral	incredible service , delivered next_day by the same courier as the bed_frame which was bought from a different manufacturer - could be coincidence but i like to see a reduced carbon foot print .
neutral	the bed is well made but was described as firm , in fact it is more soft than medium .
neutral	this makes purchasing on line impossible as all bed manufacturers seems to name their own products differently and so if they don_'_t conform to the same criteria for firm medium and soft i don_'_t know how you can reliably buy from this manufacturer without first testing the beds .
neutral	they were what i was looking for but i didn_'_t realize i could buy a kit to make them myself .
neutral	i did purchase the rest of my wedding stickers at [_link ] for a fraction of the cost .
neutral	the room was clean .
neutral	the staff was courteous .
neutral	i would have liked a frig and microwave so we could have meals in the room .
neutral	i would stay there again .
neutral	the location is close to the major roads .
neutral	i would stay there again .
neutral	the breakfast was good and they had coffee and cookies during the day .
neutral	quality of business cards good , method of setting_up excellent .
neutral	sadly delivery time not met and so everything fell_apart re the good service up to that point .
neutral	response to delivery issue was prompt and good .
neutral	for the price of inner_circle i ' d like to see a better variety of items every_month to try .
neutral	i '_m sort of disappointed because there are so many natural makeup products out there and it seems like inner_circle is focused on room sprays and body lotions .
neutral	i '_m giving it another month and then i '_m calling it quits .
neutral	the wait for the shuttle was longer_than other rental_car companies and with two tired kids in tow , not a pleasant_experience .
neutral	the added fee for renting a carseat was also a surprise .
neutral	i added it to my reservation so i thought it was included .
neutral	i might have to call the company to clear this up .
neutral	i have paid_extra money when i booked my flight throughout you company .
neutral	there was administration_fee and also i paid_extra in terms of luggage .
neutral	i paid €_00 per luggage whilst with the direct flight company it was €_00 .
neutral	we started out with petflow almost two years_ago and love the delivery service .
neutral	we live in a rural_area and when we run low on dog_food it can be a real_pain to go all the way into town !!!
neutral	my only_complaint has_been with the availability of my dog_food recently .
neutral	i did cancel my subscription for a few_months and began purchasing from amazon .
neutral	they price went up last month , so i decided to give petflow a try once again .
neutral	i set my ship date for may 0nd .
neutral	here it is may_0th and i still do not have tracking_information on my account page .
neutral	i called yesterday and was told it would be shipping that afternoon and i should see an updated delivery estimate .
neutral	it has not happened so i will need to drive to petco today to get dog_food ….
neutral	i recently bought some whiskey from the whiskey_exchange and was very happy with the price and selection .
neutral	i proceeded to buy the whiskey which was a birthday_gift for my uncle .
neutral	i paid the p_& p which was for parcel_force and the estimated delivery time was 0 - 0days .
neutral	i ordered it on the monday and waited .
neutral	i then went online to track the parcel to see that it had been taken to the wrong depot , got lost somewhere between parcel_force and royal_mail .
neutral	i eventually got it by the skin of my teeth in time .
neutral	good company bad courier .
neutral	i am happy i was able to get a car due to bad credit .
neutral	they are extremely overpriced and are extremely pushy and they couldn_'_t take that i wasn_'_t ready to purchase that day .
neutral	i wanted to look around .
neutral	it was an alright experience .
neutral	the building was cold as it is in a warehouse .
neutral	thats to be expected .
neutral	i felt as if the guys in my local_store were a little sexist to be honest .
neutral	they looked at me like i was stupid when i asked a question , then my husband asked the same thing and they were like oh sir , this is how this works .
neutral	plus when i called in to ask how big the couch was , they told me it was new unopened in a box .
neutral	that was not the case .
neutral	it was no way shape or form in a box , which made transportation for it a little harder /
neutral	same as above
neutral	my requested delivery was nearly a week late tried tracking all it said on line was that it was accepted what on earth that is supposed to mean ive no_idea !!!!
neutral	so was not very impressed i requested a set day as a thankyou so you expect it to arrive on that day !!!
neutral	sent couple of e . mails with no response finally managed to get thru on the telephone at monday_lunchtime then had to go on live_chat monday_evening as i didnt have a response when i had arrived home from work that evening !!
neutral	finally the flowers but when the flowers finally arrived they were lovely & fresh so just aswell !!!
neutral	: 0 (
neutral	my vet turned me on to petflow .
neutral	i was upset as i ' d just moved from iowa to washington and couldn_'_t find someone of the holistic and organic_foods my 0 dogs were used to eating ( some have allergies ).
neutral	she was right about the great selection and excellent prices on most of the larger items .
neutral	i still turn to amazon for a few things , but i '_ve recommended petflow to others .
neutral	the only_thing i was upset about was the shipping once it left the facility ( and petflow has no real control over that ).
neutral	it was timely shipped and i was super happy about that .
neutral	then it took over 0_weeks to get to my home when i ' d been expecting it in a matter of days .
neutral	petflow was very willing to facilitate communication between me and fedex ; however , it does make me question whether or not i want a repeat experience based on who the transporter is .
neutral	:(
neutral	this was my first occasion of ordering lenses online -
neutral	shame my lenses didnt arrive originally - but when i advised customer_services - they resent them recorded delivery .
neutral	so i think i might return to lenstore - but not sure yet .
neutral	i purchased a bag online .
neutral	i was really excited so get it but they sent it to the wrong house .
neutral	then when i got it i discovered it was the wrong bag .
neutral	i took the bag and my invoice to a superdry shop in the fort who told me i couldn_'_t return it there .
neutral	it would need to be the store in glasgow town centre .
neutral	i then took it to that store to be told i don_'_t have the correct details on the invoice .
neutral	apparently it was my fault i didn_'_t have the price of the item on the invoice .
neutral	i said i would show them my bank_statement if it meant that much even_though i could tell them to the penny how much i paid for it .
neutral	eventually after managers consent they swapped my bag for the correct one .
neutral	i purchased online to save me all the hassle of going the hour round_trip into town but in the end it would have been easier if i just went in myself .
neutral	what a waste !
neutral	... nice bag though .
neutral	not sure if it was worth the hassle !
neutral	the jacked it great , fits really well and is so warm !
neutral	originally ordered an xs however was a bit small so returned it special next_day delivery costing me £_00 and it took over 0_weeks to receive the new gillet , certainly made me think_twice about ordering from superdry online in the future
neutral	beautiful website , clean and easy to navigate .
neutral	great variety of products at reasonable prices .
neutral	the shipment process has taken over a week and we are still_waiting for it , probably because the product shipped from new_jersey and is trying to make it '_s way to nevada .
neutral	the pony_express could have gotten us our dog_food quicker .
neutral	make_sure you order while you still have plenty of food on hand .
neutral	i rec ' d the 0 pairs of skinny_jeans i ordered .
neutral	had to send them back because they were so small .
neutral	i phoned and was told by the customer_service rep that if you wear a size 0 , you must order a size 00 .
neutral	this was not mentioned on the web_site that i could see .
neutral	i had to return the jeans for credit to my account .
neutral	they were the cutest jeans i '_ve ever_seen and there was not a size 00 for any of the 0 that i had originally chosen .
neutral	please watch for them as i mailed them back today .
neutral	the book arrived in a timely_manner ; however , the condition ( although stated as lightly used ) was in much rougher condition than what i feel constitutes this label .
neutral	pages are falling out of the binding and many of the first pages are bent upward and wrinkled .
neutral	overall though , the service was good .
neutral	i love the charm of the footprints , but i wasn_'_t impressed with the bell on the charm or the length of the necklace .
neutral	i ordered one that should have been plenty long , but i couldn_'_t even wear it .
neutral	the order process and the length of time for them to send it was good .
neutral	well as an african american woman_who shops on the site regularly , i feel offended that we support this site as well but there are no black women modeling the clothes .
neutral	i personall am shaped where i wear an extra small or small sometimes medium depending_on the fabric and the women that model on the site are shaped beautifully but their are no ethinically shaped women .
neutral	the clothes should be modeled on women of all shapes of small .
neutral	there are ones with hips and butt , flat stomach and small boobs , or model shaped women that are perfect portion , or busty with flat stomach and big butt , or straight up and down or perhaps just hips and nothing else .
neutral	as a womans site , it shpuld be relatable to all , i feel this would add to your sales , not that you need it , while making everyone feel appreciated .
neutral	this is a site i recoomend often and i believe if i can add that they would definatly be able to find something no_matter_how they are shaped that would be great .
neutral	i have ordered a lot of stuff that i loved nd stuff that doesnt fit like it did the model and i hated .
neutral	if the model were shaped like me and i have a flat stomach a nice size butt and 00a boobs , i would better know how it would look on me and my body .
neutral	well hope this helps thank_you for asking .
neutral	also i did see one black girl and their are lots of extremely beautiful black women , i dont understand_why the one that is barely on there is mediocre looking .
neutral	we have women with tiny bodies , long hair and beautiful faces , im one of them and we come in lots of different shades .
neutral	the choice of cards is extensive so this is a great site for one stop_shopping .
neutral	i '_ve been able to purchase multiple cards for many of my friends and family for many occasions and they have totally enjoyed their experience .
neutral	from a user standpoint , the web_site is very easy to use .
neutral	order arrived and it was somebody_else '_s with my delivery note .
neutral	the mistake was very quickly rectified and the team apologetic . the order was just for worm and flea_treatment so no_harm done however not great for a first order but will use again .
neutral	hello -
neutral	i just received my first resume update .
neutral	also included was a cover_letter .
neutral	i am in a rush to complete this project , but i assumed it would be perfect right off the bat .
neutral	there were a few run - on sentences and a few sentences that didn_'_t properly blend with the entire resume .
neutral	i did send a lot of money with this company , and don_'_t feel that the price i paid was worth what i received in return .
neutral	i did pay for thank_you letters , along with a ' blast ' to a ww list of recruiters .
neutral	that hasn_'_t happened yet , as we are still finalizing everything .
neutral	overall , my resume does look a lot better , maybe i just had unclear expectations for the $ 0k i paid .
neutral	product ( inflatable cushion with pump ) arrived very promptly .
neutral	unfortunately the quality of the pump is so poor i haven_'_t even bothered to inflate the cushion .
neutral	am returning the whole package for a refund .
neutral	i might order again because the service has_been so good , but would choose my product carefully in future
neutral	the buttons looked exactly as i wanted - they were delivered on time - but i specifically requested a clip on back - not a pin - and they were all delivered with a pin backing .
neutral	i am still_waiting on it to arrive .
neutral	i have been without my washer for way too long .
neutral	lol
neutral	i recently rented a car in europe through autoeurope .
neutral	while the required extra_charges that amounted to $_00 were not included in the price quoted , they were listed in small_print elsewhere on the voucher .
neutral	checking other auto rental sights the same $_00 was nowhere to be found - until i called and quizzed an agent who confessed the charges would be added to the quoted price - added at the end of the rental when it was too late to change anything .
neutral	since these charges are required , they should be included up front in the quoted price for the rental !
neutral	we have seven pets and having their food delivered is convenient overall .
neutral	we have had a few missed deliveries because an item was back - ordered , but there was no proactive e_- mail notification .
neutral	i didn_'_t realize the order had been placed on hold until i realized we didn_'_t receive our delivery that week and logged_into the system to check the status .
neutral	the order interface is clumsy , the search_feature doesn_'_t always produce the correct results and it is nearly unusable from a mobile_device .
neutral	i think the prices are too high - but the products are good and delivery was fast as promise
neutral	i played extra to ship in 0 - 0 days and it took over a week .
neutral	i also had to call and check on it and it still hadn_'_t shipped .
neutral	i appears that you also charged more for 0 . day air .
neutral	;
neutral	there were plenty of buses and was a decent tour .
neutral	if you get on the recorded_tour commentary at any point ( rather_than the live tour ) beware some drivers who dont press play on the tape and skip past bits ... one driver on our tour didnt play any commentary for a good 00_mins which really turns it into an expensive bus_ride .
neutral	we used travelocity '_s top secret deal .
neutral	it was supposed to be a 0 . 0_star_rated hotel .
neutral	the travelocity representative was very helpful in setting_up my request as we we booking 0 rooms for 0 nights and a 0rd room for just one night .
neutral	the hotel we ended_up with was not a 0 . 0_star_hotel on the beach .
neutral	it was right off the freeway .
neutral	the " beach " was a small pond with garabage floating everywhere .
neutral	the pool was so filthy it was black and even_though the hotel was full i never saw a single person even go near the pool .
neutral	the hot_tub was broken .
neutral	rooms were large but cobwebs in most corners , one of the chairs were broken , you could see every repair they made .
neutral	we were supposed to get 00 - 00_% but when i asked about their rates we paid the same for 0 daof the rooms and more for the 0rd room .... no savings there .
neutral	was confused at first now i got my key and i think it is stupid how you have to send a photo of your id card
neutral	besides the awesome customer_service that was provided at this location , the area given to maneuver any sort of moving vehicle is so limited that you can see giant holes and areas where trucks have ran_into the side .
neutral	i witnessed two different 00 ' commercial trucks run_into the front office in the two hours i was moving my stuff in .
neutral	other than that , the $ 0 first month concession i received was topped with tons of fees , ranging_from insurance to lock to move - in .
neutral	ridiculous .
neutral	for 00 days i wound_up paying nearly $_00 .
neutral	oredered lenses and arrived within a couple of days however , the box had no plastic cover over it - the box had clearly been ripped_open , but am pleased to say the contents were all there .
neutral	safer packaging please as the contents were worth £_000 - not cheap !
neutral	!
neutral	have had great trouble printing off the voucher , unable to view the qr code !
neutral	will mean hassle on the day .
neutral	booked this option to make the travel hassle_free !!
neutral	!
neutral	they were delivered propmptly .
neutral	the prevail pull - ups fit well .
neutral	we feel that the product is not worth the money we paid , the wood is real soft when we put it together two of the screws were to long , the track that the doors roll on i would have thought that is would be steel instead of plastic .
neutral	i will say that when we had the problem with the damage they were quick to replace the damaged panel
neutral	i felt messed about over delivery dates with butler_fuels so not a happy customer .
neutral	well , whether it is thanks to my previous_review on trustpilot or to my patience , but , after several_months of hassle , i have finally received my refund from smartbuyglasses .
neutral	i admit that it is possible that my experience was just a particularly unlucky one .
neutral	the company did return my money , and gave_me a a small discount for my next purchase ... would i recommend this company to a friend ?
neutral	maybe , not sure .
neutral	i was able to purchase 0 pairs of pants for less_than $_00 , however there was little to no customer_service .
neutral	i was not approached once in regard to finding things , but overall the deal i got over rode the service i got .
neutral	got 0 unit with a chip in it was told to bring it back to check its a manufacturing damage ... not sure how you would tell .
neutral	rang up to check its in stock before i drive to warrington and its not .
neutral	oh and my bathroom fitters are here this weekend and can '_t finish it without the unit top .
neutral	so not very happy right now
neutral	we like the fish .
neutral	but too expensive , especially with the extra_charge for hawaiians .
neutral	we are thinking of buying it from whole foods when they are on sale .
neutral	because i thought they had ignored the extra we had paid for the probiotics to be cold - shipped .
neutral	when i called , i was reassured that it had actually been express shipped , and the shipment arrived in super quick time .
neutral	they need to be clearer on the invoice to avoid misunderstandings , but otherwise it was good service .
neutral	i bought this for my daughter '_s birthday .
neutral	it looked just the right thing on line as she does prefer leather jewellery but i was disappointed with the tag that is attached .
neutral	it was tarnished .
neutral	therefore makes it look worth a lot less_than i paid for it !
neutral	at £_00 it is expensive .
neutral	it is a nice slim leather strap ( which i wanted ) and as i am going to take off the tag and use my own charm , i decided to keep it .
neutral	i must_say the service and delivery was excellent , i could not quite believe_how quickly it came in first_class post .
neutral	just a shame i was disappointed with the gold .
neutral	vi boede i tre nætter på hotellet , og_det_var udemærket .
neutral	rent og pænt .
neutral	fin morgenmad .
neutral	der_var til gengæld rigtig koldt og lidt larm fra gaden , og_så_var værelset rigtig lille på_trods af at det_var et superior værelse .
neutral	jeg_synes , prisen var høj i forhold til , hvad vi fik og i forhold til , hvor det lå .
neutral	man kunne rent faktisk ikke komme til noget som_helst uden at skulle med metro eller bus .
neutral	det lå til gengæld tæt på .
neutral	en_anden gang vil jeg vælge noget tættere på centrum til_en lavere pris .
neutral	i love the glasses i got but the experience was a bit rocky with the time it took to get the glasses .
neutral	i expected one thing but took almost a month to get my glasses .
neutral	tracking the shipment was not the best either .
neutral	overall im happy with the product but they need to vamp up the experience with the company .
neutral	very poor customer_service .
neutral	the man that came to fit my tyres was lovely .
neutral	he fitted 0 nee tyres and changed my spare brand_new tyre onto the rim of my back tyre .
neutral	i couldnt fault him except ... today i have a complete flat on the wheel that had the spare put onto it .
neutral	i took it back to kwikfit who have advised there is nothing they can do as it is a problem with the alloy wheel .
neutral	apparently the old tyre on there was so old that as he removed it some of the ?
neutral	paont has removed resulting in the seal no_longer being there thus i need my alloy wheel reconditioned .
neutral	probably one of those things but still irritating , no warning that this could happen following fitting .
neutral	so after over 000 pound soent another £_00 to get alloy refurbished .
neutral	brilliant .
neutral	beställde utkörning till min mor .
neutral	får besked att_det inte går utan hon får hämta själv .
neutral	hon får samtal dagen före , inte på morsdag .
neutral	expedit säger att utkörning inte är beställd !!!
neutral	urdåligt .
neutral	den andra modern fick dock som hon skulle .
neutral	but my last order arrived with the package inside broken open and kitty_litter spilling on the floor !
neutral	not impressed as told bed_frame and mattress would come on the same day .
neutral	bed_frame came a day late and then when opened the hardware set ( all the washers , screws , nuts and bolts missing .
neutral	rang and was told would be sent out today but they did not arrive , so still_waiting .
neutral	if not here in a couple of days will be returning order .
neutral	i chose a beautiful all white bouquet to be delivered for a friend '_s birthday .
neutral	there was a very good reason i chose the all white bouquet .
neutral	i received an_email the day before they were due to be delivered saying that the florist didn_'_t have the white_roses so they would substitute for another color .
neutral	i did appreciate that they still made a flower delivery on the day i ordered but i was really disappointed that they didn_'_t have what they advertised .
neutral	my friend sent me a photo of the bouquet and again i was disappointed as it looked very lack lustre and only had 0 roses .
neutral	it was called the " tender purity " bouquet - premium .
neutral	there was nothing premium about this bouquet .
neutral	i don_'_t think i will use this florist again .
neutral	hi there , i wanted to give a review ofself storage . com which led me to a facility in morgan hill .
neutral	although the website was thorough in its details for each storage result , the overall number of results was extremely low .. about 0 for a major city like gilroy ca .
neutral	i did appreciate that the site was very user_friendly however .
neutral	i would be happy to provide feedback , but i have three automatic monthly shipments of dog_treats delivered to my house , and don_'_t know for which one i am providing feedback .
neutral	it would be more efficient and professional if trustpilot individualized these requests to spell out the order in question .
neutral	as for the website and finding the part at the right price i like parts_geek but as far as communicating with them i do not like i can only email them on a form they have chosen .
neutral	i would like to have a phne number in order to call and talk to them .
neutral	i ordered the wrong part number and went to get the rma info .
neutral	i foind that with no problem but then ups delivers a box that is damaged .
neutral	ups is called and given the info within the 00 hour_period of receipt of item .
neutral	i am told by upds to keep the package for at_least 0 days in case they need to send someone out to take a look at the package and they will contact me . turns_out no one calls me so i call ups and find that they state they will contact parts_geek and not me . ok so now i have the rma_# and will send back the package .
neutral	purchasing was a smooth_transition ... tracking_info provided and shipped via_usps .
neutral	pkg .
neutral	not at doorstep as indicated .
neutral	trying to resolve issue .
neutral	det_var ok antal omend ikke mange , så få gode bud jeg_fik på_min regnskabsopgave .
neutral	men agera har samlet sendt 00 opfølgningsmails , og_det_er dødirriterende .
neutral	jeg_har prøvet at skrive tilbage men må nu sætte agera som spam i min mail , da der ikek svares på_min henvendelse .
neutral	ærgerligt at det_er_det indtryk jeg sidder tilbage med , når det som_det handlede om egentligt gik fint .
neutral	great travel site .
neutral	i wish we could pick the departure and return flight separately , for timings .
neutral	the ipad app is worthless , so i had to pull out my laptop for booking and browsing .
neutral	there are good points and bad points for me .
neutral	the bad points are that although it stopped sweating of the underarms quite well it didn_'_t work at all the hands or feet which left me quite disappointed .
neutral	however , i '_m in love with the fact that it is odourless !
neutral	unlike every prescription treatment i have tried you can use it without_having to worry_about the strong medicinal smell it can leave on clothes and on your skin .
neutral	also with prescription - strength treatments they have left the skin on my hands red , sore and flaky .
neutral	perspi - guard was actually quite moisturising and i was very surprised to still have soft skin in the morning .
neutral	so although it didn_'_t work on the areas i wanted it to , i will_continue to use for my underarms , and as an ' in - between ' treatment alongside my prescription so that my hands don_'_t get as sore and dry .
neutral	overall i '_m still impressed this worked as well as it did :_d x
neutral	they provide a variety of services that help with cpc and cse and good customer_service .
neutral	however , i have had some problems with the usability of their services and data collection .
neutral	i can '_t trust the numbers they give me for clicks on cses and i cannot get the ids to be profitable .
neutral	they were big when i was in high_school ( 0 years_ago ) but have really fallen behind .
neutral	they seem to try to do what facebook does , but not as well .
neutral	i do still have my myspace though , just because there are videos on it that i don_'_t have anywhere_else .
neutral	we started off working with one individual who was very knowledgable , and had excellent communication_skills .
neutral	unfortunately he left the company and was replaced by someone_who was pleasant enough but a bit contrary and snarky .
neutral	he also clearly did not like the fellow we were first working with .
neutral	however , once the process moved along he did respond quickly and we sold the car .
neutral	overall i would recommend your company with the caveat not to expect a high degree of professionalism .
neutral	pretty good deals but i thought they were refundable with hotel in case of cancellation , but we are mislead & are refundable / cancellation with only travelocity
neutral	ordered item online with confirmation_email_saying items will be here within 0 - 0 days .
neutral	waited 0 days and got email_saying dispatched and will be with me within 0 days .
neutral	unacceptable time between ordering and dispatching .
neutral	arrived 0 working days after ordering .
neutral	received compensation .
neutral	items are perfect and might consider_using lenson in future .
neutral	good , quick delivery but really disappointed that these magnets don_'_t work on my cathedral products magnetic board .
neutral	can '_t be bothered to send them back .
neutral	i chose this firm as it seemed to specialise in ' powerful ' magnets .
neutral	ontrac is the worse carrier you could use !!!!
neutral	why not give the customer a choice ????
neutral	i want my fedx back !
neutral	i put a hold on a unit and despite that i got a confirmation that it will be held for me for 00 days it was sold to someone_else the same day .
neutral	so the hold is pretty_much useless , unless you pay right_away the unit can go just like that .
neutral	i think the system is as good as the managers are at the storage_facilities , they decide who they rent the unit to , not this system .
neutral	i logged on to my account and clicked on new activity detected .
neutral	all i saw was a blank white page .
neutral	i need to dnow what it said .
neutral	susan m . holloway
neutral	site too hard to use .
neutral	the website was easy to use , had lots of choices and was easy to complete purchase .
neutral	updates by email were also useful , but the mail however was incredibly slow ( about 00 days !
neutral	not sure why since almost nothing takes that long anymore .
neutral	i was very pleased at the start , thought being_able to play without discs was so much_better .
neutral	then i had to send identification because of fraud ( fair enough ), past that , got codes .... my last one didnt work !
neutral	contacted support , was very helpful in telling_me what they were going to do to fix my problem .
neutral	since then i '_ve had lack of communication !
neutral	emails_telling_me to do something but not how to do it !
neutral	i was then for some_reason sent my old code !
neutral	i dont understand how thats going to fix my problem .... time will tell as the sims0 . com site is down for maintenance at the minute .
neutral	i was instructed to " enter date night key in the sims 0 game loader / sims0 . com website " now that email was in capital letters which normally indicate shouting ( first email was not ) and the one containing my code after i replied expressing my unhappiness as a customer and asking how i get to this point on the website was ignored completely and a repeat of the previous email just with the code added .
neutral	adequate ... but needed four additional screws for secure fix and to take the " wobble " out of the swing .
neutral	not a task to be undertaken by the inept
neutral	i love travelocity selections , prices , all of it .
neutral	however , customer_service is a nightmare to get a question answered .
neutral	wait time is excessive .
neutral	agent in such a hurry to answer that she didn_'_t even wait for the whole question ~ and then was wrong .
neutral	agents need to speak_english clearly and without an attitude when asked to repeat ~ seriously , customer_service 000 .
neutral	from what i gather , my recent recipient of your flower delivery was happy with the bouquet .
neutral	since i live so_far away , i didn_'_t know when the flowers were delivered so an e_- mail to confirm delivery would be great .
neutral	also a special entry with the person '_s name that sent the flowers would be greatly_appreciated .
neutral	other_websites have that feature .
neutral	thanks
neutral	xpole is great if it '_s just you using it .
neutral	ordering was easy and i was very pleased with the quick response to my order .
neutral	but , a tape was wrapped around the pump of the oratene which caused the cap to twist open .
neutral	so when i opened the box to see my purchases both items were coated in oratene which had leaked out of the bottle .
neutral	maybe 0 / 00 was lost , not much , but i did have to clean up .
neutral	they are ok but only have special_offers on items i do not buy or need
neutral	it is taking 0_weeks to get my product once shipped .
neutral	it '_s too hard to set a regular schedule when you can '_t rely_on getting it within a certain time period .
neutral	we were very pleased with our new tempur mattress and pillows which were delivered by two really friendly and efficient delivery guys .
neutral	but we were outraged that furniture village feel it is acceptable to charge £_00 delivery charge for just 00_miles down the road !!
neutral	after complaining this charge was withdtrawn !
neutral	!
neutral	in our estimation this is not good business_practice .
neutral	i bought anno 0000 deluxe edition almost a month_ago i got my cd_key real fast everything installed and worked_perfectly .
neutral	however i still cannot find the two game soundtracks , or the 000 - page art book and the tree of technology poster .
neutral	all the extra in game features are there but nothing more .
neutral	i have emailed them about this with no response .
neutral	i give them 0_stars for customer_support and 0_stars for fast delivery .
neutral	i booked stress_free for the first time for my easter break , mainly_because they were so much_cheaper_than my normal meet & greet provider .
neutral	i was on an early flight so requested a 0am collection from the terminal when booking .
neutral	i rang them , as requested 00_mins_before i arrived at the teminal and had to ring again after 00mins waiting .
neutral	the collection driver finally arrive about 00_mins after my request time which_meant i didn_'_t have the leisurely start to my holiday i ' d anticipated .
neutral	service on the return was fine .
neutral	if you want a great price for meet and greet i ' d say stressfree are worth a try , but plan to arrive in plenty of time .
neutral	we had a good experience checking in but upon our return to newark_airport we waited a half_hour out in the cold after calling to be picked_up .
neutral	for that reason only i would think_twice about using their service again .
neutral	i purchased 0 maxi singletdress .. i received a colour i didn_'_t ask for , although happy to keep the wrong_colour im really disapointed the seams didn_'_t stay on the side after first wash before wear . hem on one was pretty bad too .
neutral	the rep was courteous and knowledgeable .
neutral	did not realize i was talking to expedia , however .
neutral	expedia '_s price was higher_than the direct hotel price given .
neutral	within about a six - hour contact time , the price given increased .
neutral	have not had that happen before .
neutral	i prefer to deal directly with the hotel corporation .
neutral	i have mixed feeling regarding paypal .
neutral	i comes sometimes handy .
neutral	but some times i get mail from paypal that my account has_been limited because of some blah_blah stuff .
neutral	printer dont work well it knows it not the right ink that its not epson_ink replacement
neutral	the service was fine and efficient but only after i had to phone to ask where order was .
neutral	the cheque had been cashed 0_weeks before and there was no notw of it on my order which was still noted as unpaid .
neutral	once this has_been clarified the goods were promptly devlived but the payment date was recorded as 00th of december and not 00th_november when cheque was cleared ( sent on 00th_november )
neutral	i have a 0000 cad .
neutral	deville .
neutral	that was the only choice for choosing the part .
neutral	it would be nice to have some measurements to choose from for cabin filters .
neutral	parts #'_s don_'_t work .
neutral	i have not been able to buy a cabin filter for my car since day 0 without paying way more then their worth and then they don_'_t have the right size .
neutral	before they hiked up their prices , they were great .
neutral	we had 0 dvd at a time with unlimited rentals and unlimited streaming for $_00 per_month and we were happy .
neutral	suddenly , it went up to $_00 per_month for this same service .
neutral	we now only have the streaming .
neutral	the streaming is nice and decently_priced at $ 0 per_month unlimited .
neutral	it is very good for kids stuff , t . v .
neutral	shows and documentaries but the movie selection is pretty limited .
neutral	have purchased from dyers before .
neutral	great selection of products ; even those hard to find ones .
neutral	purchased product arrived in a reasonable amount of time .
neutral	my problem with dyers is the high cost of their shipping .
neutral	the shipping for my product was actually more than the product itself , but i wanted the product .
neutral	when i got the products it was shoved in a box and smushed
neutral	i was excited to try a new collection of chocolates from a new company , but delivery was slow , as they make each box to order .
neutral	i ordered when i saw their guarantee , and thought that they must be pretty good to make such a claim , but i don_'_t think that they followed through .
neutral	the chocolates , whilst ok , didn_'_t live up to my expectations after what i read about the company , and i have most definitely tasted better !
neutral	i wrote an_email which i hope you have received by now ..... with pdfs of my prescriptions ......... sometimes connor is spelled with an - er but i have it correct on the scripts .
neutral	if you did not get them call me please .
neutral	i need them and i spent a fairly sizable amount of money to get the prescriptions .
neutral	i am resending my note and attachments .
neutral	joanna
neutral	dear joanna p ,
neutral	your doctor '_s office could not locate a contact_lens prescription on file for ' joanna p connor '.
neutral	would the contact_lens prescription be listed under a different name , or is there a different location that we should contact ?
neutral	thank_you ,

neutral	i have used the service quite a few_times and had been very impressed with price and service etc ..
neutral	however i made 0 trips in july / august and on the first occasion which was 00th_july as requested i phoned when 00_mins from airport the phone rang out repeatedly .
neutral	not acceptable .
neutral	i was running a bit late and due to the time of year i gambled on there being someone from the company there so i could hand the car over .
neutral	so that was stressful .
neutral	on my return i waited 00_mins .
neutral	on my most_recent return on the 00st august it was just over 00_mins this was to travel the 0 miles from where the cars are placed and was 00 . 00 on a weekday night so no traffic on m00 .
neutral	i have thought for the extra few_pounds next time i may book the car in at airport_parking .
neutral	when i was first using this service the wait was 00_mins for car return now 00 / 00_mins seems to be the norm .
neutral	maybe company becoming victims of their own success
neutral	it was clean but not great ,
neutral	while the products i ordered and received are very nice , there are a number of problems with them .
neutral	the notebooks and mousepads i ordered all arrived with white borders appearing around the outer edges .
neutral	when i spoke with customer_service , she informed me how to correct the problem ; however that was not clear on the template provided on the website .
neutral	in addition , while the template for mugs makes it appear that the photo will cover the entire mug , with the exception of the handle , it does not and is actually quite a bit smaller .
neutral	the cr rep informed me that in order to find the actual print measurements you have to look under the " help " tab .
neutral	that information should be front and center on the product design template .
neutral	the spiral binding on the notebooks is cut_off at the top and bottom leaving the wire sticking straight up and down , resulting in a nasty prick when i opened the first one .
neutral	i had to take a pair of pliers and fold the wire back on itself for all of the notebooks i ordered to prevent this from happening to someone_else .
neutral	and finally , the shipping cost for each item is very nearly as much as the item itself , i . e .
neutral	$ 0 . 00 to mail one mouse_pad .
neutral	i went to drive time , so the people there could help me out .
neutral	in obtaining a reasonable priced vehicle that i would like to drive in style , and that fits my needs and satisfaction of getting from point a to b .
neutral	good website , but order took longer to arrive than i expected
neutral	even_tho my parts were the right ones , and arived on time .
neutral	i til needed help w_/ some basic specs .
neutral	all and all i needed to talk to somone .
neutral	you need a helpline with a human , not a computer !
neutral	thankyou
neutral	you can '_t get comfy and is hard .
neutral	i just wanna sit and have it flow and be squishy .
neutral	it '_s great for animals though !
neutral	i have independent insurance cover so i did not need to take out super cover .
neutral	i told the lady on the desk this and she got quite rude and told me that i had to take it out .
neutral	i complained again when i noticed that i had been charged 0 . 00_euros a day , on return of the vehicle and got told they could not refund me the money and that i had to e_- mail firefly es .
neutral	still_waiting to receive it .
neutral	says it was shipped on jan 0 , it '_s now jan 00 and it '_s still in california .... i '_ll update if i ever receive it .
neutral	that is good price for the product i wanted .
neutral	let '_s see how the processing and shipping goes ...
neutral	i absolutely love all the clothes i ordered .
neutral	very cheap prices but decent quality .
neutral	my only issue was how long it toke to be delivered .
neutral	i waited about three_weeks for my order to arrive .
neutral	i would have given a higher rating if it wasn_'_t for that .
neutral	i enjoy learning about my credit on identity_guard , but there are major issues that i find irritating that make me want to try another company .
neutral	there are major issues at times with the website being under service or temporarily unavailable .
neutral	there were issues for months regarding the credit history for the last 00 / 00 months being unavailable .
neutral	only the 00 month option was available .
neutral	also , i find it irritating the way the company handles your credit updates from month to month .
neutral	i purposely set_up my account to update at the first of the month and now , by april , my credit_scores are unavailable until the 0th of the month ?!?
neutral	even when the site itself says you have a credit update available , the link often does not work .
neutral	this was explained to me by a representative at the call_center who told me that since i logged in at 0 : 00_pm on the 0st of march , i need to wait_until 0 : 00_pm on the 0th of april in order to get a credit update .
neutral	it made sense to them , but not me .
neutral	somehow because february was a short month i need to wait_until the 0th for an update .
neutral	also , the representatives at the call_center seem to be reading scripts or texting someone while they are talking to you .
neutral	i never feel_like they have heard my concern or bothered to try to solve issues .
neutral	hi .
neutral	i placed my order on 00th of may and still did not recive it .
neutral	i have contacted you and have been told it should be with me already .
neutral	it was a few_days ago and still nothing .
neutral	with regards
neutral	marta rozumiejko
neutral	i like to order pet needs like food on a monthly_basis .
neutral	it '_s like a no think no forget plan .
neutral	unfortunately the food is more_expensive than my local_petsmart sales which it always seems like my brand is on sale plus i earn $ 0 coupons almost monthly due to the amount i spend there making my food cheaper and my loyalty stronger and leaving the convince of mail order as not an option .
neutral	i really like the socks .
neutral	they are good in color , comfy to wear but one of them developed a small_hole adjacent to the stitching for the size label .
neutral	if there were no label , i would have rated them a 0 .
neutral	received the dog_food i ordered very quickly .... only problem is , i emailed the company with a problem i had with their website and the pay / groupon code ... still have not heard back from them one week_later -- i '_m afraid that once they have my money , they are not interested in helping_me
neutral	improve customer_service .
neutral	i was very skeptical_about booking with skytours .
neutral	there reviews online were very mixed .
neutral	having said that , i purchased my tickets online and went to the airport at said date and received tickets .
neutral	everything went well including appropriate waiting times etc_., however when i boarded one of my connections the security officer pulled me from the lined as he was scanning my ticket to board the plane .
neutral	after asking me a few questions he said that there were problems with my ticket .
neutral	he said that i could still board the plane but that i probably should not book with sky - tours again .
neutral	i had to make several calls to get status of my purchase and delivery .
neutral	on the day of the delivery , i called again to confirm if i was to receive a call before the delivery truck arrival to ensure that i am home when my item is delivered .
neutral	i was told that i will get a call 00 - 00mins before arrival ; no calls .
neutral	the delivery_men however were nice enough to put my items in the garage instead of leaving it on the driveway as i am pregnant and rain was expected that day .
neutral	the items are still in the boxes as i am moving so i decided to wait_until i get to my new house before unpacking .
neutral	i received my order in a reasonable amount of time after i ordered it , but the two 00 packs of canned_food i ordered were at_least 00_% comprised of dented_cans .
neutral	i have a hard time believing that shipping alone caused so many of the cans to be so dented , so i have to assume they started out like that .
neutral	the toys and vitamins i ordered were fine and packaging was intact and unmarred .
neutral	i am still_waiting for a problem to be sorted dispute contacting you twice !
neutral	!
neutral	this website is nice but i don_'_t like the fact that i don_'_t know if an item is in stock until i '_ve actually made the payment .
neutral	it '_s somewhat of a disappointment when you '_ve paired items to wear as a whole and then one item isn_'_t there .
neutral	i '_ve ordered quite a few items on wowcher from clothes to curries .
neutral	the food has_been great quality but i can '_t always say the same for the clothes .
neutral	the price at which the recent wizard of oz tickets was seriously misleading .
neutral	great transfers , but if you live in ireland , be prepared to be stung , by customs and excise
neutral	the website is not friendly for changing items set_up for automatic delivery .
neutral	also , want to cancel a delivery ?
neutral	impossible to do on the website ... a message pips up telling_me i need to call .
neutral	that , combined with how some products can be found cheaper elsewhere make it so i want to cancel .
neutral	however , customer_service for exchanges is excellent , and all my cat '_s favorite foods are at this site in the sizes i like .
neutral	took the full 00 days and it was frustrating as i see many of the other_reviewers complaints .
neutral	my issue now is the iphone i was unlocking ( mine ) was supposed to leave with my son for europe .
neutral	since it took so long he has since left the usa .
neutral	since we all know how bad customer_service is ; i would like to know if i can still unlock my phone with its current att sim .
neutral	i dont have another sim_card from another carrier .
neutral	if anyone can help me ... that would be wonderful .
neutral	anybody have a suggestion ?
neutral	i hate for the money to go down the drain !
neutral	we ordered parts for our car after a car / deer accident that could be repaired at home .
neutral	although the prices are great , we did alot of searching and comparing , i must_say that you get what you pay for .
neutral	parts were indeed shipped quickly , however , parts came in random boxes , no packing lists and not all there .
neutral	the response from partsgeek is that they would look into it , but basically it '_s out of their hands because they are not the shippers , so it seems .
neutral	they must in turn follow_up with the actual company that shipped the specific parts .
neutral	they made it my responsibility to follow_up with them to check on the status of our missing parts .
neutral	i feel that i did my part , i entrusted them with not only my money but choosing them for my large order ( this wasn_'_t just penny pieces ) and am greatly disappointed that not only are getting no where fast on the part we need , but that i have to be the one that cares that i did not receive my items .
neutral	in the meantime , my car sits , waiting to get put back together .
neutral	will not order from this company again , will trust my time and money to a company that i already know and trust .
neutral	easy_comforts is an average website for purchasing hard to find items .
neutral	the reason i give it an average score is because they do not have a " gift " option on checkout .
neutral	the shipping is a little_slow as well .
neutral	sometimes the item is not too good of quality but overall they will try to work with you .
neutral	took_ages for each_stage to be completed .
neutral	payment was very slow .
neutral	the customer_service was extremely_helpful .
neutral	he walked through all the options and suggested cost savings .
neutral	the website was very easy to use and i could visualize the design on the shirt and color options were terrific .
neutral	the color printed were true to my logo .
neutral	i would give 0_stars if the screen print quality was better .
neutral	the shirt showed through the print .
neutral	i arrived in phoenix without a map or gps .
neutral	i needed a paper map and a person_who was proficient in giving directions .
neutral	the person_who checked me out of the budget rental_car area at sky harbor assumed that i knew how to get to my destination .
neutral	please be sure that all of your employees who have contact with customers are able to give excellent directions .
neutral	example , the employee said " take i - 00 east to 00nd street exit .
neutral	then take that all the way down "
neutral	i asked him to tell me the simple turns , example_: turn left at the top of the ramp .
neutral	right on buckeye , you will exit buckeye onto i - 00 in a few blocks , take i - 00 e to 00nd street exit .
neutral	turn right , then stay on the street until you see 0000 s 00nd street
neutral	i find that so many people do not know how to give simple , complete directions .
neutral	they need to use right and left , number of blocks or miles , directions of the compass .
neutral	please retrain and retest your employees on this matter .
neutral	thank_you

neutral	i
neutral	my parents are watercolor artists , and i thought that making stamps of their favorite paintings would be a great gift idea .
neutral	i was pleased that you could choose a color theme to match the images .
neutral	i was not pleased because of the singular format choice : square ( most paintings are rectangular ).
neutral	the shipping time estimate was accurate , about 0 - 0 days , but they failed to mention that it may take a week or more to process your order before shipping .
neutral	in the end i got what i ' d wanted , but i would have been happier with a faster processing time and a rectangular format option .
neutral	i booked one apartment and the host informed me about additional cleaning fee , which was not mentioned in the description of the apartment .
neutral	as there was no possibility for the owner to cancel the fee , i decided to cancel the reservation .
neutral	even_though it was not at all my fault ( no information about the fee was in the description ) housetrip made me pay some_sort of fee for canceling the booking .
neutral	i think this is not acceptable - either you have to watch your hosts so that the information on their websites are valid , or you can '_t expect people to pay for your mistakes .
neutral	the rest went well , but i would hesitate before recomending housetrip to a friend .
neutral	i had trouble with the name used to make the reservation matching with spirit_airlines .
neutral	i was checking into the purchase of baggage before my flight and things just were not matching up .
neutral	took a very long frustrating time until things matched .
neutral	if would be nice to have some toll_free phone numbers to be able to call either at travelocity or the airlines .
neutral	i booked a hotel through olotels months in advance .... being the paranoid person i am , i called the hotel to verify the booking ( the price of the hotel was too good to be true so i thought it was a scam ).
neutral	the hotel hadn_'_t received my booking yet so naturally i panicked and contacted olotels who then reassured me that i am in fact booked at the hotel .
neutral	fast forward to the day of my reservation , as i was waiting to board my plane , i called the hotel again to verify ( i was still skeptical )... to which they again had said there was no booking .
neutral	i immediately called olotels , the agent said they would look into it and call back .
neutral	he was great !
neutral	the agent only had 00_mins_before i got on a plane to sort it out for me and he did .
neutral	he apologized for the error and even provided the hotel confirmation #.
neutral	as much work as that was for myself , i don_'_t mind taking the time to make the calls for my own sanity .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t called the hotel_directly , i would have shown up at the hotel at 00pm without a room .
neutral	i would only recommend this hotel if you are willing to take the same steps as i did ....
neutral	i dont like having to spend $_00 . 00 for a special lock that only works there .
neutral	rip_off !
neutral	$_00 . 00 fee !
neutral	!
neutral	it is much more difficult to make reservations than it used to be .
neutral	it is not helpful to have all the other reservation sites show up .
neutral	i used to be able to see the airline options clearly , but not any more .
neutral	it is easier to go to the airline sites .
neutral	i did start receiving applicants almost right_away however the caliber of the people did not meet the standards for my business .
neutral	i did hire 0 of the applicants and they are in training now .
neutral	i always like boohoo dresses , they ' re so pretty but i always have to get a size or two up from what i buy in shops .
neutral	why so skinny boohoo ?
neutral	?
neutral	other than the shipping taking almost 0_weeks , i loved everything that i purchased !
neutral	and i really loved the prices !
neutral	i ordered 0 items from pmtc about 0_weeks before i actually had to have them in - hand .
neutral	the ordering process was easy and everything seemed to be going along well , but then days passed and there was no news about my shipment .
neutral	i finally emailed the company to check on my order and was given a response to contact a specific person at pmtc .
neutral	when i called , i was told they were busy and had to leave a voicemail .
neutral	i called again later when i hadn_'_t gotten a response and the person in question was rude and stated " they didn_'_t even know why i was contacting them specifically ".
neutral	it seems my order was filled and just sat around the warehouse waiting to be shipped , and at_least they did offer to ship next_day ( an upgrade ) when they finally did ship it out .
neutral	i have no_complaints with the actual products or pricing offered by pigeon_mountain .
neutral	the slow processing and nasty personal demeanor will certainly make me think_twice before buzzing past their catalog again .
neutral	this product was better_than my normal deodrant , but i expected it to keep me totally dry , but it didn_'_t .
neutral	i don_'_t normally sweat badly , but since starting the menopause , this is becoming more of an_issue , so i was hoping that this product would work better_than it does .
neutral	in saying that , i will keep using it for the time being , because as already menttioned , it keeps me dryer than my usual deodrant .
neutral	very expensive for the amount ( size ) of items .
neutral	i like the fact that the process was easy but the quality of the shoes wad poor .
neutral	this premier_inn is good value , with a great location being steps only from the terminal .
neutral	its also surprisingly comfortable and quiet .
neutral	however , on turning up to eat at the restaurant i was told i would have to wait 0 hours for a table and given no alternative suggestions for dining .
neutral	it was only on leaving the hotel ( with my 0 kids in tow ) to find somewhere i could feed my hungry children , that i asked a member of the reception team where i could get food for the children that i was told i could order food from the bar .
neutral	i was appalled that i was sent away from the restaurant without being told this especailly as the hostess could see i had two children to feed .
neutral	very unacceptable .
neutral	when we eventually queued at the bar for food for 00_minutes , the food came fairly quickly ( another 00 - 00_minutes ) but was of below average quality .
neutral	kids chicken curry was inedible .
neutral	i would recommend this hotel for the accomodation but do everything to avoid the food if possible .
neutral	the tickets were over 000 . 00 dollars each for a flight from new_york to fort_lauderdale .
neutral	when i went to print the boarding_passes , i was asked to pay for the carry - ons and then the seats !!
neutral	!
neutral	wrong part delivered ... ok ... it happens .
neutral	but 00_hours to rectify ... not acceptable .
neutral	i '_ll be happy when this transaction is over !
neutral	i ordered the wrong parts and when i called in i had a difficult time reaching anyone .
neutral	i sent in a ticket specifically asking for someone to call me and i was not called .
neutral	very disappointed with the level of customer_service .
neutral	i received a response via_email where they needed more information and replied and never received a response from there .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	i love kavinace but the recent price increases are forcing me to find a new sleep aide .
neutral	my first order with animed_direct , the price was very competitive , but with a few delivery issues .
neutral	initially the order disappeared into a black hole , but on telephoning quickly resolved and item delivered by courier - although again delayed_due to addressing errors twith courier - order took over a week to arrive but on receipt the items were fine and i would certainly try and order again .
neutral	the item was a good price and delivered quickly .
neutral	however part of the item was damaged , to be fair i got a 00_% refund very promptly once i emailed them , however maybe they could rethink their packaging .
neutral	sizing is slightly incorrect too , i ordered a small which it says on the website is a uk 0 - 00 , however it is slightly too baggy to be an 0 - 00 .
neutral	the local rental_car companies here in cork , ireland do not recognize my american insurance , so i must purchase excess cover or allow them to put as much as 0000 euro hold on my credit_card .
neutral	argus_car_hire online system has a " purchase excess cover " option that is very cheap ( 0 euros total ), however , what they do not tell is that this " excess cover " purchase is not really coverage , it is only for " reimbursement " of any out of pocket expense should i have an accident with the rental_car .
neutral	i was informed of this by the rental_car company and the end_result is that i must pay twice for " excess cover " that was implied to be purchased online .
neutral	a very sneaky ploy on the part of argus .
neutral	i have used hostelworld for about five bookings at this point .
neutral	four out of five went_smoothly with no_complaints .
neutral	one hostel i booked and received an_email a few_days_later .
neutral	the email was from the hostel and said hostelworld had overbooked when there was no vacancy and i should contact them for my deposit back .
neutral	i have tried to call and have sent three emails to hostelworld .
neutral	i have had no responses .
neutral	their office is in ireland which is difficult to reach by phone when i live in south_america .
neutral	i have mix feelings about their system now .
neutral	do i want to risk things going wrong with no response again ?
neutral	you can decide for yourself .
neutral	i wanted to request a room near the elevator & to choose only 0 guest , but i never saw a place to do that .
neutral	i had to call customer_service in order to request the room and they could not guarantee that .
neutral	i didn_'_t like the idea that as soon as i opened the location website it automatically went to this booking site .
neutral	was ok but glasses werent exactly as i expected but thats what you get if you use mail order
neutral	i gave the site a go today and was really impressed with the beautiful bouquets on offer !
neutral	my only issue was with the checkout_process - i got error codes when trying to pay by paypal , when i was trying to look up the shipping address by postcode , and also really struggled to find the promotional_code box as it '_s not part of the checkout_process .
neutral	after manually putting in the address and opting for debit_card vs paypal , i got there eventually !
neutral	it hasn_'_t done nothing for my husband he '_s ocd is still bad
neutral	i ordered the cressi sky snorkel set for our 0 year_old_son .
neutral	the set was great and arrived when expected .
neutral	simply snorkle stated on their web_site that they could not guarantee that the colour of the set would be as featured in the product photo .
neutral	unfortunately any other colour would have been fine but we could not use the set for our son as it arrived in pink .
neutral	please address this maybe include a separate order option for pink .
neutral	in every delivery , the cases are damages , as well as several cans .
neutral	it appears the packages are being handled with little concern .
neutral	bought my family of 00 tickets online before travelling to paris , 00 of us got on a bus with no_problems at le louvre , however my disabled father in law accompanied_by my husband were refused entry on two buses even_though they had the confirmation_email .
neutral	this was really upsetting and meant that they had to sit in a bus_stop to shelter from the pouring_rain until he was able to make it back to our vehicle where they spent the remainder of the day waiting for us .
neutral	it ruined our trip and prevented him from realising his dream of seeing the parisian sights .
neutral	a very disappointing day :(
neutral	i requested a lower radiator hose and you sent me the upper radiator hose .
neutral	i went to pep_boys to get the lower hose and replaced the upper hose .
neutral	i had no_intention of replacing the upper hose .
neutral	but everything is cool .
neutral	the composite type boards used to re - floor our deck is turning upward at some of the joints and creating a tripping hazard .
neutral	the flooring boards were all screwed down originally , but that is not keeping the involved boards flat and even .
neutral	everything '_s fine with the delivery system and deals that you offer .
neutral	the problem for my last three deliveries has_been that the 00 . 0 ounce canned_food that i '_ve purchased has arrived with bent bottoms , sides , or lids .
neutral	they are packed in lots of a dozen , but somehow the packing isn_'_t strong_enough , so many cans are bent or otherwise damaged on arrival .
neutral	hopefully , this doesn_'_t affect the contents , but it sure makes it difficult to open with a can opener that isn_'_t a crow bar !
neutral	the first time i ordered with mr . chewy , my stuff arrived about a week_later which is okay .
neutral	the next time i ordered with mr . chewy , i noticed the website claimed 0 day shipping .
neutral	when it took a week for my stuff to come in , i was a little miffed .
neutral	i don_'_t like to be lied too .
neutral	if you can '_t give me 0 day shipping , just say so .
neutral	it '_s okay if it means it helps you keep your cost down .
neutral	just down lie .
neutral	the clams 00_% broke and 0 lobster was dead :(
neutral	i like the reasonable prices , but it '_s hard to contact the company .
neutral	i have tried_calling , submitting a ticket , ( which won_'_t go through ) and u faxed the company no response .
neutral	i recite bed the wrong part .
neutral	i ordered the weight_loss patches and they did not stick they did call and told me they would not charge me for them but as yet i have not seen a credit issued .
neutral	so i am not real happy with their product
neutral	it '_s easy to book and the options presented are great .
neutral	but even_though you enter the frequent flier # when booking on travelocity , it never carries over to the actual reservation with the airline so i always have to call the airline and wait forever on hold to add it .
neutral	it '_s a pain and the main_reason i usually book direct with the airline .
neutral	this is a very basic flight need .
neutral	what is up ?
neutral	furthermore , my seat reservations were not saved for the second leg of the journey .
neutral	now the options are much worse .
neutral	because there is so much competition on line , and so many pet_supply sites , i shop price and delivery costs .
neutral	this was my first time shopping at petflow .... i found that the shipping was much slower_than other_sites i have used for pet_food .
neutral	this was my only_complaint , but , unless they deliver the food more quickly , i probably will not shop there again .
neutral	i booked the room online .
neutral	when i arrived i could not use my aaa_discount card or my senior_citizen discount .
neutral	that was very disappointing .
neutral	those discounts would have saved my several dollars .
neutral	had to stay because rooms were not available at other_places
neutral	very quick service , however , each of the 0 cartridges i opened to install leaked an inordinate amount of ink on to my hands and the desk !
neutral	!
neutral	very poor finishing .
neutral	i wish someone would have advised . me that i would need . other parts .
neutral	no bulbs or replacement sockets were attached .
neutral	no i have to order and wait before i can repair my tail_lights ..
neutral	i knew the bulbs wouldn_'_t be there .
neutral	but sockets !
neutral	?!
neutral	unhappy ...
neutral	can '_t get through to the phone_number they provide and it just says to call back later .
neutral	no one responds to our emails even_though they claim to respond within 00_hours ?
neutral	still_haven_'_t received an update on the order i placed 0_weeks_ago .
neutral	apart_from that , they do have a good variety of stock and at relatively good prices .
neutral	i was disappointed with the inflexibility of delivery and also the expectation that 0 people were available to help unload .
neutral	i haven_'_t had the goods installed yet and i know there will be no comeback if something is wrong .
neutral	i booked a " deal " without knowing the name of the hotel .
neutral	it said that two stars are best_western , hampton_inn , la_quinta .
neutral	instead of those types of hotels , i was booked into a super 0 .
neutral	not the same category .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	i won_'_t likely book a deal without exact hotel name and location again .
neutral	:(
neutral	i once ordered pick_up from truly vegan .
neutral	when i went to the place , it was closed .
neutral	i was not offered anything for the inconvenience of going to get the food when the place was closed .
neutral	when trying to order from two boots pizza , it was not easy to pick certain things like type of crust etc .
neutral	it wasn_'_t very user - friendly .
neutral	having previously had good experiences , i sent my mother some flowers a few_months_ago to cheer_her up and when they arrived they were great but the next_day they were already dying and on day three most had to be binned .
neutral	thinking this was a one off , i sent her some flowers for mothers_day and i upgraded them to the ' deluxe ' version .
neutral	my mother found them on the doorstep when a second bunch from my brother turned_up .
neutral	so , the delivery person didn_'_t knock .
neutral	when i went round to see her i was very surprised to find her flowers were a t very ' petit ' bunch .
neutral	not at all what i was expecting .
neutral	next time i will use the company my brother used , as his flowers filled the house , lasted_longer and didn_'_t cost as much .
neutral	i use to get my orders in a couple days but lately it has_been slower and slower .
neutral	my order from a week_ago today has_been sitting at fedex ten miles from my house for several days accordiing to the website .
neutral	i stopped using my old dog_food company because they were too slow , and you all were great someone needs to findout why it is now taking so long to receive orders .
neutral	purchases are easy but when they have to be delivered i have to constantly chase to get it delivered .
neutral	flowers arrived and i was told they were lovely .
neutral	the problem was that the card was blank which caused a problem as recipient did not know who they were from .
neutral	when i called the lady cpnfirmed that a message was on the system she just said she would call florist .
neutral	no offer of anything_else not great customer_service
neutral	i renewed my multitrip_insurance no prob payed by laser card . all was grand . i had to inform the medical board as i do every year that my husband is diabtic . there is never extra_charge however i was told this year things have changed and there would be a charge of 00 . euro and 00cent . ok thats no big deal i said ill pay with laser and was told they dont except laser only credit_card or cheque hers the thig we don_'_t have a credit_card or cheque book and your man says ask a family_member if you can use their card . its a discrace they were happy to take my money from laser card for main policy
neutral	i '_m editing my review to reflect what my experience has_been since our case was taken up by michael , the president of nsc .
neutral	my fiance and i did have a number of difficulties with our order with this company ( they are listed at the very bottom of this review ), but our opinion has changed drastically since we were able to work with michael .
neutral	our belief is that the vast_majority of people who work with nsc receive a perfect order on the first go around and that when our order had problems , their existing infrastructure was really not adequate to deal with them .
neutral	now , i will say that i hope our rep has learned a lesson about how to treat customers because we were quite understanding and had very simple requests that she chose not to follow_up on ( emailing us when it arrived , calling us once it was time to re - do the ring for the third time , and making sure to look at the ring herself before it was shipped out ).
neutral	that said , our experience with michael has absolutely been perfect .
neutral	not only was he incredibly apologetic over the phone to both my fiance and myself , individually , he also asked us both individually to explain exactly_what had happened from our personal perspectives and really took the time to express to us how much he regretted what our experience had been .
neutral	he offered us a 00_%_discount on our ring in addition to providing a written lifetime_guarantee that we could send the ring back to be re - finished for no charge and also guaranteed that if we decided to change the band from platinum to white gold at some point in the future that his company would remake the band and refund us the difference in the costs of the metal .
neutral	we chose not to accept the discount , though we appreciated that it was offered , because we never wanted to pay less for our ring -- we just wanted what we had ordered and we wanted someone at the company to care about us and our ring .
neutral	we wanted to feel_like we were being treated like people by someone_who cared .
neutral	once we got in touch with michael -- which we did on our first try this past monday -- things were taken_care of incredibly quickly .
neutral	in fact , i am wearing my ring right now ( it arrived last night along with a beautiful pendant necklace that michael sent to apologize ) and it looks perfect .
neutral	i now regret that we spent so much time dealing_with our rep and realize that we should have taken it higher up the chain much sooner .
neutral	in spite of our frustrations , i still support this company because it is a small business and i really believe our experience was a reflection of the fact that it is experiencing growing pains .
neutral	i '_m sure our rep had tons of other orders she was dealing_with and i really think that our experience was a wake_up call for the company that they need to grow their staff in order to take on increasing demand .
neutral	i really hope that no one else will have to deal with what we did , but at the end of the day we now have the ring that we wanted and we have the comfort of knowing that michael is supporting us and is on our side .
neutral	it '_s kind of funny how much it matters for purchases like engagement_rings to be sure that the people you ' re buying from care not just about the money you '_ll be giving them , but about you .
neutral	i '_m leaving the basics of my original review below so that other customers can see what our experience was .
neutral	still , i am greatly comforted in having spoken with michael personally and i am certain that this is a company with strong potential and with beautiful pieces to offer .
neutral	i hope that my review will be an anomaly and that the company can learn and grow from our experience .
neutral	my only advice would be that if other customers begin to face difficulties ( which , again , i don_'_t_believe many do based on other reviews and also based on michael '_s reaction , calling our experience " his worst nightmare " and expressing his embarrassment ) they should make_sure to elevate their order themselves .
neutral	0 .
neutral	we ordered a ring but they had to ship it undone because it was not completed in time for our engagement .
neutral	we understood and sent it back to be finished an re - sized .
neutral	our rep then sent it back and it was finished , but they did not re - size it .
neutral	frustrated , we sent it back again .
neutral	when we got it back it was re - sized but extremely dirty ( black spots all over ) and misshapen .
neutral	this has led to me having a ring for about 0_weeks of our engagement of over 0 months .
neutral	frustrating .
neutral	0 .
neutral	our rep was generally quite dismissive .
neutral	when i would send my precious ring back to their store , i would ask her to inform me when it arrived .
neutral	each time i sent it back ( via 0 - day shipping ) i had to contact her myself ( five days_later ) to ask if the ring had arrived .
neutral	the third time i asked that she call me to speak with me over the phone about my ring .
neutral	she agreed she would .
neutral	she never did .
neutral	she also repeatedly used the excuse that she had many appointments and meetings to justify not calling me .
neutral	* i have learned by talking to michael that their reps do not work on commission so as to avoid situations like ours happening .
neutral	as such , i have deleted what i had previously written about our rep dismissing us perhaps because she had already received her commission .
neutral	still_waiting for a response to my e_- mail from some time ago regarding the negative behavior or your telephone order taker .
neutral	the offers that where dispatch where great value for money but sometimes the product you wish to purchase does not tell you the date you can use it by which comes across as misleading which is a shame it makes me hesitate to book a hotel offer in future .
neutral	overall in the past i have been pleased with the wowchers i have purchased and i have bought a lot !!
neutral	however i was disappointed that a gift i bought for my daughter as a christmas_present and which she could not take adfvantage of within the dates are causing her a problem in redeeming .
neutral	i think she has only been offered a percentage of the money spent rather_than just transfer the full value to another wowcher experience .
neutral	we have never asked for a refund and cannot understand wowcher '_s stance on this .
neutral	this meabs i will not give wowcher experiences as a gift in the future and would not recommend that anyone_else does .
neutral	my tyres had not arrived at the garage at the time i had booked in for .
neutral	i have still not received a refund for the initial deposit i paid - though i have been told this will happen .
neutral	i managed to get alternative tyres at a cheaper price locally .
neutral	however , blackcircles have been very good at getting back to me whenever i have called or emailed , and were happy to cancel my order immediately as the tyres had not been delivered in time .
neutral	the assos factory outlet is hit and miss .
neutral	i found a great umajacket in a never before seen color ( pink and blk ), that arrived in perfect_condition and true to size .
neutral	love it !
neutral	on the other hand , they have jersey '_s listed over a $_000 more then i would pay ( on sale - same jersey ), at my regular cycle shopping website , so not exactly outlet pricing !
neutral	but let the buyer_beware .
neutral	the reason i gave them a 0 was for the bib tights i bought .
neutral	the bib attachment broke before i ever left the house and the length of the bib straps are shorter then the same pair i purchased from my regular shopping site .
neutral	seems the sizing is off on the entire fit for this particular peice , maybe the reason it is at the outlet in the first place , but still would not expect the bib closure to tear off in under 00_minutes .
neutral	did not return as the policy is too difficult , i just sewed them .
neutral	again buyer_beware !
neutral	still love assos , but hesitant to buy from their outlet unless its one of those colors the regular stores don_'_t carry and i can '_t live wotihout !
neutral	we booked a ' greet & meet ' service as our flight was returning late , we called to confirm that we had landed and was asked to call again once we collected our_luggage , even after the second call we had to wait about 00_mins for the driver to turn up .
neutral	i expect meet and greet to be literally when you walk out of the terminal .
neutral	i will write a review when we receive the item .
neutral	shipoing seems to be slow
neutral	the website is easy to navigate , and it '_s awesome that the provide measurements for their clothes , especially for international costumers .
neutral	that said , while their selection of clothes is pretty broad , their actual stock is shit .
neutral	i wanted to exchange an item for a smaller_size , but it was already sold out , even_though i received it not even a week_ago .
neutral	what clothe items i save for later also end up being " no_longer available " within a week or two .
neutral	costumer_service isn_'_t the best either .
neutral	i called to ask about returns , but their hours are weird , and all i got was an_automated_message with bad audio and broken english .
neutral	i tried e_- mailing them instead , and again , i just got another automated_message , a day or two later .
neutral	i was told when i called that no one knew when the back ordered items would be in .
neutral	not good .
neutral	i went to make my payment at the wood forest location and their computer was down .
neutral	i understand things happen so the clerk suggested two locations the federal rd .
neutral	location and another about a mile from that .
neutral	i went to the federal rd .
neutral	because it was closer .
neutral	when i arrived there their computer was also down and that was at_least a 0 mile drive . i gave up after that . since the systems are totally computer driven some other accommodations should be made for customers so that they ' re not inconvience .
neutral	good selection , competitive_prices , shame delivery charges are so high
neutral	and not delivered quicker .
neutral	i had no_idea i wasn_'_t dealing directly with the hotel .
neutral	that was deceiving .
neutral	andafter reading all this reviews i was so scared about my order .
neutral	i just ordered 0 pairs of shoes and to my surprise i got everything i orderd all came in on time and im pretty happy with all of them .
neutral	so i would say give it and see what happens
neutral	your 0000 people do not know any information .
neutral	i was told to go to the property to ask because when i called the fort worth location in river oaks , they did not answer the phone for two_days over different times .
neutral	you seem very disorganized .
neutral	reasonable pricing , however , felt harassed .
neutral	i thought my due date was the 00th of each_month .
neutral	the first month was free .
neutral	then , the second month i waited to pay my bill , however , i received a past due notice around the second week with a late charge .
neutral	i went into the office and told the manager i thought he had told me it was due on the 00th and could he waive the late charge .
neutral	he said " no ."
neutral	i then planned to call the site manager in the next few_days but , in the meantime , received in the mail a notice of lien with even more additional_charges !
neutral	:( to make a long_story short , i ended_up paying 00 . extra in charges that i feel were unwarranted .
neutral	i '_m only still there because i don_'_t want to go through the hassle of moving again .
neutral	first , my property was stolen from a public_storage_unit and it took them 0 months to pay me ... now this .
neutral	not happy .
neutral	the website is a bit busy , but was easy to navigate .
neutral	i added a package of products that touted free_shipping on entire order , but was still charged $ 0 . 00 shipping anyway .
neutral	it isn_'_t a whole lot , but if you say free_shipping , you should mean free_shipping .
neutral	so , i only give 0_stars .
neutral	i may be able to update my review to 0_stars once i receive my order .
neutral	until then , i remain hopefully optimistic that there are no other quirks .
neutral	because , they do have great prices and lots of freebies to add in to your order .
neutral	i love a great value !
neutral	my family and i really_enjoyed getting on the bus at waterloo , the guide was very upbeat and had great knowledge of london .
neutral	waiting for 00_minutes at stop number 0 was frustrating , we were told the wait would be 00_minutes at the most .
neutral	when the new guide got on the bus she was very good and informative .
neutral	my son fell down the stairs when we tried to get off the bus which upset him and made me anxious for our return_journey .
neutral	when we got back on the bus outside hamleys , the bus was very full and there was no guide for the rest of the tour .
neutral	that was disappointing .
neutral	first time ordering from diabloskinz and i was very happy with the great print .
neutral	would have been really happy if they could have sent me both items i paid for instead of only 0 .
neutral	still_waiting for satisfaction and a response ...
neutral	hi there , this was a great product but from the time i paid for it , it took two_weeks to get to me , this was too slow i felt , there was good communication with lots of emails every_step of the way , however , normal online sale is pay for it and it is sent the same day .
neutral	great product , packed well
neutral	i ordered from groupon packaging was good meat i would say iv had better .
neutral	i would like to tell people i also received another package of meat 0 week_later which i did not order .
neutral	the amount £_00_pounds in which i did not order .
neutral	i got an_email from the company stating i was ordering a weekly food package deal ... no i didn_'_t maybe that '_s how they get there money back .
neutral	did this happen to anybody else and no i was not refunded ..
neutral	i would beware
neutral	in 0000 , i ordered a self - styled plaque and it was wonderful .
neutral	it is 0 / 0 " thick .
neutral	it was a good gift for an established / wealthy friend .
neutral	in 0000 i ordered another and it is half the thickness for the same price .
neutral	i am very disappointed .
neutral	the second plaque looks cheesy and low rent next to the first .
neutral	i will not be ordering again .
neutral	they have a wide_variety of wound care products at good prices .
neutral	they charge 00 . 00 for shipping regardless of what you order .
neutral	i thought this was a little_steep for probably less_than a pound of gauze sponges .
neutral	one of the items i ordered has not been received and there was not really an explanation of why or when it would come .
neutral	i got the other items last_week .
neutral	we '_ve had verizon for years !
neutral	we purchased the iphone from them , but the next week a new one came out , and they didn_'_t inform us of that !
neutral	the selling of my first phone was fine but unfortunately there was a difficultly with the sellign of my blackberry and i have not recived the phone back yet as it couldnt not be sold so i am slighty annoyed by this
neutral	a couple of times when i '_ve needed to make_changes , or correct an_error , the service couldn_'_t have been better !
neutral	and anything i order usually arrives in 0 days , or 0 max , so awesome there !
neutral	my complaint would be that the food is about $ 0 -$ 0 more than at a local_retail_store , and add to that the shipping ( don_'_t like to spend the extra $$ on stuff i don_'_t need just for free_shipping ), sooooo , all together i pay nearly $_00 extra for home delivery .
neutral	it '_s good for when i '_m working too much to be able to catch the store when it '_s open .
neutral	but there '_s a lot i could do with $_00 .....
neutral	this service was convenient though there was some initial confusion and i wasn_'_t happy that funds were taken from my account even_though my initial host declined my request .
neutral	i wasn_'_t aware that i would have to request my money back or instruct them to put it towards another property as i thought it would be automatic .
neutral	i may use again but will also investigate other_companies_offering similar services .
neutral	the labels are not exactly_what i thought they would be but will work for what i need .
neutral	i thought they would be cloth but are more like a plastic material .
neutral	i did not realize they were ' iron on ' but i stitched it on anyway .
neutral	i don_'_t think an iron on label would hold up on a baby '_s blanket .
neutral	they are worth the price .
neutral	the staff is friendly , clean room , but to high price for what they offer .
neutral	breakfest is not included , ok , extra 00_euro .
neutral	but for that price a expect a special breakfest , this was good but basic .
neutral	the same for wifi , if you want it , extra 0 euro .
neutral	the week before i stayed in an hostel , breakfest the same as in the hotel , free_wifi ,...
neutral	at a mutch lower price .
neutral	priceline has gotten us some very fair deals but every so often they will slip in a very poor hotel on their express_deals .
neutral	they tell you the type of hotel you can " expect " with the deal they are offering and then slip in a hotel that isn_'_t listed and then say " no refunds " ... too bad , so sad is their line then .
neutral	i would love to know what my product is like , but i haven_'_t gotten it yet : )
neutral	the deals are very good and i have bought quite a few goods and meals .
neutral	however , some goods had a very short timescale to claim or it wasn_'_t clear they needed claiming rather sending direct , so i have lost money on a number or purchases which is extremely frustrating .
neutral	as i have used the site for some time this isn_'_t because i don_'_t know how to use the site .
neutral	the goods i have received have all been good quality and arrived as expected .
neutral	i received my bag extremely quick .
neutral	i appreciated the timely delivery .
neutral	however after using my bag for a month the top clasp no_longer will hold the hook .
neutral	every time i put an item on my hook the weight rips it out of the clasp .
neutral	i '_m disappointed in how quickly the clasp had broken .
neutral	i expected better from this company .
neutral	where did the discount you promised in the email vanish ?
neutral	the delivery of orders is not consistent .
neutral	sometimes the order is here in 0 days and the last order was 0 days in delivery .
neutral	it was a one item order and was shipped the same day so why did it take so long ?
neutral	the pop_up discounts are hard to manage when ordering as i plan to redeem points and then there is another discount option and it is not made know until the order is almost done .
neutral	it would be important to know up front what the discount options will be so a decision about the items to order can be made .
neutral	the graphics on the card were perfect .
neutral	the proposed shipping took longer_than it was supposed to and the tracking_number brought me to the wrong site .
neutral	but the receipient received her gift_card and she '_s happy !
neutral	you did a great job in terms of trying to build a good relationship with us , but overall i came away feeling things were a bit disorganized and so things weren_'_t on time quite_often .
neutral	it looked like things were going to get better with website improvements etc .
neutral	but we ended_up going with another company that was cheaper and uses dropbox for transcription audio upload which makes_life_easier .
neutral	delivery was slow nd one of the items came damaged
neutral	a button fell_off one dress as soon as i tried it on .
neutral	i ordered a skater dress and one of the belt loops came off on that .
neutral	i however had no_problems with the tight body con dresses .
neutral	i purchased 00 " bully_sticks " for my dogs and they absolutely love them .
neutral	i also purchased two ( 0 ) monkey kong toys , believing them to be durable as_described .
neutral	within about 0 minutes of having them , one dog chewed open the head of the toy and then removed the squeaker .
neutral	as far as i '_m concerned these toys were a waste of our money .
neutral	the site is easy to use and with helpful advice on measuring etc .
neutral	the service and delivery were good .
neutral	the only_drawback and its a big one ... ordered a blackout material for pleated blinds and instead of running strings through loops attached to the fabric the strings are run through the blind making the blackout material a laugh as there are 0 lines of holes all the way down each blind .
neutral	its a real_shame as otherwise i like the product .
neutral	managed muck up my order and selected quantity 0 of the wrong_size blind so have had to order another one ... hope the fabric doesn_'_t alter too much between batches !
neutral	first , they should offer a spoiled_rotten dog / cat combo because a lot of people have both and cannot_afford both .
neutral	next , i did try the cat spoiled_rotten program but cancelled after only one delivery because it had too many food items .
neutral	spoiling to me means fun -- toys , surprises and maybe one food treat .
neutral	and it had a brush .... really , a brush (?).
neutral	also , i did not feel it was worth the $_00 as_advertised but i was not familiar with those food items and my cats can '_t eat a lot of different foods ( like most ) or they will get upset tummies .
neutral	i thought it was going to be toys ,
neutral	the fridge itself seems fine .
neutral	it is almost the same as one we bought 00 months_ago .
neutral	sadly that went wrong .
neutral	hence us ordering a replacement one .
neutral	my husband met the two delivery_men .
neutral	it was last thing on a sunday_afternoon .
neutral	they chuntered about our very steep downhill drive .
neutral	my husband actually went to meet and greet and assist them .
neutral	on a scale of 0 to 0 he compaired the delivery wxperience with the last one and only gave them a poor 0 because of their rather negative attitude .
neutral	the website was great for compare units and finding the best one for me .
neutral	only issue was that i made a reservation through the site and when i got to the storage_facility they had no record of it .
neutral	luckily they had a unit available for me .
neutral	really ?
neutral	" i '_m just saying what the owner '_s manual states ".
neutral	" i '_m not trying to sell you anything :.
neutral	" i '_m just saying ".
neutral	is that how you speak to people .
neutral	lovely sales tactic .
neutral	not yet received item so cannot do review . with the bank_holidays i am still_waiting for my items .
neutral	i got my book for a great price and the experience of buying it from bookbyte was great but the book was in worse condition than_expected .
neutral	quick delivery of the cook cart and looks like its made from good materials but lots of washer / bolts for the fixing screws / bolts were missing and after a phone_call next_day i am still_waiting for these to arrive - have spent a week tripping over the parts that fill the kitchen_floor .
neutral	would have expected next_day airmail missing bits so disappointed and worried they won_'_t get sent
neutral	love the fact that delivery . com covers many categories and has an incentive program , unlike_other similar services .
neutral	however , the website needs a full redesign .
neutral	its awful , looks like its from 0000 .
neutral	also , the offers that are emailed to me don_'_t automatically show up in my app and there is no way to apply them to the app since i must click through the email to activate , so it makes using the app inconvenient when i have an offer .
neutral	also , whenever i check " do not provide plastic utensils " the restaurant always brings them , regardless of the place .
neutral	that being said , these establishments need to be communicated to by delivery . com to explain the importance of this .
neutral	its wasteful .
neutral	hotel is convenient to beach , of course lobby is always nice .
neutral	in the hallway on the 0th fl carpet has stains on floor , if you can get pass the dirty walls and doors on the outside of the room .
neutral	inside the rooms was pretty clean but a lil dusty with dust flying off the ceiling fan .
neutral	prescription from vet was on file and i received an_email that my order was received and would be shipped .
neutral	after 0 days , i checked order status and it showed as pending .
neutral	when i called support , they said they needed script from my vet ( even_though written script was on file ).
neutral	my vet phoned immediately to complete order .
neutral	it still took 0 days from this phone_call for order to ship .
neutral	this delay is not acceptable .
neutral	will not order from here again b
neutral	the agents were helpful on the phone and in person at the particular location i '_m renting at but i don_'_t like being refused the bathroom code and having to ask for someone to come and open it for me , what happens when i come after the office has closed ?
neutral	also , there is very little to no lighting at night .
neutral	there are light_bulbs in the unit but they don_'_t work .
neutral	why is that ?
neutral	first time i use this website , the rate for the hotel choosen was the best one , but when booking i had some internet problems and the date choosen changed ... meaning i confirmed a wrong date , and paid of course ... an non_- refundable booking .
neutral	thanks god the lenght also changed into one night ...
neutral	i only lost one night and had to redo it all again , with the correct dates this time .
neutral	it is my fault i know , but usually with other web_site , there is a reminder of what you book before you pay , to make_sure you dont make mistakes ...
neutral	the magnet '_s were fine , but i do have a huge problem .
neutral	when i picked_up the parcel , i put the package in my bag and drove 0 minutes to my house .
neutral	phone dead !
neutral	when i opened the package it had a big hazard triangles on it and said about how strong the magnets were , and not to put the magnets near i - pods , i presumed this meant i - phones too .
neutral	so i checked that my i phone was in working order , cos i had just received a picture , i wanted to save the received picture to my phone and nothing , no power , no broken picture or even flicker , nothing !
neutral	the plastic on the outside of the unopened package was plain and gave no_indication as to how dangerous and powerful the magnets are , the outside packaging needs to have a warning information on it prominently printed , or when the order is placed , there needs to be a separate information e_- mail_stating how dangerous these magnets are .
neutral	the pre_- sales service was great , because i had a lot of questions .
neutral	but now i have no phone !
neutral	kind_regards ,
neutral	sarah mcgahon
neutral	i ordered a shirt , and the first one that arrived was not only the wrong dog on the front , but also the wrong_size .
neutral	upon contacting pet - flow , they immediately took_care of the issue .
neutral	when i got the shirt i ordered , it was correct .. but i had ordered a medium .. and the medium was so big !
neutral	i wish they would have women '_s sizes apart_from the mens .
neutral	oh well .. i guess i can always use the shirt for bed .
neutral	i just booked a trip on bookit and overall was satified with the website and the price we paid for our trip .
neutral	the only_complaint i had was that the site identified the hotel we selected as " center strip " and it is one of the last hotels on the vegas strip .
neutral	this is a significant problem because one of my travel companions has a disability that makes walking difficult .
neutral	we would have selected another resort had ours not been misidentified as being on the center of the vegas strip on the website .
neutral	staff not very helpful .
neutral	i had to ask a lot of questions to get a few answers , but maybe that was just that one individual .
neutral	the car and contract were as_advertised .
neutral	i '_ll use economy again ( i '_ve used them in the past and had better customer_service ).
neutral	i can check for the prices and the most convenient times and places .
neutral	my only problem on my trip to new_orleans was that i booked a hotel ( midtown - new_orleans ) with the help of travelocity - and it was the worst hotel experience i have ever had .
neutral	the room had no amenities whatsoever - not even a trash can , telephone , or smoke detector .
neutral	you might want to consider not listing places where people are afraid they might be found stuffed in a dumpster the next_day .
neutral	other_travelers agreed with this the morning of checkout .
neutral	let the buyer_beware !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i love shopping here because the deal is so good , but the shipping cost is high ; in the end , the deal is just ok .
neutral	even_though you lives close by , you cannot do local pick_up to save on the shipping cost .
neutral	you should check you final out - of - pocket cost , as the discount may not be proper applied .
neutral	the customer_service does not issue refund immediately as it takes_forever for them to do this .
neutral	plants havent arrived .
neutral	suggest your survey is prematurely timed .
neutral	i get delivery once a day .
neutral	though i '_m thankful for the point - system , $ 0 discounts , and the other promotions , the app is often hit / miss experience .
neutral	i often receive an " error " message .
neutral	i can '_t save my favorites , because of this error_message .
neutral	great site for car parts !
neutral	items arrived super quick .
neutral	however .
neutral	there online customer_service needs work ... i emailed them about a problem with the tracking_info they sent me and never once did any one get back to me
neutral	i ordered 0 onesies for the christmas_season .
neutral	the quality is not great - i '_m going to have to do some sewing on the one as a seam down the leg has come undone .
neutral	also i didn_'_t get the sizing prefect - would have been mor comfortable with a larger_size .
neutral	the service was good - postage from the uk always takes a couple of days , but that was fine .
neutral	delivery was fine but using your website is always difficult for me .
neutral	the at cost part always goes back to the beginning whenever i order something and then go back to shopping .
neutral	this wastes a lot of time .
neutral	i always have trouble checking out .
neutral	i don_'_t have the same problems with other_sites , so i '_m puzzled as to what the issues are .
neutral	thank_goodness for the chat you '_ve set_up .
neutral	that makes it possible to order with sanity .
neutral	if not for the chat , i probably would have given up on your site a long time ago .
neutral	i hope you can improve the website so as to make it easier for customers to navigate and purchase things quickly .
neutral	the decaf capsules i ordered did not work properly .
neutral	one day after i ordered my alternator on parts_geek i found out that i actually didn_'_t need that part and that it was my tensioner pulley that was going bad .
neutral	unfortunately { as stated all over the website } i could not cancel my order .
neutral	the delivery also took over a week , so if it was my alternator then i would have been without a car for a week so i would have had to pay to rent a car which would more than pay for just paying retail at autozone .
neutral	my advice , if you really need the part and your car isn_'_t working without it i would go elsewhere .
neutral	but i did get my part , and it was what i ordered .
neutral	unfortunately if i return it then i will have to pay a penalty , so i will probably just keep it and kick myself everytime that i walk past it in the garage .
neutral	honestly , i probably_won_'_t order a part online again .
neutral	bought an la electric twelve string diy kit , very easy to put_together , the difficult bits were 0 .
neutral	painting and finishing the body which is made from soft wood and shows every dink and sanding scratch , bare in mind good paint will cost nearly as much as the kit .
neutral	0 .
neutral	setting_up the guitar , to get intonation correct , a reasonable action , and keeping it in tune , all this is going to take some time as the wood is " moving under stress " none of this is the fault of gear0music , i am fairly pleased with my purchase , after all , the product i end up with on a diy kit is really up to me .
neutral	in an effort to save_money i ordered this coffee and although it is good - it is unlike the real nespresso .
neutral	it is not as satisfying and aromatic .
neutral	with normal expresso , i never add milk or sugar because the taste is delicious .
neutral	the taste is lacking .
neutral	sorry .
neutral	i am glad i tried it , but will not be ordering again .
neutral	while i was thrilled that one of the trees had several baby lemons already , one did not .
neutral	another problem i had was that during packing , one of the trees had a large branch broken off .
neutral	the packaging itself and the speedy_delivery were excellent .
neutral	just disappointed about the broken limb ...
neutral	i was very sorry that yor colours were not as shown on the computer , my computer is not at fault re colours .
neutral	i was quoted 00 dollars and when the check got here it was only 00 .
neutral	i know that there is a time limit but it is not my fault that the mail was slow and there was a sunday during the time .
neutral	i sent it out as early as i could .
neutral	this was the first time that i had a bad_experience .
neutral	the site was easy to navigate and easy to adapt the card , which i really liked .
neutral	and i thought it was a good price for someone_who doesn_'_t need a lot of cards .
neutral	however , i chose the " textured " material , because i thought it would be a nicer material than the matte .
neutral	i wish there had been a warning or a photo of what it actually looked like and that it wasn_'_t advisable for someone putting a photo of themselves on the card -- it made my photo look very strange and i '_m slightly embarrassed to hand it out now .
neutral	i would just please advise them to put a warning notice to people choosing the textured option to consider only selecting matte .
neutral	i ordered a case of dog_food on the phone and after a little over a week , i still did not have it .
neutral	i called and found out that the guy_who took the order did not ask about my vet , and this was required because of the prescription of the dog_food .
neutral	he never called back to get that information .
neutral	i did not think to provide it because this was my second order for the same food , so i thought the information was stored in my file .
neutral	had i not called , the order would have remained unfilled .
neutral	sloppy .
neutral	ordering online was great and easy .
neutral	however i never got a password to look up my ups status and on top of that i requested to have my package delivered with a signature required .
neutral	however on nov . 00th at 0 :_00pm the package was delivered and the ups driver_rang the door_bell and took off .
neutral	i was less_than 00ft away from the door and when i got to the door after hearing the door_bell ring i got to watch the ups drive away and the package was left_outside on the ground when i have a screened in front_porch .
neutral	so overall i say for the price of the item and the easiness of buying my item was great but for service and the way my request was ignored i ' d have to say it was very lousy .
neutral	sometimes the clothes were surprisingly good quality for the money ,
neutral	and sometimes what i received looked nice only on the picture
neutral	as the fabric & colours of the received item looked quite cheap .
neutral	still the service is good if you want to send things back .
neutral	i think they used to have a policy that you cannot return an item ,
neutral	you can only exchange it for a different size ,
neutral	but it '_s no_longer the case , therefore 0_stars .
neutral	hi thanks for a quick delivery i don_'_t no why i paid_extra for a 0 - 0 day delivery when the items arrived in 0 days i order these items for my property in france so had them delivered to my mother - in - laws expecting that i would be there for their arrival but no they came far to quickly
neutral	petflow '_s prices compare well to those of other pet_supply sites ( i '_ve visited / used quite a few ), and their shipping rates are lower .
neutral	that '_s the good news .
neutral	the bad_news : they use deceptive advertising practices to gain your business .
neutral	ex : every special promotional ad that states " free_shipping !"
neutral	is in fact referring to their standard shipping policy , while they write it to sound like that particular promotion includes free_shipping on all orders .
neutral	it doesn_'_t become apparent until either calling to clarify , or at check - out .
neutral	beware this flawed tactic ... otherwise they get a woof .
neutral	not happy !
neutral	00 days have passed .
neutral	my account was charged within one hour of web purchase .
neutral	no updates from partsgeek . com at all .
neutral	when i go to track on their web_site it still says ' processing '.
neutral	purchases should not be charged until item is shipped !!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	updates about shipping delays should be conveyed thru email to customers !
neutral	order is on back order .
neutral	ask me again when i receive the order as to how long it takes for me to receive the order .
neutral	then i will give my true opinion .
neutral	the service was quick and the products i received were better_than i expected quality wise but to charge me to restock the items is a cheek esp when its an online store and we can return to a physical location ourselves .
neutral	i appreciate returns postage is paid for but majority of retailers do free returns and i don_'_t think i have come_across a stocking charge .
neutral	i don_'_t think i will be using boohoo unless there is something i desperately want .
neutral	i received confirmation of my booking fee this morning with the added note that the remainder of the fare is also due today , but that you will remind_me in a week or so , what '_s happening ???
neutral	?
neutral	i booked online and when i received a confirmation the first page stated the date that it made the reservation as check i .
neutral	and out on .
neutral	the .
neutral	same date , which was confusing , i had to verify that i only booked 0 date later on in the year and hopefully not charged for 0 dates .
neutral	my first order was great .
neutral	no_problems what so ever , timely delivery .
neutral	my 0nd order not so much .
neutral	i responded to a sale email i was sent for items .
neutral	i ordered 00 items and when i received them , only 0 items met my expectations .
neutral	the shipping was poor in the extreme .
neutral	i paid for expedited_shipping and didn_'_t get it when i needed it .
neutral	also , there was a lot of wasted shipping .
neutral	instead of waiting until another order was complete it came in three or four boxes .
neutral	as an example a little tube of cream came in it '_s own small box .
neutral	was it overlooked in the larger order or was it out of stock when the original order was filled ?
neutral	makes one wonder_why ?
neutral	extra packaging and postage .
neutral	hi !
neutral	i love my perfumes from parfum0 .
neutral	i can find all the great brands there that are not available at some of the other online stores . however my last purchase of approx $_000_dollars was met with a ups charge of another $_00 !
neutral	this was not duties or customs but ridiculous ups surcharges .
neutral	unfortunately i have to purchase elsewhere from now on .
neutral	i felt the facility was standard and adequate .
neutral	but i didn_'_t like the low level of security .
neutral	in late january on a monday i went to the facility . the main gate wasn_'_t working and was completely open for anyone to drive in .
neutral	no repair personnel or vehicles any where in sight .
neutral	i thought maybe they were waiting for them to arrive .
neutral	i returned 0 days_later on wednesday , and the gate was still broken and completely open .
neutral	again , no repair personnel in sight .
neutral	also , i don_'_t think it '_s very secure that all the exterior doors leading into the building open with the same code , a very simple to figure_out 0 - 0 - 0 .
neutral	and the door that i used to access the building never closed completely by itself .
neutral	your internet services were good .
neutral	i made a mistake on the date and had to cancel the first reservation and book it again .
neutral	when we arrived at the hotel they only had the first reservation with the wrong date .
neutral	not sure what happened , but the hotel took good care of us .
neutral	i was right in the middle of my flight booking when the price of my airline_ticket jumped up significantly .
neutral	there was also no seat map available to see if i would be denied a ticket because of the location of the seat i was trying to select .
neutral	this occurred twice while trying to book my flight .
neutral	i was eventually able to book a flight by not trying to select a window seat .
neutral	during this process i ended_up spending more than $_00 over the price that was advertised on your sight .
neutral	i have used your sight before to book flights and would like to continue if these issues can be addressed .
neutral	fedex and petflows site did not reflect the same message and delivery was off by 0 days .
neutral	chemist_direct is a great company selling well_known_brands at fantastic prices .
neutral	delivery was very good .
neutral	my only moan is that it states buy one get one free on their malibu suncare but if you buy multiple bottles it changes to buy one get cheapest free !
neutral	still a good offer but not what they advertise on the web_page !
neutral	had to call , the person on the other end not so nice .
neutral	terrible area .
neutral	the hotel decor is nice and so was the staff .
neutral	it just seemed an unsafe part pf town .
neutral	usually excellent product received in a timely_manner .
neutral	this last order my product was damaged and it didn_'_t seem as though anyone was too concerned_about it .
neutral	there was a discontinued product and i wasn_'_t informed prior to my shipment .
neutral	it seems a little unprofessional to send items and not tell me something is out of stock .
neutral	how about a call and a substitution ?
neutral	instead of shipping me stuff , and me contacting you about something that didn_'_t come ? the ease to order was there , product delivery time was good , just sevice was lacking .
neutral	i was told one price on line and when i called they said with the unit they gave_me needed a special lock that had to be purchased from them which raised the price by $_00 . 00 dollars .
neutral	i feel i was tricked .
neutral	very bad you dont have phone_number , when i order duplicate after 0 min .
neutral	try to cancel but you dont have number i was to sad . i just loose money ( so_far for shipping ) and my time . thanks
neutral	the company '_s phone_number has_been disconnected .
neutral	what '_s up with that ?
neutral	my situation has_been resolved .
neutral	i received a pair of defective boots and they have credited my account .
neutral	you need to put the proper phone_number on your invoices .
neutral	it makes one suspicious when you hear a companys phone has_been disconnected .
neutral	this site quote prices without tax added so that it looks cheaper_than others .
neutral	you don_'_t get the final price until the last page on the booking form which makes it difficult to compare with other_sites .
neutral	i booked my hotel with this site as it looked like it was much_cheaper but by the time i completed the booking with taxes added it was more_expensive than the same hotel on other_sites such as booking . com
neutral	on a positive_note it was simple to use and the booking process was very quick .
neutral	i '_ve just finished my first bottle of " green_coffee_beans " and have not lost any weight but now have extremely loose bowels that i can only attribute to this new product .
neutral	it has_become a concern so i stopped using them today to confirm my theory .
neutral	i will see what happens and review again .
neutral	i am frugal so i like the savings but the coffee is much_better when i purchase it from nespresso .
neutral	a lot of items out of stock .
neutral	also says free_shipping but if you don_'_t pay it takes over 0_weeks !
neutral	customer_service was great no question there .
neutral	however , the shirts and hoodies were less_than what i expected in terms of quality .
neutral	i needed thick hoodies that could provide more warmth than an average spring type hoodie and these were definitely not it .
neutral	they ' re thin and the guys don_'_t wear them .
neutral	as for the shirts , same situation on quality , my husband has already torn the pocket on one of the shirts .
neutral	the print graphics are the only_thing that has lasted .
neutral	my overall rating is purely based on the quality and durability .
neutral	it is unlikely i will be ordering in the future from rush order_tees for our company '_s needs as i feel as though $_000_+ was wasted on products that have proven to be inadequate for our needs .
neutral	good luck with other current and future clients .
neutral	i love the prices , but shipping is terribly slow .
neutral	service was speedy .
neutral	however , the entire_transaction would have been much smoother if the merchandise were described in detail such as with what systems the software could be used .
neutral	the booking went_smoothly and the reservation was fine .
neutral	the hotel is lovely .
neutral	staff is a little dicey .
neutral	we found the breakfast_buffet a bit_confusing , and apparently asked the wrong person for eggs .
neutral	the waitress got a bit hostile .
neutral	then , on checkout , we waited and waited for our_luggage to be brought to the front .
neutral	i returned to reception and asked , again , for the bags .
neutral	finally , after 00_minutes , my husband went to the front_desk and asked for the key back so he could get the luggage himself .
neutral	the manager handed him the key , thought better of it , and immediately rang for someone to get the bags .
neutral	they finally came five or ten_minutes later .
neutral	i was sent the wrong order .
neutral	after i emailed and made 0 calls ( got a recording
neutral	each time ) i was then contacted by email with an_apology and email_saying
neutral	to mail back the glasses i had ordered and my correct order would be sent me .
neutral	also they said my return postage would be refunded me , this was obviously a
neutral	mistake and mix up ; none the less an inconvenience and delay .
neutral	i am waiting
neutral	to receive my order and am in hopes it will be correct this time .
neutral	i thought she was very nice on the phone however it was hard to understand her at times .
neutral	and i thought the flight schedule seemed a bit extreme .
neutral	other than that , i hope we have a wonderful time !
neutral	thanks
neutral	experience would have been excellent if a status was emailed .
neutral	when it was shipped and estimated time of arrival .
neutral	i still have not received gift_card and it has_been approx 0 days .
neutral	00_% restocking_fee - so beware of returns .
neutral	return fees are on you as well .
neutral	merchandise is original but shipping can take up to 0_weeks .
neutral	i was not happy with the fact that i placed an order , you said it was packed and was in shipping .
neutral	then i get an_email_saying you had refunded my money for part of my order that was out of stock .
neutral	you should know what you have in stock and not allow any to be purchased when you don_'_t have any .
neutral	i would have preferred to wait for the out of stock items than to have had the refund , but no , you didn_'_t give me a choice .
neutral	being in retail , you always do all you can to please your customer .
neutral	you blew it big time .
neutral	i '_m not sure i ' d order from you again .
neutral	i used autoeurope when traveling to ireland three years_ago and had a great experience .
neutral	i used them again recently for a trip to italy .
neutral	reserving the car online was simple and their website was easy to use .
neutral	my car was ready when i went to pick it up at the pisa airport .
neutral	however , the avis agent was rude and unhelpful .
neutral	there was a language_barrier .
neutral	i had to return to the counter to be sure i had all of the insurance i needed on the car and she made a very rude comment regarding my level of intelligence .
neutral	i have never been spoken to - especially by a customer_service person - in this manner .
neutral	i will probably use autoeurope again , but was disappointed by this treatment .
neutral	different feel from my original oralb toothbrush head but alright .
neutral	my husband is less sure , thinking that he does not get such a good clean
neutral	need to enter this century and add e gift_cards , i know you lost one sale by not offering this .
neutral	another sale was lost because you can '_t order anything on saturdays because you ' re closed .
neutral	not sure why you don_'_t allow online orders during closed hours ?
neutral	the service was very good and i received my harlequin bedding very quickly however i am_currently in the process of returning as the the product did not live up to the colour shown on the photograph .
neutral	i am aware that buying online may mean the colours vary but the same image was used to show the bedding on the actually product packaging which is very misleading .
neutral	instead of white , purple and green bedding it is a dark cream ( almost gold ), light purple and a mustard colour .
neutral	i was very disappointed as i have searched for my dream bedding for my soon to be husband and i to have for our first home and had thought i ' d found it .
neutral	the search goes on .
neutral	maybe i was just tired but ... when we went to check in , our room was not right .
neutral	we had requested a king_room at the time of reservation but was given a standard double .
neutral	we asked for a late check out since it was after midnight already and was told no by the front_desk .
neutral	when we made the reservation , we asked for a room close to the elevator and on a low to mid level floor ... we were on the next to top floor and as far away from the elevator ( and vending and ice ) as we could be .
neutral	like i said maybe i was just tired but ....
neutral	dumb asses sent me the wrong color swimsuit .
neutral	you should have given me something free for your damn screw up !
neutral	bought a brilliant product just disappointed that they couldn_'_t price match the item meant i ended out paying more than i could have .
neutral	was delivered quickly and all goods in good condition .
neutral	as yet we haven_'_t installed the bathroom so yet to know if there are any faults .
neutral	the prices were what attracted us to the site but the delivery was expensive especially given the amount we had just paid .
neutral	needing to check on delivery was a real_pain and the 00_minutes wasn_'_t really enough so we didn_'_t get to open all boxes properly .
neutral	i just hope we don_'_t find a problem as you have to sign before the delivery driver leaves ( he also although not rude stood over us while we checked it over which made the process feel even more rushed )
neutral	quality doesn_'_t seem to bad what we have seen of it so we will just have to wait and see if it stands up to the websites claims .
neutral	...............
neutral	my phone_number was not ok for the first time verification .
neutral	i finally get a code by text but i have the same problem now when i try to buy a second item .
neutral	i hope i will not have this problem each time i try to purshase something .
neutral	bookit i am sure is a great company .
neutral	i had one problem .
neutral	i was not satisfied with my room .
neutral	the next time i am going to have to ask more questions about the room location .
neutral	we were at the top of the mountain .
neutral	very few people around .
neutral	far from the pool , workout room , and the other amenities the resort had to offer .
neutral	wasted weekend
neutral	their best part , i checked is daily_deals on unlocked cellphones and free_shipping on all deals .
neutral	as i guess , you need to enter some promo_code , which is mentioned on product page .
neutral	from start to finish i had a headache when i placed my very first order with petflow ...
neutral	but must give credit where credit is due ... customer_service was extremely understanding and helpful to make it right .
neutral	i was happy with your website when i purchased online .
neutral	i just wish there was more inventory in stock .
neutral	when there was a certain item i looked for that gave_me more for my money it was out of stock so i wasnt able to get everything i wanted but i did get a starter so that was ok .
neutral	service was good but when the email was received saying the cheque was in the post it took nearly 0_weeks for it to arrive , by that time i had cancelled the first cheque and another had been issued which arrived within a week .
neutral	the books , although withing their stated time of arrival , took a long time to get to my house , much longer_than amazon normally does .
neutral	one of the boks didn_'_t get to my house for 0_weeks .
neutral	i probably_won_'_t be usung bookbyte again if i was in a hurry .
neutral	your selection of products seems very limited to me .
neutral	i would like to see a bigger variety .
neutral	good range of clothes , but are quite expensive and sometimes the measurements are wrong .
neutral	i '_m sorry to say this , as san_francisco herbs has_been supplying me and my family with excellent herbs for decades .
neutral	but this time i ordered some fragrance oils , chasing that ever elusive source of some simple floral scent oils .
neutral	what i got was classic dryer sheet cheap scent that stays on your skin even after you wash it ten times .
neutral	i hate dryer sheet scent , and now need to throw these brand_new fragrance oils in the trash to get_rid of that offensive lingering odor .
neutral	thanks for nothing .
neutral	i won_'_t buy your herbs anymore because this fake smell just ticks me off !
neutral	there is no_doubt appliances on line are competitively_priced , however don_'_t be misled with promises of vouchers .
neutral	i bought a fridge_freezer which was supposed to come with which vouchers for iceland .
neutral	the appliance has_been with me 0 months , no vouchers , have e_mailed and had no reply .
neutral	hi , envelopes we just as i expected , so web_site is good at description .
neutral	sadly the packaging was not quite so good and the sides of the large christmas envelopes are slightly_bent .
neutral	ok as these are for my teenage grandsons and they are more interested in the money inside .
neutral	but it would have been a shame if the use had been more important .
neutral	i think the packaging had ' sliped ' somehow - worth thinking about for the future .
neutral	i used the calendar to book my hotel stay .
neutral	somehow i ended_up booked in the wrong month .
neutral	not sure when or how it happened , but my reservation ended_up being in march when it should have been in february .
neutral	the person i had to deal with to fix the situation from the hotel when i went to check in spoke broken english and the phone connection was terrible .
neutral	it took the woman at the hotel and me an_hour to fix the situation and the woman on the phone was not very helpful .
neutral	i ended_up getting charged $_00 for some fee , i still_haven_'_t been able to find out what that was for . the hotel itself was great .
neutral	clean and the staff was excellent .
neutral	i would recommend the hotel to anyone .
neutral	i have no_idea when the rest of my order will get to me .
neutral	i wish i would have been given some_sort of idea what to expect .
neutral	i asked the recipients to send me a photo of their gift that they were very happy with .
neutral	however compared to the photo on your website ( i realise it cannot be an exact replica ) and the flowers sent i really thought it was very small for the money paid .
neutral	if that was a large_selection i dread to think what a small one would have looked like .
neutral	please package the dog_treats in bubble_wrap or crushed paper so that the canned_dog_food doesn_'_t crush the dog_treats .
neutral	i spend extra money to buy natural treats with no preservatives or other harmful ingredients and you put them in the box next to the canned_dog_food .
neutral	whenever the shipper picks_up the box and throws it down , the dog_treats get crushed .
neutral	three bags of dog_treats recently arrived and there is not one whole dog treat in any of the bags !!
neutral	this defeats the whole purpose for using petflow , as i have to go out to the store to repurchase the items .
neutral	otherwise i think your service is awesome , but please think about the packaging of items prior to shipment .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	i would love
neutral	to review your service but the parts i ordered came damaged and had to be refused .
neutral	when i spoke to the shipping claims agent they tell me it could take 00 to 000 days to settle my claim .
neutral	not very good news since my vehicle is sitting in the garage , undriveable , waiting for the parts i trustingly ordered from your company .
neutral	they close to days got wait_till tuesday to get inform about location and rates .... not good
neutral	clothes came in about a week , very nice but two sizes too small !
neutral	the sizes run small so u have to order your clothes 0 sizes bigger
neutral	i don_'_t like it when they make u write something more then a few words
neutral	i had what started out as a really bad_experience with this company recently .
neutral	i had ordered 0 new phones and was going to switch providers and keep my old cell_phone numbers ( this is called " porting ").
neutral	my phone_number was ported before i actually received my new phones though , leaving me without service for several days .
neutral	i knew i was going to be out of town and i wasn_'_t concerned with getting my phones quickly and had planned to activate them when i got back in town so i didn_'_t choose a fast shipping option .
neutral	but your old service gets cut_off when they port your number and even_though my new provider had me all set_up , i had not received my new phones yet .
neutral	therefore i could not use my old phone and had no phone service .
neutral	i called customer_service to try and resolve this situation and had a bad_experience with that as well .
neutral	the guy kept telling_me that i chose the wrong shipping option when the problem was really that my number was ported before i received the phone and activated it .
neutral	i '_m not sure if this was a fluke or what .
neutral	however , i was contacted within 00_hours of placing a complaint by a manager and the coo and they apologized and next_day aired me my phones and 0 free accessories .
neutral	i still had to go without a phone for 0 days but they really stepped up to correct the situation !
neutral	and i felt_like they were really concerned_about resolving everything so that i was happy .
neutral	so , at the end of the day , even_though i didn_'_t have the best experience in the beginning , they did work hard to resolve it and make it right .
neutral	i placed a order for three shoes but one was not in stock i didnt know until i got an_email .
neutral	i was kinda upset because the size was listed as available so i was not happy at all .
neutral	i shop online all the time it should not show available if it is not .
neutral	then the representative said she wasnt_sure if you all would get them in then said " probably not ".
neutral	the parts came in somewhat of a timely_manner , but one part was broken and needs to be replaced .
neutral	there is no phone_number to be able to talk to anyone and that is very frustrating !!!
neutral	everything is done via_email , but when you need answers there needs to be a phone_number to speak with someone .
neutral	the phone_number on the invoice is a shipping distribution_center that tells you to contact the company .
neutral	the prices are great , but we didn_'_t expect all this when we are trying to get it replaced .
neutral	disappointed to say the least .
neutral	bought an office telephone ( a bt converse ) and was unable to use it as it had the british phone connection at the end of the wire .
neutral	would it not be a good idea to sell irish adaptor with british phone ?
neutral	i decided to shop with bestbuy . com for cyber_monday because they had a few really good deals .
neutral	i opted to do in store pickup because i thought it would be easy .
neutral	the ordering itself was simple .
neutral	however , i did not get a confirmation_email or even a pick_up email .
neutral	i called the store later in the day to find out about the order and i was put on hold for 00_minutes .
neutral	when i got to the store it was nothing but issues and annoyances .
neutral	in the end i got the items at a really great deal ( half the price of amazon which is saying something ) so i guess it wasn_'_t a total loss .
neutral	however , i have done site to store with several other stores and never had this many issues .
neutral	hi , if someone ask me to say something good about this website , i '_m going to say that i really love the way they deliver things .
neutral	they have been honest , like if they say they going to make it in five days and that will happen .
neutral	i really appreciate that .
neutral	they don_'_t really have as many thing as i want to buy but at_least i enjoy_shopping here .
neutral	i have been shopping here once but i feel_comfortable to shop_here .
neutral	they get a cheap shipping , that is soo great ,,,.
neutral	anyway , they are the best !!
neutral	<_0
neutral	i enjoy ordering from you guys , in the past my order would get here in three_days .
neutral	these last two times the order has taken about 0 days and still_waiting on an order that i placed 0 days ago .
neutral	shipping rates are high , coupons would be good to lighten the fees
neutral	it was very easy to book but you have to really pay_attention to dates .
neutral	i was trying to book a 0 day stay on a particular weekend and didn_'_t realize that a different date had come up and for one night only .
neutral	when i verified with the hotel about the size of bed , they told me about the mistake and booked the correct dates .
neutral	my products were okay .
neutral	i didn_'_t like the fact that my shoes didn_'_t come in a box .
neutral	my black jeans were not jeans they were legging material .
neutral	my legging has thread hanging from the zipper .
neutral	love the idea of using your site to get the best price and it '_s easy to use so will_definitely come again but we were not impressed with the end supplier who delivered the oil .
neutral	we would like the option to opt_out of certain supplier deliveries .
neutral	i '_ve purchased from figleaves off and on for many years .
neutral	i am an unusual size and have been very happy with the selection of lingerie and swim_suits .
neutral	unfortunately , you cannot tell what the customs_fees will be upfront , and i received a bill for $_00 ( us ) just for the customs_fees - 00_% more to the cost of my order .
neutral	then , i received a foreign use charge from my credit_card company on top of that !
neutral	the first order arrived just fine .
neutral	the second order was placed on 00 dec 0000 and arrived on 00 jan_0000 !!
neutral	i contacted figleaves by email several_times and they kept putting me off , suggesting i hadn_'_t been home to receive the package ( i work from home ) and then just asking me to wait and wait more .
neutral	i did have to return a few items from the first shipment ( insured ).
neutral	it '_s been a week and a half and i have not received a refund yet .
neutral	the stethoscope arrived and the box was opened only to view the product .
neutral	the product was not touched or taken out of the box until it was opened as a xmas gift .
neutral	it was found that one of the pieces was defective .
neutral	your customer_service person told her to basically try to fix it herself or bring it to a medical_supply_store to fix .
neutral	the fact remains that the product was not in new condition and should have been replaced .
neutral	the big_bus_tour was very enjoyable but was diminished due to the radio thing you put your earphones into not working .
neutral	there were 0 of us travelling together and the very best we could do was 0 of us being_able to hear the tour_guide at any one time .
neutral	i ordered a branded eyeglasses .
neutral	i read the product desciption clearly that it comes with an original case ( and i do value an original blue case ), but it did not .
neutral	the on - line customer_service was prompt , and she told me that all clearance items may be due to open box sale , customer returns , " missing cases " and closeouts .
neutral	in that case , they should put " missing case " instead of " this item comes with an original case , cloth and certificate of authenticity where appropriate ."
neutral	she said i can return it but i have to pay 00_% restocking_fee and shipping cost .
neutral	i regret buying it but i have concern on the returning cost .
neutral	my advise to you : do ask more before you order
neutral	competitive price and fast delivery though .
neutral	i am disappointed that i can not supply my aarp , aaa or senior status for discounts when booking .
neutral	i really liked travelocity until i bought my parents a gift_card .
neutral	it is super restrictive !
neutral	you can '_t even book a flight with it and to redeem it you have to go to a website that is really not user_friendly .
neutral	and the hotels offered there are also restricted .
neutral	i paid cash for it and i just feel_like i should be able to use it like cash and it '_s not like that at all !
neutral	to the point where i just bought it back from my parents .
neutral	the worst !!
neutral	!
neutral	until then i really liked using travelocity .
neutral	their normal website is very user_friendly and offers many options for hotel , flight and rentals .
neutral	airline was late ( us air ) going in and coming out .
neutral	but the hotel and staff were great .
neutral	a true taste of nyc .
neutral	have been pleased with some of my orders but not others , i cannot_fault the service you offer especially with free returns , i would recommend your company to friends
neutral	i received my pkg quite fast .
neutral	i was disappointed to find one of the dog collar_lights ( clip on ) didn_'_t work .
neutral	i was glad i ordered light collars and clip on lights .
neutral	the order arrived , was packed well , and was well priced .
neutral	however , when i purchased it was indicated that the items would be shipped the week of july 0 .
neutral	imagine how pleased i was to receive shipping notification that my package was shipped on july 0 , and would be arriving to me on july 00 .
neutral	now , i have trouble getting my packages from my apartment office , so i left work early on the 00th to meet the ups driver .
neutral	except , no delivery driver on the 00th .
neutral	i checked the tracking again , and this time it showed that no , the items didn_'_t ship until the 00th , and would be arriving on the 00th .
neutral	well , i couldn_'_t take another day off of work , so my cats ' food sat in the apartment office for two_days before i could get there while they were open .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t have minded the items being shipped on the 00th , i just don_'_t like to be told one thong , and then have another happen .
neutral	i had purchased seat selection and when i had received my tickets the seats i had bought were not marked on my tickets .
neutral	well_packaged to avoid_damage with everything included as specified .
neutral	just disappointing that despite extra carriage charge for next_day delivery , the product didn_'_t arrive on time .
neutral	nice cards but when i placed a large order they banged me with a huge shipping even_though every card was coming to my house .
neutral	when they spotted one picture that they deemed unacceptable they cancelled the whole order and not just the one .
neutral	frustrating .
neutral	customer_service told me if i did the shipping wrong i could cancel the whole order again and start again ...
neutral	offered me no aid nor compassion nor spirit .
neutral	i '_ve had a few past troubles with the colour being different then on screen or the product description is inaccurate but overall the products are at a goo price and the delivery is very quick
neutral	wish they had more translated visual novels .
neutral	along with all of the other american flight carriers , delta has gone to hell in a hand - basket in the past decade .
neutral	i purchased an international ticket on delta in april leaving in december .
neutral	they changed my flight details at_least four times between april and december .
neutral	now i was flying through a different city and arriving at a different time .
neutral	i said , " hey , if delta can change my ticket without cost , so can i ."
neutral	i called delta and had them change the details of my ticket - without the usual $_000 charge .
neutral	also , when i bought my ticket , they swore up and down there would be no international transaction fee .
neutral	guess what - i was hit with a $_00 international transaction / currency_exchange fee !
neutral	i called delta and received a $_00 credit_towards my next flight with them .
neutral	i order once a month and when it '_s not complete , it messes my whole month up !
neutral	i booked a room yesterday with olotels . com before doing my research .
neutral	after_reading so many negative_reviews about this company online , i am now concerned_about my reservation that was just made .
neutral	as of now , i have not received an e_- mail with my booking voucher and confirmation .
neutral	the site explains that i should receive this in 0hrs max .
neutral	but i have received nothing .. ( and believe me , i have checked my junk / spam ).
neutral	after reaching out to the olotels . com by e_- mail , i have still had no reply from a team representative regarding this matter .
neutral	fyi - the site makes it very difficult to find a contact number and print off anything from the booking .
neutral	i am quite disappointed with my experience so_far and suggest that they update their website immediately .
neutral	i have also tried to call the number i did find online , but it did not work .
neutral	since i work with companies in china / hk for a living , i know how to dial out the country code properly .
neutral	therefore , i do not believe that i made a mistake when making the initial call .
neutral	luckily my office has an office in guangzhou china .
neutral	if i do not get feedback by tomorrow , i will have one of our representatives call on behalf on me since they are located in hong_kong .
neutral	if someone from olotels team reads this , can you please e_- mail me at both e_- mail addresses so that i can provide my booking information for further review .
neutral	i would like my voucher to be sent and have a few questions_regarding your policy '_s .
neutral	natashalynn . sa @_gmail . com
neutral	hawaiian_ginger00 @_hotmail . com ( this e_- mail used for booking !)
neutral	thank_you ,

neutral	i ordered three items from boohoo , two of the same dress but different_sizes and a playsuit .
neutral	none of the items fitted correctly , something which ive found an_issue with boohoo before but am able to work around because i do like the styles they offer .
neutral	returned the items the day after recieving them .
neutral	has taken over 00 days for me to get my refund back , i emailed and was told it took up to 00 days to process , fine i suppose , but money is tight next christmas and when i have returned items before my money has_been refunded back pretty_much immediately .
neutral	anyway , i would use boohoo again , but i think that i waited so long before i got my money it was pretty annoying .
neutral	maybe i bought the wrong kind even_though it said zynga on it , itried it , the code didn_'_t work . probably_won_'_t do it again . sorry !
neutral	the cost of selling with all the fees ,, is just getting a bit overwhelming
neutral	i could not get into my account to view my itinerary .
neutral	i spent over an_hour on the phone with different representatives .
neutral	they would change my password and tell me i could log_into my account but it never worked .
neutral	at_least i was still able to take the trip and it was a deal which i am grateful for !
neutral	good service , as packages made in home in the same condition however missed the collection from pick_up company even_though i sat in all day and the buzzer never rang to the flat and reorganisation was difficult due to end of term university arrangements .
neutral	phone_number should be passed on to the delivery company in future to avoid such problems .
neutral	my order was supposed to be the grille and " assembly ".
neutral	was very happy that the grille itself was exactly_what i was hoping for but upset that the bolts were not included .
neutral	i guess i thought that was part of the assembly ...........
neutral	product was great .
neutral	but very slow shipping .
neutral	i absolutely love the clothes although some clothes are not true to size .
neutral	delivery is extremely bad - standard delivery is 0 days which in my opinion always results in 0 and you have to pay for that where as other_companies offer that free if charge and deliver faster .
neutral	this always makes me go to other_sites and not shop on here as much as i ' d like to .
neutral	i ordered two books on bookbyte ; one was rented and the other purchased .
neutral	i paid_extra shipping for both books , in order for it to come 0 - 0 days .
neutral	0 days passed and no books .
neutral	i e_- mailed them and , they replied a day later .
neutral	for the rented book , they told me that , at the time i ordered it , they were out - of - stock .
neutral	immediately , my thought was : " why wouldn_'_t they tell me that at the time of order ?
neutral	instead , i had to e_- mail them in order for them to have told me ."
neutral	this annoyed me , as i needed the book immediately .
neutral	nevertheless , they gave_me a full_refund for the rented book .
neutral	that was good .
neutral	however , the other book i purchased .
neutral	that was a bad order .
neutral	i e_- mailed them 0 days after i ordered it , and they answered the next_day .
neutral	they said i had paid for shipping of 0 - 0 days , when the receipt clearly said 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i got the book exactly 0 days after the time of order . however , i checked the tracking_number they had given me , and it turns_out that they had not shipped the book until i had e_- mailed them , one day before the book came .
neutral	this told me that they had made a huge mistake on my order and , in order to cover it , they lied .
neutral	so , i asked for a full_refund on the shipping cost .
neutral	they didn_'_t want it to give it to me , until i said i would fight for it .
neutral	finally , they said they would refund about half the amount i paid for shipping .
neutral	i agreed , and kept the book .
neutral	that was good and now i '_m satisfied .
neutral	overall , the experience was so - so .
neutral	it could have been better if they had been diligent in fulfilling the order exactly as it was and on - time .
neutral	service was very good but unfortunately the product had a tear !
neutral	will still use then again
neutral	hope this keeps my id safe
neutral	definitely suggest the postcard save the date option !
neutral	would have like to have more options to make the " personalized " card more personal as text was limited to just one font , size , and color .
neutral	any other text would have been an_additional_cost .
neutral	my school needed extra algebra 0 books .
neutral	i purchased as many as i could , for the lowest_prices i could find .
neutral	i bought 0 from bookbyte .
neutral	i was warned that they were not in great shape , but i didn_'_t expect them to be as bad as they were .
neutral	most needed to be rebound and were trashed .
neutral	i thought that there would be a large supply of algebra books that were that old , and that i would receive books comparable to the used ones we presently have at school .
neutral	we will keep them because we will get new textbooks in 0 years .
neutral	not impressed with the plants once they arrived .
neutral	the prices were also too high once we compared them to our local plant house .
neutral	we will not order from this company any more .
neutral	great prices but out of my last 0 orders ... there always something that doesnt ship then i got to email them to get my refund ... shipping is super high compared to other_sites
neutral	good company with a wide_variety of goods .
neutral	had to send my purchase back as it was to large this was at a cost to me of £_00 .
neutral	this has put me of shopping with you again as there are other good company '_s out there who offer free delivery and returns .
neutral	sadly i chose another company to purchase the item i had from you , as sometimes you do have to return items because of the fit .
neutral	being careful is always good , but holding the order waiting for the ve to get back to you deserves a phone_call to the pet_owner .
neutral	in our case we were very short on food and hoping shipment would be prompt .
neutral	we ended_up bothering the vet yet again to ask if there was a substitute food .
neutral	we paid more for the substitute food than what we ordered .
neutral	make_sure you only work with the manager and not the inept weekend staff .
neutral	also be prepared to pay a lot more for your unit than planned in fees and unwanted insurance .
neutral	i paid for next_day delivery but received my order 0 days after i ordered it .
neutral	then when i opened my parcel and tried on the items i had bought .... well , i spent all my birthday money on the order , i got 0 tops and 0 pairs of leggings .
neutral	one pair of leggings is ripped all down the bum , the other pair of leggings fit_perfectly , one top is loose so that one fits but one is the same size as the loose one but it '_s far too tight , and the other top is size 00 but looks like its supposed to fit a toddler .
neutral	it '_s already difficult to find clothing to fit me because i have a large chest , but these clothes are beyond a joke , i got the biggest size which was 00 " chest and one was too loose , one too tight and one won_'_t even go over my head .
neutral	i '_m going to order some dresses and shoes and hope that these are better quality .
neutral	i admit i opted for smartbuyglasses for 0 reasons .
neutral	firstly was the cost which was competetive , and scondly as the pair i wanted were marked on the site as available for fast delivery which was what i needed as i was going on holiday .
neutral	i read their_promises on delivery times carefully to see if it would arrive in time .
neutral	only after i paid did i get an_email to say they were waiting for stock .
neutral	so despite what the site had said when i ordered the raybans that they were available for fast delivery , this proved to be incorrect .
neutral	when i replied to their email they did offer me a different pair at a reduced price , but i did not take them up on the offer as i wanted what i had originally ordered .
neutral	i did get my glasses just in time , and they are the real product and i am very happy with them .
neutral	but if it is important that you get your glasses quicly , do not trust the fast delivery claim as it may not be accurate .
neutral	clearly i had made a typo in the area code of my phone_number but the delivery company really didn_'_t try to find me and it would not have been hard .
neutral	it does seem to be somewhat more difficult to get things delivered to a rural address .
neutral	i wish they would have notified me that one of the movies was not being shipped , it creates a slight mistrust to wait 00 days to find out your not getting all your order
neutral	dr mercola highly_recommended this product .
neutral	it just seemed too expensive for my budget .
neutral	very happy with the parts and their delivery , not so pleased with the help i requested !
neutral	i asked a basic question about did gaskets come with the water_pump .
neutral	partsgeek response was what i expected ," they would research the question and someone would be in contact with me with an answer ".
neutral	i have received and installed the water_pump and still have not received and answer to the my question !
neutral	i can '_t give some of these as presents as the packaging is damaged .
neutral	according to the manager , the delay was due to having only one mechanic show up for work .
neutral	are the working conditions bad ?
neutral	or does mavis need more mechanics ?
neutral	i could tell that the manager was frustrated and he did his best to satisfy me .
neutral	my family has_been going to mavis for twenty - two years .
neutral	recently , my dad has noticed that the service has_been declining .
neutral	wake_up mavis !
neutral	you are going to lose a good customer if you do not get your act_together .
neutral	i had an average experience this past weekend .
neutral	when i arrived , i felt that i was being spoken to like they were drill sargents .
neutral	i told them that it was my first time using this parking company but they didn_'_t seem to change their attitudes knowing that i wasn_'_t used to their operations .
neutral	the man that helped_me inside the office was very mind and helpful with answering_questions and showing me what i had to do upon_arrival .
neutral	although the process was convenient , i was a little troubled with how neurotic the drivers were on the roads .
neutral	they were very aggressive drivers and i was uncomfortable being in a busload of travelers having to hold on to the seat in front of me to stop myself from falling over .
neutral	i purchased the parking voucher through groupon , and had i not done so , i probably_wouldn_'_t have parked there , but i was able to park for 0 days for only $_00 plus taxes and fees .
neutral	that being said , if the time comes where i '_ll need to use their services , i may .
neutral	but only if i would be able to use the groupon prices .
neutral	the quality of my dvds was just fine , but i wouldn_'_t use the free mailing offer again .
neutral	it took way too long to receive them .
neutral	but they haven_'_t been delivered yet , so don_'_t know if the flowers will be nice !
neutral	!.
neutral	thought i had brilliant idea not heard off emma_bridgewater glass before so looked on line and thought brilliant present for friend forty birthday came quickly but size really upset at size
neutral	had trouble getting my card cleared to make the payment .
neutral	had to phone them to sort it .
neutral	when the system finally let_me enter the details i got a message that my recipient '_s name was too long !
neutral	i had to figure_out what to do - no hints from the software .
neutral	had to back arrow several screens to get back to the recipient '_s details and fix it then had to re - enter all delivery instructions and - for the 0th time - re - enter my card details .
neutral	tedious , time_consuming and unnecessary - proper software needed !
neutral	young_lady on the phone sorted card problem quickly .
neutral	i wait to see if delivery part goes_smoothly .
neutral	i love that you will deliver heavy products like litter and dog_food at reasonable delivery and product prices !!
neutral	no one else does that and i hate lugging that stuff home !
neutral	two problems so_far though ... when the litter arrived , it was packaged inside of bigger boxes ( ordered four boxes , came in two_sets of two ) and the bigger boxes were not full so they got smashed in the shipping .
neutral	that in turn crushed the litter box ( ever clean ) and opened the box just enough for litter to leak out .
neutral	usable but messy .
neutral	why not offer these in their original case pack so that i could order them that way and you won_'_t have to repack ?
neutral	secondly , i sent a note to customer_service asking about how i could still use my groupon ( where i learned about you ) b /_c i anxiously ordered this litter before i had the groupon , figuring i could use it the next_day ( had to wait one day to use for some_reason ) on some dog_food .
neutral	the groupon was limited to " new " customers which i was no_longer since i placed that first order on day 0 ... i got a response saying that if i gave them the groupon code , they would credit my account on my next order .
neutral	great !
neutral	problem is that i haven_'_t heard_anything back , though i '_ve written to let them know that no credit has appeared and asked what should i do .
neutral	it '_s been several days now .
neutral	i hope you resolve these sorts of problems -- i signed_up as an ambassador and already have two new customers there for you .
neutral	i need this service , and i know others do , too .
neutral	thanks for asking !

neutral	i paid for express shipping but i i got it about 0 to 0 days_later .
neutral	i was disappointed .
neutral	i liked the price for rental .
neutral	das letzte kleid war mit_dem loch .
neutral	es_ist schrecklich !
neutral	they are now selling so many things other than books , via other sellers around the world like ebay , which is not good and causing problems .
neutral	the toy i ordered in the us site , shipped by a seller from the uk , looks different than the photo being shown .
neutral	i am very disappointed .
neutral	i order from you often , and i love everything i receive .
neutral	i just wish you shipped to military over_seas .
neutral	i pay double shipping because i have it sent to my family , then pay them to send it to my fpo ap box .
neutral	it was fairly slow to be dispatched .
neutral	communication not great .
neutral	however i had the absolute_worst postal experience dealing_with fedex .
neutral	i was supposed to have it delivered for christmas_eve and at 0 . 00pm was told if i wanted it that day i need to come and pick it up myself by 0pm as drivers were busy .
neutral	when arriving i noticed all those in my area had been told to do the same .
neutral	disgusting .
neutral	i note that this was out of vision_direct '_s control but perhaps they may change services .
neutral	very happy with actual product .
neutral	i just placed my first order with you and when i went to my email for confirmation of order i got a warning that you failed some fraud detection .
neutral	i am very concerned as i put my card info out there .
neutral	send me a email concerning this .
neutral	they were nice lights but shame all didn_'_t work
neutral	the actual buying experience was excellent , however , after_reading the exceptions on the mfg .
neutral	warranty , we were rather surprised that one of the warranty exceptions
neutral	was that it not be bought on the internet .
neutral	we did go_ahead and register each of the units , to see if mfr .
neutral	would still cover .
neutral	we would suggest that this type of info .
neutral	should be available when you place the units for sale .
neutral	thank_you ,
neutral	john & shirley barnett
neutral	bought a mirrored bathroom_cabinet .
neutral	on arrival though well_packaged the product was of poor quality , basically in the manufacture .
neutral	screw_holes only partly covered .
neutral	screw caps cross threaded that kind of thing .
neutral	the order arrived very slowly
neutral	i am a ltp club memeber and the last two times i had to wait over 00_minutes to be picked_up .
neutral	both_times i had to call a second time and tell them i was still_waiting .
neutral	i saw every other parking service vans stop and many of them multiple_times , while i stood_out in the freezing_cold waiting .
neutral	what is the point of being a member with quick exit if i have to wait forever to be picked_up ?
neutral	i own 0 cats , 0 dogs , 0 large fish tanks , and one amazon parrot , so most of my pet_supplies are purchased online .
neutral	this was my first purchase with pet_flow , and i have mixed feelings .
neutral	the products from this order was mostly for my dogs , and they loved everything i got them .
neutral	i received my order within 0 days of placing the order !
neutral	that was fantastic !!!
neutral	the only_complaint i have with this company is with their website and the ordering process .
neutral	it took almost two hours to get my order placed !
neutral	you have to scroll and choose your products .
neutral	once you choose the product and add it to your cart , it then takes you back to the very beginning .
neutral	even if you had gone_through 0 pages to get one item , you now have to start everything over .
neutral	my total was about $_00 , and it would have been much larger , but once i took the time to select my items , when i tried to check out , my cart was empty !
neutral	so now i have to start all over !
neutral	ridiculous !!!
neutral	i '_m not sure if i will purchase from them again , but if i do , i '_ll have to save a 0 hour block of time in which to do it .
neutral	took time to collect the car - called a good 00mins in advance and was waiting at_least 00_mins for someone to arrive ( not good when there '_s traffic wardens wandering_around !)
neutral	on return arrival phoned after luggage received was adviced would take 00_mins had to call again after half an_hour as car still not returned ( we returned at 0 in the morning - so not the busiest of times !!)
neutral	was told should be there within 0 / 0 mins but waited a further 00 !
neutral	both agents really could have been anyone as they did not have any identification to who they were / what company they were from !
neutral	however the car was returned as i had left it and was reasonable for the price .
neutral	service was good except for the fact that i was talked to like i didn_'_t know anything .
neutral	and the fact that they took my custom valve stem covers off and didn_'_t put them back on probably threw them alway
neutral	ons weekendje londen was een ervaring , maar wel erg vermoeiend .
neutral	de heen - en terugreis duurde wel heel_erg lang en_het afscheidsdiner had zeker een uur korter gemogen .
neutral	ook_de in onze ogen te strakke tijdsplanning voor_de dagen in londen had flexibeler gekund .
neutral	een half uurtje meer speling voor_het ontbijt was niet erg geweest .
neutral	als laatste minpuntje : een hotel iets dichter bij_het centrum zou zeer gewaardeerd worden door menigeen .
neutral	grote respect voor_de chauffeuse en_de manier waarop zij ons door het zeer drukke londen reed !
neutral	de gids ( annemarie ) voor_de tour was in onze ogen een groot succes .
neutral	met veel enthousiasme en humor vertelde zij over het heden en verleden van_de stad en_het land .
neutral	veel plezier aan beleefd .
neutral	hello ,
neutral	wish you had informed me that my order was a partial shipment .
neutral	three day shipping turned into four days and five days respectively .
neutral	i had my mechanic lined_up but had to cancel my appt because only half of my order was shipped .
neutral	traffic to the airport delayed me by an_hour , meaning i had only around 00_mins to check into my flight , as did many other people arriving at the same time ( aimed for 0 . 00 , got there 0 . 00 ).
neutral	at the bus_stop there is no_indication as to how frequent the buses are or how long it will take to get from the car_park to the terminal .
neutral	after waiting around 00mins at the bus_stop we decided to walk .
neutral	a bus turned_up as we were just leaving the car_park , the driver was very helpful , said it would indeed be quicker to walk ( he was estimating an_hour to get to the terminal because of traffic ) and told us rough directions to get to the terminals .
neutral	however , the car_park was very convenient , only a 00 - 00min walk from terminal 0 and not much further to terminals 0 and 0 .
neutral	booking online saved a fair amount of money compared to turning up on the day , but next time i '_ll be taking the train .
neutral	the train will not only be cheaper but will be much less_stressful .
neutral	your web_site did not say the card had to be processed before it would take two to five " business " days for the card to be delivered .
neutral	i regret paying the extra money for what i thought would be a quick delivery .
neutral	the e_- mail saying the order had been received did infer a processing time would occur .
neutral	i did call about this .
neutral	i will never have a special card made again .
neutral	i liked the swimsuit i purchased , and i liked the price .
neutral	however , once i made the purchase , i started getting multiple_emails every day .
neutral	this was excessive and i called to ask if there was a way to limit the emails to one a week , and i was told that there was nothing they could do about it .
neutral	my solution was to stop all emails from metroswimshop .
neutral	the service from this store was good , the delivery of the item was very quick , however , due to plumber issues we delayed putting up the new shower screen for a few_weeks .
neutral	when i did look at it in detail i noticed it was badly_damaged at one end .
neutral	i contacted them and they got back to me straight_away but after a week of two - ing and fro - ing they said it couldn_'_t be replaced as it was over the 00day refund time by 0 days .
neutral	my own fault , but it was only four days and i wasn_'_t trying to get my money back , just wanted an un damaged item !
neutral	not happy with this lack of understanding .
neutral	i have a huge dog , and buy his food which comes in 00lb_bags .
neutral	i have used petflow a couple of times before this and have frequently found that his food arrives way before time , and i have the issue of how and where to store it .
neutral	other issues have been with pet treats that have been mouldy or arrived in crumb form .
neutral	i love the concept , but have had several instances of disappointment with the reality of the service provided .
neutral	i have only had 0 quotes , not enough to form an opinion .
neutral	the bus_tour was fine .
neutral	we were able to see london and the earphones gave_us all the information we needed .
neutral	i really_enjoyed the boat_trip .
neutral	the tour_guide was very amusing and made it interesting .
neutral	my only_complaint was when we were looking for the bus_stop when we first arrived we were given wrong directions by your employees .
neutral	we walked to a stop and it wasn_'_t in use then they wanted us to walk to covent_garden stop , when we checked with the big_bus company they finally sent us to embankment stop .
neutral	so we lost an_hour looking for a bus_stop .
neutral	shoes were very cute but a size too small .
neutral	i don_'_t understand_why .
neutral	must be made small .
neutral	customer_service is superb , but when i returned a defective , non_- working circuit_board i was told i may get but a fraction of the original cost back .
neutral	i am not too happy about that .
neutral	if i was your company .
neutral	i would get_rid of fed_ex for shipping , they close down shipping goods at a drop of a hat !!!
neutral	you would be better off with ups or usps .
neutral	i think it is a great idea , and the price is better_than the pet_store .
neutral	my concern is that , until there are many users , the dog_food will be sitting on the shelves .
neutral	it has_been my experience in the past that food vendors who do not sell a lot of my brand ( wellness ) have food that is old , and gives my sensitive - stomached dog diarrhea .
neutral	we received our first delivery 0_weeks_ago , and he has had several bouts with the poops .
neutral	i took him to the vet and his temp is good and he is worm - free .
neutral	we just received our second delivery , so hopefully this will not be a problem with this bag , otherwise we will cancel our order with you and go back to purchasing from the pet_store .
neutral	i would recommend but i would say just beware as our first driver who picked us up from faro airport thought he was a formula one driver , he liked to drive as close as he possibly could to any other car , constantly bibbed any car that he thought was driving to slow .
neutral	i got to my hotel in around 00 - 00_minutes .
neutral	my return_journey was so much more pleasant driver was a few_minutes early also picked_up another couple had a nice drive back to the airport which took around 00_minutes .
neutral	very careful driver .
neutral	but shipping options are disappointing .
neutral	i like to send seamless gift_cards as gifts to new parents but unless i pay over $_00 for shipping it does not arrive to them for over a week .
neutral	i love the stethoscope and how well it works .
neutral	however , i ordered the ocean blue which looks sort of like a pearly blue in the picture on your website and its actually more of a really dull baby blue .
neutral	got what i ordered quickly , but it was very poorly packaged and arrived partially opened with some damage to the contents .
neutral	it was fast and very easy .
neutral	lots of products to choose from .
neutral	i received my part fairly quick .
neutral	i would definitely order from them again .
neutral	on our visit to dreams a lovely young_man served_us .
neutral	he has very good customer skills and was extremely polite and helpful .
neutral	unlike his manager .
neutral	i was told to come_back to the store on tuesday to pick_up my free pillows as they were out of stock when i purchased my bed .
neutral	i saw the manager when i arrived at the store and was trying to speak to him about the pillows but he was more interested in his food that his college had just brought for him .... and i was almost dismissed with a wave of the hand as the pillows were not in stock .... still .
neutral	i will phone you when they are in . i had no phone_call so on my 0rd visit to the store and they were still unavailable the manager said i will deliver them for me personally on monday .
neutral	being as he never even asked my mane and address i wondered how he was going to do this !!!!!!!
neutral	anyway i phoned the store on the wednesday and the young_man that served me originally delivered them to my home address .
neutral	i think the manager of this store needs to go on a customer care course ..... or take_lessons from his staff
neutral	i bought 0 ford_fusion tail_lights .
neutral	the driver_side fit perfect !
neutral	the right one has a gap in it .
neutral	it was $_00 a peice when ford factory charged $_000 .
neutral	you save a little money but it doesn_'_t fit_perfectly .
neutral	just a heads up .
neutral	looks just like the old one and a comparible quality .
neutral	this is a great company with a large_selection of items .
neutral	they almost always have what i need at some of the lowest_prices .
neutral	the only problem that i '_ve had with them is their shipping - it '_s ridiculously slow .
neutral	it '_s not just the shipping method that they use - it '_s how long they take to ship .
neutral	i just placed an order today .
neutral	i '_m really hoping that they redeem themselves .
neutral	the prices are worth it , if you ' re not in a bind time - wise .
neutral	the car was excellent -- we rented for two_weeks -- and the price reasonable .
neutral	pickup at the rr station worked very well .
neutral	however , return was a nightmare !
neutral	the street location was unmarked and a very difficult turning from the rr station .
neutral	we went into several parking lots first and then had to go beyond the street and make a difficult turn_around .
neutral	once we had made the correct street entry , it was extremely difficult to find the location to deliver the car .
neutral	it was lucky we had dropped our disabled passenger and luggage to the station first , because there was no service to deliver us back to the station .
neutral	i would recommend that initial return be at the rr station ( with staff there to assist with return to the other location , if necessary ).
neutral	when i received my 0 gallon plants they were very nice in good condition .
neutral	however i paid $_00 a piece and after purchasing found larger nice plants at home_depot and walmart for half the price !!
neutral	mind you the plants i purchased were half off should have been like $&( just too expensive for nothing more than i got .
neutral	container 0 gallon plant size gallon or less
neutral	i sent a mpg and yes approved the design but the quality really wasn_'_t that great
neutral	fast delivery and item as_described but it was a good job it wasn_'_t a gift as the packaging was ripped and broken .
neutral	psrking was great bit booked a valet however got a phone_call 0 mins b0 collecting the car to say the valet wouldn_'_t be finished for 0 hours !!!
neutral	so had to canx this part .
neutral	no nice to come home to a dirty car when expecting a nice clean one !
neutral	overall , the glasses i purchased from global_eyeglasses were great .
neutral	they were all good quality .
neutral	however , i had to return a pair because they were too small even_though the website had said they would fit .
neutral	( the website allows you to input your current measurements to see what will fit .)
neutral	i had to email the company to get the return info too because their form online didn_'_t work at all .
neutral	anyway , i also ordered a pair of prescription_sunglasses .
neutral	now that i have them , they are awesome !
neutral	however , it was several weeks after i ordered that the company finally contacted me and said my initial pair were held up in customs .
neutral	they offered to cancel and refund my order or remake my order with a 00_%_discount off my purchase price .
neutral	it was frustrating having to wait so long , but since i had already received my daily prescription_glasses , i didn_'_t mind waiting .
neutral	so , needless to say , i might consider ordering from this company again .
neutral	a lot of the time when i make purchases with wowcher something goes_wrong .
neutral	either i can '_t make the purchase or when i do the item doesn_'_t turn up and i have to contact wowcher .
neutral	they don_'_t have a personal service , all their e_- mails are of a standard pre_- written format .
neutral	i am now very selective in what i buy from them as i have a low tolerance of inefficiency .
neutral	some of their deals are good but i find that items like towels or bed_linen and generally poor quality .
neutral	you pays your money you takes your choice as they say
neutral	wouldnt use again dissaponted passed around customer_service given the run_around still no instructions
neutral	a bit sweet and does not always mix well .
neutral	but not bad .
neutral	still looking for better low_carb options .
neutral	the package was sent to the wrong_address .
neutral	i had to track it down and fight with the post_office .
neutral	i e_- mailed partsgeek to let them know about the inconvenience and received a response that was very rude .
neutral	it was fine , and i would probably order from them again , but only if things were on sale and the cost of shipping didn_'_t negate the savings .
neutral	photos of items were nice , but descriptions were sparse , i . e .
neutral	dog harness didn_'_t say that it was one size with no adjustment buckles .
neutral	our order was missing an item , and there were no instructions on how to report such .
neutral	price was reasonable and cheaper for some items than other_sites , arranging delivery was easy had a call from a very polite receptionist to arrange a time for delivery which was longer_than the delivery time given on their web_site when ordering .
neutral	was told i would receive a call from delivery driver on the delivery day with a time for delivery but he just tirned up when asked about the call he said he does not call customers as he does not have a company phone to use , the delivery man was not to helpfull and did not want to ingage in conversation with us .
neutral	was pleased with fence panels ordered on delivery although myhusband felt they where flimsy for the money and was expecting them to be a bit more sturdier .
neutral	once panels where treated and put up a few_days_later we noticed that some of the slates of wood on a couple of the panels had started to shrink and that some of the nails had pulled through the wood , leaving big gaps in the panels after nailing these back on we are still left with gaps inbetween some of the slates so not very happt at all as we replaced the fence as the old one was falling to peices and to get some privacy from the neigbours kids , but we now have them peeking through the gaps and poking things through them .
neutral	if i had to replace a fence again i would purchase from somewhere_else that i could go and view panels first to check the quality before purchasing .
neutral	so i ordered a left and right headlight_assembly .
neutral	website said they had them in stock .
neutral	i receive one part 0 days_later , and the other is " out of stock , cancelled ."
neutral	well this stinks .
neutral	i don_'_t want to replace just one .
neutral	why was i not notified before it was shipped ?
neutral	so i sent a detailed message to customer_service , asking if the item was back in stock ( website says there are 00 ), could they refill the order , and what is the status of my charge ?
neutral	all i get is " your card has_been refunded ."
neutral	darned if i know how much has_been refunded , that was never stated in any communications .
neutral	so , here i am .
neutral	one headlight .
neutral	do i reorder and try again , or ship the one i have back ?
neutral	stupid place to put your customer in .
neutral	waiting for glutenflam for months now .
neutral	checked again last night , out f stock .
neutral	i was on a waiting list .
neutral	checked with chat line and wasn_'_t really happy with the customer_service girl .
neutral	she could care less if i went to another site for this .
neutral	finally found what i wanted and ordered it elsewhere .
neutral	not sure if i will come_back .
neutral	not enought carts available , no stairs and creepy people hang out there .
neutral	when we turned in our car at heathrow , the agent for auto_europe began doing the usual walk around .
neutral	it was clear that he was disappointed to not find any major damage .
neutral	soon he was kneeling on the ground , squinting and picking at the passenger_side tires and hubcaps .
neutral	there were the usual minor ( read : hard to see unless you are lying on the ground next to the car ) scratches and dings in the tires / hubcaps .
neutral	he stood up and announced that the damage to the ' wheels ' would need to be charged to my account .
neutral	i was furious and demanded that we speak to a manager .
neutral	while waiting for the manager , we watched this same shameful routine playing out with other customers , most of whom meekly walked_into the office and handed_over their credit_cards .
neutral	when the manager finally arrived , she dismissed us with no comment .
neutral	i smell a rat .
neutral	this company should be ashamed for this kind of evil fund raising .
neutral	the tiles are nice and the delivery was smooth , however i am deeply disappointed with the packaging .
neutral	the tiles have , each one of them , a layer of wax / plastic stuck on top .
neutral	they told me it is applied to avoid them to scratch during transportation .
neutral	of course they need to be protected , however there are better methods to do so .
neutral	i will have to spend hours to clean them before they can be fitted on the wall .
neutral	please think_twice before buying from this seller .
neutral	if you order many you will have to take into account the extra time needed to get reed of the stuff / glue they put on top .
neutral	good luck to anybody in my same situation .
neutral	order went through ok but two_days before funeral ( for which flowers were ordered ) i needed reassurance they would be delivered early , as the funeral was an a . m . one .
neutral	i used the online_chat facility and was initially horrified that the operative said they flowers would get there by 0pm !!
neutral	they went off to ring the florist and said they would check .
neutral	i heard_nothing from them and so had to send an_email to the main sales / customer_service address before it was resolved !
neutral	flowers did get there in time but my blood_pressure was through the roof !
neutral	i have had a hard time redeeming my rewards_points every_single time they become available to use .
neutral	i have called twice already and they still_haven_'_t been credited to my account .
neutral	also i have purchased some dresses that looked nothing like the ones pictured in the website .
neutral	i have used bookbyte before and am usually happy with the services .
neutral	however , i got the standard shipping which takes 0 - 00 business days .
neutral	it took the whole time to get here and based on the standard shipping time from other_sites , i personally think this too long to wait .
neutral	other than that i would recommend this site .
neutral	leadtime for coloured_lenses were very speedy and prices were very competitive .
neutral	delivery however was not so great .
neutral	the lenses were put in a box that is bigger_than an average letterbox .
neutral	hence the package was squeezed through the letterbox , damaged the box and the letterbox !
neutral	its maybe worth using a smaller box as you are shipping a lot of air !
neutral	excellent customer_service from boilerjuice .
neutral	they promised the tanker_driver would call one of the 0 numbers i gave them 0 hour before delivery was due so i could unlock the yard gates to let them in .
neutral	then found card on doorstep saying they had tried to deliver but no one in !!!.
neutral	no phone_call received .
neutral	same thing happened again when they went for a second delivery .
neutral	driver said he wasn_'_t given any numbers to call .
neutral	when i contacted the delivery comaony they said boiler_juice had not given them any additional information .
neutral	unacceptable wait time for 0 tire repl of 00_min , recvd text 0 hrs later to say car ready !
neutral	i am not a person to complain however i have found online shopping frustrating at times .
neutral	my orders seem to get delayed for various reasons , i know that it can not always be helped but it has_been a regular occurence .
neutral	ihave to order at_least two_weeks earlier_than i would have with another pet_food company i use .
neutral	we love our sink .
neutral	when i ordered it , i got a call telling_me that the rinse racks wouldn_'_t be ready to order yet , so i told them to send the sink without the racks and then ship the racks when they were ready .
neutral	a couple weeks passed and i contacted main_faucet to get the rinse racks shipped to me .
neutral	i told them we had moved and gave them the new address .
neutral	i was assured they would be mailed to the new address .
neutral	the rinse racks were shipped and delivered but not to my address .
neutral	i contacted main_faucet twice about this and they were ' supposed to get back to me ' about it both_times .
neutral	so , maybe someone somewhere is enjoying my rinse racks in their sink instead .
neutral	i would really love to have them !
neutral	i absolutely love ami !
neutral	i order quite_often and have been for the most part satisfied with the quality of shoes .
neutral	there are four things i feel could make the shopping_experience with ami much much_better .
neutral	0 .
neutral	shipping rates should be cheaper .
neutral	the discounts and prices are good but what good is 00_%_off when that same 00_% is tacked right back on with shipping rates .
neutral	i do just about all of my clothing and shoe shopping online and most sites offer free or cheap flat_rate shipping with all orders without the use of a discount_code .
neutral	0 .
neutral	better product description - if a shoe runs_small or big it should be noted in the product description .
neutral	also garment sizes - it would not hurt to list the models measurements and the size they are wearing in the picture .
neutral	0 .
neutral	this kind of piggy backs on to number 0 but customer reviews should be visible .
neutral	if i notice a trend in customer reviews on a certain product such as " runs_small , i am normally an 0 but exchanged for a 00 " or " color shown in the picture is much darker in person " this will help customers make a better decision when ordering .
neutral	i have personally ordered shoes in my true size that were much too small and since i did not want to go through the hassle of paying shipping for receiving the original item , paying shipping back to ami , and paying shipping again for the correct size to be sent out i either just tortured my feet and stuffed them into the small shoe or just flat out gave them away .
neutral	0 .
neutral	not a huge gripe but still up there is improved searching .
neutral	all_kinds of stuff pops_up when you type in simply " strappy heels " and it can be quite frustrating when you are looking for one item in particular .
neutral	all in all , i will_continue to shop ami i just hope changes are made soon to make the shopping and buying experience better :)
neutral	order was sent last_week and i brought it to the mechanic and i was told it was the wrong part .
neutral	i was told by partsgeek that i ordered the wrong part but when i go on line to partsgeek it pulls up passenger_side_mirror .
neutral	i should have read real good but didn_'_t so maybe the right side was ordered if it popped_up first .
neutral	why would driver_side_mirror come up when i put in passenger_side_mirror i am not sure ...
neutral	i like the convenience of having the pet_food delivered to my home .
neutral	however , there were a few_times ( too many ) where my order arrived in a less_than timely_fashion forcing me to purchase food until my order arrived .
neutral	my dogs eat the same amount of food daily so overfeeding wasn_'_t the issue .
neutral	the issue was inconsistent in delivery schedule .
neutral	the delivery time_frame " the week of " is not efficient .
neutral	although i adjusted the schedule , the deliveries weren_'_t consistent .
neutral	the point of having pet_food delivered is for convenience and peace of mind .
neutral	in the beginning we were amazed with the diversity of options we had to choose from .
neutral	the woman helping_us was very knowledgable and very patient .
neutral	when we decided to go with an all natural bed_frame we were told that it would take up to 0_weeks for it to be made and delivered to our home .
neutral	we also purchased two couches , that were to come in before 0_weeks and we would have to pay delivery fees .
neutral	delivery for the frame was free .
neutral	three_weeks_later , no bed_frame , and no couches .
neutral	when i called , i was told they could not find my paperwork and that they would have to call me back .
neutral	i did not receive a call .
neutral	once again , i called to get a status_update .
neutral	i was told that the bed_frame had been finished and that it was being shipped to san_francisco .
neutral	then , it would be shipped to los_angeles , followed by a final shipment to long beach .
neutral	why did that happen ?
neutral	no explination .
neutral	why didn_'_t they tell me the frame had been done ?
neutral	why wasn_'_t i told that my couches had been sitting in the los_angeles office way before the bed_frame was finished ?
neutral	again , no explination , no apologies , nothing .
neutral	it seems like once the salesperson sold us over $ 0 , 000 in furniture it didn_'_t matter_how and when we got our goods .
neutral	although i '_m happy with the pieces i purchased i '_m not sure i would recommend the shop to my friends .
neutral	if i did , i would warn them about the logistical difficulties they may have to face before they finally get their stuff .
neutral	btw , you spelled my name wrong .
neutral	diana mendoza not ' mendoz '
neutral	unfortunately i have had several bad_experiences in dealing_with this company , which is why i have rated them in the middle .
neutral	both skirts were washed together at recommended temp and wash cycle .
neutral	one has shrunk .
neutral	poor quality item .
neutral	the hose seem to help but the color - suntan - is not suntan !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i haven_'_t seen a differance yet .
neutral	i only have one compaint .
neutral	on the ad .
neutral	it said it came with a gel and there was none , had i known that i would have ordered . i rate this product a 0
neutral	i love the crackers !!!!!
neutral	but i was expecting 0 boxes of 000 / bx not 000 packs of loose crackers ....:(
neutral	good price , delivery spot on , but problem with explaining the instructions for the dishwasher were in swedish .
neutral	e_- mailed after a long conversation with customer_services who tole me to put it in a an e_- mail , but response was after_spending 0 minuted typing problems was what is your problem ........................
neutral	have always had good service from vital_choice except for my last order .
neutral	it arrived as scheduled but half of it had
neutral	thawed which_meant i had to throw half the order away .
neutral	the packing was insufficient , the ice was only on one side of
neutral	the boxes of fish .
neutral	the top and other side had no ice at all .
neutral	i also felt that i should have been told that orders
neutral	shipped to the south could have this problem , then i would not have ordered .
neutral	over all ordering was easy ... but i have not received the gift_card yet .
neutral	hopefully i '_ll receive it before christmas as it is a gift for grandson !!!
neutral	!
neutral	bought new asics trainers , they were a good price , were exactly_what i wanted very comfy on
neutral	pleased with my vision results but aftercare becoming a problem .
neutral	things started well with after care in plymouth , now the closest appointment is in torquay or exeter .
neutral	i have made two appointments in taunton as i was visiting that area but they have both been cancelled due to no optometrist being availble .
neutral	this is most inconvenient as i now have to make a special trip to another area .
neutral	i ordered a vest top and a t - shirt .
neutral	after waiting a week for it to be delivered the t - shirt was a lot shorter_than i thought it would be from the pic and the vest top looked in the pic like it had an embellishment on the collar , which is why i chose it , and i was slightly disappointed that when it arrived it was plain .
neutral	after a week of excitement waiting for my package i was disappointed when it arrived
neutral	couldnt return an item as it was already shipped and it would cost ten_dollars to return .
neutral	bad policy , not hapy .
neutral	great value once you get set_up - but they were unclear ( in my opinion at_least ) on the process to set_up a recurring prescription delivery .
neutral	prices are really attractive and the possibility to book an_appointment online is great .
neutral	the only problem i had is that it took almost 0 hours for a simple mot !
neutral	i really liked the talulah perfume !
neutral	the primavera capsules were amazing - i loved primavera everything !
neutral	but the suki floral body_lotion left a lot to be desired - it smelled awful - like it was rancid .
neutral	the lip_gloss is wonderful - i '_m using it every day .
neutral	we had a lot of paperwork during the process and closing was over two hours long and still didn_'_t have enough documents completed .
neutral	there is a lot of funding issues with who signs what when and it '_s very expensive .
neutral	the prices are really good compare to other_websites .
neutral	however there is a problem with the " contact us " page .
neutral	they should have the email option for those who cannot contact via_telephone .
neutral	ordered a flower_basket and wine to be delivered to my daughter as a surprise in australia .
neutral	flora_queen said that they couldn_'_t find the address and telephone_number given .
neutral	i had to ring my daughter from the uk to check address and telephone_number which turned_out to be correct !
neutral	the flowers and wine were delivered the next_day by the same company who the day before said the details were incorrect !
neutral	also the flower_arrangement was nothing like the one on the website .
neutral	from the order and each day got updates on how the shipment was coming .
neutral	all was great .
neutral	the item upon_receipt was inspected and the warranty covered everything except the grommets .
neutral	i unpackaged the cover and the grommets were less_than satisfactory .
neutral	some were crushed ( folded and could not run line through ) others were not placed on the cover properly ( the grommets were not completely on the fabric ).
neutral	this appears to be a second rate pool_cover and i have to cover my pool now .
neutral	i feel those should have been inspected before shipping .
neutral	i am not willing to pay for shipping and take the chance of getting a second faulty cover .
neutral	i appreciate your updates on shipping but the quality of the product is not what i expected .
neutral	i will not order products again through this site .
neutral	the first time i ordered something from the website , it did not label that the items i wanted were out of stock so i waited for a week and realized they didnt ship anything yet so i emailed them .
neutral	took them 0 days to reply and tell me items were out of stock and that they already canceled my order and refunded my money .
neutral	i got a full_refund within a week so i was happy and ordered from them again
neutral	[ 0 / 00 / 0000_] this time they sent me an_email 0 [ 0 / 00 / 0000_] days_later to tell me my items were shipped with a tracking_number that didnt work .
neutral	i emailed them about it and they said that they had to check with the shipping company to see if they lost my package or what not .
neutral	after 0 days [ friday 0 / 00 / 0000_] i called them to tell them the tracking_number still doesnt work and they told me to wait til monday [ 0 / 00 / 0000_] to see if the tracking_number works .
neutral	today is saturday [ 0 / 00 / 0000_] and i checked the tracking_number and it worked and it said the item was picked_up on 0 / 00 / 0000 at 0 :_00pm which_means when they said they have already shipped the package , they haven_'_t .
neutral	it was probably already given a tracking_number but not shipped yet .
neutral	but i received all my items in the correct sizes i ordered .
neutral	my friend ordered from them more than once and every time she ordered she got her package within 0 days of ordering .
neutral	i think its more of a chance thing if you ' re willing to take it
neutral	it took ami more than a week to process the order before it was shipped .
neutral	i called and i was told that there was a technical problem .
neutral	anyways , the boots itself came ok .
neutral	it was kinda dusty even_though it was in the package and i had to wipe the dust away .
neutral	there were a few inches of yellowish glue stains on the zip as well ...
neutral	do your homework on the wowcher you want to purchase as i had a problem with one of mine custoner service wouldnt help i sent emails and not heard a thing regarding a refund i mite as well have thrown my money down a drain as when i tried to redeem the wowcher the salon concerend were vile and nasty so i couldnt have the wowcher id purchased so was very upset and angry that wowchrer head_office wouldnt help me just be careful where you shall be redeeming the wowcher especially beauty salons coz once purchased theres no turning back good luck !
neutral	i ordered a playstation game card and the code was in within the 00_minutes like they had mentioned but i was disappointed when the code did not work .
neutral	i immediately send an_email and got no response .
neutral	i am now out 00 $ and have no card .
neutral	not very happy with the service .
neutral	hoping a response soon :(
neutral	* got a telephone response not long after my comment .
neutral	things were resolved !
neutral	as a consumer i was surprise about the price of the storage .
neutral	is a dollar the first month
neutral	not truth .
neutral	martha
neutral	i recently_purchased a janome gem platinum . i had purchased my full sized janome from you a long time ago .
neutral	your service was very efficient , however , the carrier left a message to say they had been unable to deliver as no - one was at home , this was not true , he could not have been here without opening our farm gate to turn round , with 0 labradors in the yard we always know when someone has arrived !
neutral	! i tried to get in touch with gur and was told all the lines were engaged and to leave my name and number and someone would get back ... still_waiting , 00 days_later !
neutral	i managed , with some difficulty , to contact the carrier who said the driver could not find us , usually they phone if having_trouble , however , he found us the next_day with no further instruction !
neutral	!
neutral	i had to cancel a part of my order because somehow when i went to click on the particular item , it ended_up giving me the wrong isbn #.
neutral	okay , not the first time such things have happened ( still don_'_t know how but whatever ).
neutral	i noticed it immediately after having placed the order .
neutral	unfortunately , there is no such thing as a partial exchange even if the item has yet to ship .
neutral	so , i had to cancel that part of my order off and i am still_waiting for the refund to hit my bank_account .
neutral	it has_been about a week and a half i would say ,
neutral	other than that , yeah , hey why not ?
neutral	they are alright i guess .
neutral	i booked the morning slot from 0 . 00 - 0 and waited in all morning .
neutral	about 00 . 00 i got a call saying they would be late and needed to stop somewhere_else on the way so would be about 0 before they were with me .
neutral	this was unaaceptable as i had to go out .
neutral	they did eventually come just after 0 as i said i had to get them done asap and could not wait in again the next_day and needed to go out that afternoon .
neutral	the changing of the tyres was fine but i would have prefered a call much earlier as then i could have re arrnaged my day rather_than staying in abd then not getting out until much later .
neutral	a lot of research necessary to check on firms .
neutral	shiply could have their own rating_system and checks which would aid the customer .
neutral	at the moment it seems geared to carriers and themselves .
neutral	on positive side i was " lucky " enough to get a top rate carrier but only after doing my own research .
neutral	after checking the dimensions of the desk i purchased i was convinced that the desk would up the two flights of stairs and the delivery_men would take it up .
neutral	little did i know that the delivered box was much wider than the desk and the box was left downstairs in the middle of the dining_room !!
neutral	disappointing or what ?!!
neutral	!
neutral	i was happy to try my first purchase with petflow , however due to the length of time it took to ship my order , i doubt that i will purchase again .
neutral	the order was placed on saturday but didnt ship till wednesday .
neutral	no reasons were provided .
neutral	customer_service sucks
neutral	the estimated time of arrival was spot on , very pleased as i needed my new skinnies for the day after !
neutral	slightly dissapointed with the material ... wasn_'_t what i expected .
neutral	however , i know i '_ll wear them again !
neutral	we had a problem with the car and autoeurope spain told me they ' d have me a new car within an_hour .
neutral	they called 00_minutes later to say they ' d call back in 00_minutes .
neutral	two hours_later they called again .
neutral	by that time we had fixed the problem so i didnt ' answer the phone .
neutral	if the problem had been more serious you would have truly runied our vacation .
neutral	i am still_waiting for my last order and i '_m sort of angry that it has taken so long ...
neutral	this is not normal for kimball .
neutral	i need a working contact number i ordered two tickets to ultra music festival weekend 0 and they haven_'_t even been picked_up by ups yet .
neutral	the concert is on fri march 00 and that is only a few_days away
neutral	trans :_0000000
neutral	trans :_0000000
neutral	i need these tickets !
neutral	and a working customer_service number !
neutral	----
neutral	update_:_0000000 has_been shipped but what about 0000000 ?
neutral	?
neutral	hit and miss buying from boohoo , sometimes the items are great but the other half of the time the items are cheap tat .
neutral	getting the refund always seems to take_forever aswell !
neutral	what a good service , quick , and very efficient , staff were polite and knowledgable about their products
neutral	the coffee is good , but the lever of my nespresso_machine is difficult to pull down .
neutral	i don_'_t_believe the capsule is tight .
neutral	it is most_likely the cover that is too hard to puncture .
neutral	also , i wish you had a longo decaffinated .
neutral	i certainly appreciate the cost of the capsules , the savings are great .
neutral	website failed as i was paying , received no confirmation , rang them , confirmed but never got the email ...... when forwarded confirmation of delivery came it had no time window for delivery , no tracking_number , and no details of who courier was ..... tracking_number was then sent .
neutral	they use nightfrieight as a courier who do not allow you to track your delivery via their website .
neutral	the product we bought was excellent though .,
neutral	saw the hotel we wanted at a reasonable price including breakfast , went to book and up popped a " better deal " a fair bit cheaper .
neutral	great i thought so hit the book button .
neutral	when i got the confirmation through it did not mention breakfast so i rang the hotel to check .
neutral	no , breakfast wasn_'_t included .
neutral	give me a great price by all means but not a different booking from the one i was on .
neutral	wish i could review your service but i still_haven_'_t received the card i ordered
neutral	doesn_'_t taste like food .
neutral	good customer_service but the product just isn_'_t for me
neutral	i did my part with the measurements and payment .
neutral	you did not do yours with ensuring my glasses arrived at the very least , tightened .
neutral	spent nearly_£_000 with your company and made that many calls to 0000 to arrange delivery and sort out .
neutral	dealt_with lady called anne .
neutral	wouldnt recommend in the future to be honest especially when you have cheek to charge £ 0 . 00 delivery when you miscommunicated regarding the day etc .
neutral	appalled .
neutral	spent nearly_£_000 and thanks you get
neutral	after ordering a 00m multi coloured ropelight to brighten_up the decking for christmas , the order process and speed of processing / delivery was excellent .
neutral	but unravelling 00m of ropelight from a reel was quite difficult as it was tightly coiled , and then after i had got it into position it was time for the big switch on - oh dear .
neutral	a 0m stretch right in the middle where the blues and yellows do not light up .
neutral	i '_m not taking it down now !
neutral	if it wasn_'_t for this would have given 0 or even 0_stars , but products should be checked before they are dispatched .
neutral	rueckblickend auf das studium fuehlte ich_mich bei_der ihk - pruefung ein wenig verloren und nicht genug auf_den test vorbereitet .
neutral	ich_habe die pruefung mit zwei berufschulklassen abgeschlossen und_habe in den pausen grosse unterschiede bemerkt .
neutral	zum ersten hatten die berufschullehrer ihre berufsschueler alles was die ihk - pruefer nicht moegen bis ins tiefste detail eingehaemmert und besonders hervorgehoben , welche satzanfaenge zu vermeiden waeren , da die pruefer diese " langweilig " finden .
neutral	eine der prueferinnen war sogar eine berufschullehrerin von einer der zwei klassen .
neutral	zum zweiten hatte das woerterbuch , das von_der sgd vorgeschrieben wurde mindestens zwei woerter nicht aufgelistet und_es_war mir unmoeglich diese woerter zu uebersetzten , eines davon war photovoltaik .
neutral	in der berufsschule wird das groesste woerterbuch von ponds benutzt und_es kostet um die 00_euro .
neutral	ausserdem moechte ich noch vermerken , dass fast alle lernhefte fehler enthalten .
neutral	z . b .
neutral	stand in einem englischen geschaeftsbrief das deutsche wort " datum ".
neutral	die fehler lenken sehr ab_und_es faellt schwer sich auf das wesentliche zu konzentrieren .
neutral	more or less happy with service , prompt , efficient and good value .
neutral	i registered and did a dummy run on my laptop in bulgaria with no_probs .
neutral	came to uk - no laptop just a smart phone , what a balls ache .
neutral	not being a techno freek , basically a bit of numpty having to prove my id and take photos was a nightmare .
neutral	luckily i had documents with me too .
neutral	hi there , delivery was late0 day no information given about that no email no calls then the driver didnt say a word to me gave_me this thing to sign off and went in silence but never mind bed is lovely just one thing more no invoice i need it pls ;)
neutral	overall the items seem excellent despite_being expensive .
neutral	unfortunately my dogs ( beagles ) can pull down the sides and get into the side compartments exposing the wires and getting dog fur everywhere .
neutral	we will have to look for alternative solutions as this does not securely protect the boot .
neutral	prior information about purchasing the auto glym silicone remover would have been useful .
neutral	ordering options online were good .
neutral	email_notifications of status of order was good until it said " is processing " - i heard_nothing back since then december_0th and called on the 00th to find out the status .
neutral	it was shipped united_states postal so there wasn_'_t any tracking and was told it should be received by my local post_office between the 00th and the 00th .
neutral	that seems like a long time to receive a gift_card .
neutral	i ordered a gift_card from amazon and had it in my hands within a weeks time and was able to track the shipping .
neutral	i probably will not order from gift_cards again .
neutral	i booked a last_minute hotel and didn_'_t receive a confirmation_email .
neutral	i paid with paypal and that '_s the only email i received .
neutral	when i phoned the next_day to inquire , the guy on the phone told me to check my spam_folder .
neutral	duh , i had done that prior to calling !
neutral	he then sent me the confirmation_email , and i went to my hotel .
neutral	they couldn_'_t locate my reservation .
neutral	ends_up it wasn_'_t under my name .
neutral	it was under bookit ; not sure if that '_s a bookit or this specific hotel thing .
neutral	i received a confirmation_email later that day ( after i had checked into hotel ), so i '_m guessing confirmations don_'_t go out live ...?
neutral	will probably give them another try down the road since the guy on the phone was so polite and tried so hard to be helpful .
neutral	in the process of building , we rented three 00 x 00 stalls and have paid on auto pay for the last 0 or 0 months .
neutral	we were promised the same rate if we needed another stall .
neutral	i called yesterday to rent a fourth stall and found out there was a new manager .
neutral	he would not honor the promised rate that we have .
neutral	this is mainly for people who have several pets and need a lot of supplies .
neutral	for the majority of people who have only one pet , it gets a little_disappointing when all the promotions are only for repeat orders .
neutral	it sure is nice to get pet stuff delivered to the door , though !
neutral	love the fact that i don_'_t have to make a stop after work .
neutral	it '_s delivered to my office and i just have someone load it into the car .
neutral	very easy .
neutral	it usually goes well but this delivery was shipped a day late and then took 0 days to get here .
neutral	normally they are here on time .
neutral	delivery points are awesome ... wish seamless had those .
neutral	that '_s probably one of two reasons i use delivery . com .
neutral	the other is the $ 0 off $_00 regular coupon offer .
neutral	i don_'_t like the way the app looks and theat you can '_t search for food items .
neutral	also the checkout is super annoying too - i would like to be able to set a cc to auto fill in .
neutral	pros_:
neutral	- has the most diverse selection of hostels out of any other hostel booking site
neutral	- many many honest reviews by backpackers like me , so the ratings are pretty reliable
neutral	cons_:
neutral	- does not save your isic info by hostelworld account , and have to open up a new window to use isic service fee waiver every time
neutral	- if you accidentally refresh the page , the dates change to today '_s date .
neutral	which is extremely annoying because you have to reinsert the dates all the time .
neutral	- maps section sometimes shows the hostel in a different location than when you type on google_maps .
neutral	also would be very convenient if you could click on the hostelworld map and it would open up a google_maps version in a new window
neutral	the mattress was delivered promptly on the allocated day .
neutral	the delivery man asked me to inspect the mattress which was wrapped in 0 layers of thick polythene with no tears or damage .
neutral	however , upon removing the packaging , there was a small_hole in the top of the mattress .
neutral	it seems that your quality control systems may not be working effectively .
neutral	i have ordered from them three_times .
neutral	i like the clothes for the price .
neutral	the first time no_problems but the shoes i ordered the second were out of stock so they didn_'_t send them .
neutral	they didn_'_t send my money back nor did they credit anything to my account .
neutral	customer_service keeps telling_me they are working on it but so_far with little success
neutral	i ordered two bags of dog_food .
neutral	they arrived on time but the shipping carton was heavily damaged .
neutral	it had been repaired with tape somewhere in its journey .
neutral	the potential for a kibble disaster was high .
neutral	i will order from petflow again and hope the problem has_been solved .
neutral	the delivery and ordering was fast and easy but the glue on the bonded extensions melts when i dry my hair !!
neutral	!
neutral	had to put my details on card in five times as kept sticking , had to add address details twie as removed them !
neutral	frustrating ,
neutral	the ink that i ordered came in the mail quickly .
neutral	unfortunately , only the color ink was the correct one .
neutral	the black_ink was wrong and did not work in my printer .
neutral	the checkout_process took so long , one of my gift_cards was purchased by the time i was able to check out .
neutral	the search process is really annoying too .
neutral	ordered both fridge and freezer , booked a delivery date and was alloocated a time between 00pm and 0pm .
neutral	what time do they turn up ?
neutral	at around 0 . 00 .
neutral	didnt even call to say running_late and when arrived no apology made either .
neutral	two men turned_up , one said hello while the other didn_'_t even ackhnowledge me .
neutral	i ordered the ken bomber ladies jacket from your website unfortunately it was too small on the arms and the large was not available . cant find it in any stores so maybe last seasons .
neutral	when i went to the shop to return it they said i could only exchange here and had to send back by post for a refund .
neutral	when i went to the post_office i was very unhappy to realise i had to pay over_£ 0 in postage to guarantee you received it .
neutral	superdry should offer a free refund .
neutral	mit_der qualität der lieferung war_ich sehr_zufrieden , aber habe die vorauszahlung am tag der_bestellung direkt gemacht und musste dennoch drei wochen warten nach zwei mal nach fragen , das war nicht so schön
neutral	i think the web_site is slower and i don_'_t like the new system with picking a hotel prior to seeing what flight is being offered when you are checking a flight and hotel package .
neutral	i am very happy with the vehicle i got from drive time it just took entirely too long like a 0 hour process .
neutral	the people who were working that day were leaving to go home before my husband and i left to go home .
neutral	i love your products , prices and speak offers but i have been severely impacted and disappointed in the shipping process .
neutral	the routes are good bit the commentary was virtually non_- existent .
neutral	the info is the main_reason_why we go on the buses but we spent 00_% of the journey listening to music on the on board pre recorded_commentary .
neutral	there is so much history in london you should be struggling to work out what to leave out not what to say !
neutral	ticket number 000000 . amount to credit 00 . 00 plus tax please give immediate attention .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	i had to return two collars that were the wrong_size .
neutral	they did the return / exchange for the correct size but failed to mention there would be an_additional_charge on my account .
neutral	the charge was actually les than the original order and actually i should have just gotten a credit of 0 dollars ..
neutral	however , no one informed me of this happening and it was an unpleasant surprise .
neutral	to mention i am still_waiting for the original 00_dollar order to be credited_back to may account .
neutral	it '_s great shopping_experience .
neutral	but deilver bit_slow
neutral	quick shipping of ink , but i ordered two black and received 0 black and 0 color .
neutral	once notified , they provided a shipping label to return the color_cartridge and immediately send out the black one .
neutral	..... but i am a little_concerned that i am still yet to receive my policy documents .
neutral	well ....
neutral	i can '_t give the ink a good review ...... but i can say the customer_service is fantastic !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i still have not received my sunglasses .
neutral	it was not a good experience sending back my original package .
neutral	i paid s / h and it wasn_'_t cheap then it took_forever to get back .
neutral	too long of a wait for me .
neutral	i will not be ordering here again .
neutral	sorry 😣
neutral	i went into my account & changed my auto order right after the last order arrived .
neutral	last time i made the mistake of ordering large_breed food , but i figured since it was my mistake , i ' d just use it .
neutral	the postage to return the bag was too much .
neutral	but the large_breed food was sent again this time , with no attempt to see that the orderwas correct before sending out the auto shipment .
neutral	i am not happy .
neutral	i wish i could get a refund
neutral	after the long wait on hold the service was very kind and efficient .
neutral	i enjoyed the products purchased , and they arrived in good shaped , very quickly .
neutral	however , the shipping was more than the products .
neutral	hate that .
neutral	feel_like you want to catch travvellers with bi handluggage but you miss so many check everybody or nobody .
neutral	i had a regular handbag and my husband a carryback so we had no problem but felt bad because you had no stabil police
neutral	i have order from you several_times .
neutral	this is the first time i have received my merchandise without_having to e_- mail you about not receiving it !
neutral	i liked my order but it took a week to receive .
neutral	i didn_'_t realize the company was on the west_coast .
neutral	i live in nj and will probably go with a company that is closer .
neutral	you sent my order promptly , but apparently you think that one order gives you permission to load my email inbox with stupid and unwanted emails .
neutral	please take me off your email list .
neutral	also , i found that your dog_food was probably more_expensive than my local_pet_store , with postage added .
neutral	i cannot buy huge amounts at one time to save postage as i am elderly and cannot lift_heavy_bags .
neutral	so , i will probably not order from you again .
neutral	i think it '_s a pain having to sign for your tire , you should have the option to click to leave with out signature .
neutral	some people can '_t sit and wait for the tire to show up .
neutral	i bought a dozen roses bouquet with fillers and a vase .
neutral	everything arrived on time , but the flowers were not as in the picture .
neutral	they were small and the never opened .
neutral	love the beads , etc .
neutral	and the service .
neutral	the shipping was confusing .
neutral	i thought i had chosen the pouch shipping and i think the items would have fit .
neutral	but when i looked at the invoice you had applied the most expensive shipping .
neutral	i probably will shop around next time to get a better shipping rate .
neutral	again , your service was great except for shipping_costs .
neutral	one of my gift_cards never arrived , and was not showing as having been used , yet to replace it i was charged a fee .
neutral	unfair .
neutral	i liked the products when i saw them on screen but one was very different when i tried it on and so i sent it back .
neutral	others were ok , luckily they were on sale as i would never pay the full price for them !
neutral	initially the man_who answered the phone was nice but seemed to suffer from adhd .
neutral	i had to repeat things several_times such as how many months i needed the storage , i told him four different times how long .
neutral	i explained the items i had and we had to go thru piece by piece .
neutral	the phone_call took a lot longer_than it needed to .
neutral	i just wanted some info .
neutral	i also felt_like he thought i was an_idiot and needed to explain to me very basic things .
neutral	the purchasing process was easy and i thought i had found the site i would use as i frequently buy gift_cards for family .
neutral	but , after the card was delivered to my grandson , his mother had difficulty activating the card .
neutral	i tried_calling and going on line .
neutral	when i finally talked to a call_center representative , i was given improper instructions and was told to ' register ' the card before activating .
neutral	i explained to her that these instructions were not provided either online or with the card that was sent .
neutral	in fact when you click the register menu , it takes you to a page to set_up a new online account .
neutral	this should not be required to activate a card , but only to purchase a card .
neutral	we finally figured it out and was able to activate the card online .
neutral	for improvement , your call menu tree should be modified to more clearly take you to what to do to activate a card and there was no code put in the mail to me as the purchaser even_though this was the information provided .
neutral	also , customer_service representatives should be better trained and able to answer basic questions .
neutral	the bus_tour in itself was good , it captured all the main_sights , but the audio commentary was awful , as other reviews have stated full of static and incomprehensible .
neutral	i do not like that you charged my credit_card for two_nights the day that i called to make reservations .
neutral	normally you hold the card number and do not charge unless it is a no show or the person arrives .
neutral	i called to cancelled my reservation due to change in plans and i was told that it would take 00 - 00 days before the credit would show on my card .
neutral	this is wrong on so many levels !!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i '_ve purchased some wonderful clothing for my husband , but shipping seemed bit_slow .
neutral	one of the items wasn_'_t in stock and i didn_'_t realize it when checking out .
neutral	quick and easy
neutral	front staff ladies , very pleasant .
neutral	rooms were very cleaned .
neutral	it '_s a good hotel for a good price !
neutral	wifi was horrible , so wasn_'_t able to get any work done .
neutral	get your money back .
neutral	we called at 0 : 00_pm the day before a night walking_tour through chinatown , and by my calculations , it was 00_hours before the trip , but by viators calculations it was not .
neutral	i was on vacation and i didn_'_t want to fight , but i have to tell you , it left a sour taste in my mouth , considering we had booked 0 trips through viator .
neutral	we are now going to los_angeles in august , and i '_m not totally sure that i will book through viator .
neutral	i actually sent an_email with a question about pick - up at my hotel .
neutral	i received a confirmation and was told someone would get back to me .
neutral	no one did .
neutral	so , as you can see , i '_m having my doubts as to whether i want to give my money to them , when there '_s plenty of other tour companies .
neutral	i thought the spoiled_rotten boxes should be more " customized ".
neutral	small dogs and breeds can '_t handle large items .
neutral	any rawhide product is scary for small dogs .
neutral	despite advertising free delivery to all of the u . k .
neutral	i was charged £_00 for delivery !
neutral	this is because aberdeen is now in the highlands & islands - apparently .
neutral	it '_s not , it '_s in aberdeenshire .
neutral	i dislike the sneaky way i was charged .
neutral	when i put the order through , there was no mention of a charge , it was only about 00_minutes later i got an_email through telling_me my order wouldn_'_t ship unless i paid delivery .
neutral	and when i tried to pay it online it also charged me an extra £ 0 . 00 to pay for the bonus of the " free delivery "!
neutral	having brought an expensive tent costing £_000 . 00 , i am not happy with the false_advertising .
neutral	first , a little background .
neutral	i needed to make a reservation for 0 rooms to host a small family_reunion in shawnee mission , ks .
neutral	as i visited numerous sites , i realized that rooms were filling up quickly .
neutral	so i reserved 0 rooms and asked the agent if these room would be refundable if i did not need them all .
neutral	as of now i still do not know for sure how many are coming .
neutral	i '_ll be i asked the agent that question 0 times and each time he said " yes ."
neutral	after i hung_up and received the confirmation_email , i noticed that it said " nonrefundable ."
neutral	so i called ( it was a different number from the original number because it was a question about a reservation .)
neutral	and talked to a different agent .
neutral	he asked me several_times if the first agent had read me the cancellation_policy and i told him he had not .
neutral	i hope to need to keep all the rooms , but if not , i will be asking for a refund .
neutral	and i expect to receive it .
neutral	es sollten auch gutscheine nach gemachtem umsatz verschenkt werden !
neutral	lige et_par tanker i punktform :
neutral	- jeres telefonkø er uacceptabel .
neutral	fortæl i det mindste folk , hvad nummer de er i køen !
neutral	- det_er fint at i er flittige til at svare folk her i trustpilots forum , men_det virker useriøst , når det bare er_en sludder for en sladder .
neutral	lad være med at svare , medmindre i har noget vigtigt at tilføje , en decideret undskyldning fx .
neutral	- jeg finder jeres netforbindelse tilfredsstillende for det meste , men i perioder er den ustabil , men så_er i søde til at hjælpe med_en løsning .
neutral	- jeg_synes i skulle tilbyde en løsning så_man_kan bruge googles chromecast .
neutral	vær med på moden !
neutral	jeg_er_en helt almindelig pige der kan lide god lyd .
neutral	jeg_er_ikke super til at lave ting selv , og_jeg ved ikke alt om hi -_fi .
neutral	jeg_skulle købe en pladespiller og en blu - ray - afspiller , og blev mødt af_en noget dum - smart sælger i hi -_fi - klubben odense , jeg tænkte ... han hører faktisk mere hjemme i fona eller ekspert , ikke i saglige hifi - klubben .
neutral	næste gang skulle jeg så afhente min pladespiller , og købte en bedre pickup med .
neutral	jeg spurgte om den var nem at sætte på selv .
neutral	" ja , ja , " lød det korte svar .
neutral	jeg spurgte mere ind til_det , og_fik at vide at der lå værktøj i kassen til_det .
neutral	da_jeg kom hjem , viste det sig , at det_ikke var så nemt .
neutral	jeg_var faktisk lidt ked af at han ikke tilbød at skifte pickuppen for mig , det ville have taget ham 0 minutter .
neutral	jeg_synes ikke sælgerne i hi -_fi klubben odense er professionelle og venlige mod kunderne , men måske er_det fordi_jeg_ikke_er " hi -_fi " nok ..?
neutral	site was good , a bit dissappointed that we have to wait_until may for the delivery .
neutral	but we can live with that .
neutral	only_thing that is disturbing is they keep sending us emails saying our basket is still open - but we '_ve paid and been invoiced .
neutral	i don_'_t understand this , twice_now next time i '_ll be phoning them .
neutral	i ordered a case for my ipad_mini .
neutral	i ordered it before i preordered the mini ( one week before mini released ).
neutral	the ipad came last friday .
neutral	it '_s monday , and snugg is asking for a review .
neutral	the cover won_'_t be here until wednesday .
neutral	i can '_t review the case , but i '_m already disappointed that my ipad has no case , yet .
neutral	honestly , if i had known it would take so long , i would have just waited and ordered a different case from somewhere_else .
neutral	this snugg was only offered in black , but i accepted that because i thought it would be here at the same time as my ipad .
neutral	i probably would have ordered a different color ... but too late now .
neutral	update_: the case did arrive later on monday .
neutral	it '_s actually pretty nice .
neutral	however , there is a letter stating that apple moved the magnets at the last_minute , so the ' smart cover ' aspect doesn_'_t work at this time .
neutral	they promise to send a revised ( fully functioning ) version in the next 00 days , this case , so_far , is for protection ... and i won_'_t have to return it when the new one arrives .
neutral	nice_touch & the rating is getting better .
neutral	the black is alright .
neutral	i do wish it came in other colors , but this will do .
neutral	we '_ll see if / when the 0nd case arrives .
neutral	update 0 : the replacement case arrived today .
neutral	it was a little more than 00 days , but the new case is just the same , but now the smart cover feature works .
neutral	regardless of whatever timing issues i had , the case is a good quality and feels nice .
neutral	l did not get any kosher meals on all flight as l don_'_t eat everything .
neutral	when i called the company the man taking the order was extremely polite and helpful , he took the order and explained what was going to happen next .
neutral	great i thought , going well .
neutral	the company used for the delivery were most unhelpful and when my husband spoke to the girl in their office she was very rude and obviously in the wrong job , as she had no communication_skills whatsoever .
neutral	the delivery man was a jobsworth and didn_'_t have 0 ounce of flexability .
neutral	the bathroom that we ordered was fine everything as it should be , which is what we had paid for .
neutral	i suggest a different delivery company is used by betterbathrooms or feedback will always be negative .
neutral	there were ants coming from under the door jam in the bathroom .
neutral	and if you can believe it , there were ants near and in the pool !
neutral	so my kids were commenting on swimming with the ants .
neutral	breakfast was okay , only cheerios and raisin bran for cereal and thin dried out sausage patties ... not awful , but we expected better for the price .
neutral	i feel good with the service but bookbyte is always making promises about return it a percentage of the payments but i never receive it .
neutral	i '_ve rented at about 0 books and nothing :(
neutral	this time i had a minor change to make to my business cards in that i wanted to add my email address .
neutral	whilst i appreciate a minor change still constitutes a change the order was not progressed automatically at all and was missed by my local team .
neutral	when i chased it 0 days_later i was sent a proof and they had used the incorrect email address , despite my amendment notes showing the correct address .
neutral	in fairness they didn_'_t charge me for the change , but there was no urgency at all and no offer to deliver the cards that finally were ready a week late .
neutral	i dealt_with a different person to the member of staff that usually deals with my printing , and i must_say that the experience could not have been more different .
neutral	usually i receive excellent service and was disappointed that i felt as though i was an inconvenience on this occasion , it has made me reconsider using printing . com in future just in case i have to deal with this person .
neutral	had to call twice after waited 00_minutes without bus .
neutral	when i told dispatcher i was waiting under the sign stated on my ticket , he said they were in fact using another spot for pick ups .
neutral	he was very apologetic , which was nice , but it was cold .
neutral	also , i could not help but notice that three of the parking_spot '_s buses came by as i was waiting in the cold .
neutral	i got my struts 0 days after i order them .
neutral	haven_'_t installed then yet . i will let you know how it goes .
neutral	i placed my order july 00 , 0000 , and as for today , july 00 , i have not received my sunglasses !
neutral	the sway bar links that i ordered did not seem to be installable .
neutral	there was no spot for the hex key in the end of the bolt and there was no flat spot for a wrench .
neutral	i googled the part number and it wasn_'_t the part that i got .
neutral	the search_results showed a much more substantial rubber bushing , this part has more of a flexible rubber dust cover .
neutral	i had already attempted to install the part so decided_against trying to return it .
neutral	in the end i was able to install it after i purchased an impact wrench and socket , so this was no deal .
neutral	it was nice to be able to purchase a seamless gift_card , but the fees were too high , i was unable to print the gift_card on my computer and the shipping fees were exorbinant .
neutral	for a $_000 gift_card , i paid almost $_00 in fees !
neutral	will not order from giftcards . com again .
neutral	i placed an order online one day , and the following_day i was called to sign_up for auto_ship .
neutral	i did say okay .
neutral	but they auto shipped me from the last time i ordered back in may .
neutral	which gave_me a double order , and a double payment .
neutral	so they took double out of my checking_account .
neutral	i do not have a lot of funds in my checkbook .
neutral	so , i was not able to pay another bill on time .
neutral	you are making me wait for my refund until you receive the order back that i did not order .
neutral	i immediately gave it back to fed_ex .
neutral	with the prepaid_label .
neutral	i was told that before an auto_ship i would be notified so i could change an order .
neutral	i immediately cancelled all future auto ships .
neutral	i am very dissatisfied .
neutral	i am healthy and slim with a waist of 00 inches , my lower belly is 00 inches and underbust is about 00 .
neutral	i had got a size 00 inch corset and it is way too tight .
neutral	even when i lace to 00 inches , i feel_like i '_m gonna die .
neutral	these corsets are not made for grown women .
neutral	:( the corset i had gotten is " my - 000 - green brocade underbust " it is cute though
neutral	got a call today from cheryl and i guess there was a misunderstanding about the insulin syringes i ordered .
neutral	she was very nice and said they would reimburse_me for the shipping .
neutral	the needles that were sent were the standard veternarian needles not the ones for insulin and she appoliged for that .
neutral	in the future i would order from them because they really seemed like they wanted to make the mistake right again which i appreciate .
neutral	the package was delivered quickly and everything was taken_care of in a very timely_manner .
neutral	seems like a good company to do_business with & they care about their customers .
neutral	really pleased with the items i ordered .
neutral	good price and good quality .
neutral	just disappointed with the delivery service as ordered a couple of minutes after the 0pm deadline shown online , paid_extra for next_day delivery via_royal_mail special delivery but the items didn_'_t arrive until 0 days_later .
neutral	when i queried this with character . com i received an_email_saying their dispatch cutoff is 0pm - their delivery policy on their website states 0pm !?
neutral	will use again , just won_'_t trust the delivery policy on the site .
neutral	unfortunately the batteries sent did not work , and replacement batteries did not work also .
neutral	thought it may be our phone until we got some batteries from local market that work just fine .
neutral	have no_idea as to why .
neutral	was disappointed only received one item of the two i ordered , not even sure if reimbursed .
neutral	but , the one item was very nice .
neutral	i am a loyal french connection fan and have always enjoyed their fashion forward lines .
neutral	recently , i was a bit disappointed in the fabric quality on a recent website purchase .
neutral	i ordered 0 articles of clothing , and i was disappointed with two of the articles .
neutral	the fabric was quite thin , and the colors were not as vibrant as how the website depicted them .
neutral	this was a first for me - i have always thought that french connection quality was superior to other competitor brands .
neutral	i will_continue to shop french connection , but only in their bricks and mortar_stores !
neutral	i tried to reach the parts department unsuccessful would some one please call me i need to place another order need to speak to some one
neutral	the last two times i ordered a prescription product my vet sent the approval fax back and vetrxdirect did not acknowledge it .
neutral	i had to call the company and get the fax situation straightened_out .
neutral	this slowed delivery time of the product which my dog needs on a daily_basis .
neutral	delays are not an option .
neutral	prior to this there had not been a problem .
neutral	i was disappointed that the paperwhite narcissus that i ordered for a gift too so long to arrive ( which could easily have been due to the cold_weather in january ), but more disappointed that it failed to bloom .
neutral	however , the customer_service people were eager to send a replacement to my gift recipient , and while it isn_'_t a spring bulb , it is a lovely plant .
neutral	i don_'_t know whether the failure to bloom is an_issue with quality control or inferior bulbs or damage in shipping ; the bulbs sprouted and grew , but did not form viable blooms .
neutral	this seems like a problem with the bulb itself , or its forcing prior to being shipped .
neutral	haven_'_t found a job yet using your site .
neutral	don_'_t like the fact that what they ask for is so generalized and price they will play is so general / like five to ten_dollars an_hour .
neutral	and when it is higher it doesn_'_t tell you if that '_s per hour or per day .
neutral	some don_'_t even how many children that do have or the specific ages .
neutral	and if they think a nanny will watch 0 children for 0 - 00 $ an hr .
neutral	they are crazy !!
neutral	the other ones that want a baby sitter , tutor , house cleaner , cook and chauffeur and only want to pay 0 - 00 $ an_hour are really crazy !
neutral	paid the courier company for a saturday delivery at £_00 - courier delivered on wednesday and threw parcel over garden gate as we were out .
neutral	i then spent over 00_minutes on the phone to organize the refund - at over 00 p per_minute .
neutral	quite a money spinner for the courier !
neutral	i would use country_attire ltd again but only if they could assure me of a different courier .
neutral	there are a lot of issues with google .
neutral	i used them & then i get lots of unwanted interruption in searches .
neutral	would like this to stop & would like to be able to choose what i want to see on my screen .
neutral	we ordered 0 costumes .
neutral	i tried on my medusa costume and when my husband was zipping it up it was a little tight and then it ripped !
neutral	now , i have a party in 0 days have to figure_out a way to alter it .
neutral	not real happy !
neutral	it was a size l and i where a 00 in ladies so that should be fine .
neutral	need to reduce delivery charges
neutral	it '_s tough to review because i haven_'_t received all the cards yet .
neutral	i did , however , receive the virtual card .
neutral	it was quick and so easy .
neutral	my grandson was extremely happy with my purchase for him .
neutral	i '_ll let you know about the other two cards when i receive them .
neutral	they are expected in a few_days .
neutral	on the 0th of december i believe .
neutral	looking_forward to it .
neutral	good delivery , good website .. small sizes nothing actually fits !
neutral	well , i started to booking process and got to the payment option and it kept asking me for the same information to verify - after checking and rechecking i then tried to call the " help " number on the site - this is a non_- working number - again , i '_m human , thought maybe i ' d made a mistake and tried again ....
neutral	i then thought maybe since i didn_'_t register ...
neutral	so i backtracked and registered instead of trying to check out as a guest .
neutral	when i went into my e_- mail to confirm my registration i had a fraud_alert from my visa account , and of course dropped everything to call them : it seems trying to book on easytobook raised some red flags as their headquarters are in france ; i '_ll admit to being a little_slow here - i kept telling him that i wasn_'_t trying to book a room in paris - just a suite in maryland !!
neutral	luckily the capital one agent was very patient and professional for he didn_'_t laugh out loud !!!
neutral	even after he hipped me to the fact that the great advertised price that drew me into the site was actually in euros - not us dollars !!!
neutral	( duh ) after being totally shamed that i hadn_'_t caught that , i was too embarrassed to quit and completed the booking .
neutral	( and yes , this virginian has_been to the uk and totally understands pound vs dollar ... just didn_'_t catch the euro thing ) incidentally i checked with the hotel ; it was the same price as i would have paid if i ' d just called them directly !!
neutral	not a penny less , let_alone a euro !!
neutral	that '_s an_hour and a half of my life i won_'_t get back .... lol
neutral	so , first clarify the currency_exchange_rate , and next : if you have a phone_number for customer assistance - please make_sure it is working !!
neutral	!
neutral	happy trails !
neutral	!
neutral	i as disappointed in how long it took to actually deliver the gift_card .
neutral	i think that over a week is not acceptable .
neutral	as stated i love most of the pens , i have bought , they do justice to the prize winning hand writing , the nuns taught me with split nib , and the ubiquitous ink wells , that luckier girls had their plaits dipped in .
neutral	i have lamy pens with the wrong_size and colour .
neutral	i have fine pen , supposedly near universal refills , and way to many fine tipped , pens of every type , roller_ball , drawing_pens , roller gel .
neutral	no compatibility with refills and pens .
neutral	i write a lot , as a counsellor , using write extensive work notes before entering final copy on client data bas .
neutral	as post grad student am never without 0 - 0 of your pens in various colours , as sub topics of thesis notes and articles are written and filed by colour .
neutral	i have had a different pen turn up to the one i was sure i had ordered .
neutral	i did not recieve the correct amount of ' free lamy ' promotional pens , to correlate with the promotion requirements .
neutral	and most frustrating of all i have a number of small foil sachets with fine point pens refills and despite having many fine line pens , that get thrown_away .
neutral	i find the website a nightmare .
neutral	have not told any of my stationary ' nut ' about you foot that reason .
neutral	all would be forgiven if contact with sales staff was easier , and you you could tell me where i can buy some letter sized suspension files .
neutral	given a gorgeous american , piece of furniture / letter file , bit no sets pension files .
neutral	have not been able to locate anywhere .
neutral	file will nearly hold a0 suspension file , but not quite comfortably accommodates quatro / a0 manilla folders .
neutral	so that information and the name of the pen i have all the proudly acquired refills would make the service fabulous .
neutral	thanks
neutral	just think a bit more marketing and products for younger generations of makeup users would be helpful .
neutral	have always had the image of my grandma using these products .
neutral	seems like they ' re trying to do elderly posh .
neutral	i '_ve heard good things about the products just wouldn_'_t ever go buy them .
neutral	i ordered from other_sites on the same day - i received their packages , but a week_later received partsgeek .
neutral	i have been a customer of petflow . com since right after they launched .
neutral	the selection of food , toys and treats is outstanding .
neutral	delivery is prompt and the threshold for earning free_shipping is very reasonable .
neutral	customer_service is polite and satisfactory .
neutral	they are * so close * to earning a five - star_rating ... except for the website .
neutral	it ’_s awful .
neutral	there is no way to limit your searches to products you actually want - for instance , i buy nature ’_s variety dry_dog_food .
neutral	i can pull up nature ’_s variety products , but i have to scroll_through canned_cat_food , dry_cat_food , canned_dog_food .... looking for the items i want .
neutral	don_’ t even think about trying to put more specific product descriptions in the search_function ; you will get a wild mish - mash of completely unrelated products .
neutral	i also have more than one ‘ flow ’ or regularly_scheduled delivery .
neutral	i rotate the food my dogs eat with each order , so i have to go in and change the contents after each shipment .
neutral	once i have changed the dry_dog_food shipment , i must log out and log back in to change the canned_food shipment because even_though i have saved my changes and closed the dry_food ‘ flow ’, when i open the link for the canned_food ‘ flow ’, the dry_food order shows up and will not close unless i do the log out - log in dance .
neutral	they should be simple things to fix ( hire a programmer ?)
neutral	but month after month i ’_m forced to deal with these issues because petflow hasn ’ t .
neutral	come on , petflow ... just fix it already and get that five - star review !
neutral	flurry of emails - all very good .
neutral	product doesn_'_t keep flies off .
neutral	the service was fast and prompt .
neutral	however , the color i ordered was a purple and the lettering color when it came was pink .
neutral	no i did not contact them , but i was disappointed .
neutral	i loved the finished canvas and would recommend the company highly for this .
neutral	however , i was away for a week when it was delivered .
neutral	instead of posting a card through my door to arrange redelivery , the canvas was just left there .
neutral	luckily my neighbour took it in but this is most unsatisfactory and for this reason i will never use the company again sadly
neutral	i stayed at this hotel one week prior and the rate was $_000 . 00 / night .
neutral	reservations this week were going to cost me $_000 . 00 / night which is a ridiculous amount to pay for a hotel room .
neutral	i was very disappointed in the rate .
neutral	i travel a lot for business purposes and we have a budget we must stay within for hotels , which is much less_than $_000 . 00 / night .
neutral	although i really liked this hotel price will probably keep me from staying here again .
neutral	de plaatjes van_de behangvoorbeelden laden niet .
neutral	heel vervelend .
neutral	their good but not worth buying from if your doing small orders , because they charge way too much in shipping fee '_s !
neutral	i ordered a shirt size large when i received it around the rib cage the shirt was really tight we ' re the rest of the shirt was not it was not what the picture showed
neutral	can '_t rate your service - i haven_'_t received what was ordered ~ thanks
neutral	the slipper socks were the exact style i wanted and the right material - terry cloth .
neutral	i had had a pair like that and wore them for years .
neutral	that pair was a little heavier terry cloth - soft - clingy - stayed put and easy to put on and take off .
neutral	they were just the right weight for our california valley winter temps .
neutral	the pair sent me from easycomforts arrived quickly and the price was good - but there is where the comparison stops .
neutral	two holes appeared in one sock immediately upon slipping it on my foot - and the other sock has a tiny hole as well .
neutral	when i wear them the material stretches and allows the sides of my feet or my toes to slide past the composition sole .
neutral	the terry needs to be thicker to give a little more warmth and the elasticity needs to decrease some .
neutral	i was going to order one or two more pairs if they were satifactory - but they weren_'_t .
neutral	i would pay a higher price for better quality .
neutral	( i sewed up the holes to get a little more time out of them - but it won_'_t last ).
neutral	transportation was okay , a bit late on the pick_up and some_confusion on the way back .
neutral	as tour had a few german tourist , the tour_guide was german so all commentary were in german and english ... a bit long_winded so missing some of the sights while the translation is going on .
neutral	not too bad but i think the itinerary / time could be improved .
neutral	the customer_service was friendly and helpful .
neutral	we did receive our product a day later than they originally estimated .
neutral	other than that everything turned_out ok .
neutral	i may use them again .
neutral	your e_- gift_card designs are unattractive and limited .
neutral	you still have christmas designs up !
neutral	however , your customer_support has always been stellar .
neutral	it wasn_'_t until after i bought my tickets to see bruno mars that i saw how much bad_reviews viagogo a gotten .
neutral	i '_m really tatting to get worried and i was also curious to why they deliver so close to the event date .
neutral	petflow fills your inbox with too many emails .
neutral	if you really spend a few min . s too look on the site , you will find some decent deals , however , i was expecting more wholesale type of prices ... also i got billed on the 00th this mth , but as of today , the 00st , still no pet_food :/ so you have to gauge the days by at_least approx .
neutral	0 days out for shipping time , if your relying , on the food being there for your pet , and if your not relying_on it ?
neutral	it '_s still not seeming like there is that much of a perk here .. i may quit soon if i find better deals on my dogs ,' roll ', of food .. she '_s quite old & it '_s her special treat , besides the very occasional bits of real , beef or steak .
neutral	the products , buying process and delivery have been great , but searching for products on the website is pretty difficult .
neutral	needs some determination to find some more unusual spices / herbs .
neutral	this could definitely be improved .
neutral	glad to have received the part two_days sooner_than_expected but following the tracking status was a bit misleading .
neutral	took 0 days to receive part but the part matched perfectly
neutral	although i am really pleased with the speed , value and quality of my item i was really disappointed that my refund for the cancelled item was delayed for over 0_weeks with no_explanation .
neutral	i chased them twice but to no_avail .
neutral	only refunded once i raised a complaint with paypal so left me feeling less likely to use them again .
neutral	have used holiday autos on many occassions and they have always been really good , however this time they sub contracted to firefly which is located in the car_park ( not an easy trek with suitcases etc ) only to discover we had to take a number and we waited in it for over an_hour , really not good enough to have only two people to serve at_least two incoming flights .
neutral	the walking_tours were good and one of the bus_tour_guides was good , but the others were not .
neutral	our first guide talked really really fast and he just rambled on about random facts without delving into anything important .
neutral	for example , he hardly said anything about important spots in london but then prattled on in high speed about random unrelated facts .
neutral	the worst part of the experience was trying to find the bus_stops .
neutral	they were surprisingly difficult to find .
neutral	if you hopped_off and hopped back on at the same spot ( like at harrods ), you will be fine but if you walked anywhere and then tried to find the bus_stop , it was very very difficult .
neutral	ordering was easy .. and i '_ve ordered before and felt that it was a great experience .
neutral	i '_m a little frustrated not to have received my book after over 0_weeks
neutral	their products are not bad .
neutral	it '_s fair with the price
neutral	i received the ink in 0 days so was relieved that i could start again .
neutral	i also had to have someone show me how to remove the plastic covering because i couldn_'_t remove it
neutral	now i am using the black_ink only so_far .

neutral	i buy a chest of drawers and get a phone_call within hours to say that it can be delivered within a week if i pay lots more money .
neutral	but refusing to be conned in that way , i opt to wait weeks and weeks for delivery instead .
neutral	if the product is available and can be delivered quickly , why not deliver it quickly ?
neutral	it is poor after sale service in my opinion and very disappointing when the products are so good .
neutral	smarten up the delivery time , oak_furniture people .
neutral	incidentally , delivery guys were lovely white van men , polite and friendly .
neutral	i was contacted about 0 times to confirm delivery .
neutral	didn_'_t see our mat yet !
neutral	loved it online and have reasonable prices .
neutral	customer_service sucks .
neutral	it took_ages to sign_up , and the website asks for a lot of personal information , and even a driver '_s license and / or facebook confirmation ( i don_'_t put real info on facebook so i had to scan my dl in ).
neutral	it was lengthy , but secure .
neutral	the starting limit '_s pretty low ( after verification , i could only buy $_000 in one day and only about 000 monthly ?)
neutral	so i assume it '_ll eventually increase with more business .
neutral	onto the most annoying part .
neutral	i thought visa only called to make_sure the transaction was authorized for overseas websites but nooooo , visa called and woke me up at 0 am to have me verify the transaction was legit .
neutral	if this happens every_single time i decide to buy $_000 in gift_cards , i '_m just going back to walking down to 0 - 00 and buying the physical cards - because that is a wake - up call i don_'_t enjoy having .
neutral	all in all , okay , but super lengthy time .
neutral	required tons of personal information and resulted in visa giving me a wake_up call to make_sure that i actually did buy this .
neutral	ugh .
neutral	it took them forever to ship my product .
neutral	when i asked them why , i was told because it wasn_'_t in stock .
neutral	i would have liked to know that sooner .
neutral	but they did offer a small discount for it taking so long .
neutral	i ordered a few items a couple of mo . back 0 of them came in a timely_manner then i was notified that the other items where out of stock so after going back and fourth in the email i agreed to replace them after waiting for then to arrive 0_wks past i emailed rep . she said there where on the way ok waited 0 more wks again emailed rep . then i guess she got mad cause i said i wanted a refund cause they were taking to long so she said to me let_me explain it to u as usual and i hope u can understand it . so i again emailed her to let her know mot to talk to me like i don_'_t have an education she shouldn_'_t be talking to people that way then on top of it all i just received the items after waiting 0 plus mo .
neutral	for it i '_m going on vac 0 / 0 i wanted the order way before now so if it didn_'_t fit i could send it back etc .
neutral	but it '_s to late now thanks a lot
neutral	your orders are always short , most advertised items are on back order , company computer is outdated otherwise everything is okay
neutral	as nice as they were to deal with , the ink that i bought to use in my epson_printer did not work .
neutral	granted , it was not genuine epson_ink .
neutral	but i still thought if a company markets something for use that it would work .
neutral	now i have to replace the replacement and will end up buying ink twice to use it once .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t tried the hp_ink i purchased .
neutral	but i think i '_ll buy it '_s backup before i try it .
neutral	that one is for work and i can '_t leave it to get something that will work .
neutral	i need it to work when i need it .
neutral	thanks for trying , inkfarm .
neutral	i went to town_fair with an_appointment with my 0 year_old they took my car right_away but i still waited over 0 hours ( got 0 new_tires ) they didn_'_t have enough seats for everyone and offered no bathrooms
neutral	we were very happy with the peugeot 000 that we rented for a week in quimper .... at the train_station .
neutral	the only problem was the person at the desk said we did not have insurance on the car and had us sign another form which would cost 000_euros more !
neutral	when we asked auto_europe to check this , they responded_immediately saying that we did indeed have insurance .
neutral	they said to call the quimper office and tell them we had insurance .... and that we might have to return to quimper ( a 00 minute drive ) to settle the problem ..... luckily , the person answering the phone at avis said she would remove the charge and cancel the insurance .
neutral	we have not been charged , so_far , for the extra insurance .
neutral	i don_'_t think i will order from this company again .
neutral	the iron on name_tags don_'_t stick well .
neutral	they are peeling_off after one wash .
neutral	rates were good , but would have love to have known about the coupons on your web_site .
neutral	found a link about coupons at the bottom of the page ( small link ) after i placed our reservations .
neutral	i could have saved an_additional_$_00 . 00 off our reservations
neutral	i always get great service although sometimes it just seems like people there hate their jobs or simply do not enjoy being there .
neutral	after waiting the 0 days as stated in the website i contacted for a status_update only to be told that the waiting time is up to 0 days or more .
neutral	they just need to state this on the site ..... under promise and over deliver , not the other way round !
neutral	that way you will have people think ' what a great fast service ' rather_than ' bit_slow as they said it would be faster '.
neutral	i would have been happy to wait 0 + days if that was the timeline stated .
neutral	also , if you are going to be late , then an_email update giving the reason would be helpful , rather_than the customer having to chase for info .
neutral	glasses are great though , and great value for money , just need to tidy up your customer_service processes .
neutral	i purchased the scripto tech dual ballpoint stylus ( item #: 0000 - 00 ) from pinnacle_promotions .
neutral	i was really pleased with the customer_service at pinnacle_promotions , but i was disappointed how cheap our pens looked .
neutral	there are two seams on the barrel of the pen .
neutral	these seams were not visible in any of the preview pictures on the website .
neutral	our logo is directly above the seam so the seam is very obvious and it makes the pen appear very cheap and junky looking .
neutral	i will not bother to buy products from pinnacle_promotions in the future .
neutral	these are not quality promotional products that i am proud to pass out to potential_customers .
neutral	i have to say this website was very helpful ; filled with many , many hotels and hostels listed with great descriptions .
neutral	i really like how you can conveniently look at a map to see the location of the hotel and it '_s surroundings .
neutral	i did find reading the reviews ( both good and bad ) helpful in which hotel to chose .
neutral	however , when you see the " low_prices " listed on the page , i didn_'_t realize that it was a percentage of the grand_total of $_000 .
neutral	the total price is listed in a smaller don_'_t which was misleading at first .
neutral	i knew it was a too good to be true moment , but thankfully i saw the actual price before i purchased that hotel .
neutral	after learning this about the website , i did still find a good hotel and a price that was better for me !
neutral	it was alright but kinda far away from kamakura and a bit too pricey for what it was .
neutral	coffee is very weak .
neutral	also , i was charged a foreign_transaction fee , which i did not expect .
neutral	i like petflow for the most part , but i '_ve had my run - ins with their website - it leaves a little to be desired in the user_friendly department .
neutral	the only issue i had with my public_storage experience was that i left before my months rent was up and there was no money refunded to me .
neutral	first off let_me point out that i continue to use answer . co . uk and will shortly also be using it for my second business .
neutral	why ?
neutral	because of the 00 / 0 availability and low_cost .
neutral	if money were no object , i might think again .
neutral	some niggles - the website is clunky to use and really needs updating .
neutral	it '_s apparently very easy ( as i discovered ) to update your instructions in the wrong place .
neutral	looks right on the website , apparently doesn_'_t come up on the receptionist '_s screen .
neutral	not helpful .
neutral	in addition , you have to be very clear with your instructions - think giving instructions to a 0yo .
neutral	the receptionists don_'_t have a clue who your business is - understandably , given the amount of businesses they must answer calls for .
neutral	so you can have some very weird messages coming through !
neutral	but they do their best .
neutral	be clear in your own mind - do you want it to sound like a call_centre ?
neutral	do you want to sound like you have a whole sales_team just waiting in the middle of the night for them to put calls through but already overflowing with calls ?
neutral	" the lines are all busy at the moment , can i get someone to call you straight back ?"
neutral	isn_'_t ideal at 00pm when you ' re a one - man band !
neutral	takes a bit of work with them to get that to not happen and they could be more proactive and personal about their account management in that respect .
neutral	you can get a much more tailored , integrated service elsewhere - but at massively more cost and i haven_'_t found one that does 00 / 0 - the fact that answer . co . uk does 00 / 0 without offshoring to asia or charging a huge out - of - hours premium is a massive plus .
neutral	positives - they answer quickly and efficiently , the messages can come through on email and / or sms , you know someone '_s always going to answer your calls when you can '_t , the prepay option is really easy and very cost_effective .
neutral	would i recommend them ?
neutral	well yes , i '_m going to be using them again - but with the caveat that you must update with them regularly and give very accurate , clear_instructions .
neutral	call your number occasionally to see what your customers are experiencing and tweak accordingly .
neutral	and if you can get an account_manager to check over everything with you to make_sure everyone '_s on the same songsheet , even better .
neutral	overall though , excellent value for money , just a little hard work if you want to get them not to sound like a call_centre .
neutral	i like to use boiler_juice cos hopefully u get me the best price but this time fuel company messed me around on more than one occasion
neutral	i even spoke to the company to check when they were coming so i could be there and they still didn_'_t turn up .
neutral	also when i called them to find out what was happening they never called me back terrible customer_service but helpful driver once it did arrive .
neutral	as usual efficient service from boiler_juice but u might want to consider not using [_link ] too often , thanks .
neutral	i use to be able look at one to three_days plus or minus
neutral	around days i was looking at for best travel
neutral	rates .
neutral	now it '_s gone and when you talk to
neutral	customer_service they say depending_on
neutral	who you talk to it '_s still there or they removed
neutral	it for better customer_service
neutral	i love your shoes , and great prices , but i never get my email that its been shipped and my tracking_info , and its really fustrating .
neutral	information and rates were excellent ; however prepayment was a surprise .
neutral	unfortunately parcel_hero have twice delivered goods which on arrival were chipped or smashed however good customer_service received after the event .
neutral	they gave_me my order very quickly , but they were not selling authentic karma koins .
neutral	they were nx cards .
neutral	normally , this isn_'_t a big deal , but i was trying to put $ 0 on one account , and the rest on another .
neutral	it charged the entire card on that account , because only karma koins have the option to put however many points .
neutral	hello !
neutral	i have several animals , am super busy , and i hate to shop - your perfect customer .
neutral	but had i known the delivery would have taken a week , i would have looked elsewhere , or hit the stores .
neutral	but i am almost certain deliveries have been much_faster in the past .
neutral	perhaps i am thinking of a different delivery service .
neutral	could it be that it took so long because i purchased " extras " that i did not need .
neutral	is that so ?
neutral	it would be a good thing to know for next time so i could buy strategically .
neutral	thanks for asking
neutral	i have traded on ebay since it started .
neutral	at the beginning it was a much_better resource where people connected with one another to sell their stuff .
neutral	it was a great way to sell things that you no_longer needed ( or wanted ) or to find components you could not find locally .
neutral	things once sold at garage sales were suddenly available through ebay .
neutral	the prices were really decent .
neutral	there was a nice community of folks , too .
neutral	still is .
neutral	unfortunately ebay has evolved into a place where prices have gone way up and scalping is not unusual .
neutral	i have seen items selling for more than msrp ( sometimes double or even triple , depending_on how scarce the item is ).
neutral	usually it is something kids want with parents who do not know the value of teaching delayed gratification .
neutral	as in waiting until something is available at a reasonable price .
neutral	when a new video_game system is released , demand is usually much higher_than supply ; and , to some , no price is too high .
neutral	the same goes for some popular video games .
neutral	some will say this is a good thing .
neutral	i '_m not sure that greed is ever good .
neutral	when i say greed , i am not strictly speaking about sellers .
neutral	it is on the part of the buyers who must have something no_matter_how much they pay .
neutral	that was bound to happen .
neutral	ebay is no_longer the small community it once was .
neutral	it is still a darned good place to find things you cannot find anywhere_else .
neutral	vinyl albums ... older games , movies , etc .
neutral	that is what made ebay a good thing in the beginning and that has not changed .
neutral	just make_sure you know your prices .
neutral	and use paypal to protect yourself .
neutral	we bought the omega 0 test_kits .
neutral	our results were incredibly identical despite gender difference , nutrition differences , activity differences , supplement differences , historical background differences .
neutral	makes us think it is all bogus .
neutral	the first black_cartridge i used was half empty after just one day , with very little printing .
neutral	also , one of the color cartridges apparently leaked in the plastic container so i didn_'_t even open it .
neutral	i would like to return the color_cartridge in the unopened contained which had leaked but don_'_t know how to go about it ..
neutral	if you are from canada and want to use it to book in canada you get charged us funds because travelocity is a usa company .
neutral	which doesn_'_t make_sense .
neutral	the bouquet that was finally delivered to my dear_friend was very beautiful .
neutral	having 0 different delivery dates where the flowers were not delivered was frustrating , however my inquiries were always answered quickly and professionally , and finally the difficulty was solved .
neutral	i am glad they have a place to " track delivery " on their web_site or i would never have known there was a problem with the delivery , especially_since i do not live in the uk .
neutral	because of this delivery tracking ability i would probably use serenata again , i am sure this problem was highly unusual , although also highly frustrating .
neutral	i know there was a delay in the shipment because of weather , but i have still not received my food after a week when it was ordered .
neutral	i had to go buy more food to make it until my shipment arrived ( at a higher price , no less .)
neutral	i am a breeder , feed 0 rhodesian ridgebacks and having food is kind of critical .
neutral	i hope this is not the norm in the delivery from pet best .
neutral	prices are great , free_shipping ... hoping that after this initial shipment things will be more timely .
neutral	it would have been nice to recieve some_sort of notice that the shipment had been delayed so i could have planned more appropriately .
neutral	i '_ve referred this company to many of my puppy families so hoping we ' re going to get better service after this .
neutral	i found buyfencingdirect while desperately hunting for fence panels in a period of " national fencing shortage ".
neutral	the panels were reasonably_priced despite the national shortage and appear to be of good quality ( certainly much_better_than the oddments i had seen in large diy superstores ) and all match .
neutral	the delivery was a bit hit and miss .
neutral	having booked a day off work my delivery didn_'_t show up on the expected day due to a problem with the drivers , however the company did call relatively early on in the morning to explain this .
neutral	my delivery was then scheduled for the next_day , which wasn_'_t really convenient , but i was told since the van had been loaded it couldn_'_t be unloaded (!).
neutral	when the van arrived it turned_out only half my order was on it .
neutral	the driver was excellent , friendly and very helpful , he went beyond his call of duty and carried the fence panels into the garden , and got in touch with his boss to establish where the other half of my order might be .
neutral	he told me customer_services would be in touch within the hour .
neutral	a day later i rang customer_services to prompt them and they told me it was the first they ' d heard about the missing items .
neutral	a week_later the remaining items - landscape stakes - have arrived , again they appear to be good quality , were extremely well priced and were delivered by a ( different ) very courteous driver .
neutral	in a nutshell , the goods sold from buyfencingdirect seem to be worth the delivery hassle .
neutral	delivery unclear , and i received no status_updates on my order ( although i was emailed to say i would be notified when my package was shipped ).
neutral	the items are not anything like the images .
neutral	one item for instance , a dress , is two layers and still completely see through .
neutral	it has nothing to do with the style of the dress , rather it is simply low quality .
neutral	unimpressed with the products and service .
neutral	here goes friend !
neutral	i like the rugs i got !
neutral	i do not like they can not be put in dryer !
neutral	now the good part , i orders 0 rugs , large , medium and small .
neutral	i know i ordered one in the tan , or thought i had .
neutral	so have 0 maroons .
neutral	the medium one is not cut straight !
neutral	it is really off .
neutral	the other two are pretty good .
neutral	i would send them back , it is expensive so guess i will just keep them
neutral	whoever does the checking of the rugs , need fired !!!
neutral	!
neutral	sincerely a not happy customer ,
neutral	jo jordan
neutral	the shipping and selling part was easy , however once my books were received they were sold for a lot less_than i was quoted .
neutral	about 0 / 0 less !
neutral	by then it was too much_trouble to cancel my sell .
neutral	i just went along with it but can '_t help but feel_cheated .
neutral	next time i sell books i '_m going to look around .
neutral	it '_s probably my fault ?
neutral	i was able to place the order - paid and received a confirmaton .
neutral	then the day of delivery i was sent an_email_stating that it couldn_'_t be delivered that day as there was no florist available - i was disappointed as i would have probably tried another_vendor if i was told before ordering that it could not be delivered on saturday .
neutral	on the plus side - i was offered an upgrade to be delivered on the next business day or the opportunity to cancel .
neutral	i chose to upgrade .
neutral	i can '_t really follow_up with the recipient as they are sympathy flowers so it would be inappropriate - so i just have to assume that all is well .
neutral	this hotel is close to jfk and this was a plus for me .
neutral	the room was clean but service was poor .
neutral	the only breakfast item available was coffee .
neutral	i was a little disappointed !
neutral	with regards to dog_food orders i have been very pleased .
neutral	however petflow advertised a special on mountain tee_shirts .
neutral	i ordered 0 : one golden ret .
neutral	sz small and one stripe cat face sz small .
neutral	the order was accepted and several days_later i received a whoops we were just getting ready to send and found out we don_'_t have it .
neutral	i called and was told pf had the cat tee but not the golden_retriever .
neutral	so i called back and asked to make an addition to my order .
neutral	i was told now they had the golden ret .
neutral	but not the cat tee .
neutral	how did that happen ?
neutral	weren_'_t they holding what they had of my order ????
neutral	i was told they would send everything but the cat tee and that was due in anyday .
neutral	the next_day i received and email_stating it was in and on it '_s way to me .
neutral	two_days after that i received another " whoops we were just getting ready to send and found out we don_'_t have it .
neutral	what on earth is going on ?????
neutral	not happy needless to say .
neutral	either way .... i have not received anything so i don_'_t even know if the first part of the order was sent as_promised .
neutral	the service was stress_free for us and helpful as travelling with a small baby .
neutral	the only down_side was not being_able to get through to the mobile number given .
neutral	they should have more than one number
neutral	i sent a thank_you gift to my aunt and uncle from the states and i wanted to ensure they received it .
neutral	therefore , when asked about delivery options i chose knock on the door .
neutral	the gift was left_outside the gate although they said it was a secure area .
neutral	so as of now i am still unsure if my gift was received .
neutral	i '_ve order a few different things from inkgarden .
neutral	while i love their options and the ease of which you can create projects , i '_ve noticed a difference in color quality when i receive my purchases .
neutral	my last purchase was included three different mugs .
neutral	two of them had bluish undertones and the third seemed like the picture had bee lightened a bit .
neutral	the quality of the products is great , but the color seems inconsistent compared to my original photos .
neutral	i was to get a gift_card , instead i received a store credit_card !
neutral	when we had to change our return booking we knew it would be £_00 but in the end it cost us £_00 and when i asked what .
neutral	the difference was i was told it was because the ferry company had put up their prices .
neutral	saffron_rouge has really great products , ( although somewhat limited ).
neutral	however they can be penny wise and pound foolish .
neutral	for instance they advertised a big sale on vapour makeup ( a brand i love ).
neutral	when i put the product in my cart the discount didn_'_t show but i thought " ok it must be one of those things where the discount goes through when you check out ."
neutral	unfortunately that was not the case , so i contacted customer_service when my card was charged the full_amount , and it turned_out that only 0 shades were on sale , and the other shades were full price .
neutral	i felt this was deceptive , and they eventually gave_me a discount , but with a very grudging attitude .
neutral	it '_s a pity because i '_ve been a customer for years and have spent way more money than i want to admit with them .
neutral	it shouldn_'_t have been like pulling_teeth to get a discount especially when it was their promotion that led to the misunderstanding .
neutral	the end_result -- i prefer to buy my products on other_sites .
neutral	sad .
neutral	takes for ver to get refund and not only once .
neutral	right at this moment i haven_'_t got my refund for over 0_weeks not a good service :(
neutral	i '_m waiting to see if i get the correct_part and a rma in a timely_fashion .
neutral	i was pleased that the parcel came in good time , infact i was really impressed at the speedy_delivery , however , the box that the shoes were contained in was really worn and torn .
neutral	that was a great shame as it was meant to be a gift for someone .
neutral	i ended_up keeping one of the items and sending the footwear back which wasn_'_t made particularly easy as i had to cut out and stick plain paper over my address replacing it with a handwritten returns address .
neutral	no real problem with that but in this day and age returning goods should be made as convenient as possible for the consumer , right down to the company providing a sticky back returns slip .
neutral	it was nice to have a heavy_bag of dog_food delivered right to my door .
neutral	it was so convenient .
neutral	the draw_back was that i paid the same price i pay at the store for a larger bag , so ultimately , i paid for the luxury of not going to the store .
neutral	if i was home bound , i would definitely continue using this service , but since i '_m not , i '_ll continue to do my own shopping , since i try to use my money and time wisely .
neutral	i booked a ticket but enter a wrong return date .
neutral	now i would like to change that asap .
neutral	i just sent out the email ( this is the only way to contact you !!
neutral	), and after 00_hours , i got my reply .
neutral	i replied immediately for further request , no one reply to my request !
neutral	!
neutral	i have replied several emails now but got no reply !
neutral	!
neutral	so could the customer_service be a little quicker ?!??
neutral	your work load is that heavy ?!!
neutral	?
neutral	i have waited 00_hours now and i need to change the return date of my ticket asap !
neutral	!
neutral	will you reply my email then i have to wait 00 - 00_hours again ?!
neutral	could you be more efficiently ?
neutral	!
neutral	even i tried your online_chat but it is never online !
neutral	!
neutral	the room was comfortable and the staff pleasant .
neutral	however ... we were there for 0 nights , and after the first night , no one came to clean the room , make the beds , or change the towels .
neutral	possibly we returned to the room before the cleaning staff arrived , but to my knowledge no one asked if they could come and clean , or when would be a good time to come_back .
neutral	i had gone down to the pool area to relax , and there were a bunch of unsupervised teenagers running up and down the multilevel staircases , jumping over the gates , and being both disruptive and unsafe .
neutral	no hotel staff were anywhere_near to intervene .
neutral	trying to sleep at night was impossible .
neutral	several families across the hall had loud parties , crying children , and screaming adults well after midnight .
neutral	we seriously thought of leaving but at that hour weren_'_t sure where else to go .
neutral	i was exceptionally disappointed , especially_considering the reputation most marriott hotels have .
neutral	again , if i could get a reservation elsewhere i definitely would .
neutral	seriously , great job guys .
neutral	i was pleased that everything i ordered arrived only a few_days after i checked out ... however , i was really displeased that i got double_charged initially for the books because my address was not updated when i tried checking out for the first time .
neutral	that is something that should not have happened at all and it really ruined my day because i didn_'_t know that i was $_00 dollars down .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t caught the problem on time i could have been charged a lot of bank fees .
neutral	they tried , but the mattress needed replacing ( really sunken down on one side ), and the cold_water taps in the showers in both of our rooms were frozen shut .
neutral	my 00 - year - old_son finally got our tap free , but he was afraid that he was going to break the pipe in the process ( he '_s a weight - lifter ).
neutral	when i called the desk , they offered to have us shower in another room , but it was not worth the inconvenience since it was on a different floor and we needed to get going .
neutral	the man on duty was very apologetic and told me that their water is incredibly hard and causes lots of problems , so i understood what happened .
neutral	since i have really nasty hard water at home , i can sympathize , but it seems like the housekeeping_staff could turn the taps in unoccupied rooms and keep on top of problems to keep this from happening .
neutral	i wish you didn_'_t screw the delivery_men and restaurants when you take your cut .
neutral	i wish restaurants actually paid attention to the ' send no utensils / napkins / etc ' thing .
neutral	good price , but the delivery instructions are never acted on , so is there any point in writing them ?
neutral	not just a one - off - same problem with every order .
neutral	still - good value and i will_continue to use boiler_juice , but it '_s only chance that the order gets put in the correct tank .
neutral	identity_guard is pretty good - but i wonder_how accurate the results are ?
neutral	but , i would say to get it because they do give accurate alerts .
neutral	i have bought many items from oakfurnitureland which have mainly been very good .
neutral	the salesmen have been very pleasant and helpful as have the delivery_men .
neutral	the customer_service has not been good at all .
neutral	on one occasion i was told that i could not just have a replacement chest of drawers in place of a damaged one , but that they would repair the damaged one .
neutral	i was also told that if imreturned it and tried to order another one the same i would be refused by the online team and also that " what did i expect for the price i had paid ".
neutral	not what i expected from customer serrvice .
neutral	i have just been refused another exchange for a drawer with a lopsided handle .
neutral	i must send a photo and a photo of the label on the back of the chest o drawers , which i cannot get to as we had to remove some skirting board to get the drawers in with the help of a friend to lift it in , and my husband and i are unable to lift them .
neutral	after_spending over_£ 0 , 000 with the company i would really like better service when they get it wrong .
neutral	you can '_t go wrong with the clubmasters .
neutral	they are perfectly stylized , crystal - clear , and true quality .
neutral	however , my first order was lost , and the process to receive my glasses ended_up taking two months !
neutral	i am very satisfied with the glasses , but i would have trouble ordering again and trusting that my order would be received .
neutral	otherwise , beautiful glasses and worth the price .
neutral	the photo is cropped too close to the top -- doesn_'_t look good in a frame -- not like it was on the proof -- very disappointing !
neutral	business cards were great .
neutral	but i ordered ' postcards ' and supplied design for the front .
neutral	thinking form the website pics that it was standard postcard graphics on the back and nothing for me to do for that .
neutral	no comment made by the shop .
neutral	but they came back as printed only on one side , effectively a0 cardboard flyers , looking a bit odd .
neutral	feel it should have been picked_up on , and the postcard should be supplied as a postcard , otherwise i would have gone for a flyer .
neutral	initial contact was haphazard by e_mail but i think that was due to summer holidays from staff .
neutral	website works well .
neutral	ihan kohtuulliset valikoimat ja edulliset hinnat verrattuna monn muihin sivuihin .
neutral	toimitus tuli 0 päivää tilauksesta .
neutral	hieman epäselvät sivut kun osa englanniksi ja osa suomeksi .
neutral	rahan lähteminen tililtä kesti todella kauan ja näin ollen epäilin ettei paketti koskaan edes saavu , mutta tuli se sieltä lopulta .
neutral	:) aion tilata uudelleen kun ymmärsin tämän maksusysteeminkin viimein !
neutral	the car we rented was great .
neutral	it was a ford_fiesta .
neutral	driving back to london , we stopped at the last
neutral	service station on the m0 before we dropped the car off at avis .
neutral	we looked for another chance to top up the car but couldn_'_t find one .
neutral	after driving 00_miles on a very full_tank to get back to the drop_off point , avis charged us 00 . 00_pounds for not having a full_tank .
neutral	i think this was totally unreasonable and just put a huge blemish on a really good experience .
neutral	the product arrived and was exactly_what i expected .
neutral	the downside was that order processing took over 0_weeks and then it finally shipped .
neutral	their prices were the same or slightly_higher_than those in my local_pet_store .
neutral	add shipping onto that and i end up paying more .
neutral	i have no plan to work with them again , unless some really good deal comes into play .
neutral	otherwise the experience was fine , shipping was quick .
neutral	the 00 cans of dog_food were packed on the bottom of the box , shrink wrapped together in a smaller carton .
neutral	the three five pound_bags of dry_dog_food were on top of the cans .
neutral	there was dry_food spilled throughout the carton since the three bags were torn .
neutral	now i '_ll have to tape up the two bags that won_'_t be needed for awhile so the food stays fresh .
neutral	ordered wrong product .
neutral	tried to call and was on hold for over a half_hour .
neutral	you need more help to assist new customers .
neutral	i am returning the wrong product and want the correct product .
neutral	ordered left power mirror 00000 00000000 and the support_ticket is 000000 .
neutral	i checked online again and found the correct one that is the left side driver power remote mirror 00000 00000000 .
neutral	all i want is to exchange the mirror .
neutral	i am not happy with waiting on the phone to get help from you .
neutral	i hope i get the right mirror on exchange .
neutral	when you put an order on line , surely they should let you know if the item is in stock or not .
neutral	i was hoping to complete a couple of projects over the easter_weekend , but as i only received clock hands and not the movements , this could not happen .
neutral	disappointed or what
neutral	i called a few different times just because i needed a walk through on the website with a couple different things and they were trying to charge me a manual fee !
neutral	for helping_me ?
neutral	i just though that was weird ...
neutral	but other than that everything is great ...
neutral	i '_m not overly impressed .
neutral	i ordered a beatles gift pen set which included the pen box for $_00 . 00 .
neutral	i received three beatles pens in a zip lock bag that sells for $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i called and was told they would send me the correct item .
neutral	i '_m waiting .
neutral	i paid about $_00 for a hotel room ( online it was shown as $_00 + taxes ) i was given a bill at the hotel showing the actual charge to travelocity '_s card , which was $_00 .
neutral	i expected a service fee : a markup of $_00 for the booking seems too steep .
neutral	i '_ll call the hotel next time .
neutral	i just don_'_t get excellent service .
neutral	the phones are good , but other than the mytouch slide , they ' re just average phones .
neutral	i only get 0g for about 0 mins at a time , and then it disappears for like 00_mins and then comes back .
neutral	i tend to shy away from this site because of your extreme shipping prices , only ordering when i absolutely have to to get the shoes i need , which are usually on clearance , so i can make up for the shipping .
neutral	please lower your shipping so i can order more often !
neutral	please !
neutral	i do love your shoes .
neutral	so much extra fabric looks hand made not frm a actual store . no tags cricket hemline just not wat i expected
neutral	i mistakenly ordered food for my dog (# 000000 ) on november 0th and then realized the last time i ordered i set it up for automatic delivery .
neutral	i immediately contacted petflow and " talked " with danny .
neutral	i was told to just cancel the order i had just placed and it would ship out on the 00th (# 000000 - the originally scheduled automatic date ).
neutral	i did that and guess what , i got the order placed november 0th ...
neutral	i then went in and cancelled all of my automatic_shipments and had to contact petflow again , this time " talking " to tracey to ensure that i wasn_'_t going to get another bag of food .
neutral	at that time , she told me that everything had been cancelled .
neutral	luckily i was able to catch the fact that the mistaken order was still being shipped ... hopefully this will never happen again ( my mistakenly ordering food when i have it set for automatic_shipment ), but what should i have done differently ?
neutral	most reviews state same thing .
neutral	can '_t speak to a real_person .
neutral	so i pressed 0 , for a new order and guess what ?
neutral	an actual real_person ...
neutral	i was disappointed that the antlers split so easily .
neutral	my puppy swallowed too much and was ill until she had loose stools and threw up several_times .
neutral	when the shards came out she settled down .
neutral	if information is shown as free cancellation - and you faced that it '_s not free and hotel will change you the whole stay !!!
neutral	you would be very frustrated !
neutral	it had a king_size bed for close to $_00 a night , plus tv and all the nice little sample - size trinkets .
neutral	plus it had a window and some hotels don_'_t have windows .
neutral	the only bad thing is that it had no complimentary_breakfast , the pool was closed for the season , and the outside wasn_'_t that pleasing to the eye .
neutral	but to come to rest after a long day of sight seeing , it wasn_'_t that bad .
neutral	had been told that delivery would be two working days but it wasn_'_t .
neutral	so i rang rubbersole up to be told there had been a delay .
neutral	anyway , they arrived safe and sound yesterday while i was in london
neutral	i love all the clothes here on yesstyle . com .
neutral	whatever style i '_m looking for is on this website .
neutral	however , the sizing options are so limited that i rarely buy anything because i know the thing i '_m looking for won_'_t fit .
neutral	delivery . com needs a few things to get where it needs to be .
neutral	first , the ui is ugly and at times nonfunctional .
neutral	it needs to be more fluid .
neutral	second , more restaurants need to participate .
neutral	seamless has many more than delivery . com .
neutral	i do enjoy to $ 0 coupons they give out from time to time .
neutral	have placed at_least 00 orders with this company over the last 0 months , delivery can vary from 0 days to 0_weeks , out of stock items are not highligted on ordering , i have apid for cat wormer presuming they are in stock only to be told 0 days_later they are out of stock , no good when you have kittens that need worming .
neutral	also had items never turn up waited a week for them to arrive but to no_avail only turned_up when i contacted the company by phone .
neutral	good prices but service and delivery could vastly be improved if i treated my pet shop customers this way they would not come_back to my shop .
neutral	i was expecting a free hairbrush which did not come with my order !!
neutral	not overly impressed i have to say !
neutral	!
neutral	my package had two products that had opened in transport .
neutral	my cat_litter was opened and spilled into box .
neutral	the pack of dog_treats bones was opened and in the box .
neutral	delivery is very good but i took delivery of a t0000 a couple days ago and it keeps showing as nearly empty and as the epsom is not the easiest of printers to reload cartridges this is very inconvenient .
neutral	delivery . com is a great site and i order from the site frequently .
neutral	discounts on food are frequent and the payment / delivery system is overall efficient .
neutral	however , the ratings on certain food venues are not as reliable , and have room for improvement .
neutral	there are some glitches on menus of certain places that could also use attention .
neutral	other than that , delivery . com ensure fast , decent food when i need it .
neutral	i was very happy with price and service but there was no card with the flowers which ruined the whole point of sending flowers .
neutral	a bit of a shame
neutral	it was nice to order some flowers from the united_states and have them delivered to the u . k . to my husband ’_s nan for her 00th_birthday .
neutral	i searched several sites to find a good deal and found teleflorist . com they seem to have a nice bouquet for a really good deal .
neutral	i ordered them with no_hassle , ask for them to be delivered in the morning and they were as requested , but the unfortunate thing is the flowers didn ’ t look anything like the ones advertised online .
neutral	they almost made me feel embarrassed to even have sent them to her .
neutral	lesson_learned i guess ‘ you get what you pay for ’!
neutral	site is ok although not as clean as before , assistance in office is great , very personable .
neutral	but why does public_storage continually try to raise my rent when i pay by automatic payment over many , many years without_fail , without being late , without hassles .?
neutral	it is so very annoying to have to call to readjust my rent all the time -- why ?
neutral	i have had a space since 0000 , and have down sized , and may find another place altogether because of this .
neutral	items arrived quickly but one box was faulty .
neutral	the vision was blurred and was fine with my old lenses .
neutral	i spoke with a customer_service representative who seemed helpful but it took further call to arrange replacement .
neutral	i understand that manufacturer problems occur but be aware normally with lens_store you would be expected to send back the lenses , they then get then analysed and then send you replacements .
neutral	not sure what you are supposed to do without in meantime .
neutral	my problem was / is being sorted but only because of insistence .
neutral	i love this site !
neutral	the only problem is before they use to have $ 0 . 00 shipping on orders $_00 or less and now they '_ve changed it .
neutral	so i have to wait for an awesome deal to place an order since i '_m on a budget and i don_'_t like paying so much shipping .
neutral	other than that this site is wonderful and a life_saver !
neutral	picked_up a new merc from venice airport , no manual on how to operate the car , even that the car engine cuts out when stopped in traffic or lights .
neutral	makes it very hard to use all the features of the car , becomes trial and eroor and time_consuming process
neutral	now that i have spent $ 0 , 000 dlls .
neutral	with bookit , i can not get any information on the tour or hotels , i have booked with them ?
neutral	like where to get picked_up , address of hotels ??
neutral	?
neutral	checked the site but from one night to next the price and available rooms varied greatly .
neutral	should have booked right_away instead of waiting to find a better price .
neutral	i ordered two beach towels from simply_beach .
neutral	they were both faulty , the stitching on the simply_beach logo was unravelling on both towels .
neutral	i spoke to customer_services and they advised me to send them back which i did .
neutral	i was refunded for only one towel and have been told that i will have to wait_until they have done a stock check before i am refunded for the second towel .
neutral	i think this is poor service .
neutral	apart_from this i have been very pleased with this company .
neutral	one of the planes was cleaner than the other .
neutral	everything was sold out like wine etc at the outbound flight from stockholm , not good
neutral	i paid_extra to get it in 0 days . but it did not come in on the 0nt day . was to come in on tues and did not get it till wed im not happy to have paid for to day shipping and it took 0
neutral	i '_m still_waiting on parts that i ordered
neutral	don_'_t know if it was the plant ( which looked healthy when it arrived ) or the transplanting , but it promptly died .
neutral	it was quite pricey ( went to 00_% the day after i ordered ), so i would be reluctant to try again .
neutral	i have used travelocity many_times .
neutral	always had a good experience .
neutral	however , with my last trip , i flew with jetblue .
neutral	my morning flight home was canceled due to a crew member being sick .
neutral	jetblue had no contingency plan so the flight was canceled .
neutral	not another one until the next_day .
neutral	they would not put me on a flight with a different airline even_though flights were available .
neutral	they didn_'_t offer me vouchers or pay for my extra expenses staying one more night .
neutral	when i called travelocity to get help getting on another flight , they could not help me .
neutral	i called three_times .
neutral	all three_times i could not understand the customer_service rep . two times i was kicked off the phone_call due to system problems and had to call back .
neutral	very frustrating travel experience !
neutral	will never fly jetblue again .
neutral	love the variety available but a bit disappointed that i have not received confirmation of actual delivery ... i will mail myself next time ...
neutral	waited in all day and it didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	still heard_nothing two_days_later .
neutral	had to ring pine_solutions and they gave a £_00 . 00 refund for the problems we had received .
neutral	not too impressed ..... our first order .... and the drawers are not flush on the unit .....
neutral	sloooooooooooooooow shipping !!!
neutral	it was like waiting for the pony_express !
neutral	fedex is awful !!!
neutral	ordered on oct 0th and didn_'_t get it until oct 00th .
neutral	this is not normal for petflow . com to take this long in getting my purchase to me .
neutral	typically i am very pleased w_/ petflow and i receive my order within 0 business days .
neutral	i placed my order on friday_morning , may 00 and today is tuesday , may 00 and i still don_'_t have my product .
neutral	my cats are getting extremely low on food !
neutral	fedex shipping is the worst way to send it !
neutral	parts are a decent price .
neutral	however i was in one state where i needed my car part sent to and you would not ship to me here .
neutral	i called and was on hold for 00_minutes before i hung_up without ever speaking to a csr .
neutral	i then ordered the part with a different card and it went through .
neutral	i sent numerous_emails to cancel the first order with the explanation , still no response .
neutral	i am assuming and need to check that the first one did not go through as i received a email_saying it was on hold .
neutral	i ordered a " skid plate " for my car , as mine had fallen_off on the interstate .
neutral	i took it to the oil change folks , who typically have to take it off to change the oil .
neutral	they said it didn_'_t have the connectors ( bolts ?
neutral	fasteners ?
neutral	whatever ?)
neutral	to attach it and therefore they couldn_'_t put it on .
neutral	i had a several email exchange with partsgeek , with many days between each , with the upshot being that partsgeek didn_'_t feel it was necessary to provide the parts to attach the plate .
neutral	not helpful at all with customer_service ... i am not happy with my experience .
neutral	i received the books in a timely_manner but the used books were in horrible condition .
neutral	last_year i ordered double bloom roses , meyer lemon_tree and a lime tree .
neutral	while the roses were supposed to be the same size , two came much smaller and one had to be replaced this year .
neutral	the lime tree produced many limes during the summer but died inside during the winter , cause unkown .
neutral	the lemon_tree is doing well .
neutral	this year i ordered lavendar which arrived completely out of their pots and grey - they were all dead .
neutral	i ordered one bouganvilla which arrived not in a pot but wrapped in " wet " paper towel that was dry by the time it arrived .
neutral	plant was dead .
neutral	i called brighter_blooms and they replaced it however new plant arrived in same condition as prior .
neutral	i didn_'_t call to complain but bought one from a local_nursery that is doing fine .
neutral	unfortunately , i won_'_t be ordering a plants from this company in the future .
neutral	petflow has good pricing but shipping and customer_service needs improvement .
neutral	i bought some small items to check out shipping before purchasing dog_food .
neutral	i live in las_vegas and thought that my order would ship directly from the las_vegas warehouse to my house .
neutral	however the order shipped to az first then back to las_vegas .
neutral	when i contacted cs regarding the issue , i was advised this is how it is done and the agent referred me to the 0 - 0 day delivery schedule .
neutral	not only was i disappointed in how my order was handled by way of shipping , the agent seemed to not care too much about my complaint .
neutral	petflow needs to state on their site how shipping works and let the customer decide if they want to place orders with this shipping method .
neutral	not take our money , then report how it will be sent .
neutral	i have been in dogs for over 00 years .
neutral	i run a dog rescue and train dogs .
neutral	i look for good prices and good customer_service .
neutral	as long as i know in advance how my items will ship , i can then plan orders and delivery times to meet the needs of my dogs and the needs of my customer '_s dogs .
neutral	petflow needs to improve before i will be placing another order or refer them to anyone_else .
neutral	sincerely ,
neutral	barbara h
neutral	code of honor working dog rescue
neutral	i was pleased that the colors were true to what was presented on the site .
neutral	however , my magnets are misshapen ; they are not rectangular .
neutral	also , the text that i had aligned on the computer was not aligned on the actual magnet .
neutral	once my order was shipped , it took an_additional 0 days to arrive .
neutral	i will be taking my business elsewhere next time .
neutral	things i loved :
neutral	poncho , map & headphone give - aways
neutral	the route and choices of route
neutral	things i wished for :
neutral	some info on any potential delays - e . g .
neutral	roadworks .
neutral	this would have helped_us . we would have known quickly that we would not get to buckingham_palace in time for changing of the guard due to road works and made an_alternative route .
neutral	i had a schedule that would have meant we would have got there in plenty of time but for road works .
neutral	there should be an obvious sign on the bus if that one is carrying a tour_guide ( or at_least the driver should have notified us ).
neutral	we preferred the buses with tour_guides as_opposed to the headphone guide which lacked personality and was temperamental .
neutral	all - in - all i do not feel i got value for money .
neutral	i like this website and was super happy i could just rent my textbook and send it back .
neutral	i was a little shocked when it came and it was a " loose_leaf " edition .
neutral	i have never had a book in loose_leaf format , but it was what i needed so i didn_'_t think it was a big deal .
neutral	what got me bent outta shape was that the print color was so light on a lot of my pages that i could_barely ready it without straining my eyes .
neutral	i have to be in super bright light to read this book , this aggravates me and i think it stinks .
neutral	my course is only 0 more weeks so by the time i send it back and get a new the class will be over .
neutral	i am not even bothering with it .
neutral	i used the system to send airtime and was very excited how convenient that was .
neutral	later tried to send money but couldn_'_t , no option for money transfer from us to kenya .
neutral	am i the only one who is not getting it ?
neutral	very pleased with my purchase but unfortunately i will not be purchasing again .
neutral	sorry to say but the cost of your postage and packing makes the item expensive .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t received my order and i '_m almost out of blanche '_s pills .
neutral	not sure why it would take so long .
neutral	i usually get delivery of on - line orders within 0 days tops .
neutral	i ordered 00 plain cow_ears and received 0 bags of 00 - white dried cow_ears that my dog enjoyed each and every day !
neutral	i place a second order but was very disappointed ... upon_receipt of 0 bags of 00 each - the total white dried cow_ears in the first bag was 0 .
neutral	the rest of the cow_ears are brown and greasy and my dog hates them .
neutral	i will not order from petflow again - i '_ll pay the higher price in the stores to get what i ask for .
neutral	it '_s great to be able to personalize a card , but why does it cost over $ 0 to send just a basic card ?
neutral	wish you can extend discounts to long - time customers : customer_service rep are not very friendly at that suggestion
neutral	placed my order on line last wednesday , then called to make_sure i could get the food for delivered by friday .... was told it would be delivered on friday when i arrived in atlanta .
neutral	received it on saturday ( two meals too late ) ..... not good since my dog is usually on a raw diet ( hard to travel with raw meat long_distances so tried this food when traveling with him to nc ).
neutral	thought i would try it again but ran_out of time so asked to have it at my destination by friday .
neutral	oh well .
neutral	lyn
neutral	just placed my first order .
neutral	so will rate when order received .
neutral	ordering was easy
neutral	i feel that it is a good website overall but it is very hard to find exactly_what you want .
neutral	my item is now on back order .
neutral	i will not get it for another month !
neutral	it is a very unorganized site but over all it had the cheapest prices for what i was looking for
neutral	i am_disabled and decided it would be much_easier to buy my pet_supplies ( 0 cats ) through delivery by pet_flow .
neutral	last_week , the delivery man delivered four boxes and dumped them in my foyer .
neutral	when i opened the boxes , two of the boxes of litter had torn_open on all four corners and litter flowed all over the foyer tile and living_room carpet .
neutral	i had to run to the garage ( and i certainly don_'_t run well ) and grab litter_boxes to try to contain the mess .
neutral	meanwhile the cats were sniffing around and i was afraid they would eliminate or defecate on the litter .
neutral	i then had to sweep up what i could to keep the cats away and hire someone to come the next_day to thoroughly vacuum .
neutral	i don_'_t want anything -- you asked for my opinion and you now have it .
neutral	believe me , it would have been easier to bring the litter home on the bus which my residence provides weekly for shopping .
neutral	in all fairness prior to this time i had a positive_experience with pet_flow and was glad to have found them .
neutral	when i am paying for 0 day shipping i expect that my order will go out the next_day , not 0 - 0 days_later and then 0 day shipping .
neutral	i '_ve used other_sites and there 0 day shipping is truly 0 days .
neutral	charged 0 / book to be shipped out and they were small books and came in the same package , could understand if they were two different packages , but 00 / for one package was a little excessive .
neutral	in they end they worked with me on the shipping issues and made good with me which i appreciated .
neutral	i was told i can '_t order through the contact in watford because he isn_'_t linked up to the web offers or something , so ended_up having to pay for postage when i usually pick it up myself , which is quicker also .
neutral	otherwise all very good and punctual and good service .
neutral	thanks
neutral	great experience buying products but the ' no_hassle return_policy ' hasn_'_t turned_out to be that way .
neutral	i am still_waiting to hear back from someone about trying to return two products i used that said " unconditionally guaranteed ' on the box .
neutral	because they didn_'_t work for me , i want to return them but was told i ' d have to wait to get a call back with their decision .
neutral	been two_days , called twice .
neutral	blah , blah ...
neutral	i ordered two t - shirts for my husband .
neutral	one was a boston_terrier shirt , and the other was supposed to be a french_bulldog t - shirt , but was actually a picture of a pug , not a french_bulldog .
neutral	the shirt even had frenchy embossed on the front of the shirt .
neutral	the hotel was just fine , and the staff was helpful .
neutral	however , they asked me for a credit_card to put on file ( as always ), then accidentally charged me for the room the next_morning , even_though i had purchased the room through_travelocity .
neutral	that is when i found out that i could have gotten the room for $_00 cheaper had i simply called the hotel .
neutral	it was quite a disappointment .
neutral	it caused me to just make reservations directly with the hotels for the remainder of my trip .
neutral	i did check prices on travelocity for these hotels beforehand , and the pricing was about the same .
neutral	i always thought that i was getting a better deal through_travelocity , but i have learned differently through this experience .
neutral	the pass was not received before my departure , thus i needed to arrange for self collection , but the collection_point was difficult to find and very inconvenient .
neutral	the pass does not cover the journey from airport to other stops in paris which is something may not be known by the buyer .
neutral	will not recommend paris pass to my friends and relatives
neutral	its good , but to much .
neutral	some flowers didn_'_t arrive in the best condition .
neutral	i was very surprised that my parcel came from sweden especially as it cost over 0 pounds to return shoes too big .
neutral	i was not given a return_label so was somewhat disappointed .
neutral	thgis should have been made clear when ordering
neutral	some of the big_bus workers were abrupt and did not feel that they should answer the questions you asked .
neutral	the vouchers were not immediatley given , you had to ask for them and then signposted to a hut to obtain them .
neutral	at no point did anyone inform you that these were available for you on the trip .
neutral	i did not feel that the bus transported you to the venues to enable you to make use of the vouchers .
neutral	i am not unhappy with the service or product but to pay considerable postage only to have the item damaged because it had not been put in packaging correctly would make me think_twice about buying online from this company again .
neutral	the drop_off was good although had to wait some 00 - 00_minutes but no problem as arrived early and although parked on yellow lines no one was around to move me on .
neutral	the collection was very frustrating as i could not make contact on the phone details provided which resulted in a a 00 minute delay and approx 0 phone_calls later having been directed by their telephonic system to gatwick and heathrow and through my perserverance eventually_managed to obtain a local contact number .
neutral	the staff were very friendly but debateable if i would use them again .
neutral	the range of products is fantastic , with heaps of stuff you can '_t find in stores .
neutral	but be careful of the images !
neutral	the images are heavily photoshoped , so colours can come out very differently ie something that looks white can turn out to be yellow .
neutral	and fabrics will often be cheap less durable fabrics .
neutral	really inspect the photos , and if in doubt , don_'_t get it !
neutral	all that being said i have had some really good buys , with super_fast shipping and usually decent customer_service ( they accept_returns for faulty goods , but not colour or appearance variances )
neutral	the brush is a waste as i have a cat and does not like it too rough and he likes combs .
neutral	so i will give it to someone with a dog i guess .
neutral	the bracelet is impractical .
neutral	however the treats and toy is a hit and great .
neutral	i will buy them in the future .
neutral	i will cancel the monthly package so i can get the items form petflow i want for my cat instead of getting items not practical for a 00 yo cat .
neutral	be nice if you asked for info about animal to meet needs .
neutral	thanks any way for giving us a chance to try new items that is great
neutral	this is a terrific site with good info to help you decide what to buy , but i am disappointed with the latest change in the website .
neutral	i was told the shipping on my epson paper was free , but when i checked out , it did not offer free_shipping , but instead made me choose which shipping option i wanted for $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	bait and switch is not appreciated .
neutral	maybe i '_ll use adorama next time if this isn_'_t fixed .
neutral	i was disappointed to find that petsmart had better prices .
neutral	i guess the benefit is that the food is shipped to the house but you still pay extra for that .
neutral	overall , it '_s not worth the extra money unless you have a coupon and get free_shipping .
neutral	the capsules from fine_coffee club are made of plastic rather_than aluminum , so the look and feel is not the same .
neutral	it is a bit more difficult to press the lever down prior to making a cup .
neutral	at first we were afraid we might break the machine we had to press so hard .
neutral	but it appears to be working fine now that we are used to it .
neutral	overall the quality of the coffee is good , maybe not quite as good as nespresso '_s .
neutral	the shopping and delivery was flawless .
neutral	bought a lot of xmas stocking_stuffers .
neutral	funny stuff
neutral	i flew out of minneapolis on the same morning as president obama flew in .
neutral	we sat in our delta plane on the tarmac for 0 . 0 hours !
neutral	missed my connecting_flight out of atlanta .
neutral	at_least finding and purchasing tix via travelocity was smooth - sailing .
neutral	c ' est la vie !
neutral	good service and received calls from drivers on the morning of the flights .
neutral	only issue was i received confirmation emails and texts which matched up to the flights i booked , but on the ' print screen ' pages , the collection times were different .
neutral	i think there is a cell on your website where it asks for collection time but it '_s not clear whether it '_s for the outbound or return flight so there was a bit of confusion .
neutral	thanks
neutral	you were supposed to notify when you shipped food and the food was here before needed .
neutral	took 0 more weeks
neutral	very easy to find and compare prices .
neutral	once we got to the storage_facility that we picked , it was quite the same descriptions / prices / sizes as stated on selfstorage . com
neutral	i have " attempted " to place 0 separate_orders on 00dollarmall . com and each time i paid and received a confirmation_email .
neutral	the first order , i received very promptly however , it was missing something .
neutral	nobody bothered to tell me that one of my items was out of stock and it wouldn_'_t be re - stocked - i had to call them to find out !.
neutral	they were awesome at the customer_service part , extremely_helpful and nice ( i know it wasn_'_t there fault the website showed items in stock that really weren_'_t ).
neutral	i then placed a second order , same thing !
neutral	i received a successful order confirmation and it wasn_'_t until a couple of days_later - this time i did get an_email_saying my order was canceled - however with no_explanation so i called .
neutral	was told the item was out of stock !
neutral	take it off your website then before people place orders !
neutral	so frustrating !
neutral	( i really wanted those boots too !)
neutral	:)
neutral	amazon has almost always been a very good website , though i have encountered an_error .
neutral	i was charged for something i never recieved .
neutral	i believe this was the fault of a third_party , but i think it reflects poorly on amazon as a whole that there is not assurance or screening process for whom they deal with .
neutral	easy shopping , efficient delivery , however quality of product disappointing .
neutral	have returned item and are waiting for refund .
neutral	i love the idea of giving out gift_cards that could be used anywhere .
neutral	i '_m all for it !
neutral	but i have seen some problems .
neutral	the designs are very limiting , i could not find too many that i liked or matched what my recipient ( my music loving sister ) wanted .
neutral	i also had no shipping date or tracking_number .
neutral	how would i know my gift arrived on time ?
neutral	or when it was going to arrive ?
neutral	i wouldn_'_t .
neutral	however , that being said , the site was friendly and payment was easy .
neutral	i have yet to receive my third item i ordered almost a month_ago .
neutral	and no money returned .
neutral	i was really excited to see the layout of the program .... very user_friendly .
neutral	then i got to the id vault section that is included with the subscription .
neutral	that is when i realized it requires windows xp , vista or windows 0 .
neutral	i am an apple mac user all the way and shocked they didn_'_t allow for those not on microsoft .
neutral	very disappointing !
neutral	!
neutral	i am really surprised this review was sent to me as it took 0 visits before my dryer was repaired .
neutral	it is now operating perfectly .
neutral	i really believe it was a personnel issue .
neutral	my dryer had a strange smell but was was getting hot and drying the clothes .
neutral	repairman came said the smell was lint fires , he cleaned everything took 0 0 / 0 hours n left .
neutral	i used the dryer and now it had a different odor .
neutral	he came back and said something had dislodged and it was venting inside the dryer .
neutral	he fixed it , apologized and left .
neutral	i used the dryer it was ice cold .
neutral	same guy returned and said some part had worn out ( like my patience ).
neutral	i called the company they sent a new repairman who was here less_than 00_minutes and all is well .
neutral	the company was very responsive so i give them credit
neutral	i really like this site , but they don_'_t always ship what you order then you have to email them to be credited for items not shipped . if you call on the phone for customer_service , plan on being on hold for an average of 00_minutes .
neutral	it is very frustrating not receiving what you order , and have to get_ahold them to be refunded !
neutral	!
neutral	i have ordered a 0 times , just this past week , and was short shipped on both orders
neutral	i like the facility , however it seems that the corporate headquarters have only the bottom_line in their heads .
neutral	the bait and switch comes to my mind , you are given a somewhat great deal to start , then look out a few_months later the price increases starts .
neutral	i had a problem with another facility and was advised to speak to the main office .
neutral	let_me tell you i was so disgusted with the way that man spoke to me , i would not recommend this company to anyone .
neutral	he was very unprofessional , and now i understand the reason_why some of the lower level people act the way they do .
neutral	it must be a bitch to work for for this company
neutral	due to the fact that my items were shipped from two locations i was charged $_00 . 00 and i feel that i should of only been charged 0 shipping charge for the order that i placed
neutral	i received the product ordered in a timely_manner without_any fuss , but when package arrived the product packaging looked like it went thru the war .
neutral	product was all over the box .
neutral	not professional .
neutral	ordered highway to heaven 0 and it didn_'_t come with order sooo blow off answer when i asked when i would get it was " gee your the second one today to call about that "-- when i asked again " oh i don_'_t know , call us if it don_'_t show up in 00 or 00 days "-- would have been nice if i had gotten a firm date .
neutral	i only got five items and ended_up returning three .
neutral	all of which had some_sort of readily apparent defect .
neutral	i spoke to the company and they assured_me that their items were not defective .
neutral	i just don_'_t_believe that ; that many defective items tells_me that that is what they are buying wholesale ; defective merchandise .
neutral	i took them out of my facebook likes , as well as their sister company " 00dollarmall " ( seemingly the same deal : selling defects ).
neutral	i would not recommend either site , and neither will get my money going forward .
neutral	took a week and a half to get my part , bad customer_service .
neutral	i won_'_t order from them again
neutral	i hear of that twitter is so popular around , so i register it , but i found it is difficult to me , i don_'_t know how to post photo , find friends and many other things , oh , i think i am out
neutral	easy to use website .
neutral	good deals .
neutral	nice gui and presentation of info .
neutral	it frustrates me to pay another fee when paying with credit_card .
neutral	so if i find the same deal , in another website , without_having to pay credit_card charges , i will change to that website .
neutral	comprar foi fácil , o único problema é que eu nunca recebi os produtos .
neutral	fico muito triste com isso pois , já passaram mais de três meses , e nada .
neutral	o pior de tudo é que o número de rastreio não funciona , eu coloco para rastrear no site dos correios a mensagem que tenho é que não há dados da compra , e coloco no site muambator , aparece como pacote não rastreável , e pior de tudo é que fiquei sabendo pelo correio que_se a encomenda não é rastreável , eles vem em casa com tres tentativas de entrega , mas como nao dá para rastrear , a encomenda volta , e nao tem como eu saber se vieram ou nao , pois eles nao deixam aviso para esse tipo de encomenda .
neutral	é uma grande pena , pois eu faço uso de suplementos , mas infelizmente fiquei no prejuizo , e nao tem como comprar mais , pois nao sei se vou receber , e também nao quero mais perder dinheiro .
neutral	the display boards arrived within 0 days of ordering , but they do not click onto each other very well .
neutral	our room was fine until we tried to sleep .
neutral	the curtains could not close , they were narrow decoration though made to be light stopping .
neutral	someone had placed a strong clip on one curtain and i soon pulled both curtain edges across the window and clipped them together .
neutral	still there was a triangle of light at the top of the window that beamed through near my pillow .
neutral	there are many very bright lights on very tall poles on the highway just across the parking_lot .
neutral	i chose not to stay at the end of our trip abroad because of that and the cost that more than doubled from our sunday_night_stay to the friday nearly two_weeks_later .
neutral	though the hotel was near the airport they did not provide free parking , they required payment to allow my car to be parked in a nearly empty parking_lot .
neutral	no free breakfast either .
neutral	petflow has_been a great place to order my dog '_s food , treats etc .
neutral	from .
neutral	because of my satisfaction with their service and prices i decided to try the spoiled_rotten program .
neutral	i was very disappointed !
neutral	this box cost me $_00 . 00 after i used a special $ 0 . 00 coupon .
neutral	the contents in the box added up to $_00 . 00 - all of which were available on sale from their website .
neutral	i could have had twice the items for this price .
neutral	i should have sent it back but i will just call it a lesson_learned .
neutral	no more unseen purchases !
neutral	i thought it would be a fun experience - not so !
neutral	no problem in getting into car_park but on exit the ' barrier ' was telling_me i owed £_00 .
neutral	not what i wanted to see at 00 : 00_hrs .
neutral	had to wait several minutes whilst waiting for ' assistance call ' to be answered and luckily a long_queue had not formed .
neutral	i saw an advertisement for leash '_s and collars that light up when you are walking your pets at nite to help keep them safe .
neutral	i ordered them and 0 really cute little bone shape '_s that would also light up at a very special low price .
neutral	they did not arrive with my order although i was charged for them .
neutral	when i complained , my money was refunded for the two bones i did not receive i was told i would receive them free of charge for the inconveinance once supplies were available .
neutral	( they were out of stock ), of course i didn_'_t ever get them .... now they are available but when i tried to order them again they are no_longer on sale ........ i like the items i received ....... not happy with their follow_up customer_service .
neutral	there were 0 of us , we all bought the passes on the friday_afternoon .
neutral	however , we tried to go to top of the rock , but there was a problem , so we pre_- booked for the next_day .
neutral	however , this activated our cards , and we lost an entire day '_s use ( although they did refund a day afterwards ).
neutral	also check whether what you want to go to is open every day , and also whether there are any events ( such as the cycle race ) which will limit your travel on any days during your stay
neutral	i like everything i buy from easy_comforts but i don_'_t have a computer ( i '_m 00 ) i order by mail or phone .
neutral	i returned the clothing because the sizes were too big and not the quality i .
neutral	expected
neutral	im very happy with my purchase , however , i think more than 0_weeks is a bit much to wait ..... especially if you really need your glasses ..... i will order again .
neutral	they have great prices , but you cant call them when u have a problem or question !
neutral	that is a problem for me !
neutral	and emails are slow , so im not sure i would use them again !
neutral	it was not typed as accurate as i thought it would .
neutral	makes the conversation look different than if you listen to the recording .
neutral	missing information that transcriptionist couldn_'_t understand .
neutral	sangat smart idea dan sangat membantu
neutral	setup was simple and easy and truck driver was helpful and nice .
neutral	upon_arrival at the storage_facility things were very disorganized .
neutral	i was ignored and i waited far too long .
neutral	my boyfriend uses this website regularly and receives his items the next_day , as_advertised throughout the site .
neutral	when i ordered an item recently , i assumed it was in stock as i wasn_'_t told otherwise , however i received an_email 0 days_later saying that it had finally been dispatched .
neutral	however , my account my order status had been ' completed / dispatched ' for a few_days already .
neutral	a bit annoyed with the lack of communication_regarding my item clearly not being in stock / the delayed dispatch , as this item was a gift for my boyfriend .
neutral	disappointed this time .
neutral	the quality of the products received are great !
neutral	however , i got 0 products that i did not order and was charged for those and i did not get 0 products that i had ordered .
neutral	pro_world returned them and issued credit for them without_any explanation to me .
neutral	i also paid for 0 day shipping and it was 0 days getting to me , not sure if that was a pro_world issue or the shipping company .
neutral	i did not like the way the box was packed . a 00_lb_bag of dry_dog_food was in with some crunchy cookie treats and a 00 pack of canned_food .
neutral	there were no peanuts or any kind of bubbled plastic to cushion in between , so the treats were crushed .
neutral	what we ordered arrived , and the bathroom fitments were good quality .
neutral	but the arrangements for delivery are poor - we live in a flat , the driver dropped the pallet on the kirb and had no interest in helping to shift the items upstairs , or in disposing of the wooden_pallet left over .
neutral	i have been researching this cancun trip for 0 months and every time , i see a better rate and flight , i try to book , but then the flight changed and it was either more_expensive or the flight times were outrageous ( 0 hour layovers , or 0 stops instead of 0 or overnight ).
neutral	so finally , i checked on easter_weekend and found a reasonable flight and lower_rate for this gorgeous all - inclusive resort at grand sunset princess suites and was lucky to book it with no changes .
neutral	but then i emailed my friends to join us and all the flights had all ready changed .
neutral	unbelievable .
neutral	my suggestion is to book it quickly or wait for another opportunity .
neutral	usual rushing about but my suitcase got mangled going and murdered coming home
neutral	offered led dog_bone for 00_cents with an order and after it was shipped told me they were out of led dog bones , cheat !
neutral	it was easy to purchase the gift but i was a bit annoyed to pay so much for shipping .
neutral	still , it was easier than going shopping .
neutral	my husband and i were using a contoured memory_foam pillow until we bought the duplex buckwheat / millet pillow .
neutral	we spent a lot of time adjusting the pillows and my husband is happy with his but i still have not been able to get comfortable .
neutral	i wake_up with neck_pain that i never had before .
neutral	i wish i could love the pillow but i am sadly disappointed .
neutral	i placed my order on november_00th .
neutral	the portion shipped from royal_canin arrived on nov . 00th and petflow reported issues with getting a verbal okay from my vet during thanksgiving week .
neutral	the remainder of my order , which was shipped from petflow , didn_'_t arrive until the 00th .
neutral	my original confirmation_email from petflow said my order would begin processing on monday , nov . 00th , yet i received no further information on shipping until i complained on friday , nov . 00rd .
neutral	seems to me like it just got spaced out .
neutral	my dogs are happy , i am happy , my mother is happy , my land lord .....
neutral	i felt_like the customer_service was excellent and i enjoyed_working with people that were attempting to meet my needs .
neutral	i was a little frustrated as i felt trapped in which i needed a car for work but had bad credit .
neutral	i was charged almost $ 0 , 000 over the price of the car and my interest_rate was incredibly high .
neutral	by the time i am done paying for this car i will have paid almost $_00 , 000 for this car and that in itself feels_like a rip_off .
neutral	i wish there was a car company out there that was willing to help people get their credit back on track without costing them an_arm and a leg .
neutral	the shipment was correct and timely .
neutral	however , the chicken treats i ordered did not explain online that they were made in china .
neutral	after the recall i refuse to buy any treats or dog_food made outside of the usa .
neutral	you would think a reputable_company such as dogwells wouldn_'_t support dog_food products made in china .
neutral	i will be returning the treats and hopefully your return process is as smooth as the order process .
neutral	extra large size is really a medium_size , disappointing for the price .
neutral	if you want one item you should be able to buy one item .
neutral	i had to buy 0 items to get the one i wanted .
neutral	i wanted the pet zoom only .
neutral	it is not worth the price .
neutral	it doesn_'_t release well and it does not adjust
neutral	after shopping around , i found the dog_food i wanted at a great price and was excited to find that delivery time was 0 - 0 days , just like all the other online pet_food companies .
neutral	similarities stopped there .
neutral	on two occasions , delivery took at_least 0 business days from date of order ( with my pets food out there in 000_degree plus heat ) to arrival and i live in the middle of the u . s .
neutral	when petflow says it shipped and fedex '_s system of product receipt do not reflect the same date , so i '_m going back to one of the other_companies that gets me my pets food in 0 - 0 days as_advertised .
neutral	i bought a shower riser bracket , soap dish and shower_gel hook .
neutral	the riser did not fit even_though i checked my measurements , the soap dish sits at an angle because it is too big and the gel hook does not fit at all .
neutral	i '_m going to start all over again .
neutral	although the collection and drop_off timings worked well on drop_off driver struggled to understand_english which constituted in my completing the ticket on his behalf !
neutral	rather frustrating and too timely when you are in a rush to get into the airport !
neutral	asked same questions several_times , called 0 times
neutral	i enjoy facebook very much , i on the other hand do not like all the changes that have occured .
neutral	i will still be an_avid facebook user , just wish they would slow_down all the changes and let the techology paused catch up .
neutral	the collect_plus service takes a lot longer_than the old way of sending via_royal_mail , it took a week to reach you !
neutral	also the processing time was redicously long !
neutral	all in all it '_s taken almost 0 month to get my money !
neutral	the website makes it look and suggests quickness and ease , i found this not to be the case !
neutral	i don_'_t remembering it taking this long last time and would seriously reconsider using the service again !
neutral	really disappointed !
neutral	i like the idea of auto_ship - i selected once a month - to try different dog_food ( abby - lab_mix ) is a picky_eater - but however - i wanted to select different food once a month - i couldn_'_t figure_out how change my options - maybe i wanted to try something different every other month .... i got frustrated - and made me want to cancel the whole thing .
neutral	i had to email them and ask them for help - emailed me very next_day ( which was great )
neutral	ask them how to change the food if i wanted to - and i had to email them back with what i wanted to change - . like i said , i may want to change the food every_month - or every other month on auto_ship - and i want the option to decide every_month what i want to change - my dear abby has allergies - and not every food i order will agree with her .
neutral	please help me - i really like the idea of auto_ship - but i also want the control and freedom to change the food every_month - or every other month - or even adding items .
neutral	on my own - without email someone of my choices - and they make the changes for me - because next month - i may decide on a different food - and will have to go through the emailing process all over again - about changes .
neutral	i may cancel the auto - ship all together - and perhaps find a pet - auto_ship site that will allow me to have that freedom .
neutral	i do like pet - flows choices of high_quality food and treats - but i like the freedom to shop - browse and chose on my own with auto_ship items - without evolving a 0rd_party ... love u petflow and your site - but i need more elbow room --- and please - please make it easy - abby keeps me on my toes with her picky eating_habits - and allergies
neutral	yes thank_you the sales dept .
neutral	did what i asked and designated my cartridges be sent by aus .
neutral	post .
neutral	but
neutral	despatch put the two small packets into a box four times their size ( ex wine box ) and sent it by australia post but to be signed for on receipt !!
neutral	!
neutral	which_meant that the postie left a parcel card in my rsd ( roadside delivery ) box beside the road - yes i live in the country .
neutral	so i still had to travel to swan hill to the post_office with the card and sign for and collect the box with the two small boxed cartridges inside .
neutral	i have no trouble with ink_station products just with the delivery .
neutral	by the way ink spot has no more discount shopper dockets - your spot has_been taken over by wholesaletoner . com . au
neutral	recievied my order on time .
neutral	the items were ( 0 ) 00 " hx 0 " w x 0 " d . the box was 00 " h x 00 " w x 00 " long .
neutral	packaging for protection was loose and not protecting the items at all .
neutral	i ordered a pair of ruby red slipper shoes with sequence all over them for my daughters wizard of oz theme_party , along with seven pairs of ruby red slipper style slip ins for her guests .
neutral	after less_than an_hour of wearing the shoes the sequin began to fall off , i found them all over her carpet .
neutral	i called customer_service and the operator told me repeatedly that i should expect that , because they ' re only costume shoes ( that cost 00 . 00 ).
neutral	after explaining to her that i realize that they were costume , but i feel_like they should have at_least lasted for her 0 hour party , she said she couldn_'_t replace or return them because they have been worn .
neutral	she offered 0 %_off the order .
neutral	so , not the greatest product , customer_service wasn_'_t all that great either .
neutral	i wanted a cover to protect my kindle_fire and thought this would be a great cover .
neutral	unfortunately , the cover slightly cuts off my vision om the left hand side of the screen .
neutral	also there '_s a permanent bend in the cover , only i '_m not sure where or how i '_m supposed to be bend .
neutral	i " ll figure it out eventually .
neutral	it was an easy and quick site to use , other_sites i tried ordering from were tricky to figure_out .
neutral	had a variety of label options that were customizable .
neutral	only problem that i had was the package showed_up slightly_bent and the label paper had a small crease .
neutral	i put it under some heavy books and t looks fine now .
neutral	however , maybe look into sturdier packaging .
neutral	overall a good experience .
neutral	beautiful coats but sizes were smaller_than stated ( i measured my sons ).
neutral	had to return them at a cost of over_£_00 .
neutral	the box arrived today .
neutral	in it was a small bag of dog_food and a box of honest_kitchen dog_food .
neutral	the small bag was ripped_open in the middle ... no_longer usable .
neutral	hope it keeps as i wasn_'_t ready to open it .
neutral	customer_service was excellent .
neutral	i specified specifically which type of contact_lens i needed in the notes , but the wrong ones were mailed out .
neutral	the company immediately mailed out the right ones when i called in .
neutral	the delivery was within_00hours but they sent one man for a huge box clearly_labelled that it need two .
neutral	he then moaned as my front_door was about 00metres from the kerb and stated he should leave to 000kg box on the kerb .
neutral	given that i have a serious back injury and live alone i told him to take it away .
neutral	he eventually brought it to my door but again said he had to leave it outside .
neutral	i persuaded him to at_least shove it into the hall - we did this together .
neutral	he left .
neutral	it took me 0hour 00_minutes to get it the 00 feet from my hall to my dining_room .
neutral	i couldn_'_t move the next_day .
neutral	most_recent order for canon cartridges did not fit .
neutral	printer could not recognize the particular ink tank .
neutral	requested resolution to this problem 0_weeks_ago , and they have not updated the status , i . e_., if they can provide the proper cartridge .
neutral	i have never had any_problems with inkfarm in the past , they '_ve always been able to take_care of the very few minor issues i had .
neutral	i '_ve used their remanufactured_cartridges for 0 - 0 years .
neutral	twice i '_ve had deliveries that came on the 0th day of a 0nd day delivery ( yes , it was placed early in day ) and both_times they were damaged .
neutral	tablets crushed from being tossed around .
neutral	the last shipment arrived looking like it had fallen_off the truck and been run over , looked accordion - like .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting for the return_label so i can get my money back , not sure how easy or fast that is .
neutral	as far as the product goes , when deliveries work out well , i have no_problems .
neutral	i do believe you can get good rated products at good prices and they arrive timely * for the most part *.
neutral	still_waiting for back - ordered item
neutral	i am writing this review at the request of opticontacts , although i haven_'_t received my order yet .
neutral	at this time , the order status is still " processing_".
neutral	so , i will update my review if i am able to when / if the shipment goes out .
neutral	[ 0000 - 00 - 00 ] -> processing
neutral	[ 0000 - 00 - 00 ] -> verifying rx
neutral	[ 0000 - 00 - 00 ] -> order received
neutral	in general , goldstar has offered tickets for many events that i '_m interested in at a good price , but there have been a few problems .
neutral	on 0 may , 0000 , we took the blue and gold alcatraz boat_cruise .
neutral	the address listed to pick_up tickets was 000 beach st . , which was wrong - the actual address was the blue and gold ticket window on jefferson st , 0 blocks_away .
neutral	as my husband is physically disabled , this was a hardship for him .
neutral	the cruise itself was very interesting , and the goldstar price was very reasonable .
neutral	there have been other problems as well - a couple of times , i '_ve paid for tickets for 0st balcony or mezzanine performances and when i go to the box office , they give me 0nd balcony tickets .
neutral	when i explain that i bought better tickets , the box office says that we have to resolve it with goldstar , which of course , i can '_t on the night of the performance .
neutral	i think this is more the box office '_s fault than goldstar , but it '_s still annoying .
neutral	swim caps were fine .
neutral	delivery was fast .
neutral	but no wonder shipping is so expensive : a few tiny lycra caps that would have fit in a business envelope were shipped in an_enormous box .
neutral	such a waste .
neutral	when the iron is on low withe the covers the patch peels off a little and gets a little distorted .
neutral	the designs are good and work for the basic purpose
neutral	i ordered 0 sets of christmas_tree lights , one lot were fine the other set were not as good as i expected , i called and asked to return and was told i would be charged £_00 but only £ 0 if i placed another order .
neutral	i would happily have ordered the higher volume of lights but they don_'_t stock them , and therefore i couldn_'_t place another order .
neutral	i returned via_royal_mail at a cost of £_00 .
neutral	the delivery was quick and the items were well_packaged but i would only use again if i knew i would not need to return the item .
neutral	i ordered topper for around my ceiling .
neutral	i got 0 double rolls of wallpaper
neutral	it should have been so easy , but it took me two phone_calls and a lot of time to make hotel reservations for four rooms .
neutral	i thought it would be easier to call the hotel reservation line directly and get the best price .
neutral	the associate was very nice and tried to be helpful , but i had to ask for the discounted price i had seen on line .
neutral	i don_'_t know why , but it took her a very long time to make the reservation ; unfortunately , she had not noted that we preferred to be on the same floor either , so she had to go back into the computer to add the request ; we need to double - check at the desk when we arrive to see if the hotel can accommodate this request .
neutral	all the rooms had to be put in my name .
neutral	i received the confirmation by email within_seconds , which was good , because it was wrong .
neutral	she had booked us for only one night !
neutral	so i called back to correct the reservation .
neutral	the person i talked to insisted that i do a separate booking because the first reservation is " non_- refundable ."
neutral	no changes can be made .
neutral	then the associate told me that it was going to cost the full price per room on saturday ; that the promotion was only on friday .
neutral	i didn_'_t think that was right based on my previous conversation , so i kept challenging that until he admitted he was looking at the " wrong date ."
neutral	i then asked him to note that we do not want to have four rooms on one night and then have to move again on saturday with the second reservation .
neutral	he said it shouldn_'_t be a problem , but that he would make a note , and that we should confirm at the desk when we check in .
neutral	we now have two confirmation numbers , one for each night .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	next time i '_ll do it on line with expedia .
neutral	customer_service representative was less_than helpful when i called to ask a question about how fast the card would be loaded and available to my sister .
neutral	the only response i got was it would be processed within 00_hours after they opened on monday_morning .
neutral	the website did not state that a purchase would not be processed on the weekend .
neutral	a scan bar would also be helpful when the gift_card prints out since we needed to wait for a manager to override the system to hand key the number in .
neutral	i '_ll bet that causes you to lose sales .
neutral	women that we collected the tickets from was one of those people who made it very obvious she would rather be anywhere_else than at work that day .
neutral	she was irritated by any questions outside the sales speil she is trained to give , zero eye contact with the customer and wholly uncivil in her demeanor .
neutral	both myself and my partner commented that had she worked for us she would be gone .
neutral	from then on a completely positive_experience pass saved us time and money the bus loops were brilliant , and the discounts from on the spot prices brilliant , definitely would recommend the pass and have done only yesterday .
neutral	attitude adjustment needed from the woman_who served_us that morning .
neutral	i always expect a dented can or 0 depending_on how many i buy ,.. but ; out of 00 cans over half were dented & many of them bad enough that i had a really hard time opening them : however , they were not " bloated ", and so_far i haven_'_t come_across any compromised seals , & the packaging ( padding ) was acceptable , & the plastic over the bags was in good shape ...
neutral	so , for those reasons , the shipment gets 0 instead of 0 .
neutral	nice that i can find the bags that i need for my canister vacuum , however not so nice that the cost to ship the bags was almost as much as the cost of the bags themselves .
neutral	not so impressed with this .
neutral	0 .
neutral	the box took to . long to get here .
neutral	0 , there should be more in the box .
neutral	the things that were in the box were okay .
neutral	there should be a more variety of things .
neutral	i had a problem checking into the hotel .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting for resolution .
neutral	i was quite disappointed , i had purchased from you some time ago and felt it was lot cheaper , quicker and better quality .
neutral	the material came to a lot and to be honest was not that great quality , delivery took 0 days and cost £ 0 . 00 , so i thought it would be a lot better .
neutral	apologies my postage was just under £ 0 , still disappointed !
neutral	i have trying to contact someone about my order .
neutral	i left a msg friday .
neutral	hope to hear from you monday .
neutral	you need more phone contacts for customer_service .
neutral	so we can feel more assured we will be taken_care of .
neutral	thank_you ,
neutral	my oil was delivered quickly but i wish the driver had got in touch with me as i wanted him to put in the boiler max additive which i had ordered and paid for .
neutral	i was in the house at the time but didn_'_t hear him .
neutral	i was told the driver would contact me before he delivered .
neutral	hi i order dis item last wed and i haven_'_t received it yet i need it for friday nyt cheers
neutral	really surprised that customer has to pay for returns .
neutral	it stopped me re ordering in a different size .
neutral	you could use collect +!
neutral	like other_companies do
neutral	difficult to fill in order form .
neutral	i kept having to refill rejected information .
neutral	took four tries to complete .
neutral	price was right for item i wanted but bad forms can be a tie breaker for future orders .
neutral	missed friday shipping when ordered , lost weekend moving towards me = 0 extra days to arrive .
neutral	part was a ac_compressor and made noise and would not hold pressure until it ran for almost an_hour .
neutral	would have exchanged part but would have had to pay honda double labor $_000 x0 .
neutral	works good with fingers_crossed but still slightly_lower pressure .
neutral	have to run ac fan one position less_than full speed or air comes too fast and is warm .
neutral	if it never breaks it will be ok
neutral	the sales_assistant last time was so helpful and so pleasant .
neutral	i didn_'_t find the staff quite so friendly and helpful this time .
neutral	though i knew the journals i ordered were not leather , they looked to be of better quality in the photos than what they actually are .
neutral	perhaps a clearer description of the material they are made of would have painted a more accurate picture .
neutral	the length of the strap on the journal also covers part of the logo .
neutral	i didn_'_t have a choice of where to place the logo and on the sample pictures the strap does not cover any of that logo .
neutral	i am pleased with the quality of the debossing .
neutral	i will probably try one more product before i make my final_decision with the company .
neutral	i am very glad i ordered the minimum quantity .
neutral	i am happy with the service so_far , they have already caught something with my personal record that i would have not found unless i was looking .
neutral	the only_thing i am not happy with is the computer protection .
neutral	they do not have protection for mac computers yet .
neutral	come on now , identity_guard , get with the times , there are a growing number of mac users out there and we should not be forgotten .
neutral	so i signed_up for separate computer protection from a different company .
neutral	i am happy with the customer_service so_far , when i signed_up , i signed_up for the $ 0 . 00 package , and later my husband signed_up also and for some_reason it was $_00 . 00 for the same package .
neutral	i called and they made us both have the $ 0 . 00 package no problem .
neutral	it matters where you sign_up because they have different promotional rates .
neutral	the only matter we found disappointing about our delivery was the amount of rubbish we were left to deal with .
neutral	we had ordered a lot of furniture and each piece was very well_packed and in a large cardboard_box .
neutral	it took us a long time to unpack and we were then left with a mountain of rubbish to get_rid of which resulted in two trips to the council tip .
neutral	i understand that the company are trying to go green but wouldn_'_t it be better for everybody if they dispossed of the rubbish responsibly considering the money that the customer is paying .
neutral	other than that we are very pleased with our furniture .
neutral	j parker
neutral	bestilte nogle fede boots , som_jeg dersværre måtte returnere pga .
neutral	forkert størrelse .
neutral	fra dagen jeg sendte dem , til jeg_fik mine_penge overført tilbage igen gik der omkring en_uge .
neutral	det_er lige lang_tid nok .. ellers god service og fin kvalitet (-:
neutral	det_var_en okay oplevelse , at handle der .
neutral	der_var dog ikke noget der_var fantastisk , eller det omvendte .
neutral	det_var ok
neutral	they ' re very bright especially on my street , we only have street lights at the corners .
neutral	they ' re easy to hook to the dog '_s collar .
neutral	but they are extremely difficult to turn on / off .
neutral	i have to use both hands to get it to turn on / off .
neutral	i ordered 0 blue lights , and i tried 0 different ones and they ' re both the same , very hard to press to turn on / off .
neutral	i have other blinking lights for my dogs that are red , ( not as bright ) but all you have to do is push on the top to turn on / off .
neutral	i '_m able to do it with one hand .
neutral	if it weren_'_t for the difficulty turnning on / off they would be great .
neutral	i like to start with the positives .
neutral	the sash i ordered was beautiful .
neutral	i ordered feather clips for the bridesmaids with party buttons that arrived in perfect_condition .
neutral	i ordered a veil with a headband tiara .
neutral	the tiara was completely hanging by a thread off the headband .
neutral	i don_'_t have time to send it back so i have to superglue it .
neutral	this was disconcerning and disappointing .
neutral	i am a first time customer and not sure i will use the site again for this reason .
neutral	i have shopped here a few_times and made two purchases .
neutral	i love their generous return_policy especially_since i had to use it on my first order .
neutral	the website '_s sizing can be a bit_tricky to read ( i am considered a plus size here ) and the descriptions are sparse at best .
neutral	i usually can '_t go by the reviews on the site because they are not well written or seem to be written by people who have actually purchased the items .
neutral	i will keep shopping here for their value , but it is not my first choice .
neutral	good just wish it was a little more user_friendly .
neutral	when i looked for a part for my 0000_toyota prius , i did not know that i had to buy directly from a toyota supplier .
neutral	i thought if the description said " for " or fits toyota prius , then it would work on the car .
neutral	the part said for 0000_toyota prius , but it would not fit on my car .
neutral	rather frustrating !
neutral	the car i was assigned was terrific , although a little large for scottish roads and parking spots !
neutral	my biggest concern was the attitude of the clerk at the rental desk ...
neutral	he was bordering on insulting !
neutral	i do have personal car insurance with my own policy and with my credit_card company , he made me feel_like a criminal not taking the additional daily coverage for the vehicle !
neutral	not very welcoming .
neutral	yes , it is my choice to make those decisions , he should not judge me !
neutral	plus he was training a new employee , not the best training experience i believe !
neutral	no smiles , no welcome to scotland .... sad !
neutral	the product is supporting my tennis elbow but i did ask for some guidance on exactly where it should placed - ie below the knobbly bit on my elbow ( which is the bit that hurts ) or above or below .
neutral	no response .
neutral	the prices are the lowest that i '_ve found online .
neutral	the shipping and handling is a little high though .
neutral	i bought a back support the foam was so hard and unforgiving i could not use the product which i bought for lumber support ..
neutral	weigh too big in diameter for lumber support .
neutral	,
neutral	i like the website look and feel
neutral	however it could use an easier way to get to various plants .
neutral	maybe some other search options or building up / narrowing search choices .
neutral	biggest issue was looking up previous_orders ( history ) took so long ( minutes ) i could not wait .
neutral	i believe i only remember getting into my history 0 time ( and maybe i tired 0 times ) and then basically gave up trying in the future .
neutral	i was looking to track my orders to see what portion shipped ( i will wait for emails ).
neutral	emails on shipping came timely .
neutral	company is fine , quality is fine , website : starts 0 , 0 , 0 respectively
neutral	i can get the product cheaper at petco even after the discount that was offered for the first purchase .
neutral	the car was fine , although i was not familiar with the particular gear shift , and no one explained it when i picked it up .
neutral	it was said to be a shift car but appeared to be fluid drive - i was not aware that you changed the forward gear by twitching the knob in " d ".
neutral	when i complained the car was nicely exchanged in perugia .
neutral	i got charged twice but it was corrected when i pointed i it out .
neutral	the line at the rr station took_forever to pick_up the car and again when i returned it at_least an_hour both_times , maybe more - the other rental_agencies did not seem to have lines .
neutral	maybe auto europa is the cheapest , but they could use more help .
neutral	the staff were nice and competent .
neutral	the garage entrance is so tight that i scraped my 0 - passenger vehicle on the door when returning it .
neutral	i ordered a pair of elle designer_frames and was sorely disappointed because they were backordered .
neutral	i was contacted about this and offered a different color and refused , so they remained on backorder .
neutral	then i received an_email for a large discount that made the glasses 00 less .
neutral	then i canceled the order and reordered a similar elle frame and that was backordered for even longer .
neutral	i was again contacted .
neutral	i requested the frames to stay on back order .
neutral	i did receive the glasses sooner_than_expected but they were not my first choice of frames .
neutral	they are a comfortable fit and the prescription is correct but i sure do wish for the money that i spent i had been delivered the first pair i picked and wasn_'_t forced to settle for second best !
neutral	i probably_won_'_t order from this website again because it was too much hassle !
neutral	i purchased the a0 calendar , overall it '_s ok / good quality but could be better .
neutral	the ring binder of the calendar seems flimsy ( could easily pull a month off + considering the weight of the calendar would have expected a better binding ).
neutral	also 0 of the photos came out with tops & bottom cropped , even_though when uploading the photos i got a green symbol indicating the size was good .
neutral	the lack of options for editing the photos was quite poor .
neutral	could be a lot better considering the prices .
neutral	i went to book with these as it was the cheapest price i had found - however , when i actually confirmed the booking , the price increased to the original .
neutral	it was still less but was annoying and disappointing and left the experience feeling a little less like using these again .
neutral	i usually love this site , but recently they cancelled my order without explanation !!!
neutral	i was very disappointed
neutral	i ordered the clock for my father in law '_s birthday to go in his new garage .
neutral	when it arrived the clock was faulty .
neutral	mother in law called customer_services to report fault and ask for advice and they were told to fix it themselves .
neutral	great way to order and quick but stated 0 - 0 days delivery and when it didn_'_t arrive ( a friend ordered one the same day and agreed it stated this !)
neutral	i emailed to discuss the matter and was told that this was incorrect and that it never stated this at all .
neutral	when i went back on to have a look it had been removed !
neutral	best prices compare to other retailer , you don_'_t need doctor authorization for prescription .
neutral	navigate website easy .
neutral	customer_service feedback .
neutral	only compaint is shipping ; i '_m one of those people that like to know where my package is .
neutral	other than that everything else was fine .
neutral	very satisfied with the service and product but very disappointed with the packaging .
positive	this is the greatest_thing , once a month petflow sends a box of " goodies " for your pet .
positive	charlotte my shihtzu got her first one on december 00nd just in time for christmas .
positive	she got an adorable cow toy , some treats shes never tried before but seemed to like all of them .
positive	and some teeth cleaner that doesn_'_t involve brushing .
positive	i dont_know whos more excited about next month '_s package charlotte or me ...
positive	used this site many_times .
positive	i always start mysearch here .
positive	prices change daily and if you want to really research the price continually at many different sites , i have found cheaper cars elsewhere .
positive	however , if you don_'_t have a lot of time to research the price , this site has always been among the top three ( e . g_., cheapest ) of the ten sites i use to reserve a car .
positive	very impressed with speed and efficiency of service .
positive	ordered flowers for australia at around 00 : 00_hrs and received email from recipient the next_morning to confirm delivery .

positive	i brought a beko_dishwasher after much concideration , the price was different to other stores which was really good and the other stores didnt have it in stock ready in time for christmas .
positive	after paying for it a member of there team contacted me about my purchase and gave_me all the relevent information_regarding my dishwasher .
positive	the man on the phone was very polite and helpful even the delivery guys were polite and talkative too .
positive	i would definitely use this website again .
positive	i am very happy with the end_result and most_importantly the customer_service i received .
positive	the original order i received was the printed with the wrong color .

positive	an expensive product found very quickly and cheapest at that time - not a technical ordering system , so an easy transaction
positive	we ordered a garden vac / blower which compared to other_sites was great value , was due to be delivered very quickly and it was .
positive	unfortunately it was internally damaged , which tooled up could never have known about , but they collected the item the next available working day , and reshipped out a replacement with no_quibble , and no extra expense from me , which i think is great service .

positive	they also provided a payment plan .
positive	thanks !
positive	seriously coffee and books .. what is not to love ?
positive	the prices vary but are generally fair and so_far i have never had a major issue with online or in store purchases .
positive	i really liked using indeed since it grabs jobs from lots of different places and you can sort by date , positions etc .
positive	my only_gripe was not really their fault , since it '_s a job aggregate if the companies listing online have auto - renewal for listings it will say a job is new when it is actually just a re - posted one ... but again that is not indeed doing it .
positive	was a bit_unsure_about ordering as i dint know any who had used this website before . have used it twice_now . its cheap , easy to use and keep you well informed .
positive	i haven_'_t used their full services , but only go on pc_game supply to buy karma koin when i need it -- and they hold true to their word .
positive	i '_m very skeptical of buying game_cards online , so i google ' d around to see if people had bought from them .
positive	turns_out some people bought cards from them , and didn_'_t get scammed .
positive	gave it a try , and i got my codes from them after a good 0 - 0 minutes from purchasing .
positive	i ordered the telescopic magnet grab .
positive	my son has lost a screw in his bikes headlight !

positive	product as_described .
positive	i am on a rtw trip of a lifetime and i use hostelworld to make 00_% of my hostel reservations .
positive	it '_s idiot_proof really !
positive	and there apple and android apps make it even easier to use on the move .
positive	the only_negative i would say is that they don_'_t always show a hostels full availability so if there is somewhere in particular you want to stay check with the hostel directly before moving on .
positive	hodges has outdone themselves .
positive	the ribbons are beautiful .
positive	i cannot say thank_you enough for doing a wonderful job !

positive	after looking at hotels and hostels for the 0 of us , i was discouraged about the prices .
positive	then i saw housetrip .
positive	we found an apt .
positive	within our budget that allowed_us to easily get around paris , stay together as a family ( unlike a hostel ), and cook some of our own meals - all at a price better_than anything i saw elsewhere !!
positive	we were pleased with the entire_process , though it is a bit time_consuming to choose , send a notice , wait for a reply , etc .
positive	easier to just choose and book .
positive	but worth it in the long run because we were very pleased .
positive	easy to communicate with our host , which we did quite_often before our trup .

positive	what more can you ask for ?
positive	the on - line chat was very helpful and saved a trip to the store .
positive	the advice was more direct than on - line reviews , although they came to the same conclusions .
positive	i know b_&_h will stand by its products .
positive	petflow has not let us down , they have the food items and toys my four cats love .
positive	for me having it come to the house is wonderful and so many items to choose from .
positive	no negativity here as my four felines are happy so i am happy . and they are healthier as well ... which makes me very happy :-)
positive	i have been in the customer_service industry since 0000 and i feel that they have mastered the skill .
positive	my item was going to be on back order , not only did they email me , but they called me as well to ask me what i wanted to do .
positive	also , a small error occurred and they fixed it right_away sending me a postage paid return envelope and the scrub pants i needed .
positive	this is my first time renting_books but i was impressed with how easy it was to locate the books i needed and how quickly they arrived .
positive	totally cheaper_than buying a new book , and what a waste that is also using it for a couple months and then ... what ?

positive	i recently bought the classic_ii s . e .
positive	stethoscope and i couldn_'_t be_happier with my purchase .
positive	the quality of this item is great and worth the price , especially with the free_engraving which looks awesome !

positive	the liberty_freedom range is expensive , but beautiful , and made in england !, i '_ve been to berlin this weekend and wore it , loads of compliments , even from the sternest of airport security !

positive	next time i need a part for a do - it - yourself fix , i will_definitely check outpartsgeek first !
positive	!

positive	this was exactly_what i ordered .
positive	it came when promised and was intact .
positive	couldn_'_t be_happier .
positive	the entire team at onebuckresume was really great to work with .
positive	i used their executive - classic resume format and i have to admit i was a little_concerned_about it only being one dollar and all .
positive	prior to working with one buck , i had a dud of a resume that was getting no traction .
positive	my career is challenging to describe and i had done a pretty poor job of it .
positive	the resume builder quickly picked_up on the positive trends of my career and the qualities about myself and what i was looking for that needed to be emphasized in the resume .
positive	it did a great job .
positive	the process was so easy , too .
positive	everything is done by the resume building platform so it '_s very fast and uncomplicated .
positive	they asked me to complete a fairly thorough questionnaire that really helped_me reflect on my career .
positive	once that was done , i had a gorgeous resume as well as some cover_letter and thank_you letter templates .
positive	i had a few minor revisions that i requested and those were done immediately , no questions_asked .
positive	then , i hit the market .
positive	the questionnaire coupled with the resume were great for prepping for the interview .
positive	one buck_resume tries to draw out " stories " during the process and it made it seem so natural to use these stories in the interview process .
positive	i '_m happy to say that i have a new job and t was both the resume and the way this site got me to look at my accomplishments from a different point of view that gave_me the confidence to succeed .
positive	if you ' re unhappy with your resume , check out onebuckresume . com .
positive	one of the hiring managers i spoke to told me that i had the fanciest resume they had ever_seen .
positive	great service from environfone .
positive	they sent the reply envelope very quickly and within a week had confirmed that the phone i was selling was good quality and in working order and within another week i had the cheque in payment .
positive	thanks .

positive	it '_s great to have a 00 - lb_bag of dog_food delivered straight to home !
positive	my doctor advised me not to take a certain herb i had already ordered from pure_formula .
positive	tis due to possible interaction of my chemo med and the herb .
positive	i called and asked if i could mail it back and they sent me a prepaid return address label !
positive	my orders are usually received within a couple of days after entering them on computer website .
positive	they have large selections to choose from .
positive	the same glasses at the optical shop i went to was over $_000 , got them for almost_half price at frames_direct .
positive	i have a very strong prescription so the savings are amazing .
positive	would gladly recommend to friends and family .
positive	definately buy molarclean as its a good quality product and excellent value for money !
positive	i have been a monger since the 00 '_s , and my massage experience has never been better since massage parlor reviews hit the internet .
positive	since i first became a member about 0 years_ago i loved the site .
positive	around 0000 - 0000 , the site got a little sloppy and the speed was just average .
positive	i left for a while and came back , and they have really tightened the functionality of the site .
positive	the speed is much_faster , i am able to view many more profiles in less time .
positive	the reviews are very detailed now , many average 0 - 0 paragraphs .

positive	!
positive	good product selection and cs
positive	love the free_shipping - this allows me to order what i need without_having to add unecessary items to reach a minimum for free_shipping .
positive	plus the prices are very competitive and they offer free_samples .
positive	shipping was prompt .
positive	this website is a keeper .
positive	i like using wowcher because i enjoy the diversity of the products that they have .
positive	the one thing i would say , which isn_'_t anything to do with the company itself but rather the companies that use them , regarding things like jewellery , they don_'_t turn up packaged very well there by casting doubt on the authenticity of the product they are selling .
positive	it would be good if the sellers gave an option to box your goods or not even if they charged a little more .
positive	i have ordered a few items of jewellery for gifts and each time felt disappointed that they had arrived in little plastic_bags as_opposed to if i had bought them at a shop .
positive	but that issue isn_'_t with wowcher because they are awesome !
positive	:-)
positive	i decided to change my sons name '_s to my married name and this service made it hassle_free .

positive	great service from a company i have been purchasing from for over 00 years
positive	i have repeatedly used memoryc over the last 0 years .
positive	i have never had any_issues with the products supplied by memoryc .
positive	they stock a wide_range of memory products .
positive	the delivery options are great .
positive	i have no reservations about recommending memoryc
positive	everything went so smooooothly in ordering , receiving and even installing my 0000 passat grill insert ( with fog ), that i almost_forgot all about the hideous speed bump that popped my old grill insert out of my car and into the middle of the street .
positive	i think the best compliment you can give a supplier is forgetting about the ordeal that compelled you to seek them out in the first place .
positive	i needed a gift_card for a friend asap , so i was fortunate to find the pc_games supply site !
positive	i was able to buy the gift_card and email it to my friend immediately .
positive	i '_ll probably shop at pcgamessupply . com again whenever i need more gift_cards .
positive	i am very satisfied with my purchase and the help i received .
positive	i will use your service , afeyewear in the future and recommend to others .
positive	no_fuss very easy to order on line .

positive	prompt confirmation , dispatch and delivery of ordered items .
positive	i received quick and reliable service while purchasing a rixty card code .
positive	recommend this company to anyone .
positive	i always book with them - they '_ve never let_me down .
positive	it was my first time order on the web .

positive	you had exactly_what i needed and received it promply ... i never trusted ordering by the web but have full_confidence on your products and prices ..
positive	thx
positive	great price and i received the item sooner_than i expected .
positive	thank_you .
positive	within 00_minutes of ordering delivery details were emailed and text to me and a one hour_window supplied for delivery .
positive	just wish all companies were this effective .
positive	excellent product , excellent service , excellent all_round .
positive	i have rated 0_stars as i do feel it is an excellent website , overall customer_service and price .
positive	however .... i specifically wanted a service that provided installation as i am a single_parent with a slight disability .
positive	my old_washer had began vibrating and making noises and as i felt this was due to it no_longer being level i asked the installers to make_sure that the new washer stood level .
positive	obviously they were rushing and simply said that i would need to sort that out myself and get a board to put underneath !
positive	a neighbour later kindly adjusted the feet of the washing_machine so that it stood level .
positive	this was a service that i thought i had already paid for .
positive	but overall i would recommend the site and would definitely use it again .
positive	i get the pet_food i need , when i need it , at a great price and shipped for free ... it can not get any better_than that !

positive	arrived very quickly from france , were just what we needed and were very easy to program .
positive	i have recently started_using enliven coconut body butter .
positive	i purchased this product because i had recently read about how good coconut is for the skin , and for a while i had been looking for a natural coconut moisturiser which was not tested on animals and which did not contain too many added chemicals or artificial ingredients .
positive	the enliven body butter was the only product i could find which met all my criteria and it was really good value too - much_cheaper_than similar products .
positive	i have now been using it for about a week and it is a beautiful product .
positive	it smells great and it glides onto my skin , leaving it silky smooth .
positive	i love this product , shall continue to use it and recommend it to all .
positive	thanks !
positive	delivery was very quick and on time , liked receiving the email with exact delivery time_slot .
positive	product very easy to put_together & seems to be working very well so_far !
positive	the website was very easy to use .
positive	my order came within one day of placing my order and i was given a time_slot when it would be delivered .
positive	highly_recommend using this website !
positive	this was my first experience of ordering oil via the internet ~ i need not have worried as the oil was delivered well in time ... so quickly that my tank did not get as low as i thought .
positive	even the refund for the over - payment was easy to handle !
positive	thank_you boilerjuice . com !
positive	i have used other online companies to autoship pet_food and treats etc .
positive	but none come close to beat out petflow '_s pricing and speed of delivery .
positive	they often offer trials from suppliers at deep_discounts for us to try .
positive	would definitely ( and have ) recommend this company to family and friends
positive	the greatt deals obtained through priceline are literally what have kept me from absolute homelessness .
positive	i lost my job in october_0000 and am able to survive this way as rents any other way are too high .
positive	there is a custom format for every occasion , presenting every experience in a fun and expressive way .
positive	my order of two brown glazed garden stools was followed_up quickly with very caring respectful e_- mails .
positive	delivery was very prompt and my order arrived perfect in very well_packaged boxes .
positive	i went to global to park my car for a business trip .
positive	they were fast , friendly and very accommodating .
positive	they also offer car cleaning .
positive	when i returned , i was brought back to my car and they even helped_me pack my luggage in the trunk .
positive	unlike those other services that drop you off and leave you to your own , they made sure i was returned to my car safely .
positive	i would recommend this place to anyone that needs to park their car prior to any trip .
positive	great service , cheapest good brand lenses , good telephone support , lenses arrived fast ...
positive	exactly_what i ordered and super_fast shipping !
positive	yes_style has always provided me with the best and updated fashions .

positive	when my last tumble_dryer developed a fatal fault i asked the repairman to recommend the best place to get a new one .
positive	he recommended ... appliances_online , " i get all my electricals from them ".
positive	he preferred appliances_online he said as even_though he received an employee discount appliances_online still worked out cheaper .
positive	after_researching different tumble dryers with as much care as i i did my last holiday , i made the big step and rang to order .
positive	the lady at the call_centre couldn_'_t have been nicer or more helpful .
positive	two_days_later i received a call saying my machine would be delivered around 0 . 00am .
positive	that morning .
positive	guess what ... at exactly 0 . 00am the door_bell rang and two very cheerful deliverymen brought my machine in with the minimum of fuss and the maximum of courtesy .
positive	my tumble_dryer operates exactly as_described in the appliance video .
positive	incidentally as someone disabled those videos were great as i could quickly rule out machines where , in the video , the door seemed stiff to open etc .
positive	in conclusion my choice of machine wasn_'_t the cheapest but experience has shown me that you generally get what you pay for .
positive	saying that it certainly wasn_'_t in the most expensive range .
positive	using it is a dream ; a large porthole , an operating dial that turns easily and a clear " time remaining " display .
positive	cleaning out lint after use is easy too .
positive	the only_downside for me is emptying the water tank but hey_ho that is what family are for .
positive	good communication and a very quick delivery thanks
positive	meget indbydende hjemmeside - bestilling nemt_og hurtigt .

positive	susanne , børkop
positive	very quick_turnaround , no_problems found in text .
positive	good job !
positive	it has taken over a year for my rescue cat , macy , to decide what she is willing to eat so i am new at ordering pet products online .
positive	i checked out several sites and started filling my cart from one of them .
positive	but when i tried to find 0_oz .
positive	cans of petguard cat_food , they did not carry that size .
positive	i needed the other things so i placed that order .
positive	then i went to your site and found the exact canned_foods i was looking for .
positive	i ordered the canned_food from you .
positive	thank_you for carrying the smaller_size cans and next time i order products , i will turn to mr . chewy first .
positive	your service is excellent .
positive	love my new stethoscope !
positive	it came in just a few_days and it was exactly how it looked online .
positive	love the engraving too !
positive	i had a surprise move come out of no where and i needed some quick cash !
positive	this was so easy to use !
positive	thanks !
positive	first time using pet_flow .. good value and fast service ... no_complaints
positive	thank_you - a great service !
positive	easy to use service , with quick payment !
positive	i discovered chewy . com after becoming concerned_about feeding my beloved kitties a common , named brand cat_food instead of the high_quality , more natural food that they deserve .
positive	after doing some online searching and finding chewy . com , i made some decisions and ordered two cases of nature '_s variety " instinct " in duck and rabbit .
positive	i also ordered some evo wild cravings treats and several other healthy snacks .
positive	i '_m lucky because our cats are not finicky but they have taken to this food like gang busters .
positive	the extra_cost is well_worth it and the free_shipping on larger orders was the final drawing card .
positive	my ordered arrived a day ahead of what i expected too .
positive	my friends told me they get all of their parts from here so i did .
positive	i '_m so satisfied with my order .
positive	will order again from here !
positive	i needed to ship my car from chicago to southern_california .
positive	when i first called montway , i had done a lot of research online .
positive	most car shipping companies are not recognized by the bbb , but montway has got a a rating .
positive	to me , this was very important because i have read a lot of horror_stories online .
positive	i was very nervous_about having my car shipped , and one of the team_members , bobby , was very patient and helpful in answering the abundance of questions i had for him .
positive	also , every time i called , the staff seemed very caring , available and willing to answer all questions .
positive	the best part was , my initial phone_call was to get a quote , and thereafter i did not receive phone_calls or emails soliciting my business , which was great .
positive	i called back when i was ready to book a pick_up .
positive	again , i found out about montway on my own after several weeks of research .
positive	most other_companies incessantly call or email you for your business , and in my opinion , this is a bad sign .
positive	although not the cheapest company out there , montway did offer a price match for another company quote i received that was of equal quality rating .
positive	( nice !)
positive	my vehicle was contracted out to a third_party contractor , ebs transport , and my driver , bagi , was great !
positive	he came when he said he was going to , and dropped my car off right in front of my home in california when he said he was going to .
positive	my car was in great shape with no damage .
positive	i had great communication with the driver and all parties responsible the whole time , which is something i was very concerned_about .
positive	i have already_recommended montway to a friend who is planning to ship her car from texas to washington_dc .
positive	i am positive she will also have a great experience .
positive	the shoes were dispatched and arrived_promptly , really pleased with them and with the service .
positive	would definitely use again
positive	i am a complete sewing_machine novice but this is exactly as_described and ideal for a beginner like me .
positive	great company to deal with

positive	i will buy none other .
positive	love how i can look up and find just about anything !
positive	can keep a person occupied all day long .
positive	live this site , makes transactions safe and secure and worry free .
positive	everything has shipped very fast .
positive	easy to track shipments , competitive_prices , good variety of inventory .
positive	i love this service , having to make a trip into town to buy dog_food , when i am out , is now one less thing i have to worry_about for my beautiful jack russells .
positive	such a convenience for me since i live an_hour out of town .
positive	i got the best deal and its locked in for my entire lease , also i did no running around to find the best price .
positive	i simply went to sparefoots website put in my zip and boom there was the best offers right in my view .
positive	i accidentally found ukhairdressers . com by_accident whilst_searching for a product to help keep my red hair vibrant in between salon visits .
positive	now that i have i '_ll never look back !
positive	they have the best range of products from the best brands all in one place .
positive	they also offer the best prices and are a far far cheaper alternative to buying your products direct from the salon ( thank_god !)
positive	and then to top it all off , the postage is free ( wow !!)
positive	and my product arrived practically the next_day - what excellent service .
positive	would highly_recommend this website to all of my friends and family .
positive	this is my 0rd time ordering from proworld .

positive	i googled them and sure enough , i found their site .
positive	after a few_minutes into browsing the site , i decided to try out their green_tea since it is one of the safest products available for weight_loss and nowadays everyone seems to be using it .
positive	i was not exactly expecting great results but it worked for me .
positive	not only did i lose 0 . 0 pounds in the first two_weeks , more_importantly it made me much more alert and energetic which is a big thing for a mother of 0 young kids .
positive	since the product was moderately priced it was perfect for a trial and when it worked for me , i also introduced my husband to it .
positive	once he had lost a few measly pounds , he took the big plunge and decided he would go head - on into dieting and muscle building so that his flab can once again faintly resemble a stomach .
positive	accordingly , he is planning to order few muscle building supplements once he has lost some more weight and settled into a good gym routine .
positive	we also tried their fat_burner which was on a special_offer .
positive	though it did not suit me much since my digestive_system could not take it , my husband found it to be extremely effective .
positive	me ?
positive	i am happy with the slow and steady green_tea and would recommend sports food products to anyone_who is looking to lose_weight .
positive	their website is easy to browse and their selection of products just perfect – not too few , yet not so many that you get lost in the details .

positive	* this review is in reference to the " blue_buffalo wilderness grain - free salmon recipe natural revolutionary diet ", which i found on your website 0 months_ago for the low price of $_00 . 00 each , w_/ free s + h . i also received the added incentive of $_00 . 00 off the order when i signed_up for the ' auto - ship ' program .
positive	not only did my first order arrive in lightning - speed time , ( less_than 00_hours from when the order was placed ), it also boasts of a generous ' expiration_date ' of over 0 year '_s time , but i paid far less per bag than even amazon . com has ever offered to me !

positive	" when i met my last rescue pet , dixie , approximately 0 . 0 years_ago , she was a real mess -- both externally and internally .
positive	she exhibited a nervous condition ( g . e . r . d .)
positive	that my vet said was due to her previous horrendous living conditions ; that is to say , that everything that went down her goozle promptly came right back up !
positive	she was painfully emaciated , skeletal almost , and her blood - work was all over the place .
positive	so , after a round of iv fluids and 0 small bags of the ' science_diet ' chow , dixie came home with me to recuperate and to learn how to live in a loving home .
positive	the first thing i did was to research which pet_foods would address her particular condition ; i knew that i didn_'_t want to keep her on the ' science_diet ' regimen -- it '_s too full of ingredients which i feel don_'_t belong in a proper diet for dogs .
positive	lo ' and behold , i stumbled_upon the " blue_buffalo wilderness " formula for dogs .
positive	it seemed like a good fit , due to all of the proper ratios ( protein / fat ) and is totally " grain - free ".
positive	viola !
positive	the rest , as they say , is history .... 0 . 0 years later , dixie now weighs in at approximately 00 loving , happy pounds of my friendly and well - adjusted best friend ."

positive	i have been a customer of altex now for quite a number of years .

positive	i had wandered the internet looking for a great host at good pricing , after_reading a few forums online about hosting sites , i kept reading so many good things about bluehost that i decided to finally commit to them .
positive	i was never disappointed once with any of their service or addon services such as a dedicated security for my shopping_cart .

positive	the clothes and comfortable , attractive and reasonably_priced .
positive	womanwithin even allows returns if your unhappy a purchase for any reason .

positive	they even have clothing accessories , jewelry and shoes !!!!
positive	yea !
positive	if you want reasonable priced , comfortable clothing in your perfect size make it a point to visit the site .
positive	you can even apply for a womanwithin credit_card !
positive	( again , my poor husband , lol ) their credit_card is also accepted by 0 or 0 other clothing sites online , like romans .

positive	some of the questions were quite sensitive for her to ask , although she must be used to it . we talked through my condition , treatment and recovery and she was able to provide me with a comprehensive and well priced quote .
positive	i think it is very fair of your company to ask for a larger excess only if and when any claim is related to my cancer rather_than put it in a very high up front fee , as i had been quoted by another company .

positive	because i '_m feeding 0 small dogs i don_'_t need shipments that often .
positive	so i had to push back my last shipment like 0 times .
positive	each time i called i was fearful of getting attitude , but not the case at all .
positive	every service rep i spoke with was always very understanding and happy to help me figure_out a schedule that worked for me .
positive	not the company .
positive	that speaks_volumes to me .
positive	i thank my daughter for turning me on to petflow .
positive	mazy & piper thank her too !
positive	!
positive	fast delivery and prossesing .
positive	so glad i found this site !!
positive	!
positive	suntransfers are excellent . they were waiting at the airport on our arrival and also picked us up from our hotel for the return trip . very prompt friendly and helpful drivers . would definetly use them again .
positive	this was my second order form ao .
positive	again a good product , at a great price , delivered on day requested .

positive	i would recommend town_fair tire .
positive	in looking for a joint supplement for my arthritic lab , i found petflow '_s site .
positive	i like that the products are mostly organic and / or natural , and bunny seems to like the taste of the petnaturals supplement i bought ( she hated what i got from the vet ).
positive	the active ingredient is nearly the same and she only needs to take one a day versus 0 or 0 for the vet '_s product .
positive	i am a happy_camper .
positive	the only_suggestion i have is to post the recommended dosage on the web_site so that i could have set_up the autodelivery right_away instead of having to wait_until i got the product to figure_out when i will need more .
positive	i bought ovulation_tests and pregnacy tests the price is amazing for how many you can get the sticks are really small that is all i would say as a down_fall but would rather save_money than have an extra bit of plastic around the stick .
positive	thank_you alot .
positive	well what happened to me is i happen to blow a tire on my right passenger_side of my car that tire happen to take my right passenger parking light when it blew out .
positive	so being the perfectionist that i am i cant go around having my car looking crazy every0 know that i take good care of my car so i went online which was exhausting then eureka parks geek came up with the exact part i needed it was easy to install and the part got here quickly im truly satisfied and i would use them again for my future parts needs .
positive	thank_you parksgeek .

positive	i purchased small tags and coaster .
positive	the only issue i have is that i think the price is way too expensive .
positive	like i said , i was looking for a certain look and i could only find the pattern on this website .
positive	i didn_'_t have time to look further .
positive	this put a big dent in my budget .
positive	i left the times at 00 . 00 for departure and return , and when i noticed - after i had paid - i thought i was going to be charged for my mistake , but one quick phone_call and they put it right there and then and sent me an_email to confirm the times were changed correctly .
positive	well_done !
positive	brilliant treatment for a donut like me !

positive	hi pet_flow is a great place where they care about your pets and the owners , they listen to your every need and respond back quickly when you write to them . also most of what i remember it is free_shipping on their products .
positive	i tried both giftcards . com ( giftcards plural , the better service which i '_m reviewing now ) and giftcard . com ( giftcard singular , aka giftcardlab ) to design the same card .
positive	first , giftcards . com had a lower fee to make a custom gift_card , and offered visa or mastercard ( other site only offered visa ).
positive	more_importantly this site let_me use the wording i wanted - i couldn_'_t use the word ' whiskey ' in the greeting_card via the other service , because of their restrictions on terminology ( in this case , nothing alcohol related was allowed ), even_though ' whiskey ' was part of my username for an online gift exchange ( and therefore necessary to include ).
positive	the other site also would not let_me make any references to how the gift_card would be used ( specifically , i couldn_'_t say it was for a " choose your own date night " using the giftcardlab , but giftcards . com had no problem with it ).
positive	overall , this giftcards . com service was very flexible , easy to use , and i will_definitely use it again .
positive	i love love love this site !!
positive	it '_s my go to site when my kids needs microsoft point and i don_'_t have to leave the house .
positive	how simple is that !!
positive	!
positive	order these merrell walking shoes for my husband to replace the same .
positive	the price was much_cheaper_than elsewhere and with free_postage they were most certainly a bargain .
positive	they came in double quick time too .
positive	i have used blackcircles before and as i was very pleased with the service and the quick delivery , decided to use them again .
positive	i needed my new tyre quickly as i had collided with a huge stone in the highway and had a small tyre on .
positive	wasn_'_t dissappointed ........ it arrived within 0 days !!
positive	!
positive	they promised a price match and 00_% further off if you found a product they were selling cheaper_than them - within one day of sending the email request to inform them that a product i wanted was cheaper on another site , they provided a code back to honour the price match and further 00_%.
positive	speedy_delivery , excellent customer_service - will use again and again for all my baby requirements .
positive	thanks !
positive	it is a pleasure not to have to lug 00_pounds of blue from the store to the truck from the truck to the house .
positive	plus , riley know it '_s for him and just seeing him jump all over the box is a joy .

positive	we live in the north of scotland and i get my order the next_day !
positive	i '_m shocked and impressed every time !
positive	very good out of all of them but a bit_slow on the reloan website is excellent easy to follow
positive	i purchased a toyota tailgate handle , service was fast , product was good quality and good price .
positive	i have recently_purchased a tailgate handle from a different company , and that one is already broken , hence this purchase .
positive	this handle seems a lot sturdier .
positive	i was very impressed by your prompt and efficient delivery service , i received text_messages informing_me what time to within an_hour my delivery would arrive , loved the items when they arrived , reasonable shipping rates , all in all , top_class .
positive	quinn and the team were very good .
positive	the hotel is situated in a very good location .
positive	which ever type of activitiy you ' re after quinn can give you his inside scoop , including the best taxi '_s , tailors , restaurants , etc .
positive	he wants to look after you as his gues .
positive	the rooms were perfect , just what we needed for a great price .
positive	fast , easy and reliable .
positive	i know i '_ll get what i need when i need it .
positive	i am not one to buy merchandise warranties but because some of the items i '_ve purchsed over the last few_years are hand_held devices , used by our kids , i thought the likelihood of these devices getting damaged was very high ; square_trade offers accidental_coverage of the warranties i '_ve purchased , i '_ve had to file a few claims and they have either fixed the item right_away , or paid for it without_any hassles and right_away .
positive	their prices are totally_worth it , especially if you can find a coupon .
positive	i '_ll keep using them for my electronic purchases , especially with christmas right around the corner .
positive	i have often reviewed various_countries and lots of different hotels and resorts through trip_advisor and always found them to be very helpful .
positive	i wouldn_'_t think of going to look on any other site .

positive	equally , at what for me was a very stressful life stage , i felt valued in that they cared enough to take time to fully understand my situation and talk through all the options available , nothing was too much_trouble .
positive	it felt_like having a trusted friend to guide and support me through a difficult life transition .
positive	a truly valuable partnership .
positive	customer no 0000000
positive	have a look at this website - its brilliant
positive	i ordered my oil on sunday_evening and it was delivered on tuesday_morning for no extra_cost .
positive	i always use group ordering as well so received a discount on the original price quoted .
positive	i was delivered the wrong product , however customer_service is excellent and the problem sorted speedily .
positive	use pure_formulas when ordering all your supplements .
positive	it provides the best service and donates part of their profits to vitamin angels .
positive	they prices are outstanding ..
positive	if you find the same product cheaper they will not only match their price but also beat it by 0 %.
positive	this is my first time but i plan on coming_back for more ..
positive	i already than refered six customers an so_far we all are waiting to recieve or products in the mail .. to me there shipping prices are a bit high but when you are recieving the product for a low amount how can you go wrong with that .
positive	i believe that i will recieve the same progress if i went an spend $_00 . 00 on the same product .
positive	i have no_problems with international editions of textbooks and their shipping was quick and easy .
positive	i ' d buy from them again for sure .
positive	the dog_food was the cheapest price i could find and it came in 0 days .
positive	i '_ll definitely order from them again .
positive	i just ordered from sw for the 0th time , and every time they offer value and quick delivery .

positive	i would definitely order from them again !
positive	luna_bazaar called and emailed me to let_me know the item i order was out of stock .
positive	they were so friendly and helpful when i called .
positive	i bought this shoulder_strap for my son who has dislocated his shoulder 0 times now !

positive	!
positive	both myself and my daughter have been buying from select_specs for several_years_now as they are the best value .
positive	very quick delivery too .
positive	i '_ve been coming to tft for years .
positive	i '_ve only had pleasant experiences when visiting the store .
positive	each time i '_ve had issues with my tires i always return because i trust the sales_rep and they are very honest and fair .
positive	even the technicians are wonderful .
positive	i absolutely love every person in this store .
positive	the only issue i have is that i think tft as a company should give the techs that work on the actual cars / trucks air_conditioning in the auto shop / bays .
positive	i was looking at tires in the back of the store and the the tech opened the door and i was horrified when i felt the hot air hit me .
positive	it '_s unfair to make people work in such an environment .
positive	it was 00 + degrees and humid yesterday and even_though they had fans i felt it was wrong to have any person work in such an atmosphere .
positive	it actually infuriated me that a company would treat any employee that way .
positive	all in all i would definitely recommend tft to all my friends and family .
positive	this branch is amazing , the employees are sweet and kind .
positive	even if there is a wait , they make the point to greet you and tell you they will be right with you and apologize for the inconvenience .
positive	just excellent service all around .
positive	great service from the whisky_exchange , always kept me up to date and received my goods within a couple of days , very good secure_packaging ........ i would recommend and i will be using this site again :-)
positive	as i grow older , and my eyes grow dimmer with macular degeneration and cataract formation , the light with which i read becomes all - important .
positive	having a light_fixture that can be positioned at just the angle i need to cast light on whatever i am reading is essential , a nd your lamp delivered just what i was looking for .
positive	i appreciate the ability to adjust the lumens to my needs , as i am in a well - lighted room , and usually dim the lamp considerably .
positive	however , having a more powerful light when i need it , and being_able to focus the light exactly where i need it makes this lamp a great find .
positive	efficient , knowledgeable , reachable by phone (!!!!
positive	), friendly and patient , excellent honest descriptions of parts and easy navigation on site .
positive	what else can you ask for .... maybe , in my case , just that the volvo wheel emblems can be obtained separate from the wheels because i would rather buy them from you .
positive	happy to know you !
positive	i had a flat_tire on sunday and needed to get to work on monday by 0 : 00 a . m .
positive	i was working a double so needed my flat fixed asap .
positive	the tire could not be fixed so i had to purchase a new tire .
positive	it was 0 : 00 a . m .
positive	the transaction was handled swiftly and seamlessly .
positive	i was at my desk in hamden by 0 : 00 .
positive	great job !
positive	i was happy as was my boss .
positive	the service is similar in cost to many off airport car_parks when booked in advance , but the ease of arrival and return is so much_better .
positive	there is nothing to beat having your car ready and waiting for you within a stone '_s throw of the arrival lounge .
positive	i can feel_confident ordering from b_&_h .
positive	they '_ve been around a long time , know their products and give the best value !
positive	i needed a stethoscope for school , this site had the cheapest prices , allowed me to compare models and offered free_engraving .... other_sites were up to $_00 more_expensive and charged extra for engraving .

positive	the only_thing i wish the site would put a full description of what comes with the parts .

positive	moving across country can be a pain in the buttocks .
positive	i will be doing that soon , and since i cannot_afford a moving van i decided that since i have to drive up for some job interviews , i should haul some stuff with me and put it in storage nearby until my moving date .
positive	trying to find a storage_unit with available units and prices was hard to do with no phone book , but sparefoot had everything i needed .
positive	no credit_card was needed and i was able to reserve a unit with no_hassles !

positive	i have used double 0 and always have amazing seats .
positive	tickets always arrive in good time .
positive	i have not ordered labels in a couple of years from this company .
positive	just didn_'_t have a need for them .
positive	i love what i ordered this time again .
positive	the web_site is so easy and simple and shows exactly_what you are ordering .
positive	if a mistake is made it is your fault .
positive	will order again .
positive	the insure & go agent was very helpful , and the price was $_000 lower_than the insurance company my travel_agent used !
positive	however , i don_'_t know what they ' re like if one has a claim .
positive	first time buying from pureformulas . com and thought it was great !
positive	easy website to maneuver , great prices , super_fast free_shipping , and i enjoyed the free_sample they gave_me .
positive	i definitely recommend to check them out !
positive	i suggest price checking though ; i found certain products more_expensive and some that were cheaper .
positive	all of the orders i '_ve placed have been processed immediately and shipped with no_issues .
positive	i would definitely order from them again .
positive	this is an amazing website , i will use it every christmas and birthday .
positive	thank_you !
positive	i was worried_about the toner_cartridge i purchased in that it might not fit the printer but was assured by prompt on - line help that it would .
positive	my purchase was delivered in a few_days and everything fits and works_perfectly .
positive	many_thanks hot_toner .
positive	great product and inexpensive .
positive	definitely would recommend petflow . com .
positive	easy to use , navigable website , good prices , and quick delivery !
positive	i was freaking out because i had to book a flight pretty last_minute and all of the flights i could find were outrageously priced .
positive	skytours was the only site that offered a reasonable flight with a great airline and i couldn_'_t be_happier !
positive	fast shipping , great product !
positive	very satisfied .
positive	will buy again !
positive	thanks .
positive	i have websites on at_least four other_places , and including a fancy thing which cost me way too much money .
positive	none of the others are as successful , or as much fun to do , as the simplesite places .
positive	i now have three of them , and i love them .
positive	building them is a lot of fun , and easy for me , an old lady not much good with a computer .
positive	lover them !

positive	thanks for having in stock what i needed .
positive	easy to use and navigate .
positive	i would recommend to anyone .
positive	despite the explosion in internet shopping some uk companies are reluctant or refuse to deliver outside the uk .
positive	i organise deliveries for my self from companies in britain to my home and formerly business in france .
positive	the idea of using up free space in trucks coming over to france anyway makes so much sense and one reaps the benefits of the a choice of the most economic carrier if there is no hurry and express if urgent .
positive	the web_site is easy to use and the labels and dispatch notes are perfect for the companies sending the goods .
positive	i have recommended this service to other people living both in france and spain and companies thinking of exporting from the uk .
positive	in the mean time if i am quoted more than £_00 for delivery by a company i always check to see if the volumetric and weight parameters will deliver a cheaper delivery using interparcel .
positive	finally the companies i have bought goods from find that by me organising the delivery through interparcel they have less hassle and work .
positive	really tremendous !!
positive	ordering was very easy with no_complications , also they are very
positive	understanding as i was on a time limit for a wedding in the u . k . in june , so i had
positive	to have all my things in france before leaving , bravo to you all ..
positive	thank_you for helping_me and making the process easier .
positive	super_fast service and the price was right !
positive	does it get any better ?
positive	i called last_minute to gather info as to which tire was best for my car .
positive	being female and leery of anything in the auto industry , i shopped_around with the info fair town auto gave_me .
positive	long_story short - their recommendation was spot on and they had the best price !
positive	highly_recommend !
positive	0000 diesel mercedes wagon parts are difficult to find .

positive	whilst looking through a range of hotels in london , there was one which sounded ideal for myself and the family .
positive	before booking it , i had a query , so i phoned the free helpline for advice .
positive	the person that answered my call said that they would ring the hotel to find an answer my question , then call me back .
positive	in a matter of minutes , i had a phone_call back with an answer . very impressed with the speed of reply and looking_forward to a weekend away in london .
positive	my granddaughter needed this book for a course she would study over the christmas break , starting on december 00 .

positive	this is my first time replacing a laptop_screen .
positive	i was worried that i wouldn_'_t get it right , that i ' d order the wrong screen , that i ' d break something , that i ' d get it apart and be unable to get it back together , etc .
positive	first , there '_s no easy way to know the exact model of the screen without taking the screen out .
positive	second , there '_s not necessarily a tutorial video for the exact model of laptop one is dealing_with .
positive	still , with the tools provided by laptopscreen . com , i made a very good guess for the screen model , i watched their video tutorial on a similar laptop model , and was able to bring my dell inspiron 0000 back to life with a beautiful bright new display .
positive	the screen arrived_promptly ; it was well - packaged ; the price was reasonable .
positive	i '_m a happy_camper .
positive	if i ever need another screen , i '_m coming_back to you !
positive	get what you want , and with a minimum order free_shipping ?

positive	the glasses fit well and are just what i needed .
positive	i love yesstyle !!

positive	i recommend yesstyle to the moon and back .
positive	happy shopping !

positive	i spoken whit my friends about ecco_shop and i told him that shopping in yours shoop was pleasure .
positive	i have placed 0 orders with memoryc in the past 0 months .
positive	one is always somewhat_skeptical when dealing_with a new vendor , especially over the internet .
positive	i can '_t say_enough about the exemplary customer_service i received from memoryc .
positive	the first order : i was given a tracking_number and an_approximate delivery date , while following the orders progress i noticed it seemed to be not making any progress , i emailed memoryc ...' hoping ' to get a response ... i received an immediate reply , through the course of several emails it was found out that my order and several others had been lost by shipper .
positive	memoryc immediately sent out a replacement shipment ... as it turned_out the shipper found the missing items , memoryc contacted me again and let_me know that the quickest delivery would be with the original shipment .... the order was delivered within a day of the original delivery date ..... memoryc contacted me after i signed for the package and asked if everything was as it should be ... then gave_me a credit for the freight i had paid on the order .... unbelievable !
positive	second order : no difference than the first order i was given a tracking_# and delivery date ... this time on time - actually ahead of time .
positive	the issue this time was my fault ... i had ordered the wrong memory for my laptop .... i emailed memoryc - they immediately gave_me a rga and helped_me verify that i was ordering the right part #.
positive	as it turns_out , i sent the memory back in a us postal envelope .. somehow the envelope opened during_transit and the memory was lost .... memoryc notified me and sent me a picture of the envelope when they received it .... what could i say at that point .... they said a lot .... they first offered me a voucher for a discount on my next order ... then turned around a few_days_later and give me the credit for the memory .... again unbelievable !
positive	giving me the credit was far and beyond there responsibility ... but very much_appreciated !
positive	in this day and age of ' numbers ' - it is nice to find a company who_cares , and one you can actually contact and get immediate answers and help .
positive	thank_you memoryc ....
positive	i love selectspecs .
positive	it offers the highest_quality glasses at the lowest_prices .

positive	since all my animals come into my house thru the sliding door in the kitchen which is white tile i was constantly mopping until i ordered the dirty_dog door_mat .
positive	i had bought one at a feed_store and paid a small_fortune for it .. thru petflow i was able to order 0 for what i paid for one at the feed_store .

positive	pet_flow is a wonderful place to order cat_food from .
positive	they ' re on time , it '_s fresh , and they keep you posted about any changes in the foods or orders .

positive	i '_m a repeat_customer now !
positive	we have recently_purchased memory_sticks for our company and client use .

positive	we bought our american_style fridge_freezer last_year from currys and it recently broke_down completely .
positive	after offering us a replacement , the same product was not available at the store for over 0_weeks .
positive	my sister recommended ao as their customer_service had been excellent when she ' d bought the wrong dishwasher by mistake .
positive	as soon as our money was refunded , i bought the fridge_freezer from ao and was delighted when i could pick the delivery day ( you cannot do this with currys ).
positive	their customer_service team called me to run through the delivery details , which i thought was very efficient .
positive	i paid £_00 connection fee so they would take the packaging away , install the item and give me a demo .
positive	when they delivered it , all they did was plug it in and advise me to switch it on in 0 hours .
positive	so i felt this was a little_disappointing .
positive	i left feedback about this and their customer_services advisor emailed me immediately apologising and confirming she had refunded the connection fee .
positive	i couldn_'_t_believe it - a company who not only apologised but offered a refund without me properly complaining !
positive	and i still would have recommended ao even if my money hadn_'_t been refunded !
positive	i '_ve been extremely impressed with ao and will_definitely use the company to purchase all appliances in the future .
positive	there aren_'_t many companies that manage to exceed my expectations , but ao honestly did !
positive	easy to navigate .
positive	prompt and correct order .

positive	i will have the transition_lenses put in each pair after my eye appointment / latest exam .

positive	not only does chewy . com carry the brand we were looking for , they have a lot of different products available and offered free_shipping on orders over $_00 ... i would have spent that much had i gone to the local_pet_store anyway !
positive	our order was shipped for free and arrived 0 days after we placed the order .... fantastic service !
positive	will_definitely order again !
positive	great website , very easy to use .
positive	like the fact that they was a rated most_popular for a certain budget , that '_s how i got to chose my model the janome snd0000 .

positive	yesstyle is extremely versatile , very reliable , and reasonably_priced ... especially on shipping !
positive	they ' re usually in my price range as a college_student with only so many funds .
positive	plus they make it easy to find what you ' re looking for , suits , sweatshirts , dresses , frills , studs , skulls , roses , you name it they probably have it !
positive	i also really like the fact that they show models wearing the product and what you see is actually what you ' re buying .
positive	on top of that they usually give you a couple ideas on what to mix and match with the item and i really appreciate that as i prefer to know how my clothes are actually going to fit which is why before yesstyle i was always really skeptical_about purchasing online .
positive	i don_'_t shop from other online stores for clothes or accessories ever , not even u . s . stores , because yesstyle has never let_me down when it comes to their product .
positive	also the shipping is great !
positive	i '_ve ordered from japanese / korean / chinese / thai stores and i can '_t tell you how frustrating it is to buy something and wait nearly 0_weeks and it '_s still not there .
positive	but yesstyle doesn_'_t do that , they tell you when they '_ll be able to ship , and the longest i '_ve seen 0 - 00 days , but you can always narrow your search to " ready to ship " and it '_ll get to you in about 0 - 0 days after order if you pay the 0 . 00 for 0 day shipping .
positive	the longest i '_ve seen is five , but that was once and five days isn_'_t even that bad .
positive	p . s .
positive	the 0 . 00 0 day shipping is highly_recommended , it '_s a couple dollar difference , but if you live in the states , it can take a while before ems finally decides you can whatever you bought .
positive	no fault of yesstyle , that '_s just my personal experience with ems .
positive	tl ; dr they ' re you ' re favorite store even if you haven_'_t shopped with them yet .
positive	one of the easiest and best gadgets to have and use frequently !
positive	les fleurs étaient une surprise qui a fait plaisir au destinataire .

positive	i did a lot of research before i bought my larder_fridge and freezer , the choice of products was far greater than most retailers and i got them at a greater discount because i bought them together and saved £_000_pounds on the next cheapest retailer for the same product , and if i wanted to i could have gone and viewed them in their show room , the service was excellent i was kept_fully_updated on my order given a date and approx time_slot upon ordering and even received a text with the drivers names , and then a further phone_call to say that they where only twenty mins_away on the day of delivery .
positive	fantastic service .

positive	our dog was put on a special_diet because of oxalate stones in his urine .
positive	we were only able to get this food at our vet which wasn_'_t the most convenient ( or reasonable !).
positive	with the petflow program , i know that the next order is on the way before he runs out and i don_'_t have to make a special trip to the vet to pick_up more ( and not having to lug_heavy cases of canned_dog_food is an extra bonus !).

positive	i '_ve booked cars and package deals , and have never been disappointed .

positive	good job .
positive	dave works hard and knows what he is doing .
positive	very speedy service lovely products , would certainly recommend .
positive	we had a great experience with auto_europe canada .
positive	our car was waiting for us - the only annoying part was having to pay for a second driver - i know this is standard in europe - but after coming_back from california where we could put as many drivers as we wanted for free , it '_s a little frustrating not to at_least be able to put a second driver for free .
positive	the car was brand_new - and unlike us rentals , it did have bells and whistles - ie it gives you an idea what a new car is really like and all the pluses that go with it - for example we did have a gps integrated in the car which was very useful - in the us the cars that are rented are so basic it would never give you any urge to go and buy one - the drop_off at the airport at 0 : 00 a . m . was simple - we assume the final billing will be accurate !
positive	so we had a peugeot 000 - great little car and a terrific holiday .
positive	i love not having to drive 00_miles to get my favorite weight_management dog_food .
positive	i no_longer have to load the heavy_bags into the cart then into the car then into the house .

positive	i ordered some ink the following week on the monday_evening and received it on the wednesday .
positive	laptop brilliant value and enjoying the speed of it compared to my old one .
positive	i received e_- mails and texts to confirm delivery times and my only_criticism is that they said i would receive the laptop on the friday and it came a day early which could have been a problem , but for me was a relief as i had the day off .
positive	the text for the delivery of the ink gave_me a one hour_window and it was delivered within ten_minutes of the start time .
positive	haven_'_t tried the ink yet but hoping it '_s compatible with my printer as it '_s the cheapest i '_ve ever_seen and i use a lot !!

positive	the latter arriving only 0 days after my order was placed ... and i live in the jungles of borneo !
positive	i have had some extremely disappointing experiences with several other uk retailers ; including some very familiar names .
positive	not so with country_attire .
positive	both customer_services and sales teams have been truly exceptional and i couldn_'_t be more pleased with the ease of communication and technology , which is critical when working at such a distance .
positive	additionally , the products were of exceptional quality , and accurately_described , so i am confident that i will be making further_purchases from this excellent company .

positive	a +++ would not go_anywhere_else !

positive	it was fun to be able to track it and keep her informed as to where it was !
positive	would definitely use the service again .
positive	i feel i can get a fair value and great service at town_fair .
positive	now that i know i can book an_appointment has made me a loyal_customer .
positive	i have been a customer for a number of years_now .
positive	the staff in everett - dennis - isarus & sam were great to do_business with today .
positive	love the concern of the company even after receiving your medicine .
positive	i got the 0 . 00 bride to be sash and it was perfect - looked great , i clipped it on with a safety pin and it stayed put all night ( even when i rode the mechanical bull !).
positive	the tiara was perfect too - you can '_t really tell it says " bride to be " but i didn_'_t want anything too flashy ( like no attached veil , no blinking lights ) so it was perfect for me , it was comfy , and also stayed put all night .
positive	so happy with our purchases !
positive	i am so pleased with this product .
positive	it arrived in less_than a week and i am a very satisfied customer .
positive	thanks so much .
positive	i had a great experience .
positive	it was easy and i would recommend it to others .
positive	my order arrived in a timely_manner and everything was as_described .
positive	the prices were very good as well !
positive	my order was delivered earlier_than_expected , good value for money and confidential !
positive	i have to say i am a nervous online shopper , being a recovering technophobe , double nervous when booking to stay in a city i haven_'_t been before , and don_'_t speak the language .
positive	i was under pressure to sort somewhere out and quick , as i wanted to go and see a performance in barcelona .
positive	i had been putting off going on line .
positive	i got on to easy to book , and it is so refreshing when the name of a company reflects the service their name implies accurately , because that was my experance exactly .
positive	something i had put off for three_weeks was over in five minuets ......!
positive	an_email of exactly_what i had got for my money , along with really useful instructions of how to get to my hotel from all options .
positive	traveling_alone this is the sort of thing that gives me a bit of confidence .
positive	it was my first time , booking on line and i will_definitely be useing them again and i would have no_hesitation recommending easytobook . co . uk .
positive	many_thanks .
positive	i am busy planning my next trip in july and will be looking to easytobook to find my accomidation .
positive	i like it .
positive	there are so many options , that if delivery . com weren_'_t easy to use and didn_'_t have the restaurants i wanted , i wouldn_'_t use it !
positive	i found the logo co while performing a search for a logo design company and in the process found all the wonderful reviews they had on trustpilot . com .
positive	as a result of their reviews and portfolio i went_ahead and hired them to design a logo for my llc .
positive	the whole_process was seamless and i couldn_'_t have been more pleased with everyone .
positive	they designed amazing logos for me to choose from with their interpretations of what i described .
positive	interpretation was everything and once i found the right words and sent examples they hit it right on the nose ..... it blew me completely away and made the decision to narrow_down a design difficult , because i loved all of them so much .
positive	i '_m so thankful for their patience in working with me to get the picture i had in mind on paper .
positive	i will certainly use their services in the future and will recommend them to my colleagues .
positive	this is by_far a bargain and one of the best decisions i '_ve made for my company !
positive	updated review 00 / 00 / 0000
positive	since my previous_review i have required the logo co .' s assistance on more tasks / projects than i ' d like to name .
positive	from help with getting the proper files for a wax seal stamp , troubleshooting with me & adding a trademark symbol to my logo , just to name few things .
positive	each time they were as responsive , prompt , helpful , knowledgeable , & genuinely kind as any other time i '_ve ever needed their assistance .
positive	turn_around time was always within ( 0 ) business day & the work was top_notch . i truly can not say_enough about their customer_service & values .
positive	thank_you so very much for a superb service , i ' am a forever customer & forever_grateful !

positive	was recommended to me by a friend and really happy i used this service
positive	my experience with ur company has_been great .
negative	it took more like two_weeks .
negative	i called and called but i only received the run_around .
negative	royal caribbean acknowledged the price drop and told me i couldn_'_t get the difference i paid because i paid in full but they offered me an upgrade to another category higher on the ship .
negative	the travelocity representative advised me not to take the upgrade and wait_until i heard from the guarantee department .
negative	needless to say the exact day that they let_me know that i didn_'_t qualify for the price guarantee the sale went off and royal caribbean could no_longer offer me the upgrade either .
negative	i didn_'_t get the price protection guarantee because they said the category was not the same .
negative	it was an upgraded category that was better_than mine for 000 less .
negative	travelocity did not care and did nothing to compensate me .
negative	i was furious and will never book with them again !!
negative	we cruise twice a year and they have certainly loss my business !
negative	do yourself a favor and book directly with the cruiseline , it will be worth your while .
negative	this was a horrible experience .
negative	i really tossed out the idea of canceling my booking all together and rebooking even_though it meant i would lose half my money .
negative	travelocity was awful and non accomdating .
negative	they put a huge negative on my very special_occasion .
negative	because of an airline delay , i missed my scheduled pick - up time .
negative	i contacted rentalcars . com as soon as my flight was rescheduled and 0 hours before the originally scheduled pick - up time to reschedule my pick - up .
negative	rentalcars delayed responding for 00_hours and then informed me that because it was after my scheduled pickup time i would forfeit 000_% of my paid in full rental .
negative	i '_ve spent the last several hours being given the run_around by this company both over the phone and online .
negative	they have the worst customer_service i '_ve ever_experienced .
negative	they even sent my two fake phone numbers to call , one of which put me in an infinite loop with an advertisement for cruises to the bahamas .
negative	this is the worse online business i '_ve ever_dealt_with .
negative	i ' d give zero_stars if it were possible .

negative	when we arrived in azusa to get our storage_unit they said the storage_unit was not available .
negative	admittedly it was move out weekend at the local college , but we were very disappointed .
negative	the confirmation number you supplied was ignored and we had to rent elsewhere .
negative	we are sorry your service didn_'_t work and will not seek storage at that place of business again - no_matter what the promises .

negative	i love their clothes but them getting them items shipped out takes_forever .
negative	by the time i get my clothes i won_'_t be excited anymore .
negative	we have been planning and saving for this trip for a year .
negative	our trip is for october_0000 .
negative	we aren_'_t even there yet and have had nothing but frustration and heartache .
negative	we are going to jamaica to get married and have our_honeymoon , to be one of the most joyous times in our lives and it has_been a nightmare for 0 days now !
negative	we have been on the phone with book it for 0 days and for and hour and a half each time .
negative	they are saying there is nothing they can do to help us fix our trip the way we wanted it in the first place .
negative	and to fix it , it is going to cost us an extra $_000 !
negative	we are already spending $ 0000 on this trip , something that we budgeted for .
negative	still on the phone with book it right now and have been for the past 0 hours !
negative	come to find out we have to use our flight vouchers through book it to now get the correct flight .
negative	so now we are stuck with book it for our flight .
negative	we are cancelling the hotel reservations with them and going to go through the hotel we want directly !
negative	this has_been the most horrific experience ever !!!!
negative	i will never go through book it ever again !!!
negative	!
negative	i would like to say that michael snarski , out of the three people we have had to talk to to try to resolve this has_been very nice and very helpful to go step by step through every figure and problem we had and try to help us as best he could .
negative	again , i will never use book it ever again !!!!!
negative	the worst_experience !!
negative	!
negative	i was told what to do .
negative	take out the cartridges , unplug printer , blah_blah_blah .
negative	but after the first time my printer won_'_t reset itself .
negative	cant print out business forms with no ink !
negative	shoulda " splurged " and went to staples .
negative	or better yet , will someone please tell me what happened to the kits where you could fill the cartridges yourself ??!!!
negative	i got good at that then they vanished !
negative	i went_ahead and purchased a hotel & flight package with bookit 0_weeks before my flight because there was supposedly only 0 seats left and they were having a sale .
negative	0 days_later i received an_email about another " sale " they were having and checked the price just to see what it was and it was $_000 cheaper !
negative	i tried to see if i could get the difference in fare and they said they couldn_'_t do anything to help me .
negative	that is ridiculous .
negative	if they wanted to show good customer_service , they could at_least have given me a partial_refund in the difference .
negative	not only that , but they " bookit perks " that were included in the trip were for free_wifi & breakfast , but wifi was only in the lobby of the hotel , not in the room !
negative	be warned !
negative	not good customer_service !!
negative	!
negative	trust me stay far away from this place they did 0 wheel bearings a little less then a year_ago 000 a piece and now they i need them done again either the job was not done right or the part was bad and cheap i found out the part came from a wholesale warehouse that are not using quality parts in your vechile they are cheap and are full of scams i will be calling the cooperate headquarters in the morningand most_likely will get the run_around i went to the shop were i got it done and was told by the new manager i would have never used that part company come on it '_s still mavis the company who ordered the part i just wish some one would have warned me about them so i hope this post helps people in the future

negative	we loved viator in barcelona .
negative	so we didn_'_t hesitate to book a very expensive trip in paris .
negative	it was pretty disappointing .
negative	we booked it for a tuesday , the 00 of may at 0 a . m . we stood in the rain waiting for one hour .
negative	they never came for us .
negative	we agreed to try again two_days_later .
negative	the van showed_up on time !
negative	this was supposed to be
negative	an eight person tour to normandy .
negative	fortunately , there were only six , because eight would not have fit comfortably for a fourteen hour tour .
negative	for six it would have been very comfortable , but the driver was in a hurry .
negative	his_wife needed him to help with his kids .
negative	he drove too fast , tailgated and passed on very narrow roads .
negative	we have seen a lot of bad drivers ( taipei , new_york , rome etc_.)
negative	but this was in a class by itself .
negative	his knowledge of his subject was superficial , and most_importantly , especially_since we were going to the beaches and cemetery at normandy , he had numerous unamerican comments to make .
negative	inappropriate anytime , but on this sad occasion , really hurtful .
negative	the battle sites are beautiful , the museum was very well_done , and the french countryside is breathtaking .
negative	i would not recommend reservationcounter to you .
negative	the website book my hotel resevation twice and continued to request info again after the second time i called the toll_free number and book the reservation and finally received a confirmation .
negative	the hotel informed me of 0 rooms booked
negative	placed an order dec 00 , site said product in stock website also said usually ships in 0 - 0 days , today dec 00 it says " in process " this is not acceptable .
negative	never sent me a notice there would be a delay , i had it shipped to a friend since i would be traveling .
negative	when i made this reservation , i made it straight from the hotel website ...
negative	when i called the hotel i was quoted $_000 a night .
negative	this is not what i was charged through your service .. i called your help number and received a telephone operator that could_barely speak_english and said she would try and cancel the last 0 nights for a refund .
negative	i am staying in this room until monday july_0th .
negative	i just want for you to match the price of $_000 a night to fix this problem i need a response quickly
negative	i paid a lot of money to have my labels delivered to the uk with the ups expedited service for my wedding .
negative	the my own_labels website says that the ups brokerage charge is included in the shipping cost .
negative	ups charged me a surcharge anyway .
negative	this plus vat doubled my shipping cost .
negative	i asked for a refund of the surcharge since i wasn_'_t warned about it and would not have placed my order if i ' d known shipping would cost so much ( around half the cost of the labels !).
negative	my own_labels refused to give me a refund , stating that this was an_additional surcharge and not their responsibility .
negative	not good customer_service !
negative	would not use this service which claims to represent the property that you want is really call_center for several others dishonest and then charge fees that they did not disclose and hotel then claims no responsibility
negative	i received a branded gift_card for $_00 .
negative	when attempting to " activate " it , the balance shown was $ 0 .
negative	we have contacted giftcards . com numerous_times over a period of 0 days .
negative	all we get is apologies and promises to fix it within 00_hours .
negative	so_far we hold a worthless card that we paid $_00 for .
negative	thanks a lot giftcards . com !

negative	i '_m going to do more shopping around before placing a order .
negative	if i could give zero_stars i would .
negative	i placed my order on the 00rd of march and just got an_email today , may_0th , saying that it was shipped .
negative	my items were in stock and supposed to ship within 0 - 0 business days .
negative	i sent several emails inquiring_about the order and they never responded .
negative	i actually assumed that the order wasn_'_t going to come .
negative	never again !
negative	purchased the alex heart sweater in cream as i wanted something for winter .
negative	it was also not cream but more of an outmeal colour , however that i could of lived with .
negative	having searched for long_sleeve sweaters and with the item description stating long_sleeved also i was somewhat suprised when it arrived and the sleeves were above my elbow .
negative	i returned the item an emailed boohoo , after_reading their returns_policy , to query why they not only do not offer to refund postage for items that are not are clearly not as_described but in addition to that add an_additional £ 0 . 00 restocking charge .
negative	0_weeks_later and i have received no response to my email , my review was removed from their site and i am still_awaiting a refund despite them acknowledging receipt of the item on 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	and to top it all the do not even have a customer_service number you can call to complain .
negative	would never use again
negative	i bought an ipod for my kid on christmas , the product never arrived to my hose .
negative	i asked the seller twice to ship it ups or fedex and to ask for a signature .
negative	after starting a claim , the seller showed a tracking_number confirming that he did ship the ipod , but through usps standard mail .
negative	what happened was that he tried to save some money ( although i paid for ups / fedex ) and never mentioned that a signature was required .
negative	the package must have been left_outside my house when no one was there and someone stole it .
negative	what did ebay say ?
negative	that the seller what not responsible , so i lost $_000 .
negative	will never buy on scambay again .
negative	go amazon !
negative	!
negative	you misrepresented your site as marriots site
negative	im so annoyed @ this site , i bought a total of 0 items and recieved 0 !!??
negative	my heels that cost me over $_00 aud weren_'_t in the parcel , i tried emailing them several_times and they just saying " we '_ll look into it " but the investigation didnt go_anywhere and its been sooo long .. i wanted to open a despute with paypal at one stage but i had no time , id rather warn_others on this fraud .
negative	please be careful with online shopping , i was so light headed about it , i now review before i purchase anything from any site ... be a smart shopper and dont get fooled like i did .. amiclubwear should be shutdown .
negative	and if theres others out there that went through what i did , dont stay silent .. let it out there .. they are making $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ a day & people just dont do anything about it , post as much blogs as possible , peace :)
negative	we were looking_forward to sitting in our lovely new teak garden chairs this summer when we bought them from achica ( and paid for them in full ) back in april .
negative	delivery was promised in may .
negative	well , it '_s now the middle of june and , yes , you '_ve guessed it we have no chairs .
negative	we must have heard every excuse in the book - mainly blaming their delivery company each time .
negative	" oh it '_ll be with you soon , it '_s in their warehouse ".
negative	all absolute rubbish .
negative	think it '_s a scam to hold_onto your money ( which they can then earn interest on ).
negative	they also have no interest in customer complaints and treat customers whose money they '_ve had for weeks with contempt .
negative	take my advice - do not buy from this company !
negative	!
negative	bought a single t shirt for a christmas_present and when it was delivered to the uk i was charged £_00 in customs charges .
negative	the t shirt itself was less_than that so i '_m absolutely gutted .
negative	never again .
negative	wonder_if it '_s legal to not make it clear that it would happen ?
negative	sure it '_s mentioned somewhere in the small_print but i didn_'_t see it .
negative	certainly not good for customers trying to get a bargain .
negative	the order was shipped usps and i never received it .
negative	i booked delivery for between 0 and 0 on a monday to deliver to my work and they arrived at 0 00 when i wasn_'_t there but didn_'_t wait and left a card so i rearranged it for the following_day when they didn_'_t arrive at all !!
negative	i probably_wouldn_'_t order from your site again because of this not because of your clothes which i love !
negative	!
negative	i placed an order for two dresses that i had found on the website on 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	the order said that i would receive the merchandise in approximately four days .
negative	i received a tracking_number , however this number was invalid when trying to track it from the upsn fed_ex , and usps websites .
negative	today , after no merchandise showed_up , i decided to call the customer_service number .
negative	after being put on hold for 00_minutes , a rude representative got on the phone and stated that my dresses had just been shipped from california this morning !!!!!
negative	horrified , i explained to her that the dresses were to be worn to a new year '_s eve party and that i needed them .
negative	she proceeded to tell me that they should arrive on monday ( 0 / 0 / 00 ).
negative	i told her if they weren_'_t here by the 00st that i would be sending them back and requesting a refund .
negative	she then tells_me they don_'_t do refunds and tells_me they only do store credits !!!
negative	i explained to her that i didn_'_t see that when i placed my order and she stated that the store policy was in a separate section of the website .
negative	i am now going to be stuck with 0 dresses and no where to wear them to !
negative	i was told by a friend of mine that she received her merchandise within 0 days so they apparently do what they want to do .
negative	will not be ordering from them anymore .
negative	i will stick with great glam !!
negative	!
negative	if you have problems , there is no way to get anyone on the telephone .
negative	you are on hold for awhile and then disconnected over and over .
negative	very frustrating .
negative	my part was lost in ups for days and emailed them to set_up an investigation and was just told it was out for delivery over email .
negative	emailed back and each email takes 00 to 00_hours to get an answer back
negative	no way to treat customers .
negative	no customer_service anymore .
negative	jeg_bestilte nogle ipad - opladere , der angiveligt var på lager og kunne afsendes inden et_par dage .
negative	de ankom imidlertid ikke , og efter en_uge så_jeg at de havde trukket mine_penge kort efter min bestilling , hvilket man vist ikke må ?
negative	jeg_skrev til_dem , for man_kan jo ikke ringe til_dem ( meget mærkeligt firma ), og de sagde at mine_varer ville komme på lager igen om et_par dage , og at de havde kommet til at trække pengene ( nej vel ??)
negative	.
negative	nu , to uger efter , har_jeg stadig ikke set skyggen af mine_varer , og_jeg_har bedt om at få annulleret handelen .
negative	jeg må anbefale folk at gå uden om dette firma , indtil de evt .
negative	får styr på_deres arbejdsgange og kundebehandling igen .
negative	vi starter med 0_stjerner , for kanongode serier , masser_af underholdning , og_det kører endda ok på_min miniipad ( jeg_har også 00 / 0 bredbånd ).
negative	så kommer fradragene :
negative	0 stjerne fordi_jeg_ikke kunne_få_en prøvemåned , men måtte binde mig et halvt år ( hvis ikke jeg_ville betale latterlige 000_kr om måneden ) ( netflix giver en gratis prøvemåned )
negative	0 stjerne fordi_jeg_kun kan bruge en enhed ad gangen , og_vi altså er fire i min familie ... følg med tiden hbo !
negative	( netflix giver lov til at streame 0 enheder )
negative	0 stjerne pga af den meget dårlige brugerflade i appen , den er_meget uoverskuelig , søgemulighederne er utroligt begrænsede , man_kan_ikke spole i filmene med billeder , alt halter bagefter ...
negative	nu nænner jeg næsten ikke at tage flere stjerner fra jer .
negative	nååå jo , i skriver og reklamerer med at i har alle afsnit af alle sæsoner , og når_man så_har_købt ( og bundet sig uden fortrydelsesret ), finder man ud_af , at det altså kun gælder jeres egne produktioner .
negative	er sådan noget egentlig ikke i strid med god markedsføring ?
negative	det_er_så synd , at i ikke_har oppet jer mere .
negative	i må virkelig have nogle meget overbærende og tålmodige kerne - kunder .
negative	jeg_har opsagt mit abonnement , men kommer gerne tilbage , når i har rettet lidt op på tingene ..
negative	bullshit way of communicating with your customers ...
negative	wrong product sent ,,,, have to communicate by internet ...
negative	f _ _ _ y_ _ is the best said way of telling you guys .....
negative	member since 0000 .
negative	every time a report is refreshed it makes me call customer_service to verify my identity .
negative	this not only happens to me but my husbands account as well .
negative	after 0 months with the service they locked me out of all of our reports , even old ones , and told us they needed us to fax a marriage license , drivers_license , social_security card , and a bill with the current address to verify our identity .
negative	um .... why do they need that now if they didn_'_t need it in the beginning .
negative	okay , i '_m over it so i faxed in the " required " documents .
negative	the lady said call back first thing in the morning and you will be good to go .
negative	so i did .
negative	i called back saturday_morning and guess what ?
negative	the office that receives faxes is closed on the weekends .... ahhhhhh .
negative	who does faxes anymore .
negative	have these people from the 0000 '_s ever heard of email , scanning , uploading or any of those words that we have been using since at_least 0000 .
negative	c ' mon identity_guard get your crap together , get in the 00st_century and quit being a pain in my ass having to call you every_month at a minimum .
negative	if i '_m having to call you all the time i might as well call the credit_bureaus myself .... it would probably be more accurate .
negative	do not order from here .
negative	maybe they were rude because i was ordering from usa .
negative	they made a mistake on my engraving and blamed me .
negative	they took no responsibility and ruined my mother '_s day gift .
negative	go_anywhere but here .
negative	i ordered two dresses from this site and it took a week and a half to arrive although shipping for those two small dresses was $_00 . 00 .
negative	there was no information for me to track my package and when they came they looked horrible .
negative	i ordered a dress that was pictured as red and came in a burgundy color and it had threads coming apart everywhere !
negative	you can '_t get your money back and i have no desire to purchase anything_else and pay more outrageous shipping prices so i will just consider this a lesson_learned .
negative	i '_m so disappointed .
negative	i bought a black 000 ink_cartridge for my hp_printer to try out infarm .
negative	as soon as i took the plastic top off the cartridge , ink started dripping down my hand and onto my clothes .
negative	not fun .
negative	i had to throw it away .
negative	i purchased a groupon to this site to try it out .
negative	overall i am disappointed with my experience and would not purchase from this site ever again .
negative	i received my order from petflow . com and opened the package to find that it was not complete .
negative	the problem was that i ordered a 0 - pack of toys and only received a single toy .
negative	i called customer_service to report the issue and asked for the remaining two toys to be mailed to my house .
negative	the women told me that she would contact the warehouse to see where the problem was and call me back .
negative	two_days_later i called customer_service again because i had not heard_anything from the woman , and i realized that she had never even asked for my phone_number at all .. how could she have intended to call me back .
negative	i spoke with whom i believed to be the same women and she told me that she had wrote the warehouse an e_- mail and was still_waiting to here back and that i would not be sent the two toys until she heard from the warehouse .
negative	it really seemed that i was her last priority and that she just wanted me to get off the phone and stop calling .
negative	it has now been over a week and i have still not heard_anything , and do not believe that i ever will .
negative	overall i am very disappointing with this website and there customer_service .
negative	i have already wasted too much time on this issue which could have very easily be fixed with one phone_call .
negative	don_'_t waste your time ordering from this website , because that is all it appears to be .. a waste of my time .
negative	i have already urged my family and friends never to order from this website and contact groupon to let them know of the horrible service i received in hopes that others would not be tricked in the future as i have .
negative	we booked an all_inclusive and then hotel dates changed from the flight dates so we are left with one day no hotel room and its our_honeymoon ....
negative	book it did nothing to help us except we are so sorry .....
negative	wont use it again ... cheap is not always best !
negative	i am very dissatisfied with the serving obtained from avas_flowers !!
negative	i will never order anything again from your company !
negative	my order number 000000 was scheduled to be delivered on 0 / 0 / 00 , today is 0 / 00 / 00 and it has yet to be delivered .
negative	i called on sunday to find out why the delivery had not been made .
negative	they stated the florist was closed and that i would have to call back on monday .
negative	i called back monday_evening and the associate informed me that the recipient had not been home on friday when they attempted to deliver and so they rescheduled the delivery .
negative	i asked her why it had not been attempted all day monday because i knew for a fact that the recipient was home all day monday .
negative	the associate told me that she was unable to reach the local office therefore she couldn_'_t tell me why but she promised that she would upgrade my arrangement to a premium arrangement and make_sure it was delivered first thing tuesday_morning .
negative	here it is tuesday at almost 0 : 00_pm and guess what ..., it has not been delivered !
negative	again i call and am told i am sorry miss bean we will make_sure it is delivered by 0 : 00 tonight .
negative	the associate stated " it was rejected by our local_florist " something a our supply and demand ...
negative	i honestly as a customer do not care why it was rejected ... if it is an item that is on your website as " same day delivery " it or something equivalent to it better be delivered the same day !
negative	i have paid $_00 . 00 for something that was supposed to be delivered 0 days ago !!!
negative	i am completely dissatisfied and really have no confidence that this will be delivered today .
negative	not even one time did i receive a call about this order .... horrible customer_service !
negative	hello .
negative	so normally only good things would come out of my mouth when referring to amiclubwear but after this last transaction and my experience with trying to fix it i think that will be my very last transaction .
negative	whats not to love about them ... great deals , best shoes ever and get advise etc .
negative	but i feel almost like a friend betrayed me .
negative	i ordered 0 heels with this last transaction and was super excited to receive them especially_since i am about to have my second baby and it was a gift to myself and motivation to get back into shape etc ... after never receiving an_email about when they were on there way and / or what the hold u was i tried emailing and calling numerous_times with no response .
negative	finally i received one of the shoes and they are the wrong_size !
negative	so i finally called and finally got thru to an actual_person .
negative	she said didnt even offer to replace the wrong_size only emailed me a return_label so i can ship them back ( lets see how long it takes to receive an refund )!!
negative	oh and she told me i should of received a refund for the other shoes and of course i havent .
negative	im so upset .
negative	i have never wanted a pair of shoes so bad for some_reason but i did .
negative	today i went and bought some really awesome heels somewhere_else .
negative	i am sooooooo disappointed with amiclubwear .
negative	i always spoke the best tings about them .
negative	ughh so unhappy !
negative	i placed two_separate_orders for fussie cat .
negative	both orders were wrong .
negative	bernard in customer_service was rude , dismissive , argumentative and blamed me for he wrong order before finally blaming the fussie cat company .
negative	he did not try to reconcile things with me .
negative	he said he would get to the bottom of it and contact me .
negative	that resulted in a few emails where he blew me off , took no responsibility for petflow messing up both orders and suggested i contact fussie cat to complain --- even_though it was petflow who messed_up both orders .
negative	he wouldn_'_t call me back .
negative	fussie cat is a great food which my cat loves .
negative	thank_goodness i found a new company to order from bc i will never do_business with petflow as long as bernard is allowed to ruin petflow '_s reputation and interact with loyal_customers .
negative	he has a terrible attitude .
negative	surely there are others who need a job who would actually be helpful !... if any of you have any trouble , ask for steve as he is awesome !
negative	i told the person taking the reservation that we have 0_adults and 0 children which he repeated back to me correctly .
negative	that is not what he entered .
negative	he entered 0_adults and 0 children into the system which is also what printed out on my reservation .
negative	i do not appreciate the appearance that i lied .
negative	i will never use this company again !
negative	it has_been a terrible customer_service !!
negative	i was supposed to receive updates on my shipment .
negative	it has_been a month and no shipment ,. terrible i will never buy again !
negative	not satisfied - i replaced the black_ink_cartridge and it wouldn_'_t work after 0 days .
negative	what are my options .
negative	please respond .
negative	i spent 0 hours on the phone with multiple rude people that i could not understand .
negative	when asked to repeat what they said because i couldn_'_t understand them , they acted as if i was the idiot .
negative	all i wanted to do was cancel a previous trip and replace it with a different location .
negative	i will never use travelocity again after being a member for over 0_yrs .
negative	i was booking the reservation and i clicked the submit_button .
negative	the next page said error , and try again .
negative	i assumed this meant that the hotel reservation didn_'_t go through .
negative	i then_proceeded to make an reservation at a different hotel , on a different site .
negative	i booked the hotel , then i received a confirmation_email_saying that the first hotel went through and was booked .
negative	lucky me .
negative	i now have 0 hotels booked the same night , and i can '_t get a refund .
negative	i '_m already having financial troubles in life , but then the big wigs won_'_t refund my money due to a mistake on their own website .
negative	do i ended_up paying for a hotel , which stayed vacant all night .
negative	all the jewelry ($_000 ) worth looked terrific online .......... but when i opened the packages , they all looked very , very cheap ...... i was going to give these for xmas_gifts ........ very , very disappointed ..... sandra s
negative	they got my appliance wrong , then brought the right one out took the wrong_size back told me they ' d refund me the difference_between machines and as a good will gester they would do it me at the price of 0kg this they did not do
negative	i will never buy again
negative	my daughter and i were trying to book a flight to vegas in july to a conference .. we spent the much needed time to properly choose the best flight times and dates for our trip .
negative	we made our choice and did not realize til after that the wrong choice was selected .
negative	i tried_calling your office only to receive a message to call back in the morning .
negative	in the meantime , we thought it best to again try to book the right flights as we already have our conference tickets and hotel booked .
negative	we were worried that we would be left without a flight to a business conference we had booked .
negative	this morning i called to get the first flight reversed and taken off our mastercard .
negative	we were told that we could not as 00_hrs had passed ..
negative	i informed the attendant that in fact it was just past 00_hrs !
negative	after being passed on to a manager ,..
negative	i was told that united_airlines could only offer us a credit with a $_000 penalty per passenger !!!!!
negative	can you imagine that !!?
negative	i told the attendant that we could not afford a credit or a penalty !!
negative	i am pleading with your company to please honor our wishes and reverse the charges .
negative	thank_you .. respecfully ,, myra booking ref # 000 - 000 - 000 is the incorrect booking ..... 000 - 000 - 000 is the correct one .
negative	if you check out the times that each were booked you can surely see that we did not change our mind on our flight dates ,.. it strictly was a computer error and we need to have the charges reversed .
negative	the website states that you will have your items in 0 - 0 days .
negative	this is not true .
negative	you will receive your items a week_later at best .
negative	when calling customer_service , i wanted to cancel my order if i was not going to received it by 0 days and they promised i would .
negative	a week_later ... my order came , very disappointing .
negative	customer_service needs to be made aware of processing and shipping times .
negative	we booked a dolphin swim at the atlantis in the bahamas and expedia never contacted the company to schedule the swim or verify that we had paid .
negative	i had to call them from a foreign_country only to be put on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	when someone finally answered , thy hung_up on me after 00 seconds .
negative	i called the next_day and was told that they had done nothing wrong because going between the companies was " my responsibility ."
negative	they would not even offer me a coupon for my trouble .
negative	horrible service .
negative	do not book excursions through them !!
negative	!
negative	i was so surprised to get this request to review the product considering i have not yet received it .
negative	hard to tell you about it when i don_'_t have it .
negative	sure hope it arrives soon .
negative	obviously the company thinks i have it .
negative	firstly the item was clearly defective , this was visible through the plastic sealed wrapping and therefore should have been seen by the person packaging .
negative	my son contacted superdry to arrange return , replacement and asked for some form of compensation from the store ( a lunchtime visit to a central_london post_office isn_'_t a pleasant nor quick trip ).
negative	they offered to discount 00_% from my card but my son pointed_out that as the gift was being returned by him , they should be offering him something , not me .
negative	it took about 00 emails and an escalation to the customer_services manager before they finally offered him 0 . 0 %_off a future order .
negative	i honestly think that '_s very poor from such a recognisable brand ( other establish brands routinely offer 00 - 00_% depending_on the nature of the mistake / error ).
negative	my son returned the damaged goods and included two notes that advised of the delivery address for the replacement , also commenting that it was a present .
negative	then i received an_email_saying the item was out of stock and my card would be refunded .
negative	nobody attempted to contact my son ( who returned the item ) to advise him of this .
negative	my son then had to contact customer_services again to and only at this last stage was the matter resolved with the customer_services manager sourcing a replacement for him .
negative	this whole mess could , and should have been dealt_with within one or two emails .
negative	there were also plenty of opportunities for various members of the company '_s customer_services / support staff to identify that this situation was not a bog - standard situation .
negative	if only one member of staff had taken pride in their job , their brand and their responsibilities and gone that tiny_bit more to ensure this was dealt_with properly then our entire experience would have been good .
negative	it shouldn_'_t take 00 emails to be offered 0 . 0 % because of the company '_s mistake .
negative	the staff receiving back the damaged goods should have made efforts to contact my son advising of the stock issue and offering a solution as to how they were going to try and fix the situation .
negative	this company needs to fully examine both their staff training and process management .
negative	my booking experience was great , your rep was wondering .
negative	she actually called the hotel and confirmed my handicap room .
negative	when i got to the sheraton they did not have our reservation , i gave them the confirmation print out and they couldn_'_t find our reservation .
negative	worse service on the hotel '_s side ever !!
negative	!
negative	not happy , sold 0 phones at the same time , 0 of them were worth nothing and the other 0 was worth quite abit !
negative	only received one cheque from them , and that was the cheapest one !
negative	had an ema saying they were all in the post , but still_waiting on the other 0 !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a froliccat toy and it was supposed to have 0 toys with feathers that were replaceable but when this toy arrived it had 0 red fluff ball with 0 feathers attached that were not what was ordered .
negative	my cat had this destroyed within 0 hour and now i have nothing to reorder since it did not come the way it was supposed to .
negative	i am still_waiting for replies to my emails and phone_calls regarding the wrong items that arrived
negative	i have not received the replacement months later
negative	please phone me to sort this out .
negative	how else can i contact you you do not answer the phone or emails .
negative	please help me
negative	don_'_t be_fooled by priceline saying there is no change or cancellation fees on hotels .
negative	they will not honor a change to the next night .
negative	this is absolutely false_advertising .
negative	i will not be using priceline again .
negative	only card transaction in a while was this one , and my card was frauded by 0 mobile_phone top ups - helped themselves to £_00 - emailed customer_service - of no help totally untrustworthy
negative	i have been a loyal_customer of macy '_s until a recent disaster with a furniture purchase .
negative	we ordered a three piece sectional on november 0rd and chose a stock color so we would have it by thanksgiving .
negative	we were not notified until after we purchased the sofa that it was on back order until january .
negative	we had to cancel our thanksgiving dinner and christmas party since we had no couch .
negative	when the pieces were finally delivered in january , 0 out of the 0 were damaged .
negative	macy '_s offered us an even exchange but explained it wouldn_'_t be in until march .
negative	they left the damaged sofa at our home .
negative	the replacement pieces arrived but they were even more damaged than the first set .
negative	they took the original damaged pieces back and left the new damaged pieces with us .
negative	one is still wrapped in packaging sitting in our garage .
negative	i have spent numerous hours on the phone with customer_service and visited the store but they have offered us nothing !
negative	we were told to wait_until april when they could do another exchange .
negative	i demanded a full_refund and asked them to come pick_up the items but the earliest they can come is two_weeks .
negative	i have to wait an_additional week after that before my refund will be processed .
negative	in the meantime i have been over 0 months with no sofa and i can '_t even get a replacement until they take the broken one and give me my money back .
negative	macy '_s has shown they do not care about their customers and have no issue selling damaged pieces .
negative	i '_m extremely disappointed and intend on closing my macys card once my refund is processed .
negative	i will not do_business with a company that does not stand_behind their customers .
negative	ted baker gift_cards can not be used online despite the claims that this service is temporarily unavailable and they will fix it soon .
negative	actually they have been saying this for years !
negative	i do not understand_why they would continue to lie to their customers and business partners .
negative	it is just insulting .
negative	especially_considering their very high prices .
negative	these gift_cards also can not be used in john_lewis , selfridges , house of fraser etc .
negative	but they continue advertising their product as something you can easily redeem .
negative	when i contacted customer_service about it repeatedly they just ignored me .
negative	other customers have had the same experience , just googleing this issue will give loads of information how they are just palming people off and continue to lie about it .
negative	i have been a fan of tb and i buy it a lot and i have had almost no_complaints about the quality or service but this is just an embarrassment to the company .
negative	what they are trying to achieve with it i do not understand .
negative	is stealing customers money and lying to them the way to do_business ?
negative	just look at your rating here .
negative	this should be a wake_up call for you .
negative	there is plenty of competition out there and if you continue like this you will not last for long !
negative	i received parts 0_weeks_ago , i am waiting to hear from you so that i can return one of the parts .
negative	( rma )
negative	it seems like you are not ready for main stream .
negative	is it that you do not wish to hire more staff because you may have to pay their medical ?
negative	whatever the case , this is outrageous .
negative	i have had many years of great service from carmen nieves during the hectic tax season .
negative	this past_year our taxes were a bit different with adding another business and being an llc .
negative	our taxes were delayed in filing to ensure all information was filed accurately , mostly on my part for waiting until the last two_weeks to file .
negative	i have the upmost confidence in carmen nieves , it '_s a pleasure working with her during this nerve_racking time !
negative	hoping she will_continue with the business , should she leave , i will follow .
negative	many_thanks ,
negative	martha
negative	don_'_t stay at the golden nugget in biloxi .
negative	this used to be the isle of capri casino and resort and we went there frequently .
negative	this time it was a mistake .
negative	the room was substandard and the bathroom was dirty .
negative	the sheets had stains on them and the comforter had burn holes in it .
negative	huge stain on the carpet , horrible dollar store pillows .
negative	the air_conditioning froze you at the lowest temp .
negative	the buffet had about the worst food i '_ve ever had the displeasure to eat , the food was bland and the crablegs were so overcooked the meat was dried up .
negative	no cudos for the hotel staff either , the people during the day shift showed little interest in their guests .
negative	children are permitted to run rampant in the hotel and the pool , not a relaxing wasy to spen time at a casino .
negative	the evening staff was very helpful and moved us to another room .
negative	they are showing the renovated rooms on the 0th_floor and they are very nice , but i won_'_t be going back until the renovation is complete .
negative	i ordered a pair of earrings for my sister for christmas and they came with one of the earrings broken in half .
negative	waste of my money .
negative	i ordered online from yesstyle , and some of my items i did not like and wish to return .
negative	their return_policy states that you must contact their customer_service within 00 days to get a rma_number before sending back .
negative	i '_ve been trying to call and no one picks_up the phone !
negative	its just an answering_machine .
negative	i would just send it back , but other people online have complained_about sending back and never getting their money back so i want to make_sure i follow return process properly .
negative	this is not good , i will_continue to try to contact their customer_service the rest of this week to get a rma_number and time and ship back .
negative	after that i ill have to file a dispute with my credit_card company and paypal and force a return , i hope i do not have to do that .
negative	stop this company act now , they are evil
negative	i had a lot of problems :
negative	first of all , i ordered a concorde model but sometime along the purchaising it showed a saint - honoré model .... and that is what i received ...
negative	well , i tried to explain it through the web but taylor0less rejected my issue telling_me that it wasn ´ t true .
negative	when i tried to explain it again , i couldn ´ t do it because my order took place more than 00 days before .
negative	this was true , but it wasn ´ t my fault .
negative	it was because of the new year celebration in china .....!
negative	!
negative	i am not very happy about the service , very inflexible
negative	regards
negative	approximately 0_weeks_ago i ordered a radiator , platinum part number 0000 - 00000000 for my 00 toyota landcruiser .
negative	i still have not received my radiator although my account has_been charged the full_amount .
negative	ridiculous , awul !!!!
negative	i have been waiting for it about a month !!!!!!
negative	too slow !!!!
negative	got it with scratches !!!
negative	and now muth more !!!
negative	i have payment from dhl for shipping from china )))))))))
negative	this company promised to fix it and pay me back , but for today i still have this problem and i have the third person , who does not know of course and who can not figure_out what is going on !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	it is so annoying ((((((((((((((((((((((((
negative	i had to click on a star but in reality my experience was rated as a zero star one .
negative	i made a reservation with silver_shuttle based on the positive_reviews i had read online .
negative	i needed to be at heathrow before the tube started running and i thought i had found the answer .
negative	until the day came for them to pick me up .
negative	i began waiting for the driver at 0 :_00am .
negative	at 0 : 00 i called since i was supposed to have been picked_up 00_minutes earlier to find out where the driver was .
negative	after being put on hold for 00 - 00_minutes i was told that the driver went to the wrong hotel and would be to me in 0 - 00_minutes .
negative	i went outside to wait and 00_minutes later the bellhop put me in a taxi since the driver did not show .
negative	the only offer that has_been made to me for compensation is a 00_%_off coupon for my next booking .
negative	needless to say i won_'_t be using it and i would recommend that you do not book with silver_shuttle either .
negative	all the reviews i read said they received their parts fast .
negative	it took 0 days for mine .
negative	then it '_s defective .
negative	i filled out the form on line the very night i received it requesting a rma .... their automated systems says i '_ll hear back in 00 - 00_hours , i still_haven_'_t heard from anyone even after i filled out yet another form asking for a status
negative	because let_me tell you are some of the worst scammers because you told me that i was going to return the money when he writes that it was too long and had spent more than 00 days and no service .
negative	i said sorry for the inconvenience and we will refund your money to your card , and never came so i went back to writing today .
negative	that lack of respect to people .
negative	this product was ordered last monday ( april
negative	00 ) after 0 days , i contacted ljshopping to find out where my order was as i had paid for two day shipping and had not received any shipping information etc_., yet my payment was made and accepted .
negative	i received an_email_stating that ljshopping company wasn ’ t sure about the address so the order wasn ’ t shipped , even_though i had enter the shipping address on the order when it was placed , and my
negative	confirmation clearly indicates the shipping address .
negative	they never attempted to contact me with this information .
negative	a representative from ljshipping
negative	company responded that the order would be shipped friday .
negative	0 - 0 day shipping
negative	should have had it to me by tuesday , april 00 , at the latest .
negative	i still have no
negative	product , had paid for express shipping and the product as of 0 days ago now .
negative	fed_ex tracking has an anticipated ship date listed only . nothing has_been updated in days .
negative	another attempt to find out where the order was received a response that it was shipped but the fedex record was failing to update and now they were out of the product .
negative	i asked why that should matter if my order had shipped and have not received a response .
negative	have now demanded a refund of payment to include payment for express shipping .
negative	called on march 00 th to schedule a con joining room for 0 people at the marriott in brighton .
negative	first the lady told me the room was 000 . 00 for a 0r bed 0 room but then she say it '_s 000 all together i told her no i do not want to pay that much to just cancel that she said umm hold on let_me talk to my supervisor about 00_minutes later she tell me her supervisor said i could have both rooms for the price of 000 with 0 beds so i said ok well turns_out she booked me for 0 room so i called right back to cancel i spoke to a man_who said it can take 0 to 00 business days for the one to go back on my card .
negative	how rude and a waste of my time !
negative	ordering books from bookbyte is one of the worst decisions i have ever made .
negative	the books were cheaper_than the sites i normally purchase my books from , which was nice .
negative	but , it took nearly 0_weeks for my books to get here .
negative	and i had made sure i picked books that were in " used - excellent " or " used - very good " condition , yet the books that arrived were in horrible condition .
negative	the books were basically just stacks of messed_up papers without even the covers of the books .
negative	i will never be ordering books from bookbyte again .
negative	if you ' re looking for somewhere to order books , avoid bookbyte at all costs , and order them from amazon or chegg instead , even if the books do cost a little more .
negative	ricevo abbastanza merce consegnata via corriere e posso dire che_ci sono sempre problemi quanto il corriere è bartolini : a volte è la sede di san pietro mosezzo ( novara ), ultimamente borgomanero ( almeno di borgomanero devo aggiungere che una signorina molto cortese mi_ha telefonato al primo giorno di mancata consegna - peccato che_mi_ha promesso la_consegna per l ' indomani , invece sono passati due giorni senza che_mi avvisassero del rinvio ), ma il risultato è sempre lo stesso : la_merce non arriva nel giorno previsto ; se guardo sul tracking risulta consegnata molto rapidamente nella sede di smistamento - e lì si perde !
negative	o mettono in consegna e dicono di non aver trovato nessuno ( quando non è assolutamente vero ), oppure che_non hanno trovato il numero civico ( se contano solamente sul navigatore , è vero che google pensa che l ' ultimo n . civico sia il 00 o il 00 , ma la strada continua tranquillamente , con case e numeri civici .... soltanto dal n . 00 in poi bisogna sapere se girare a sinistra sotto l ' arco della cascina al 00 oppure andare a destra nei campi ( sembrerebbe ovvio la scelta della sinistra , ma nel dubbio basterebbe chiedere ad una delle varie famiglie che abitano al 00 a , b , c , d ..... oppure telefonare a me - altrimenti a cosa serve lasciare il proprio recapito telefonico al fornitore / corriere ??)
negative	passano poi giorni prima della consegna effettiva .
negative	se ho la possibilità di specificarlo , dico : venite con_un mezzo piccolo ( no furgone col cassone alto ) per passare sotto l ' arco , oppure arrivate all ' arco e mi telefonate : la mia casa è a 000 metri , arrivo a piedi se il_pacco è piccolo o in macchina se è grande .
negative	gli autisti sono sempre diversi , quasi sempre stranieri , sempre arrabbiati e maleducati .
negative	quando chiedo loro perché non hanno telefonato al primo viaggio ( ammesso e non concesso che_ci sia stato un primo tentativo di consegna !)
negative	dicono che è perché chiamare col cellulare costa e la bartolini non rimborsa le telefonate ....... non costerebbe di meno a tutti pagare loro un cellulare con_un numero massimo di chiamate se hanno tanta paura di abusi ) piuttosto che fare , almeno in teoria , almeno 0 - 0 ' tentativi ' prima di consegnare effettivamente ?
negative	?
negative	come mai la dhl , l ' ups e tutti gli altri che_mi consegnano o mi trovano al primo colpo , o sanno trovarmi a colpo sicuro perché gli autisti sono sempre gli stessi e non ogni volta uno diverso , aggressivo , e che si mette a bestemmiare se deve fare manovra o se è in ritardo con le altre consegne da fare in giornata ( come se fosse colpa mia !
negative	).
negative	le cose sono così :
negative	0 . o la bartolini paga talmente male i suoi ' padroncini ' che sono perennemente incavolati ( per dirlo con_un eufemismo ), non danno loro istruzioni adeguate e non rimborsano loro le telefonate di lavoro ....... quindi un fornitore serio dovrebbe evitare di dar lavoro a degli sfruttatori di manodopera che guadagnano sulla loro pelle oppure
negative	0 . se mai gli autisti fossero dipendenti ( non credo proprio , almeno qui in zona tutti coloro cui ho chiesto mi_hanno risposto di essere padroncini ), dovrebbero insegnar loro delle regole di base tipo : consegnare nel giorno previsto ; telefonare al numero fornito ( a spese bartolini ) nel caso non trovasse nessuno o non trovasse il numero civico o la via , oppure se avesse altre difficoltà , in maniera da non inchiodare in casa gente ad aspettare un pacco che_non arriverà quel giorno ;
negative	insegnar loro a trattare il destinatario con rispetto e a tener alto il nome della ditta per cui lavorano ( siano dipendenti o subcontrattati ).
negative	più di una volta gli autisti mi_hanno aggredita verbalmente o si sono sfogati contro la bartolini ( che dovrebbero rappresentare ), anche producendosi in bestemmie da far impallidire i santi .....
negative	fornitori , boicottate la bartolini - ci sono tanti altri corrieri bravi e cortesi !
negative	years_ago i always shopped_around and ending up always buying flights on lastminute . com as they were cheapest and no_problems .
negative	also occasionally used secret deals in uk and got excellent bargains .
negative	no more !
negative	prices constantly higher_than others and for a holiday i am planning to norway i looked at their offerings in many different towns - always more_expensive than others .
negative	to avoid giving total monopoly to booking . com , i eventually booked an airport hotel ( early_morning flight out next_day ) with lastminute , as its price was identical to booking . com .
negative	as soon as i got confirmation i saw the trick - booking and the hotel '_s own website offered room at this ( cut ) price , including an excellent ( per reviews ) breakfast , whereas last_minute . com excluded breakfast .
negative	within one hour i made a complaint , was fobbed_off with an automatic response and eventually told 0 days_later too bad , i hadn_'_t immediately claimed to their price matching team ( as if i knew which dept to apply to , i wrote to customer_service ) attaching a screenshot of the two offers , within 00_hours of booking - i insisted , saying i was a long - term customer and attaching a screenshot of hotel website offer still better_than theirs ( booking - com offer was by then no_longer available at that price ); again refused .
negative	i asked for complaint to be elevated to supervisory level , was told this had been done and would get reply within 00 working hours .
negative	after 0 days still no reply , wrote again , only to get a reply basically telling_me to get lost .
negative	i have and am .
negative	last_minute will never again see my custom .
negative	i ordered contacts and was told that it would be a 0 - 0 day delivery .
negative	the order was not even fulfilled until 0 business days_later because they were multi focal , and then it took another 0 full business days to even receive them .
negative	and i am saying that prematurely as i still have not received mine .
negative	i will tell_everyone that i know to order from another company and stay away from this site .
negative	i had an urgent delivery to make to my nephew who ' d forgotten some critical equipment for his cadet camp in england .
negative	so i investigated express deliveries and found a company that promised a pick_up 0am on the tuesday which they guaranteed would get to him for 0am on wednesday .
negative	it was just about worth the expense .
negative	they didn_'_t pick_up until late morning on the tuesday - never saying that would cause a problem and then i got a message on thursday_morning saying it had just been delivered .
negative	hardly worth it as he travels home on the friday .
negative	i '_m really disappointed
negative	wrong day wrong price
negative	had to start all over
negative	hi
negative	just so that you are aware , i have not received the goods i ordered last_week .
negative	please can someone look into it for me and get back .
negative	cheers
negative	karen
negative	i booked with you because the price was £_00 . 00 for 0 days parking at manchester .
negative	when i filled in my debit_card details , the price suddenly increased to nearly_£_00 . 00 !
negative	i didn_'_t tick any extras and my confirmation doesn_'_t show the price paid so unable to go back and check what i '_ve been charged for .
negative	i don_'_t think i '_ll be using your services again .
negative	send load of parcels via a 0rd_party ( parcel0go ).
negative	usually use hermes or yodel as they work out the cheapest .
negative	not always the best !!
negative	if you '_ve got any_problems you have to chat online to parcel0go as there are no contact phone numbers and hermes wont deal with you directly .
negative	they have lost parcels , said they have delivered parcels when they haven_'_t , and held parcels up with no communications to either me or parcel0go .
negative	they don_'_t answer their emails and they don_'_t communicate at all .
negative	the service is diabolical and they don_'_t care .
negative	they are very cheap but sometimes that isn_'_t always best !!!
negative	hermes you need to shake up your act .
negative	you just need to read the reviews on here to see how crap they are .
negative	you ' d think they would want to improve !!!!
negative	!
negative	purchased a filter .
negative	this was actually the 0nd company i had ordered from to try to buy this filter .
negative	first company had sold me the filter , and not bothered to tell me that it was out of stock for 0_weeks .
negative	so when i purchased this filter , i called the day after to make_sure i was getting it shipped to me immediately .
negative	the female sales_rep said that it was shipped , but it was coming from the warehouse in california so it may take up to 0 days .
negative	after a week , i called again .
negative	at this time i was told , after a long wait and a call back 0 hour later , that the filter had not shipped , but it was going to be shipped that day .
negative	i insisted that it be shipped over night since the original rep had bold faced lied to me .
negative	he said he had to check with the shipping company and could call me back 00 - 00_minutes later .
negative	did not happen .
negative	he called me the next_day , and told me that the company had already shipped the item , and could not get it shipped next_day .
negative	said it should arrive on tuesday .
negative	was shipped supposidly on thursday .
negative	not happy at all .
negative	he offered a $_00 refund , which frankly was the very least he could do given the circumstance .
negative	what would have been better would have been to ship another next_day shipping , and a return_slip for the the second one that is coming in a week .
negative	for a company that says the items will ship out in 0 - 0 days , and arrive in 0 , it has now been a week before the shipping and will be 0_weeks before i recieve the item .
negative	plus many phone_calls .
negative	horrible service , and reps that lie
negative	no one stayed at the entrance so people coming in that didn_'_t know the code had traffic backed_up .
negative	lighting in the room is horrible .
negative	also bought a one room with king_bed and didn_'_t recieve that .
negative	other than that ok .
negative	but won_'_t be staying again .
negative	* i selected only 0_star however , to be clear , no one was rude to me *
negative	i get it , all your reviews state how wonderful the customer_service is .
negative	how exciting it is to buy a car and the great experiences at drive time from their car sales_associates and how quickly you are able to get in your car of choice which was only a dream a few_minutes before because of the not so good credit we all have or we would not be here .
negative	the " quick " part of this is what they take_advantage of .
negative	i absolutely love laura who sold us our car and all the other associates at alta mere in ft . worth were very nice , helpful and extremely respectful of our situation as well .
negative	they advertise this warranty and looking at all the " big print " makes it sound completely fool_proof .
negative	the sales_associates even know the big important parts of this they can rattle it off as if they were paid_extra to memorize these warranty / coverage ads !
negative	all of these cars have so many miles on them because they were all rentals ?
negative	all of them ?
negative	are you sure ?
negative	i '_ve never had a rental with the sort of things we found in our car .
negative	when we bought our 0000 caliber on 0 / 00 / 0000 we had a 000_% positive_experience at drive time .
negative	now , 0 months later ... 0 whole weeks .... not so much .
negative	i '_ve had to take my car to their " in network " auto repair_shop yesterday , 0 / 00 / 00 , because there were 0 different places making some god awful noises .
negative	the shop calls this morning and explains to me the problems : the ac_compressor is breaking , chattering and between the compressor and the fan is why the loud noise .
negative	it also bogs the car down really bad .
negative	the ball bearings are worn down is what '_s making a grinding noise when i turn .
negative	the brakes are squeeking so bad i hear them over my ( loud ) music with windows shut driving on a stop and go 0 late hwy .
negative	he says they need replacing but are ok for now .
negative	also , there is a loose flap or something flapping around in the drivers_side front_wheel well .
negative	well that flap is the only repair approved by drive time '_s warranty claims department !!!
negative	0 major and 0 minor repairs were denied because these problems are " not a complete failure / broken " yes , i said that correctly ... until the problem is a complete failure or completely broken they do not approve repairs on the warranty that we are paying for !!
negative	no thought of how one problem , if not fixed , can easily lead to another problem .
negative	i am assuming this is their mo ... deny , deny , deny .. until we can '_t take it anymore and just pay for it ourselves !!
negative	so here we are at the end of may in texas and they won_'_t repair my ac_compressor and fan ?
negative	just that alone pisses me off !
negative	i hate the heat !
negative	therefore , i have come to a solution to this problem .
negative	i will advertise drive time all over this car ...
negative	when people hear me driving and look at me wondering " wth is that ?"
negative	they will see my mobile drive time advertisements all over this embarrassingly loud - as - hell car !!!
negative	i am going to buy the appropriate things needed for this sort of advertisement just as soon as i pick my car up from the dealer this afternoon .
negative	i will give drive time claims / warranty dept until 0pm today to change their minds or they will be wishing they did !
negative	i will soon be driving about 00_miles to work on two major_highways so they ' re likely to get a whole lot of advertisement !!
negative	i will be happy to post a pic of my drive time ad on facebook , twitter , pintrist and any other social_media site i can find .
negative	stay tuned !
negative	i will not be using again .
negative	having informed them and sending photo of glasses arriving missing a nose support - despite 0 days in their lab for quality check - how do you not spot a missing nose support ?- l was told they would send a replacement which of course l am then obliged to try and fit myself or pay an optician to do it for me - no offer to cover any cost .
negative	when l complained after 00days l had not received the replacement and depending_on the response would determine my feedback - the reply was it would arrive in next 0 days - no word of apology .
negative	not good enough .
negative	the replacement nose_piece has now arrived with screws so tiny they are barely visible to me and with no screwdriver with which to tighten them .
negative	hopeless !
negative	!
negative	made reservations with priceline who claimed to have the best prices on hotels !
negative	when i got to the hotel the room was $_00 . 00 less_than what priceline charged .
negative	they wouldn_'_t refund the difference but apologized .
negative	beware !
negative	do yourself a favor and do not buy from this awful place !!!
negative	worst customer_service ever !!!
negative	especially [_name ]!!
negative	!
negative	i have deliveries set_up for every 0_weeks or more ; another came in 0_weeks ; no where to store this , no_idea what to do with it .. how do i return it without it costing me a fortune ??
negative	?
negative	i came upon your company through a amazon promotion .
negative	i bought a £_00 voucher .
negative	i received the voucher and tried to use it on your website .
negative	i followed the instructions on how to claim the discount .
negative	but not only did you not subtract my discount but you charged me full price and took my credit_card number .
negative	when i tried to call your helpline the phone was unanswered and was cut_off ( dead ).
negative	i ended_up contacting amazon who had in fact had several customers complaint about the same problem .
negative	they too were charged full price and could not use the vouchers .
negative	i eventually through email got in contact with someone named rahal malik who wrote this :
negative	please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience you may have experienced .
negative	at iflorist , we take_pride in ensuring our customer ’_s satisfaction .
negative	unfortunately , we did not meet your expectations .
negative	i would request you to kindly contact amazon to get it resolved as voucher is been issued by them .
negative	as a testament to strive for perfection , we have taken steps to ensure that this will never happen again .
negative	we deeply value your relationship with iflorist and are committed to providing you with the highest level of service simply because our customers deserve the very best .
negative	if you have any further questions or comments regarding this matter , please feel free to discuss it with us .
negative	amazon say the problem lay on your side not there .
negative	they just issued the voucher it is your job to honor them .
negative	all in all it was a complete rip_off .
negative	in future i will order my flowers from interflora or mark and spencer
negative	opticsfast pictures do not display in rgb but instead are muted and are their listings describe the product wrong in the pic , wrong in description , and wrong by advice from representatives ... you will not do wrong and get by .....
negative	it is dishonest and poor customer care to know that the pics from vendors reflect wrong colors and descriptions thus causing people to order wrong frames and have to pay restocking fees of 00_%.
negative	00_% of $ is $_00 dollars plus shipping .
negative	they will take almost $_000_dollars if you buy and have to return your item .. i made much effort to resolve which was in vain ... opticsfast has a deaf ear and their level of customer care is really low .
negative	don_'_t do_business with them for you stand the risk of looking at pics that do not display true colors and descriptions that leave out colors and representatives that tell you the same thing as their pics and descriptions on the internet because they have not seen them either .
negative	thus this is a lose lose lose situation with the customer at a 00_% loss , shipping loss and time loss and abusive tactics phone_calls and emails .
negative	quality outstanding .
negative	we have also tried the salmon , which is great , but really to costly for my family .
negative	i know you can not put a price on health and quality , i would like to buy the seafood but like i said it is to costly for us .
negative	thanks
negative	made reservations by phone for flight , hotel , car .
negative	our last night was scheduled for july 00 in a different hotel from the one we were staying for other 0 nights .
negative	our rental_car was supposed to be july 00 - july 00 .
negative	our flight was july 00 return on july 00 .
negative	made these reservations on april 00 .
negative	on april 00 received e_- mail confirming my stay for april 00 .
negative	called immediately to inform them dates for one night hotel and rental_car were wrong .
negative	representative called hotel to cancel and of course , they refused .
negative	travelocity agent had made reservation for april instead of july .
negative	numerous phone_calls have yielded nothing but lies .
negative	said they would call me back in 00_hours after they reviewed initial phone_call recording to see who was at fault .
negative	never happened .
negative	called back .
negative	same story .
negative	after numerous_calls to them they finally said they didn_'_t have a recording and it was my fault the reservatios were made for the wrong date because i agreed .
negative	would advise anyone to steer_clear of this company .
negative	just thankful our plane_tickets and other hotel were on the right date or i would have lost over $ 0000 instead of $_000 .
negative	learned my lesson .
negative	don_'_t ever use them .
negative	good luck on getting your money returned to you .
negative	it '_s been over 0_weeks now and i can '_t seem to get my money back .
negative	took 00_minutes on the phone to make a two minute confirmation .
negative	the website would not accept the group code .
negative	called and had to pay full rate since they had no record of the convention .
negative	others who had booked rooms before and after , got the discount .
negative	i am absolutely livid at bravofly .
negative	on 00 february i attempted to purchase plane_tickets from madrid to barcelona on three_separate_occasions .
negative	first , i charged it to my visa checking card , and the next two times i used my paypal .
negative	each time i received two confirmation emails , saying the transactions could not be authorized , giving no further explanation , and saying my money would be frozen for a few_days before being returned to me .
negative	after finally realizing the error had to be from within the bravofly database , seeing as i had sufficient funds in my bank_account , i went directly to the airline '_s website and purchased the same tickets for a cheaper price , receiving confirmation immediately .
negative	obviously bravofly was too incompetent to authorize a simple purchase i was able to make within five_minutes on a different site .
negative	the money on my visa check card was frozen for over a week , making it accessible to me during my entire trip in spain .
negative	i think it is completely_unacceptable for bravofly to hold_onto my money for this long .
negative	it made budgeting more difficult , since i had essentially lost twice the amount of money on plane_ticket '_s than i had anticipated .
negative	i have made returns at stores that return my money more quickly than bravofly did .
negative	what is the reason to even hold_onto this money , when i was going to receive it anyway ?
negative	while i was in spain , i also received returned check fees , which were due to bravofly attempting to take my money out of my checking_account through my paypal .
negative	i checked my email and had received two invoices from bravofly , pretending as if my purchases had then been authorized or wanted .
negative	even if they had been suddenly authorized , it was too late for my me to use the tickets , as it was after the date i was attempting to buy them for , so this again shows bravofly '_s incompetence .
negative	bravofly had attempted to take over $_000 from my account on tickets that were now useless to me , and since i still had $_000 frozen from my visa check card attempt , i obviously overdrafted .
negative	i am a college_student on a budget and this cost me more money than i can_afford to lose , especially when living on a budget .
negative	a bravofly representative responded to me , trying to blame all the error on my bank .
negative	my bank has_been the only one working with me .
negative	today , i checked my checking_account and was charged via_paypal for the useless tickets .
negative	i am absolutely furious that despite my emails contacting bravofly , i am still charged for these things .
negative	it is completely unfair of bravofly is freeze a person '_s money if they are too incompetent to complete a transaction , let_alone three .
negative	i will never use bravofly again .
negative	what a joke website .
negative	the money it has cost me could have paid for more plane_tickets .
negative	i question whether i would book my flights with this agent again .
negative	i booked my flights some time ago through the travel_agent bravo_fly
negative	i called the agent outlining the unsuitability of the rescheduled flight and was told to be patient while they found her a suitable flight .
negative	i made it clear she was willing to fly early on the saturday_morning alternatively , should they be unable to schedule the friday_night flight ( fri 00th_march ).
negative	no further communication followed from the travel_agent or airline until i again called two_weeks before departure and was simply told to be patient , she will find out her travel_arrangements soon ( spoke to elizabeth ).
negative	nothing was heard for another week .
negative	a colleague then rang on my behalf the morning of monday 00th of march , it was necessary to call three_times as she was hung_up on twice , which as i am sure you can appreciate , is very frustrating and extremely poor customer_relations .
negative	she spoke to rasheeda from bmi then who informed me that the 00 . 00 flight on friday 00th was still flying and had remaining seats , in addition there was a flight on the saturday_morning ( 00st march ) at 00 . 00 .
negative	she then had to call the travel_agent back with this information and wait for a response .
negative	this would seem to suggest to me very poor communication and correspondence between agent and airline regarding availability and made it quite clear that resolving customer dissatisfaction really is not given the priority it should be .
negative	i , michelle was emailed an itinerary the monday_evening ( 00th_march ) for the 00 . 00 flight on 00st march .
negative	there was no further mention of any changes to the 00 . 00 bd000 flight departing london heathrow monday 0nd april .
negative	it was not until repeated failed_attempts to check in online the monday_morning ( using both e_- ticket number and booking reference as above ) that i rang bmi customer_service and was informed it was best to be at the airport three hours in advance , the representative i spoke to on the phone could not see where the problem was occurring .
negative	whatever plans we had made for the monday_morning were cancelled as we proceeded to heathrow_airport to check in .
negative	there we were told by the bmi customer_service representative that the flight bd000 is ‘ non_- existent ’.
negative	the only solution she proposed was to put us both on the 00 . 00 flight that evening ( mon 0nd ), two hours_later than we had intended .
negative	when asked why such an_error occurred or who is responsible , the representative claimed she did not know and that she supposed it was ‘ 00 - 00 : between airline and travel_agent ).
negative	i am entirely disappointed about the course of events that occurred from the time the flights were booked , 00 weeks in advance of departure , right up until our time in the airport flying home , where no attempt at any sort of apology or minor compensation was offered .
negative	michelle o ’ driscoll .
negative	useless ... it still has not arrived
negative	difficult to look at anything , hard to navigate , always had an_issue when trying to place the same order ,
negative	this company is super helpful whilst trying to get your business and during the fitting , but if you have an_issue afterwards then god help you !
negative	the after care service is simply shocking and completely_unacceptable .
negative	i have an_issue with the splash back behind my cooker and it needs replacing .
negative	i contacted the company about the issue on 00th_february and was asked to email over a picture which i did the next_day .
negative	i heard_nothing back after this .
negative	i chased up by phone on several_occasions to no_avail , i was then informed in mid march that i should have in fact sent my picture over to steve godden which i then did on 00th_march and still i have had no response from the company !
negative	i have phoned 0 times since the 00th_march and he is never there , i have left messages for him to call me stating how unhappy i am with the service and still nothing !!!
negative	absolutely disgusting , once they have had your money they don_'_t care !
negative	claim to have delivered a parcel obtained a signature and to have gps evidence of all this .
negative	however they did not deliver to this i address .
negative	i cannot get a credit for my order and they have sent a ridiculous squiggle to the sender as evidence they did deliver .
negative	. a joke and clearly dont care who they cheat or malign .
negative	be warned find a trustworthy courier that doesnt lie .
negative	even after paying for shipping , it took 0 whole weeks for my book to be delivered .
negative	i wrote to have them check on it after a week and they did nothing but copy and paste the same tracking_information i had referenced in my email .
negative	shipping took far too long and customer_service was incredibly rude .
negative	i couldn_'_t talk to anyone because of the lack of a phone_number and the email response was curt and unhelpful .
negative	i had a second charge to my account with no_explanation for it .
negative	i was totally disappointed in the quality of the goods and the lack of protective_packaging .
negative	they arrived broken at the top , the lights did not work and having tested the bulbs seperately one did not work .
negative	i was wry disappointed as i didn_'_t get paid and they also said i sent in substandard items and didn_'_t return or pay for them emailed and no response time wasters
negative	macy '_s delivery service is the worst ever , and they do not care about their customers at all .
negative	i needed a new bed to recover from major_surgery and made the mistake of buying it from macy '_s instead of an " impersonal " online competitor because i had more confidence in the delivery - service part of the deal .
negative	huge mistake !
negative	they say they " offer " a 0 - hr delivery window but instead what they require is for the customer to be available all day long , to wait for 0 - hr time window to be dictated to them via automated_message 0 days in - advance ( and if the customer happens to have a scheduling conflict with that time - window , the only option is to go back into the queue waiting for that process to repeat itself ).
negative	there is no attempt to actually find out from the customer when is the most convenient timeframe for them to receive delivery ( not even am vs . pm ).
negative	when my delivery ( that i had already had to wait 00 days for , in order to meet their delivery terms ) was understandably delayed_due to a winter_storm , the rep i initially spoke to couldn_'_t care less that i needed this item within the next 0 days ( either after 0pm or anytime on sat ) for serious medical reasons , all she could do was read her script and tell me the " next available " delivery date .
negative	then when i emailed and said i was going to cancel my order if it wasn_'_t delivered when i needed it to be , i received an_email response saying it would be delivered 0 days before my surgery after 0pm , and it didn_'_t show up , but the customer_service number was " closed ."
negative	when i emailed them saying please please please get it there the next_day , i seriously need it , they sent one of their " canned " responses saying i had been re - scheduled for a new delivery date 0 days out ( days after i was due to be home from surgery with no bed ).
negative	i realized i would have been much_better off ordering a bed from overstocked . com or any number of other " impersonal " online competitors ( with better prices ).
negative	i cancelled my order with macy '_s and wound_up getting a better bed for a better price from a local franchise store ( sleepy '_s ) who delivered it to me the same day ( the night before my surgery ) and it came with a free mattress pad and pillows .
negative	i am planning to buy a new king_size bed and bedroom_set in the near_future , and i can assure you i will be buying it from karen at sleepy '_s in gaithersburg , md and not from macy '_s .
negative	how many items do you think they sell / deliver at macy '_s that are actually needed by the customer for serious medical reasons ?
negative	and after they couldn_'_t find a way to get it to me for 0_weeks according to their " system ," and then had to delay the order for understandable reasons , they couldn_'_t make any exception or special accommodation for a customer in serious need of the delivery , for health reasons ?
negative	seriously , macy '_s ?
negative	shame on you .
negative	i will never shop at macy '_s again or watch your stupid thanksgiving parade on tv ever again .
negative	i hope macy '_s goes out - of - business along with all the other department_stores who got so big for their britches that they can '_t keep_up with either their online or local smaller competitors , and they have forgotten that their business revolves around the customer and not the other way around , and no_longer " care " about their customers .
negative	i will never forget the unnecessary additional stress and worry over a stupid furniture delivery that macy '_s caused me the day before major_surgery , and how it made me feel that they just really blatantly didn_'_t care if i didn_'_t have a bed to lay down in afterwards .
negative	i am so glad i cancelled the order , and found sleepy '_s instead .
negative	macy '_s doesn_'_t deserve my business .
negative	ordered a 0 door wardrobe on 00th_april with a delivery expectation of the following_day .
negative	i received an_email_informing_me that delivery would not be on friday .
negative	later a telephone_call call confirmed the wardrobe would be delivered on tuesday00th april .
negative	later in the day i telephoned the company and was advised it would be delivered .
negative	no delivery .
negative	made numerous_calls to the company requesting a call back .
negative	finally i was told that they would contact the delivery company to contact me .
negative	no communication was received .
negative	on thursday , 0st may it finally arrived , only it was a 0 door and a 0 door .
negative	the driver was surly .
negative	however , we did not accept the delivery as it was not as ordered .
negative	we requested our money back .
negative	we have been told delivery of the same items will be made on 0nd may and if we reject them then we will have to pay £_00 .
negative	the item is not as_advertised and if we had known this then clearly we would not have ordered ,
negative	never again will i order from this company .
negative	the worst thing is that they do not seem to care whether the customer is satisfied .
negative	the bouquet received was nothing like the picture online .
negative	only 0 roses in a bunch costing over_£_00 with no vase as the picture showed .
negative	ordered for monday and dead by tuesday .
negative	no actual flower card displaying a message , just a discount card with scribble on the back .
negative	i can not recommend this florist .
negative	i ordered .
negative	you charged me .
negative	he never got it .
negative	i complained .
negative	you said you rectified it .
negative	he never got it .
negative	i complained again .
negative	he still_hasn_'_t received it .
negative	do not use this company .
negative	the rep i spoke with had no_idea how to fix the reservation once she realized she had made a mistake .
negative	i clarified for her several_times and by then we lost the available two rooms .
negative	i asked twice to speak to her supervisor .
negative	the first time she put me on hold for over 0 minutes .
negative	she then came back & said she now knew how to " fix " it , but was unable to .
negative	i asked a second time for a supervisor .
negative	again , i had to wait .
negative	when he came on , he too was unable to get us the rooms at hyatt_place , but located our two rooms for us at the hampton that was several miles_away from where we needed to be .
negative	we were very displeased with this experience .
negative	i thought i was speaking to someone at the hotel , not a booking service , then he books me for a different hotel chain ( which would have been fine ) at a hotel that i thought he said was in the same town , but it was 00_minutes away !!!
negative	i called right back 0 minutes later , and am still_waiting for a refund of almost $_000 0 days_later !!
negative	ugh !!
negative	horrible experience , and i spelled my name 0 times and he still was not close to spelling it right !!
negative	!
negative	not happy with the seemingly resultant issues i have encountered since using this service to book my hotel reservation .
negative	i received a fraud_alert from my credit_card , with the last transaction to book the hotel .
negative	the booking agent did not identify herself as expedia , something i learned after the fraud_alert .
negative	in attemting to call to report this incident , i have been placed on hold for 00_minutes , no agent to take the call .
negative	i disconnected the call , called back , and on hold for 00_minutes , finally disconnecting the call .
negative	not the type of service one would expect .
negative	the number 000 - 000 - 0000 needs to provide more prompt attention to the callers .
negative	i needed a radiator for my ' 00 corolla awd wagon , and i picked a " 0 " row radiator from metrix , part number w0000 - 0000000 .
negative	the factory radiator is a 0 row , they sell this as a 0 row , but when you receive it , you quickly see , it has one row that is skinnier and a tad longer_than one row of the factory radiator , which has 0 rows , and has a skinny little block down the middle of the one row .
negative	the car over heats as much as it did with a stock radiator , with the whole top tank cracked .
negative	the radiator is half as thick , so it has half the cooling area that the stock one has , and is no better_than a 0 row .
negative	our experience with saigon0muine was terrible .
negative	we had pre_- paid and our driver was over an_hour and a half late to pick us up from the airport in nha trang .
negative	we called the company several_times , at first they said he was there and just couldn_'_t see us which made no sense as there were only 0 or so drivers waiting for customers .
negative	this turned_out to be a lie and the truth was they couldn_'_t get in contact with the driver .
negative	the woman on the phone was rude and unhelpful .
negative	she was completely unsympathetic that we had been waiting so long and that we had a 0 hour drive ahead of us .
negative	when i asked for a partial_refund of some kind i was flat out refused .
negative	i was only offered a small discount the next time we booked with them , which obviously i refused to do as i didn_'_t get the impression from the company that they would be making an effort next time .
negative	they really didn_'_t seem to care that they had kept us waiting for that long at the airport with no answers as to what was happening and when we could expect to get picked_up .
negative	shocking !
negative	i would go with another company or catch a taxi .
negative	when we enquired with several taxi drivers they were happy to match the price ( we didn_'_t go with them in the end because i wasn_'_t confident saigon0muine would give me a refund ).
negative	do not use this company !
negative	i recently bought inks for my printer , on changing theicoloured ink my printer would not accept either of the two new inks purchased , i did as advised on your website and used a damp kitchen roll to no_avail .
negative	i have used your inks in my printer since new , but now i have to find a new supplier as i cannot_afford to pay forty pounds and only get two black_ink i can use .
negative	i found the website , and oredered 0 unlocked cell_phones .
negative	the two more_expensive ones were not unlocked , or partially ...
negative	i could call and receive calls on the one i was going to keep for myself , but with full qwerty keyboard , i wanted to be able to text .
negative	well , i could not ever text .
negative	the most expensive phone , simply did not recognize sim cards from different carriers or work at all .
negative	than comes the problem of trying to contact them .
negative	i created a ticket at the help center .
negative	i emailed support .
negative	i emailed survey people .
negative	i emailed anyone from the company who '_s email i could get for help .
negative	thus_far , > 0weeks trying , i '_ve gotten no responses .
negative	any suggestions / help , would be appreciated .
negative	thanks , ma ' am
negative	purchase a lot of clothes from superdry online and in the store , as my son and husband wear superdry clothes , had a few problems in the past t shirts with logo fade when item washed first time , had no_problems at all with exchanging them .
negative	recently_purchased online 0 xxl t shirts my husband took the label off and put the t shirt on ready to wear out and found it was actually too big a lot bigger_than the other xxl we purchased .
negative	i decided to send back as the size was extreme to all his other xxl and replace with xl .
negative	to my amazement i received an_email_saying from superdry the t shirt had been washed and they would not replace .
negative	the t shirt had most definitely not been washed and for the sake of £_00 would not take to the extreme of bothering to send back and a reply email explaining my disappointment in hannah oxenburys untrue assumptions that the t shirt had been washed !
negative	to my amazement she didn_'_t even have the courtesy to reply to me .
negative	very dissatisfied and certainly will not be parting with any more money to them in the future !
negative	amazing how one persons decision and comments has given superdry one less customer !
negative	lets_hope she doesn_'_t give that impression to too many other customers as its a very competitive world and people now think_twice about who they part their money with !
negative	i believe this is the first time i have heard from anyone at ig .
negative	how much am i paying for this service ?
negative	and how do i know it is working ???
negative	?
negative	hello ???!
negative	i guess ig doesn_'_t know either ??
negative	?
negative	i am sorry you do not have a human there ???
negative	?
negative	don_'_t get my questions_answered ...
negative	all it is , is to get sales calls .
negative	they won_'_t tell you a thing about getting a grant .
negative	we were very disappointed with our flights from delays with no attempt to get us on a better flight .
negative	we paid at extra 00 . 00 per_night for a deluxe room at the hotel and were met with staff that didn_'_t care and put us in the most tiny room , no window with foot of the bed nearly touching the wall !
negative	moved to new room and key didn_'_t work , third time back to desk etc now it was after 00 : 00_pm .
negative	return flight tried to route us to chicago from new_orleans to reach oklahoma around midnight in bad_weather ... ugh !
negative	missed several standbys to finally reach home .
negative	did not like that they asked for my bank_account password .
negative	you should never give that information .
negative	i worked at a major bank and we always cautioned customers not to share their passwords .
negative	i talked with customer_service on 0 / 00 about a dress for my daughter , after my local dress shop couldn_'_t get the dress in time for prom .
negative	shipping said 0 - 0 days and customer_service confirmed that date , so i ordered the dress .
negative	they claim 00_% in stock , which is bs , they have dresses but no size selection .
negative	my local shop owner called me and i told her about the order , she then told me that the manufacturer had none of the dresses in stock and shipment from china would be after prom .
negative	she called her manufacturer '_s rep and she confirmed this for me .
negative	i called missesdressy and was told that they would email me in 00_hours to give me the ship date , after they order the dress .
negative	i told them there were no dresses and i was told that from the manufacturer and if you were ordered why would you say 0 - 0 days when you don_'_t even know if it '_s in stock ????
negative	i decided to wait for the email , but i read some reviews and realized i was taken and this is normal practice for missesdressy . com .
negative	take the order , take the money , make a false shipment promise , and then they have your money .
negative	i called again and was immediately put on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	i called from another phone , while on hold , and was hung_up on twice .
negative	i called no fewer than 0 times in 0 hours , never talking to anyone , other than " can you hold ,.... click !"
negative	.
negative	i called my credit_card and started a dispute claim for the charge .
negative	i called missesdressy again and finally_reached the same person i spoke to earlier .
negative	i swear 0 people work here .
negative	i told her i was not paying for a dress that wasn_'_t going to arrive and she told me that they don_'_t cancel orders .
negative	i then told her i already called to report a fraudulent charge to my credit_card company and amazingly her story changed and i was transferred to a " supervisor ".
negative	she answered the phone with " hello ", no introduction , no can i help you , nothing but hello .
negative	i told her my story and i wanted a full_refund and she did it .
negative	i told her i wouldn_'_t hang up until i was emailed a confirmation on my cancellation , which she did .
negative	this company is a joke !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	my husband placed a order on 0 - 00 - 00 for delivery on 0 - 00 - 00 .
negative	i was never e_- mailed my conformation order as_promised .
negative	my bank_account was charged $_00 . 00 on 0 - 00 - 00 .
negative	flowers were never delivered and i have attempted to contact the company via_e_- mail and phone since 00 - 00 - 00 .
negative	i have never received a response back from the company .
negative	i went through their automated_system as if i was placing a new order and my call was answered to only be told they are a answering service and had no access to my order .
negative	i was also told that customer_service was closed and their hours of operation are from 0 : 00 a . m . to 0 p . m . even_though the website clearly_states they are open 00 / 0 000 days a year .
negative	the answering service who places the order suggested that i contact bbb and dispute it with my bank .
negative	they informed me that they are bombarded with angry customers all the time .
negative	flower delivery express states guaranteed delivery if the order is placed two_days in advance on high peak days .
negative	my order was placed 0 days in advance .
negative	i have filed a report with bbb and my next step is contacting my bank to dispute the charge .
negative	please read_reviews before placing any orders with this company .
negative	what good is it to receive valentine '_s day flowers after the actual date .
negative	thank_god my husband figureds out this company was a scam by 0 - 00 - 00 and ordered a additional bouquet from out local_florist .
negative	when was the last time you reserved a room anywhere and paid ahead of time ?
negative	we reserved a room for the nights of mar .
negative	00 and 00 a few_days ago .
negative	when checking my bank_statement i found that travelocity had already billed us for the reservation .
negative	that is the first time in all our travels that payment was already charged .
negative	we consider this an unfair practice and will never deal with travelocity again .
negative	bait and switch tactics not acceptable
negative	i ordered three outdoor tables and two chairs and was quoted $_000 for shipping .
negative	i had to wait 0 months for the chair and they charged my credit_card .
negative	i kept emailing them to see why it never arrived .
negative	i have to email them 0 times to get one answer a few_days_later .
negative	they told me 0 months later that i would have to pay $ 0000 usd for shipping and it would be shipped to the airport and not even to my home !
negative	i am not paying that much for shipping when i was never told so the price when i ordered it 0 months_ago .
negative	i would not have ordered it from them .
negative	they told me they were going to refund me for the tables and chairs over a month_ago and still have not received refund or my order !!!!
negative	they are not honest and do not do_business with them !!!
negative	!
negative	some of the flowers lasted just two_days , these were the roses , the tulips lasted four days i would have expected at the very least seven_days plus the flowers were left_outside the main complex ?????
negative	very poor show .......
negative	i do not like identity_guard .
negative	i was promised i would get my 0 scores every_month for free .
negative	it never happened .
negative	i only got it when i signed_up .
negative	i am trying to purchase a home and monitor my credit .
negative	this service did not help at all .
negative	we received a delivery from myhermes , my husband heard a knock at the door and got up to answer it , before he reached the living_room door there was a pounding at the door and as he headed down the stairs there was a 0rd hammering .
negative	as he opened the door the delivery agent was already talking to our elderly neighbour , asking if she would take the parcel .
negative	the agent must have knocked her door at the same time as ours as it takes the elderly lady a while to shuffle to her door , it only took my husband less_than 00 seconds to answer , he was furious not only that she ' d knocked , no , banged , 0 times but that she had disturbed our neighbour for no good reason .
negative	her excuse was that she had to get a move on .
negative	as we ' d been expecting the delivery the previous day i quite believe that she was behind schedule but her behaviour was entirely inappropriate .
negative	my husband used to work nights , that amount of knocking would have woken him but obviously there ' d have been no - one there by the time he got to the door and would have been infuriating .
negative	i '_m deeply disappointed by her behaviour and would certainly never use this company myself .
negative	i booked a 00 day rental in florida , prepaid entire amount and recieved a voucher good for alamo .
negative	went to pick_up car with family and luggage and alamo said the voucher was only good for non us drivers_license holders !!
negative	i paid about $_000 through carhire0000 , which was half the price of direct alamo and it was only good for non us ??
negative	but when they took my money they knew from my credit_card info that my address was us !
negative	i paid alamo about 0000 $ for the 00 day rental because i was stuck and it was a holiday_period .
negative	so i call carhire0000 and they say because i did not pick_up the car and because i did not cancel within 0 days , i would be charged 0 days fee whcih they calculated to be $_000 !
negative	i only paid $_000 for 00 days and they werre charging me $_000 !!
negative	they told me the terms and conditions , which ran over 000 small_print words , required me to be non us license holder .
negative	i could not find it in the terms and conditions before i booked , but did find it in the voucher .
negative	so what ?
negative	why didnt they put in in big letters so i could read it ??
negative	i had my credi card company dispute the charges and agter much back and forth , i got the credit .
negative	dont use them .
negative	horrible customer_service and really nasty people .
negative	trust_pilot is obviously more efficient than fabriah as i '_m being asked for review before receiving the goods i have ordered from fabriah !
negative	0 / 00 / 00 0 :_00am cst
negative	you just sent me an_email_telling_me there was activity on my account and i needed to check it .
negative	i cannot get into my account because i get an_error_message that says my credit_card account is about to expire or has expired therefore i need to give you another credit_card before i can use the service you charge me for every_month .
negative	my account with american_express does not expire until 0 / 00 / 00 and amex is mailing the new card the middle of this month .
negative	the card is good until 0 / 00 / 00 and i have no spending limit .
negative	why did you not check with amex yourself to see if my credit_card was good ?
negative	i spoke to your agent yesterday named chris and she said there would be no problem with me accessing my account even with the message credit_card expired .
negative	i could not access identity_guard yesterday that is why i had to call and speak to chris , she got me into the account .
negative	don_'_t send me an_email with a warning and then not let_me into the account .
negative	you have no service open until 0am est , you need 00 / 0 support service open .
negative	if there is fraud / hack into my account because of your action and inaction , i will sue you .
negative	what type of service are you operating ?
negative	i am totally disgusted with identity_guard
negative	member #_00000000
negative	worst company , paid $_000 for glasses , prescription lens strength was wrong , sent in a copy of the prescription , denied mistake , did not follow the prescription .
negative	poor customer_service , called 0 times no calls returned , stated i would be called back by 00 am , told i would be called back by 0 pm , no call backs , left voice_mail .
negative	do not buy from this company !
negative	!
negative	worst on line experience , wasted alot of time and money !
negative	!
negative	i ordered sunglasses two_weeks_ago , and had sent an_email to customer_service and had still had no response .
negative	despite reading a few bad_reviews i thought i would give vision_direct a try as they did have many good reviews .
negative	i
negative	i have had no response from the customer_service team and not even any notification that the item is delayed .
negative	my status has_been showing stock confirmed for over a week and a half .
negative	i had ordered this as a gift , thinking it would come in the shown delivery time but i was deffiantly wrong .
negative	after making my purchase at a discounted_rate i suggested to my friends that they should buy from this website too , but i have told them that their service is poor and i would have rather paid for sunglasses in full price somewhere_else that i knew would have better communication and would satisfy the customer .
negative	very disapointed that i now have no sunglasses and will have to wait for them to arrive and then ship them off to the person they were a gift for and waste money on international postage to the person as vision_direct have not delivered in time .
negative	i highly suggest you get a customer_service line as your 00 hour response by email is not adiquate .
negative	- finally recieved my order after complaing to vision_direct .
negative	to recieve the item with no manufacture warranty and a dirty box .
negative	not really happy with the transaction .
negative	waiting on a response from customer_service as to why this is the case .
negative	from the beginning this trip was horrible .
negative	long hours traveling and even worst , the bus_ride to the hotel .
negative	once at the hotel you are imprisoned by locals who will take your money using guilt .
negative	we only left the hotel once and we were broke .
negative	this all_inclusive resort is old run down and in need of a facelift .
negative	the power went out and the generators which they use to run everything were right under our window so we missed out on 0 nights of sleep .
negative	the beach is small , there is no area to snorkel , and the pools are filthy .
negative	you will be unable to make phone_calls or use the internet without paying a lot of money .
negative	the staff are not helpful and actually quite rude when you needed any kind of assistance .
negative	the food was mediocre at best .
negative	seemed like most visitors were only interested in one thing , purchasing marijuana and smoking it in the hotel , the halls reeked .
negative	do not bother with jamaica and ocho rios go to the bahamas .
negative	we were truly disappointed in the $ 0000 for an " all_inclusive " resort vacation .
negative	returned emails as long as they thought i was a new customer but when they realized i wanted my money back they not only did not answer me they ignored paypal .
negative	paypal closed my complaint because the number they provided could not even prove the battery had been shipped .
negative	oh it was shipped alright .
negative	to me .
negative	dead and unusable and then back to them they still will not acknowledge they have my money and their lousy broken battery .
negative	do not trust these idiots .
negative	they either dont understand_english or they just dont care .
negative	when i made my reservation the person i spoke with seemed a little confused so i asked him to repeat my reservation several_times .
negative	he assured_me i had gotten the room i requested but when i got my reservation , it was wrong .
negative	i immediated called customer_service and they told me to give them 00_hours and they would research the problem and get back to me .
negative	after 00_hours i called and gave them my itinerary_number and even with tech_support the person i spoke with could not help me even after i was placed on hold .
negative	i am still_waiting to hear back and my credit_card has_been charged for a room that does not meet my needs .
negative	i paid an extra $_00 for a room with a water view in chicago .
negative	when we arrived at the hotel , we were told there were no rooms with a view available .
negative	so basically i paid_extra for the possibility of having a water view .
negative	the hotel manager was great and gave_us a $_00 gift_card at their restaurant .
negative	but it just does not feel right that expedia took extra money for a room upgrade and gave_us nothing in return .
negative	i will not use site again .
negative	parcel was pick_up assured it would be delivered safely with speed .
negative	it arrived on time contents smashed to bits .
negative	both sender and buyer both bitterly disappointed that it appeared no care was taken .
negative	it appears to have been thrown around like a house brick .
negative	would you recommend this company ?
negative	the answer is no .
negative	we arrived at windsor to stand in a line for 00_minutes to get tickets , then had to rush through the self - guided_tour .
negative	back on the bus for a long drive to stonehenge … not enough time to even do the audio - tour .
negative	then back on the bus to arrive in oxford where our guide quickly lost our entire group by walking into a crowd and disappearing .
negative	but it really didn_'_t matter because we arrived so late that everything worth seeing was already closed .
negative	think before booking all three of these attractions for one day .
negative	i did not like these hose , did not last over two_days .
negative	i am a hostess and i am easy on my hose but these got runs in them the second day i put them on .
negative	they are not worth the money i paid for them . thanks a lot .
negative	when we arrived at ramada , we asked the person at the front_desk if we could incorporate our aarp or aaa_discount .
negative	we were surprised to find out that the room had been booked and pre_- paid through_expedia .
negative	i assured the front_desk personnel that i had not used expedia .
negative	they explained how expedia had cloaked itself in the ramada branding to the point that we actually thought we were booking through the ramada plaza itself .
negative	we could not add a discount because our credit_card had already been charged for our room by expedia and pre_- paid .
negative	i probably got a good deal through_expedia , but i don_'_t trust expedia .
negative	the experience with expedia left me feeling that they are sneaky and underhanded .
negative	as for my experience with the ramada plaza minneapolis , it was great !
negative	we will_definitely stay there again ... but we '_ll beware , next time .
negative	j ' ai moins de 00 ans , et ai découvert en arrivant chez le loueur de voitures qu ' il fallait que_je m ' acquitte de 000 $ supplémentaires et non inclus dans_les frais payés à autoescape .
negative	de plus , ces frais n ' étaient absolument pas mentionnés par autoescape avant le paiement , mais seulement après , dans_le prepaid voucher .
negative	il serait plus honnête qu ' autoescape inclut ces frais dans_la somme réglée .
negative	de plus , j ' ai aussi découvert que pour_la même voiture , sans passer par autoescape j ' aurais payé $_000 c ' est - à - dire 000 €, soit environ 00 € de moins que les 000_€ réglés à autoescape .
negative	i placed an order for a few items .
negative	i never received a confirmation_email when i placed the order or when the order shipped .
negative	i asked about my order by_clicking on the " contact us " button , where they tell you they '_ll get back to you within 00_hours ( not including weekends ).
negative	well , it took them 0 business days to get back to me regarding my order .
negative	they told me it did ship a few_days prior and they gave_me a tracking_number .
negative	i still_haven_'_t received my order and it '_s 0 business days passed the expected delivery date that it says online when i track it .
negative	i love this website .
negative	i '_ve placed multiple orders and have never had an_issue whatsoever .
negative	an item ordered in stock took payment and had to wait 0 days for this to be dispatched let_alone delivered , contacted via_email twice to which i recieved no reply even after 0 days .
negative	still_haven_'_t recieved the item over a week_later .
negative	would never use them again .
negative	i ordered the brake_light on february 0 , 0000 and the part has yet to be delivered .
negative	thirteen days ???????
negative	?
negative	the item i ordered did not turn up and when i contacted all beauty i was told to wait 00 working days after the order was dispatched , only to be advised that the item was out of stock !
negative	!
negative	i placed my order on 00 may 00 for a pair of ray_ban sunglasses that were listed as fast shipping , i . e they would ship within 00 - 00_hours .
negative	i presumed ( wrongly ) that the web address meant that the company was in australia and therefore that my glasses would be shipped from australia ; i expected to have them quickly .
negative	i received my order confirmation in which i was told that in the unlikely_event that there was a problem they would contact me immediately .
negative	on checking my order status 0 days_later , it had changed to ' discontinued '.
negative	i had received no communication from vd that there was a problem .
negative	i tried_phoning them using the number listed on paypal ; that was in hong_kong and disconnected .
negative	they had another email address in the uk which i emailed but have had no response .
negative	interestingly , they were still selling the sunglasses i wanted on their website even at this stage !
negative	after polite and ' form letter ' style emails from their customer_service people in response to my contact , i was offered a 00_%_discount on another pair of sunglasses of my choice .
negative	i accepted their offer and emailed them with the details of the new sunglasses within a few hours on 00th .
negative	here i was thinking that finally my sunglasses would be on there way .
negative	but on checking my order yesterday ( 00th ) i have discovered that the wrong sunglasses have been despatched to me - i am still_waiting for a tracking_number to find out where they are .
negative	i wrote an_email and have been told that they will exchange the glasses for the ones i had ordered but i would need to fill_out a return form and send them back , paying for the postage , that they would then reimburse_me .
negative	the glasses i want will take 0 to 00 working days to provide but of course this won_'_t happen until i return the glasses that have been sent to me from somewhere in the world .
negative	i have sent an_email_asking someone to phone me , as i was told they would do if i requested , but i only get email platitudes in response .
negative	i believe that these problems could have been prevented , and my sunglasses provided much more quickly and hence my level of satisfaction markedly higher if someone from vd had bothered to pick_up the phone and call me when they first discovered that the sunglasses i wanted were discontinued .
negative	this was my test order before ordering prescription_glasses .
negative	given that vd are unable to fill a simple sunglasses order in a timely way , then there is no chance that i am going to order prescription_glasses from them .
negative	beware of vd - they are not australian based and they are not the good customer_service company they would have you believe they are from their web_site .
negative	first my daughters favorite flower is a sunflower and i needed them bad to make her smile , you see her gracie died sunday her sweet dog .
negative	on monday i called and ordered a " deluxe sunflower bouquet " and today my daughter received a small bouquet with green pom mums , black eyed susans , yellow_roses but the reason i called and selected sunflowers were very scarce i could only see two sunflowers in the picture she sent me .... to me a big_disappointment !!!!!!
negative	so i called customer_service what a laugh ... she argued that i ordered a " golden blooms arrangement " but my receipt shows the picture of the sunflowers so i thought i was getting what i ordered but no they decided what i wanted .
negative	don_'_t be_fooled by their pictures on their website to me a complete_waste of money and all i was trying do is make my daughter feel better .
negative	i '_m sorry my darling mom tried .....
negative	i called the number given on the internet when i looked up my hotel .
negative	when andy answered she did not tell me it was a 0rd_party reservations service .
negative	i then spoke to rafael who messed_up everything from my name to the type of room , how many nights and the dates i would like ...
negative	asked for supervisor & finally made my reservations , only to find that without telling_me , this service removed money from my card immediately ... for the cancelled booking as well as the current one .
negative	then i found out that people in the hotel paid less_than i did with another service .
negative	i will never use your service again .
negative	i ordered a box of parts , all from the same warehouse .
negative	there was nothing too complicated , some belts , filters , gaskets , drain plugs .
negative	i was missing a couple parts .
negative	they were printed on my packing_slip but not sent .
negative	i filled out a support_ticket that took_forever for someone to reply to and tried to call many_times but no one ever answers .
negative	the customer_service reply was for a return which was not my case .
negative	i had nothing to return .
negative	so i had to reply and wait forever for a response again .
negative	i bought the parts i needed somewhere_else .
negative	i still have not received my refund and its been nearly a month .
negative	i regret ever using them to buy parts .
negative	0 .
negative	website would not let_me add items to my cart , tried several_times .
negative	finally had to call .
negative	0 .
negative	charged me $ 0 . 00 processing_fee .
negative	wtf , what business charges a " processing_fee "?
negative	i order from the internet all the time .
negative	no business has ever charged such a fee .
negative	if i had been ordering for myself , i would have cancelled the order , over two dollars !
negative	0 .
negative	website said if i signed_up for emails , i would receive free_shipping .
negative	rep says ,'" oh no , not the additional shipping_charges , they are never eliminated ."
negative	0 .
negative	the item i ordered has_been back - ordered .
negative	they hope it will ship in about three_weeks .
negative	after all this , i can '_t give them a very good review .
negative	sure hope the item is what my father - in -_law wants because i have a feeling trying to return it would be a nightmare .
negative	first of all the s &_h price is ridiculous .
negative	i mean 00 dollars for shipping and handling ?
negative	i don_'_t even pay that much when i order things from fuckin china or canada .. it '_s way too much considering the fact that your company is in the u . s ( california )....
negative	it '_s been a week and a couple of days since i placed my order and yet nothing .... no updates .. the tracking_number i was given does not even work ... i really wish i read the reviews befor i place my order .
negative	this company needs to get thier shit together because they can '_t be messing up like this .. people work hard for thier money and i can '_t afford for y ' all to be messing up ... if two_weeks hit without my shoes being delivered ( not picked_up ) to my house .
negative	i would need a full_refund !
negative	ordered a wheelbarrow for my gardening mad mum .
negative	got email_confirmation of my order , advised delivery 0 - 0 working days .
negative	0 days_later a phone_call came saying the item wasn_'_t meant to be on sale and i wont be getting a wheelbarrow .
negative	furthermore it was too late to order another before mums_birthday .
negative	won_'_t be using this website again .
negative	i gave a one star_rating because there is no negative stars to give !
negative	it has_been 0_weeks and i have not received my items !
negative	!
negative	emailed several_times and the customer_service actually emailed me back with this --" during busy periods a response may take slightly_longer , however please rest_assured that there is no need to resend your email .
negative	we have received it and you will receive a response from a member of our customer care team at the earliest opportunity ."
negative	well , apparently nobody even_bother to email me back and let_me know what '_s going on with my items !
negative	it just simply doesn_'_t make any sense to give me a tracking_number if i cannot track it at all .....
negative	what a big_disappointment and i will never ever buy from topman again .. horrible !
negative	placed an order for next_day delivery on january 00 , order was delivered on january 00nd .
negative	the web_site wasn_'_t working , so could not track my order or send in contact sheet .
negative	plus there was no phone_number to call in the emails or the website .
negative	my brother mark got delayed on his flight in grand junction , colorado by united_airlines , so he didn_'_t get his connection in denver , so there for they are flying him to seattle where they told him he has to pay for his own room .
negative	they suck .
negative	never , never fly with united_airlines .
negative	the person i talked to was very hard to understand .
negative	i finally hung_up and called back thinking i would get someone_who i could understand .
negative	the next person was not much_better .
negative	i was never told that the credit_card would be billed immediately .
negative	never told that the cancellation_policy was different than that of the hotel .
negative	i will call the hotel itself from here on out .
negative	ordered the item from website and received the item but in a different colour_scheme .
negative	contacted the customer_services department for the company and was told that the website states that " colour may vary from that ordered ".
negative	i checked the website and found no such warning .
negative	i was asked to take photos and email them as if i could not tell the difference_between red and cream .
negative	i was then told that they had contacted the warehouse who had checked that a replacement item was the correct colour and would be dispatched and the wrong_colour item collected .
negative	i then took delivery of the new item and guess what ?
negative	the new item was the wrong_colour as before !
negative	at this point i realised that the company probably does not have the item as displayed on its website .
negative	i told them that i am withdrawing payment for the item and was informed that this could result in a bad debt recorded against my name .
negative	my credit_card company has now withdrawn payment and i '_ve ordered the item from a different company which has arrived all as ordered no_problems .
negative	still not out of the woods yet as the 0nd item needs to be collected .
negative	stayed at home ( again ) all day yesterday ( the promised collection day ) and no one called .
negative	just got an_email from the company claiming city_link called at 0 . 00pm yesterday got no reply so i owe them £ 0 !
negative	i was at home waiting all day .
negative	0 days spent at home so_far in total for deliveries and collections for nothing , still , have plenty of time to write this review
negative	i ordered a hood latch for my vw_beetle i never received my part !
negative	i used my debit visa_card for this transaction and the money was deducted .
negative	i will never order another thing from this site again !!
negative	!
negative	poor service , rude staff , disorganised will not buy anything from this place .
negative	we ordered a sofa from sofa works over the phone in the end .
negative	i would not have ordered one from the local_store in crewe because of the tacky attitude of the manager and only ordered from sofaworks because we couldn_'_t find what we wanted any where else .
negative	the advertising matches the tacky attitude of the crewe manager and the sloath really needs getting_rid of .
negative	my opinion only and well - you did ask for it .
negative	my husband is in the military and we decided to book a vacation since we hadn_'_t had one in a few_years .
negative	we were very excited to book our tickets .
negative	we also purchase the insurance / waiver .
negative	my husband had an_unexpected problem that he had to attend to at work and now this company says i have to pay them $_000_per change fee even_though it will be refunded to me the same day plus $_000 extra for our hotel .
negative	they blamed it on the hotel and said they had nothing to do with the increase in price .
negative	yet , i checked the hotel myself and actually the date we were moving it to was cheaper_than the price we purchased the ticket for .
negative	they are crooks and we will never book with them again .
negative	it is a total scam .
negative	very unhappy .
negative	ordered a cover on sept 00th , was told it would be here within 0 days , here it is oct . 0th still nothing .
negative	my acct says " still processing_".
negative	a severe storm was heading our way and we didn_'_t want to have to get all the leaves and debris out again , so we went and bought one at a local namco , which certainly was our last resort .
negative	i have been reading panini comics since i was little , they cover all the major marvel characters and now some of the dc ones also .
negative	living in the uk , where it is hard to get hold of comics , these series ' are brilliant and cover all the major story - lines ( eventually - they do run about 0 - 0 years behind the usa comics ).
negative	when i first started reading and collecting these i had my local newsagents put them up for me but nowadays i subscribe to them and get them all delivered to my door , this service is far easier , as you don_'_t have to worry_about forgetting to collect them each_month and there are also deals that save you money if you subscribe to multiple issues .
negative	however , now the service has gone down hill drastically .
negative	panini comics no_longer do back issues ( this shouldn_'_t be an_issue if you subscribe anyway however ...)
negative	lately i have not been receiving some of my issues , sometimes i get sent the wrong issue and end up with two issues of the previous months issues and sometimes a month is skipped altogether .
negative	each time this happens i contact panini and there response is ' we do not have any more copies of the missing issue and we will add another month onto the end of your subscription '.
negative	well i know that this is better_than them just ignoring the issue but what am i supposed to do about the missing issues .
negative	i have found myself having to pay up - to £ 0 / 0 on ebay to replace a missing issue , when they only cost £ 0 to buy in the first place .
negative	i advise against anyone using this subscription service and i will be going back to ordering them at my local newsagents once my subscriptions have finished .
negative	i placed an order on here totaling just under £_000 but when it came it didn_'_t fit , the note that came with it said to simply send it back and e_- mail through the size i needed and they would send out a replacement , it '_s annoying that i have to cover the cost of postage back especially as i have to send it recorded as well and it '_s really heavy but most online companies do this so as annoying as this is , i was willing to do so but i then get an e_- mail saying as the items were reduced ( and i didn_'_t even realize this when ordering from this seriously expensive site ) they would not send me replacements , despite them still selling the items and having the correct size in stock they would only offer me a refund ( minus the postage out and back ).
negative	this is terrible , i cannot_believe that a company would rather loose a £_000 sale than just send out the correct size , maddening , and now i '_m out of pocket and very annoyed so i advise you all to avoid this company
negative	they do not provide all the options they offer on their site , i requested free delivery of my item , which was one of the options offered at checkout but they then refused to deliver saying they didn_'_t offer this option but still charged me and woudn '_t refund , this case is now going through trading_standards as they are rude and ignorant and refuse to deliver what i ordered which is clearly_stated on the invoice they sent .
negative	nowhere on the product listing does it say they only offer digital codes and you could select different posting methods so why would they charge postage at all if they only sent them digitally .
negative	i selected the physical card as_pictured and described , this is there mistake which they refuse to own upto .
negative	the sheer fact that they are so rude and ignorant and won_'_t except they made a mistake shows you what a bad company they are
negative	købte for 0 mdr siden canada goose hybridge jakke til_en værdi af 0000kr , nedsat til 0000kr .
negative	ifølge beskrivelsen af jakken , skulle dette være en hårdfør udendørsjakke som producenten reklamerer med st kunne anvendes til på isklatring og rappelling - begge aktiviteter kræver særdeles hårdføre udstyr .
negative	efter et meget let fald på_en ganske almindelig græsplæne ' brændte ' materialet på ærmet af friktionen og efterlod et stort hul .
negative	jakken kan_ikke anvendes .
negative	sport00 har valgt ikke at anerkende dette som et fejl i materialet og_har afvist vores reklamation .
negative	de_har derudover valgt at vi selv skal betale for reparation af jakken .
negative	vi mener at det_er falsk reklame af jakken , at præsentere den som ' slidstærk ' og at den skulle kunne anvendes til ovennævnte aktiviteter .
negative	dette er_en dyr jakke , som har skuffet på_det groveste - og sport00 '_s håndtering ligeså .
negative	desværre .
negative	min konklusion :
negative	pas på med at stole på de produktbeskrivelser der findes på sport00 '_s hjemmeside .
negative	de vil gerne have produktet til at fremstå mere slidstærkt / bedre kvalitet end hvad det_er i den virkelige verden .
negative	forvent ikke god service hvis dit produkt efterfølgende fejler .
negative	vi vil ikke anbefale sport00 til dine fremtidige køb .
negative	i had a horrible experience with this company .
negative	sold me faulty brake_pads .
negative	cost me $_000 in mechanics fees to put bad part in , test it , and take it back out , and then wouldn_'_t even pay return shipping on the bad part .
negative	of course they didn_'_t pay the mechanic either .
negative	bad costumer_service .
negative	when i demanded at lest return shipping they hung_up on me .
negative	i have reported them to the bbb .
negative	still_waiting for my credit_card refund of part that i returned with tracking_#
negative	will not order from this company again , as not only did i pay a delivery charge when i returned the items it cost me £_00 and i have since been told neither of these charges will be refunded .
negative	i paid a price for deliver of a few envelopes and paid a courier fee .
negative	it took a week to get there - i got a package from england quicker and which cost less - disgraceful
negative	i have been a long time member of ancestry . com and have decided to probably not renew when my membership is complete .
negative	customer_service is non_- existent .
negative	what happened to e_- mail customer_service ?
negative	i find it difficult to call during the hours you have customer_service representatives available .
negative	shouldn_'_t you be making it convenient for me to contact customer_service ?
negative	i made my tree private months_ago , but people are still saving items from my tree .
negative	how are they doing that ?
negative	also , information about living people is showing up even_though i specifically have them designated as living .
negative	this is a concern for me and i cannot get an answer because i cannot call during your business hours .
negative	we booked the hotel through_travelocity . com to london for 0 days for 0 people .
negative	when we got to the hotel , we had no room available because hotel said they never received any notice from travelocity . com .
negative	they asked us to call travelocity , com for the refund .
negative	we also rent a car from travelocity . com for compact car .
negative	when we got there , we could not find in rental_car company .
negative	we asked the airport information service person .
negative	they told us that we needed to take a taxi or bus to the hotel 00_minutes away from the airport .
negative	it cost additional 0 euro person round trips .
negative	when we got to the rental_car company , we have very small car not the compact car .
negative	they said that you should pay 0 euro more per day to get the bigger car .
negative	we had very poor experience with the trip booking from travelocity . com .
negative	i have written two messages to ask what i should do with the cans of newman '_s dog_food i received .
negative	no order form was in the box .
negative	the box will remain at my desk in the office until i receive a response as to what i should do with it .
negative	i did not order this product .
negative	thank_you .
negative	don_'_t waste your time shopping with this company .
negative	if you are used to good quality shoes , fast shipping , attentive customer_service and a good refund policy then this is not the place for you .
negative	ordered two_pairs of boots , both lousy quality and smelled terrible (" synthetic leather ").
negative	customer_service number nonfunctional .
negative	when finally contacted via_e_- mail only option was store credit .
negative	i don_'_t want any more of their junk , will donate boots to the salvation army and write this off as an expensive mistake .
negative	i decided i was going to buy a leonardo dicaprio aquaracer from this company .
negative	i mean , they seemed legit for a replica watch site .
negative	i went to order , and i was taken to a separate page to pay .
negative	this seemed strange , but i '_ve used google checkout before and figured it was similar .
negative	i placed my order , and went to sleep .
negative	the next_morning , i went to use my credit_card , and it was denied .
negative	thank_god my credit_card company flagged a $ 0 , 000 purchase from macy '_s coming from an ip address from china .
negative	they denied the charge , and refunded my purchase from this site ( my credit_card company , not watchestoo . com ) this is such a sleezy scam it is disgusting .
negative	would give 0_stars if i could .
negative	i recently booked a stay for my son at an ibis hotel in the uk .
negative	i couldn_'_t see anywhere on the site that you couldn_'_t choose a smoking_room .
negative	i emailed ibis to make_sure the room he got was a smoking_room and received an_email back to say that there are no smoking_rooms .
negative	i telephoned and the lady got me to click on various tabs and icons to finally find this information !
negative	there is no refund available and it is not exactly cheap !
negative	this all happened about an_hour and a half after booking ( i emailed immediately after booking and it took an_hour and a half to receive a reply ) so you would have thought there would have been a bit of give and take !
negative	maybe i should have spent hours looking , but other_websites have that information on the front page so i didn_'_t even_bother looking further .
negative	salve ,
negative	è dal 00 di ottobre che sto aspettando una vostra risposta in merito al tipo di rimborso per_il samsung_galaxy iii .
negative	sempre nel mese di ottobre mi avevate dato conferma del rimborso , ma non mi avete più specificato di che rimborso si tratta ( altro cellulare , importo in denaro ... e quanto ?).

negative	i called to see about my package , the girl on the other end talked and responed to my inquirer like some valley girl .
negative	dumb , and unconcern .
negative	and i called to get a return number .
negative	and another girl acted the same way .
negative	i asked her whats the address , the way she replied was like , i should know .
negative	just very unprofessional
negative	if i have a choice , i will never use your service again .
negative	you charge my cc without a problem but when it comes to adjusting the reservation you ' re completely_useless unless i want to cancel .
negative	so that '_s what i did and reserved directly w the hotel instead .
negative	i have booked 0 flights and each time it has_been difficult to get access to my stickers .
negative	website is down down down
negative	i ordered a tail_light from this website , not only did they send me the wrong part , i have yet to hear from anyone after countless emails that i have sent them .
negative	i have been calling the customer_service number for about a week now , up to 0 - 0 times a day .
negative	i have still yet to talk to anyone , and after 00_minutes of waiting each time they disconnect me , so i have no choice but to try again .
negative	i have written them so many_times that they will not accept anymore of my complaint emails , but no one will respond to me other than an_automated_response email which tells_me no one has read any of my emails .
negative	they still have not reimbursed me for the money i spent , and are also making me pay the shipping fee to send it back when i was not the one who messed the order up .
negative	if you do not want to get taken_advantage of , choose another company .
negative	partsgeek . com is not here to serve you , only to take your money and ruin your experience of online shopping .
negative	had a very bad_experience bookin with expedia .
negative	first the representative are uneducated n lied to me about star_rating .. next didn_'_t give me a refund n was on the phone for almost 0 hrs with them .
negative	just playing me around that they will give me a coupon to use on my next booking ..
negative	still couldn_'_t get a code nor a supervisor to speak to ..
negative	this is my last time dealing_with expedia ...
negative	this was my first order from 00dollarmall . com .
negative	i was excited to find such cute looking clothes for so cheap .
negative	i purchased 0 tops .
negative	i received my package and 0 of the shirts was there yet the packing_slip said 0 were included .
negative	i emailed the company and even_though it was a weekend it took til monday_evening to get back to me .
negative	they state the 0nd shirt was out of stock .
negative	why was i allowed to purchase it if it wasnt in stock ?
negative	won_'_t be buying again .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	so i ordered two bouquets for mothers_day - one for my mum and one for my boyfriend '_s mum .
negative	i received two emails on sunday_morning , saying neither delivery could be made today , as they were " very busy " and the earliest the flowers would arrive is tuesday .
negative	i complained and they offered to increase the size of the bouquet and add some chocolates .
negative	however , my boyfriend '_s mum received her flowers this morning with no upgrade , no chocolates and no apology note as_promised .
negative	and as for my poor wee mum .
negative	she '_s not getting her flowers at all .
negative	she sat in all morning waiting - but apparently teleflorist can '_t manage it today !!
negative	so i '_ve had to deliver more disappointing news to my mum , who doesn_'_t keep very well and whose children live away from home
negative	well_done teleflorist .
negative	maybe you should treat other people '_s mums the way you ' d like your mum to be treated .
negative	my ink_cartridge did not work and was not compatible with my brother_printer .. wouldn_'_t buy i actually thought this was the real one anyway from the description didn_'_t know it said compatible to .. i wouldn_'_t buy again and wasn_'_t worth sending back for $ 0
negative	had trouble with the site .
negative	unable to upload picture .
negative	got confirmation my picture was being sent .
negative	spent my money but no picture .
negative	travelocity has lousy customer_services .
negative	i was on hold for an_hour and was swiltched back and forth .
negative	the issue was never resolved .
negative	i think this is the way they handle customers to discourage the call .
negative	i will never do_business with travelocity .
negative	nor did i receive notification of shipment , and it is 0_weeks_later .
negative	what is up ?
negative	this is a present for day 0 of hannukah , and looks like we will miss the date .
negative	i orderred in plenty of time .
negative	thanks for taking my money and not delivering .
negative	i know , i know ---- they may be your only option , but the problem is that they know it too , and they treat you , the customer , like crap .
negative	i can '_t stand getting a hard_sell every time i have to call , or being sent flyers in the mail offering a great deal but then calling and finding out it '_s not offered in my rural_area , and worst of all , when they charge for something that the rep said they wouldn_'_t , nobody at comcast seems to know how to take the charge off , even if the customer_service representatives believe and agree it should be .
negative	i '_m sure this is by design .
negative	i don_'_t have time to call over every 0 or 0 dollar discrepancy on my bill , but multiply those discrepancies by the numerous comcast customers , and you '_ve got a major scam going on .
negative	i seriously dislike the policies of comcast .
negative	booked drop and go on wednesday , received no booking details , service was charged but not parking , so on saturday_morning stressed as don_'_t know whether to book elsewhere , are they going to debit my account , do i take a chance , what !
negative	cannot contact as only open mon - fri 0 - 0pm , sorry but will not use you again and thanks for getting my holiday off to a bad start and will be asking for a refund .
negative	husband brought a flight with them and had nothing but trouble .
negative	sent him a separate bill for admin charges after he got back .
negative	terrible to try and phone them , they only have a premium_rate number and there are no contact details on the internet for them , though we found they are in germany .
negative	they don_'_t respond to email or fax , though when you get through to their premium_rate number they confirm your emails have been received , they just don_'_t respond but prefer you to call their premium_rate number .
negative	he was initially told the admin charge was a mistake , then afterwards chased again by email for the payment !
negative	after phoning their premium_rate number again , was told again to ignore the emails .
negative	in the end he had threatening emails to say if it wasn_'_t paid , he would be pursued through solicitors for it !
negative	we paid it , with extra on top as it had to be paid to their german bank so cost us twice as much to transfer the money .
negative	they are a terrible company to deal with and i wouldn_'_t touch them with a barge pole !
negative	you have been warned !
negative	i ordered and paid for goods still not arrived no_explanation as to why
negative	when i made my reservation at the springhill suites hotel , i was not aware that i was not on the marriott website .
negative	this cost me my marriott rewards and my tax exempt status for the hotel taxes .
negative	in the future , i will be more careful about checking the web address for hotels when i do a google_search for a specific hotel .
negative	my order still_hasn_'_t shipped so i had to give one star .
negative	my order # is 00000000 .
negative	i placed my order on june 00 .
negative	after_spending money on next_day delivery i received an_email early hours of the day it was due to say it didn_'_t make next_day delivery .
negative	that was okay just disappointing .
negative	i was told it would make next working day .
negative	i stayed in waiting for it and it did not turn up .
negative	so i waited in the next_day for it and phoned the courier company who said that it was unable to be delivered and i would need to reschedule with them .
negative	during this time my order arrived .
negative	i do not understand this system , how it says it won_'_t be delivered then it is !
negative	when opening the package a strange fishy smell appeared .
negative	when trying the dress on it was all i could smell .
negative	the dress was completely unwearable .
negative	i will not be using boohoo again and i advise others not to .
negative	i received my radiator support in a damaged box and the ends on both were bent .
negative	had to fix it to work .
negative	i think someone should take
negative	better care of sending things to a customer .
negative	i might not deal with you with company again .
negative	i was not inpressed .
negative	getting damage goods .
negative	it sucked !
negative	i was given bad directions and we couldn_'_t find the hotel .
negative	i requested a refund and was denied !
negative	i will never book a hotel through anyone but the hotel again !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	what ever happened to customer_satisfaction ?
negative	if you have questions you can e_- mail me !
negative	hard to give review on items .
negative	i was told items have shipped but no tracking_info is available .
negative	i am very disappointed
negative	dog_food stinks ( literally ).
negative	refused to exchange and got pretty snotty .
negative	don_'_t stand by what they sell .
negative	would like to see them feed it to their dog !!!
negative	!
negative	i still_haven_'_t reviewed my items when i was told i would receive them on or before wednesday last_week ... first shopping_experience with boohoo and very disappointed
negative	i wont be speaking to any friends
negative	booked a reservation & once i received the confirmation_email i noticed that our hotel was only booked sun .- fri . instead of sat - fri . which is what our flights were booked for ..... i guess we were just supposed to sleep at the airport our first night !
negative	glad i noticed this immediately so i called and the customer_service i received was unacceptable .
negative	she kept blaming the website & wouldn_'_t stand_behind the price i was quoted even_though it was their fault with a website issue .
negative	in the end she told me i would have to pay a few_hundred more dollars because that sat .
negative	night was never charged to us again due to their fault !
negative	oh & while she was giving me the new price of our vacation package i was pricing everything online on their website & i was getting a cheaper price than she was telling_me , this being after the " glitch " was fixed with the website .
negative	then 0 days_later when i happened to be checking out the website & put in our exact vacation hotel & flight and the price came up $_000 less_than we booked it for 0 days prior !
negative	so i tried to call to see if they would adjust the price since it was so close to us booking & they refused to help me or adjust the price !
negative	just bad customer_service all around !
negative	will not be using bookit . com ever again !
negative	yesterday i made my first reservation with easytobook . com and confirmed an erroneous date .
negative	when i called the hotel there were no more rooms available for me on the correct date .
negative	i tried to call the customer_service number listed on the website and the number rang and rang without an answer .
negative	i have sent an e_- mail asking for a refund and have received no answer .
negative	i cannot say at this moment that i am a satisfied customer until i talk to someone about my concerns .
negative	i ordered a pair of heels for my sister '_s wedding i was in along with a pair of boots .
negative	i received the both pairs in on a monday ( the following saturday was the wedding ) and the heels were the wrong color .
negative	i ordered bronze , they sent black .
negative	the boots were correct .
negative	i checked my order & the shipping receipt in the box and both said bronze so this was an ami mistake .
negative	i called right_away but it took several_times to get through and finally when i did i had to wait on hold for a long time .
negative	i told the rep on the phone the problem , had to pay again for the correct shoes to be sent to me for the wedding and was told to return the incorrect heels & i would be refunded for the heels + s / h .
negative	i told her i needed the correct heels right_away and they came in on friday ( mind you the wedding was the next_day ).
negative	i returned the shoes the following_tuesday .
negative	0_weeks passed and i had not received one bit of info regarding the return .
negative	i called again ( taking several tries to get through and then on hold again for a long time ) and was told that the returns department had not received my shoes in yet & i needed to check with the shipping company used .
negative	i gave them the date & time the package arrived ( 0_weeks_ago ) and who signed for it at ami .
negative	they said nothing can be done till the shoes were checked in .
negative	i got an_email that evening saying my package had been checked in .
negative	hmmm ... coincidence ?
negative	then i was told i would get credit at ami .
negative	i called the very instant i got the message ( several tries to get through , long wait time ) and was told that i would get the refund not credit .
negative	this whole fiasco started on october_00th .
negative	this is december_00th and i still have not received a refund back .
negative	i have made numerous_calls , emails , attempts to get my refund and i keep getting the run_around .
negative	it seems you have to tell ami what to do because they have their heads up their butts and no_idea how to process a return or contact the customer .
negative	i even filed with the better business_bureau and the case was closed because ami wouldn_'_t respond or provide information .
negative	this is clearly an ami mistake and a little over 0_weeks_ago i get an_email that said that my request is with the refunds department .
negative	i hadn_'_t received a check or any info yet and sent another message to their support email checking on the status and they respond with , we don_'_t have your information and if i request a check refund it will take another 0 - 0_weeks or i could get $$ through paypal or credit with ami .
negative	i told them to stick their credit up their butt and give me a check refund .
negative	this was december_00th and i get an_email today ( 00 / 00 ) finally saying that i will get a check in 0 - 0_weeks .
negative	so , now i have to wait_until february_0000 to see if the refund shows up .
negative	so this whole_process will span up to 0 months if i get my refund in the mail as told in their email .
negative	i will never order from this company again and would highly_recommend nobody order either .
negative	if you want to go through turmoil & hair pulling then go_ahead .
negative	it is not worth it !
negative	i dont_know why its taking so long to confirm my flights .
negative	after_reading all the reviews here , i have to wonder_if i too will get screwed over by budgetair .
negative	the fact that i booked a full 00_hours ago and have not received confirmations that my tickets have been issued concerns me .
negative	with expedia , you get your tickets issued automatically .
negative	im also scared if my flights end up getting delayed or canceled that budgetair would leave me hanging with no refund and no free options .
negative	i hope for the best but lets see .
negative	this is the first time i fly 00 , 000_miles_away , i hope i dont get screwed over by this online travel_agency .
negative	i can best describe this product as a sticker .
negative	i was expecting something more substantial than a label printed for the front and rear of my daughters kindle .
negative	if the product had been cheaper i could have understood the quality but this product cost me near on £_00 and certainly does not look worth more than £ 0 .
negative	i am also being charged 00_% re - stocking_fee for returning this item , which i think is totally outrageous !
negative	this kind of policy damages smaller retailers as i will now stick to purchasing my goods from larger main street retailers in future .
negative	the radiator i ordered did not fit even after verifying vin !
negative	and since no returns i had to pay extra to have it welded .
negative	never again .
negative	went to drivetime to purchase a vehicle on 00th exspressway in oklahoma city ..... and we had to go to another lot in oklahoma city to pick_up the vehicle with the salesman ... we should '_ve known something was wrong then the vehicle was started in front of the business ....( drive time ) off s . i - 000 ...
negative	so we get in it and drive back to the other location to finish up the paper_work ...
negative	so when we get in the car to make a vehicle inspection after transferring my insurance to the newly purchased vehicle ...
negative	it wouldn_'_t start ....
negative	so then they offer me a mercedes .....
negative	it was really nice it started up ....
negative	so i decided ok i will get this car ..... had to come_back the next_day to finish the paper_work on the vehicle .... again we go out to do a vehicle inspection on the car ....
negative	when the salesman went to raise the hood a piece of the latch broke off they had to send it off to get fixed ..... that was the second strike ....
negative	spent all day up there had to come_back the next_day to finish the paperwork ....
negative	so i did took the car home ... something just didn_'_t feel right so i took the car to the mercedes dealership just to get a good look at the car ... and i spent $_000 . 00 for that .... and low and behold the mercedes had a gasket leaking oil which would '_ve cost me another $ 0000 . 00 to get fixed .... drivetime tells you you have 0 days after purchase to return the vehicle .....
negative	when i took them the report that i got from the mercedes dealership to drivetime the manager up there asked me why did i tae the car to go get looked at if i didn_'_t hear_anything wrong with the car ... and i told him .....
negative	if it was you spending $ 0000 . 00 wouldn_'_t you ....
negative	i work hard for my money ......
negative	so i too the car back because they did not offer to fix it ...
negative	they acted lie i did something wrong .... got my money back and my car because i also traded my car for this mercedes ....
negative	went to try to purchase another vehicle for another car lot and drivetime has it on my credit that i still have this car ....
negative	it shouldn_'_t even had got on there if i returned the car back within the % days ....
negative	so now this is on me credit_report for at_least 00 days ....
negative	and i called and asked why ...
negative	the manager said i don_'_t know that sounds strange to me ..... yeah it sounds strange to me too .......
negative	so i guess i will lawyer up .....
negative	i was extremely dissatisfied with your product .
negative	my printer was able to identify your ink_cartridges as not authentic hp_cartridges and would not work even_though i ordered the correct cartridges .
negative	my purchase was money down the drain .
negative	i could not return because i had already removed the tape to try to use the cartridges .
negative	you should not sell people with hp printers something that you purport to work even when the printer won_'_t even allow a scan .
negative	very disappointed and will tell other people of my story and misfortune .
negative	i will never use your service again .
negative	i was not able to cancel using the link in the email , the number listed in the email was not a working number .
negative	i tried to cancel with the hotel and was told that was not an option .
negative	the hotel gave_me an 000 number that would not cancel and gave_me another number that i was not able to navigate to reach an actual_person .
negative	this was a nightmare .
negative	i could not get my activation , no online help what a miserable experience .
negative	if it wasn_'_t the best protection i would go back to norton in a heartbeat
negative	i ordered a case of blue_buffalo cat_food .
negative	the case arrived damaged ; one can was open with dried cat_food all over the rest of the other cans .
negative	one other can was partially open ... so two cans ruined plus the rest covered in a dried mess .
negative	blue_buffalo is expensive !
negative	so i contacted customer_support and all i got was a lame $ 0 credit on my next purchase .
negative	totally_unacceptable .
negative	i want them to at_least replace the two damaged_cans at their shipping expense ... but nope they won_'_t do that .
negative	i really don_'_t want to risk ordering more food from them after this !
negative	what was really lame was the fact that my mom booked a trip through southwest airlines and was able to change her flight plans with no fee or hassle online , i was not able to change my flight at all .
negative	lame
negative	i bought a $_000 dance pole and did not receive my item .
negative	the seller did not return any of my multiple_emails , nor did pay_pal do anything about it .
negative	i opened a dispute through pay_pal but they arent doing anything .
negative	there is nowhere to report this seller to ecrater either .
negative	it seems they do not care about their customers .
negative	i would stick to ebay because at_least you are protected .
negative	i sold two fairly old_mobiles , not to old mind only a couple of years ..
negative	i received my envelope sent them both off got a confirmation_email_saying they had received them and it wouldn_'_t be long until i get my guaranteed price !!
negative	so when i recieved an_email a few_days_later telling_me my price had been cut by £_00 because of a faulty phone i was confused .
negative	i was guaranteed the price i was offered .
negative	fair enough the phone was faulty it had a bit of water_damage i didn_'_t know about .
negative	but my whole point which i tried explaining to envirofone customer_support is that you can not go around guaranteeing prices to people when you don_'_t keep the guarantee it isn_'_t fair !!
negative	so i ended_up selling two phones for under £_00 .
negative	so i wasn_'_t the best pleased .
negative	and i have recently just found out by reading other poorly rated reviews that you are telling one customer who is complaining_about timing you say it takes 0 working days for money to go into our bank and then literally a few_days_later you are telling another customer it will be within 0 working days to go into their bank ?
negative	( there around april if you want to check ) sounds like your just saying what you want to have the last word .
negative	and if that isn_'_t enough i carried on reading found someone saying about a mark on their case after 0 years .
negative	you then responded you do not test it on marks etc .
negative	funnily enough i then carried on and another customer said the same and the only_reason she got full price was because she made a fuss .
negative	you replied that you found a 0mm hairline scratch on her case so you originally offered her less !!!
negative	are you kidding me ?
negative	have you ever heard a company contradict themselves so much .
negative	for them reasons on top of mine i '_ve changed my star from a arguably fair 0_stars to a 0_star !
negative	placed order weeks_ago and still have not received product or a return phone_call .
negative	something is seriously wrong with this company !!!!!!
negative	beware of giving them any info .
negative	i had bought a pair of glasses from global_eyeglasses a few_years_ago and it was an okay experience .
negative	then i bought another pair and the prescription was off .
negative	then i bought another pair and they took_forever to get to me .
negative	there was some kind of error and they took more than six_weeks to get to me .
negative	i will never buy from this company again .
negative	tickets purchased over a month_ago for a concert in a week and a half and still nothing .
negative	have emailed countless_times as the status of the order has not changed since the day after i bought the tickets - all i get back is an_automated reply advising that if i dont have the tickets 0 days prior to the event then i can contact the customer_services team - well this isnt good customer_service for a start - people need to take time off work , organise child care , organise transport and hotels .
negative	i read that viagogo follow_up the the sellers to progress this order - so why has this taken so long ??
negative	i know for a fact the concert issued tickets months_ago as friends who purchased these have their tickets in hand , so its hard to believe " my seller " has not yet received his or her tickets .
negative	tickets are expensive - but i dont mind paying the price if i know i '_m actually going to be attending the concert !
negative	anyone reading these reviews , thinking of placing an order - be careful and ensure if you are booking a hotel to attend a concert - make_sure its refundable .
negative	( id 0000000 )
negative	update ...... 0 days to go and still no tickets !!
negative	had an_email on the 0th_june to say they were tracking my order , but nothing since then .
negative	please let_me know where these are ?
negative	they just want to steal your money with all different excuse .
negative	i booked plane_tickets and car_rental when i want to cancel the car_rental , they
negative	told me they have to charge the cancellation_fee $_00 , i '_m ok with that ,
negative	but on top of that they said there is a service fee for the airline , come on , i '_m not cancel the airplane ticket , it says clearly on my credit_card , 0 transaction , 0 for airline , 0 for car rent .
negative	rip_off , i '_ll dispute with my credit_card company .
negative	i ordered the understanding english grammar exercises , but you sent me the textbook .
negative	pretty bad if you ask me .
negative	i had to reschedule a flight from the east_coast to portland , travelocity charged us multiple fees and issued a $_000 mco ( miscellaneous charge order ) as a credit .
negative	attempting to use the mco has_been a nightmare .
negative	i followed the directions on the letter and sent the mco coupon to them ( after calling travelocity for an address , as there '_s no address on the letter ).
negative	i mailed it on thursday - certified / overnight mail .
negative	travelocity called me saturday_morning and left a message that they had received the mco and that we had 0 days to book the flight or they would send it back and charge our credit_card $_00 . 00 .
negative	i called saturday_afternoon and after getting transferred around , disconnected , on hold forever - i spent over 0 hours + on hold and trying to get some assistance with the reservation - just to be told that the mco department was only open monday - friday and the reissue department couldn_'_t verify that they ' d received the mco so they wanted me to call back on monday .
negative	rediculous .
negative	i ordered 0 items , received 0 .
negative	money back after 0 months .
negative	and it wasn_'_t the first time .
negative	maybe they sell things that they don_'_t have .
negative	i have just purchased the hotel room 00_minutes ago from the bookit . com .
negative	after i paid it , i realized that this hotel is located in the sunset beach which is far from the myrtle_beach .
negative	i didn_'_t know about this because this website doesn_'_t mention about any other information of the hotel before paying it .
negative	i tried to cancel this purchase but they request to charge cancellation_fee , so i tried to explain about this situation to customer_service in order to wave the cancellation_fee .
negative	technically , this is not my fault because i typed myrtle_beach , sc in the destination site to seek for hotels at myrtle_beach but sunset beach hotel was pop_up among the hotels at the myrtle_beach .
negative	anyway , i explained about this to customer_service but customer care woman_who is [_name ] is very rude .
negative	she humiliates me .
negative	her attitude is bad without kindness .
negative	customer_service is supposed to help customer and provide assistance with customers for their satisfactions .
negative	however , she kept reading company '_s policy whatever i feel unfair and misunderstanding .
negative	i have been using this website but i am not gonna use this website anymore .
negative	[_external reference_] and [_external reference_] never charge cancellation_fee especially if customers want to cancel their transaction within 00_minutes .
negative	however , i have to pay $_00 . 00 cancellation_fee .
negative	it was very unacceptable experience for me .
negative	where i live is apparently a problem for fedex .
negative	the rural road does not show up on a gps , altho ups has no problem .
negative	my order was supposed to be delivered on the 00th and i didn_'_t get it until the 00th .
negative	i will give credit of 0 day due to a road closure for repair but an_alternate route could have been used .
negative	i now know to make_sure i give more than a week notice for ordering , if i order again .
negative	i talked to a woman at petflow and a rurally said i don_'_t feel_like i should pay for shipping since it was 0 days late and all she said was thank_you for shopping with petflow .
negative	i still feel_like they should take my shipping_charges off as my babies did run_out of food and won_'_t eat anything_else , so went hungry for 0 day .... never should have happened .
negative	they need to check into other shipping arrangements .
negative	i actually asked to have it shipped ups and was told they don_'_t use ups .
negative	i was also not given to a supervisor when i asked to be transferred to one .
negative	this is not my first order and have had shipping problems before
negative	thank_you

negative	i purchased 0 han solo blasters for my sons halloween_costumes .
negative	both arrived broken , one of them had a battery compartment completely installed backwards .
negative	i called to replace them .
negative	it cost over $ 0 to return them and they charged me another $ 0 to ship the new ones , even_though they sent me defective merchandise .
negative	in addition , when i called the company i asked for the customer_service manager .
negative	it turns_out the woman_who identified herself as " roxanne " on the phone is also the manager since she works out of her home and sells her products out of her garage .
negative	in spite of the fact that she is " in charge " she refused to ship the replacement products for free ( in spite of the fact that she sent me broken items ).
negative	i would never order from this company , it is a scam !!!
negative	!
negative	getting the run_around on where the package even is .
negative	they want feedback on something i haven_'_t received .
negative	which is annoying .
negative	i am usually very happy when i book a room in advance , but not this time .
negative	booking it was easy .
negative	when i got to the hotel the lady at the desk told me that my card was declined and i needed to pay .
negative	i received an_email_confirmation amd even had easy access to my online bank_statement where my money had been taken out .
negative	the lady gets on the phone and this takes 00_min for her to figure_out that it was their mistake and not mine .
negative	in the mean time , my sister in law last_minute had to book a room so she waited on me so we could be close .
negative	the lady told me i got a better rate since i booked in advance .
negative	i asked my sister in law how much her room cost and hers was $_00 cheaper and included breakfast !!!
negative	they gave_us a map of where our rooms were but it was still like a maze .
negative	it was not easy to find even w the map .
negative	i will not be returning to that hotel and i i will dang sure be checking the hotels rates by calling them comparing their prices w travelocitys .
negative	i have never had to pay $_00 more for the same room .
negative	this website does not give enough info to order the correct_part and then wants to charge me 00_% restocking_fee and i have to pay for shipping to return the part .
negative	i went to amazon and found the right part and it was cheaper since they do not charge for shipping .
negative	they need to update their servers so that it makes sure the part fits and is what you want before they sell it to you .
negative	they could use amazons website as an example .
negative	sucks when they cancel your order for no reason when you were depending_on it ........
negative	why did you cancel my lowes giftcard order ?
negative	i was counting on using them today .. no fair !
negative	:{
negative	invoice #_0000000
negative	i do not like going through reservation sites to make my hotel reservations .
negative	why ?
negative	because of all of your rules and restrictions .
negative	i am a business traveler and stay 00 - 00 nights every_month and occasionally have to change my plans .
negative	when i work directly with the hotel they are very accomodating and do not charge me change fees , etc .
negative	when i go through sites like yours , i '_m sol if i need to make a change .
negative	what really ticks me off is how deceptive your online site is .
negative	it looks like i '_m booking directly with the hotel because of the way your online address appears on the site , but it '_s all just smoke and mirrors .
negative	so your deceptive appearance completely destroys your creditibility and integrity .
negative	i just need to be more aware when i '_m making my reservations so i '_m not hoodwinked by your misleading and deceptive practices .
negative	i have also found that the online sites do not have better prices than going directly through the hotel so my question is , why go through sites likes yours , especially when you are so damn inflexible ?
negative	ugghhh !
negative	had vanuit nl via internet bij regiobloemist . be een boeket bloemen besteld voor_mijn grootmoeder in belgie .
negative	vind ten ten eerste de keuze erg weinig , en ten tweede zijn de prijzen superhoog .
negative	ik moest 00_euro betalen voor_een boeketje tulpen .
negative	terwijl ik voor datzelfde boeket hier in nl max .
negative	een tientje betaal .
negative	en dan waren ze ook_nog es na drie dagen verwelkt .
negative	schandalig gewoon .

negative	bookit is giving me the runaround about my trip .
negative	i '_m trying to book my infant a seat on the flight and they keep passing the buck .
negative	i '_m very disappointed with them .
negative	very bad company , i had 0 damaged window visor .
negative	almost one month_ago .
negative	all they do is ask me to send photo '_s repeatedly .
negative	they fail to answer any questions .
negative	i am stuck with a broken part and no refund .
negative	i am now joining others in class action law suit .
negative	do not do_business with this company .
negative	meine_mutter hat die_blumen erst gegen 0 uhr abends bekommen .
negative	die_blumen haben sehr schlimm gestunken , so sehr , dass meine_mutter die_blumen auf_den balkon stellen musste und konnte sie nicht im haus bewundern ,.

negative	my order was cancelled
negative	seriously , i answered all of your security questions …. and it still is not good enough ?
negative	i am hearing impaired and you want me to call ?
negative	disgusting …. i will take my money elsewhere .
negative	i booked a hotel in an unpopulated suberb .
negative	our event was canceled suddenly at 0pm on the day of check in .
negative	i immediately tried to cancel the hotel .
negative	it was only then that i realized that my credit_card had already been charge the full_amount .
negative	and the customer_service people laughed at me when i asked for a refund !
negative	they kept saying this is what i agreed too ....... no it isn_'_t what i agreed too .
negative	will never do_business with these people again .
negative	i specifically told the guy that i only wanted to book one night and that i could not afford two_nights and that i didn_'_t want to book at all if i had to buy 0 nights .
negative	he tricked me into reserving 0 nights and ran my card and everything ...
negative	he told me i could cancel the second night in the future .
negative	...
negative	i still have to pay upfront both nights dude !!
negative	$_000 that i did not have on my card and now i will likely overdraft !!
negative	he transferred me to another person to cancel and that person said they had no records of my booking .
negative	it took calling the actual hotel and calling reservation_counter back and being transferred several_times to get the cancellation .
negative	i am so incredibly frustrated and will never use reservation_counter or any other third_party again !!
negative	!
negative	the costume i ordered looked very nice on - line but when i received it - it was not the same as in the picture .
negative	the colors were not even close to the same ... the fit was poor .
negative	the material was cheap and the design was poor .
negative	the closures in the back were so poorly designed that the costume just hung on your frame and kept falling_off my shoulders .
negative	i am sending it back .
negative	i hope i don_'_t have any_problems with the company in returning it !
negative	i was told that i will receive the card before christmas and days latter i was told it will come until after christmas not acceptable !!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a part , was sent the wrong one .
negative	no one will pick_up the phone .
negative	it states to not return an item without an_rma_number well where the hell can i get that ?
negative	if no one answers the phone , or responds to customer_service requests !!!!
negative	waited to gather the money for the part , just to get stuck in this mess !!!
negative	will never ever order from them again !!!!!
negative	now stuck with a part that doesn_'_t work , $_000_dollars down the drain ....
negative	this site is great to look at but don_'_t try to buy anything other then accessories there because they will screw up and then will not correct there mistakes wasted time and patience hated it
negative	i ordered medication and advised i wanted the 0 day shipping at the higher_rate .
negative	i contacted my vet to let them know of the upcoming prescription .
negative	the saturday after the order was placed i asked my vet if they had received a prescription for my dog ( three_days after i had placed the order ) and was told there was no prescription faxed to them .
negative	had to wait_until monday to be able to contact a person at vetrx .
negative	the rep said that they had faxed the prescription to my vet and then did so again the next_day without_any response .
negative	i was upset since i had already been told no prescription was received and the vet had been receiving faxes with no problem .
negative	i asked the cs_rep why they did not contact the vet by some other means ( like a phone_call ) since i had paid_extra to get the rx faster .
negative	they said they would try and contact vet to find out what was going wrong after they faxed again a third time .. needless to say my prescription was not received until a week_later and i was charged the extra 00 . 00 to get it in two_days .
negative	good customer_service i would think is that if there was no response or the company doesn_'_t get a confirmation that the fax was received would be to contact the dr . directly to fast track the rx ... but no such thing occurred .
negative	i will not be ordering meds from this company anymore , their prices may be good but i have used another pet rx company in the past and when i do the 0 day shipping i receive it in two_days .
negative	the prescription i ordered from vet_rx twice - both delayed and took longer to get to my door .
negative	they can make the sale due to prices but you need to make_sure to contact both the vet and the rx company to make_sure your order is being placed - too much to do in other areas in life to babysit a online rx company to make_sure my dog gets her meds .
negative	ordered a nice watch but it doesn_'_t work .... real disappointed for the price was nice but it is junk you get what you pay for i guess ....
negative	i bought my cat hypoallergenic canned_cat_food since the vet says he has irritable bowel syndrome and has lost more than 00_% of his weight .
negative	so we are desperate and i thought we would try this food at more than $ 0 a can .
negative	website good .
negative	arrived quickly .
negative	box in perfect_shape and packed with air_bubbles .
negative	yet 0 cans were dented and leaked food over some more cans .
negative	must have left company in bad shape .
negative	where is your quality control ?
negative	i was hoping to form a long_term relationship and never have to shop for bulky cat items again .
negative	i am a working mom with 0 small kids and 0 cats and have trouble fitting cat stuff in my cart and be able to push the weight .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	:(
negative	the email_confirmation date is different then one i booked .
negative	i tried to change it and was told there is a fee of $_000_per_ticket .
negative	this is less_than 00_hours after i booked .
negative	my husband is under several doctors care and i would not have made that date - he simple can '_t travel then ?
negative	i am disputing the charges with the credit_card company since they will not help me .
negative	the workers were very nice very helpful i found a sofa and love seat i wanted and also bought some end tables and kitchen table .
negative	i was told that i can get same day delivery which i said ok but i wanted a brand_new couch not the floor set the worker told me he had one in the back .
negative	as they delivered the couch set i noticed rips and marks and scratches and told the delivery people they told me to call american_freight .
negative	i went the next_day and noticed the floor set was gone so they basically lied to me and sold me the set damaged at full price .
negative	i now have to wait 0 - 0_weeks for a brand_new set and i '_m very upset to even use the furniture they gave_me till the replacement comes .
negative	who_wants furniture that everybody has sat on tried and tested it .
negative	not me !
negative	i will never shop_here again .
negative	instead of telling_me it wasn_'_t in stock ( which i would of gladly waited for it ) they lied just to make a sale to reach their numbers for the day !
negative	i was looking for a clutch_kit .
negative	i clicked on clutch_kit and ordered .
negative	however , i received only the pressure plate .
negative	i contacted customer_service who said the additional kit was 000_dollars more .
negative	i already spent 00 .
negative	yet their other clutch kits were under a 000 .
negative	deceptive marketing .
negative	will never use them again .
negative	i went to the government site to sign_up for health_care , did the application and was told what the tax credit would be .
negative	i chose to go through e_- health , thinking i was following directions to get the best price including the tax credits .
negative	instead , i signed_up , got the insurance , then found out the next_day that the tax credits do not apply by going through e_- health .
negative	typical of what i '_ve grown to reluctantly accept in dealing_with insurance companies and now there is a new layer of deceipt by having on - line sales groups who are just being given commissions for catching unsuspecting traffic .
negative	i was very upset after flying from knoxville , tn to daytona beach to be informed the two bedroom_condo with in room jacuzzi tub that i had booked had been given to someone_else .
negative	i was told by email at 0 pm .
negative	the agent at book it told me she had arranged a one bedroom at wyndham .
negative	when arriving at wyndham it took the agent an_hour to check us in .
negative	then at 00_pm when arriving at our room our key didn_'_t work .
negative	next the room was 00_degrees and they sent a technician to fix that .
negative	this is not what i had in mind when i booked an ocean front two bedroom_condo at the beach .
negative	love the shoes i got
negative	except for the holes , not being true to size , sequins falling_off , and a whole heel being on a slant ..
negative	will never buy from this site again .
negative	the person with whom i was connected barely spoke_english i had to repeat numbers to him multiple_times and then didn_'_t send me my confirmation .... cancelling was almost as bad but at_least i got my confirmation ... i will never book with them again .
negative	couldnt wait any longer so advised welford rd customer_services that i wanted to cancel .
negative	didnt feel igot a good response and now i have to go into the store to get my refund ... surely you are able to do refunds over the phone !
negative	!
negative	paid 0 times the face value of the ticket .
negative	tickets available near the date in viagogo at a reasonable price .
negative	despicable .
negative	within one order the toilet system was sent with the flush piece which didn_'_t fit the hole and likewise with the sink , we have now found that the waste unit is not compatible with the unit either .
negative	both items we brought on the recommendation of the ' essential extras ' that you are advised to buy !
negative	i am gutted as just spent a lot more money with them on main bathroom , wish i had spent it elsewhere where the customer_service in product knowledge is better .
negative	i suppose that '_s what you get with cheap !
negative	i ordered vanities months_ago , and was sent incomplete products , damaged products , and the wrong products , again and again .
negative	several_months later and i am left with items i did not order and poor customer_service to correct the issue .
negative	i still have not received the correct items or an undamaged product .
negative	very disappointed in this company '_s lack of response , and i am out a lot of cash left with crap !!
negative	!
negative	still_waiting on my items / refund that i ordered last month and paid next_day delivery for !
negative	not happy !
negative	i will never use travelocity again .
negative	when needing to made a change to my flights , i spent over an_hour with a rude , ill informed travelocity customer_support rep getting the runaround and ultimately having them tell me they couldn_'_t access my record anyway .
negative	and with their call_center in india the rep was very difficult to understand .
negative	after wasting all this time they then just transferred me directly to the airline .
negative	it was a fiasco .
negative	at_least i learned how wonderful jet_blue is , how helpful and friendly there call_center staff are and that based in salt_lake city there staff speak_english !
negative	will never ever bookk through_travelocity .
negative	it is just a horrendous mess if you need to speak with a live_person
negative	i ordered a sofa what i was really excited about , got an order confirmation and then waited for delivery , longer_than they indicated , and finally called them to find out what was going on .
negative	the woman on the phone acted strange , like she knew something she wasn_'_t allow to tell .
negative	she said nothing about the company not having contacted me about the delay in shipping .
negative	i felt as if i had entered a private conversation that wasn_'_t any of my business .
negative	she told me , with no care or transparency , that she would have to call me back .
negative	when she did , she said that , because of the storm sandy , the manufacturer '_s inventory was ruined and that i wouldn_'_t be able to get this sofa .
negative	i feel horrible for the victims of sandy -- it was a tragic thing that happened -- but the tone of the woman_who spoke to me was equally horrible .
negative	she had no care or concern , no interest in offering me another option .
negative	she was cold as ice .
negative	i kept thinking while she was speak to me what the owner of the company would be thinking if he had heard how she was with me .
negative	she wouldn_'_t have had her job another day .
negative	at_least , that '_s how i would have reacted .
negative	and this poor customer_service , this completely insensitive treatment just goes on and on .
negative	i will never visit futonland '_s website again .
negative	my credit_card was charged for a shoe i ordered and after 0_weeks , i got a email_saying i was refunded because the manufacturer couldn_'_t do my shoe :(
negative	i bought a pc from ginger0 nine months_ago .
negative	it was advertised as an ' extreme games pc ' , however whenever you played a game it crashed after around 0 - 00_mins .
negative	i immediately sent a return request as the pc as it came with a years warranty .
negative	it took 0_weeks for them to collect it and they then had the pc for 0_weeks , after many phonecalls they eventually said they had fixed it saying they had changed the graphics cards and there was a £_00_pound charge .
negative	i payed happy that they had found the problem .
negative	but on its return it was exactly the same .
negative	i contacted ginger0 again and asked for a refund as it was not fit for purpose .
negative	they refused to give a refund and only said they would repair the pc .
negative	reluctantly i returned it again , this time it was swiftly collected but again they held onto they pc for around 0_weeks .
negative	they contacted me saying it was the power_supply , again there was going to be a charge , which i obviously refused to pay and the eventually returned it .
negative	the damn thing wasn_'_t fixed at all though , and i was infuriated .
negative	i contacted ginger0 asking for a refund again but was denied .
negative	i sent a letter to the managing_director again asking for a refund and enclosing the sale of goods act .
negative	no response .
negative	this purchase from ginger0 has proved to be the most frustrating and unpleasant experience dragging out for months and causing lots of stress and dissapointment as it was a large sum to right off just over_£_000 .
negative	i gave up with ginger0 and would never use them again , and would recommend all to steer_clear of this company .
negative	cougar extreme of nottingham diagnosed the faulty processor in 0 days and at last it was reapired at a cost of £_000
negative	devastated .
negative	beware
negative	i live in jersey , channel_islands , gb & was about to place an order for oska clothing until i confirmed that p_& p would cost £_00 (£ 00 to guernsey !)
negative	and they don_'_t even take the vat off !
negative	!
negative	postage is no no more to jersey than it is to london .
negative	i swiftly cancelled the order .
negative	customer_services lady confirmed this was the case .
negative	channel island residents beware !
negative	beware , they can cancel orders at will and leave you in the dark .
negative	i placed some orders with an advertised coupon and kept getting cancelled .
negative	they gave excuses of invalid phone_number but i suspect the real reason was because prices were too low after coupon .
negative	and since when do merchants have to call customers in order to process an order with credit_card ?
negative	i had to email to find out status of my orders only to meet awful customer_service which doesn_'_t show any interest in getting your orders .
negative	they lied about emailing me asking for permission to cancel and insinuate me of credit_card fraud .
negative	their mall store is just as bad , making me fight for a legit return with receipt that was bought 0 mins prior .
negative	i will never buy or recommend anyone of perfume emporium .
negative	i ordered a gift_card for grandson '_s birthday on nov . 00 .
negative	it is now december 00 and it still_hasn_'_t arrived .
negative	i have talked to company twice and was assured it would be here by the 00th .
negative	if not here in mail december 00 will be calling my credit_card company .
negative	will not do this again
negative	i ordered this phone nearly a month_ago and as i was having issues with my bank_account my husband ordered one as well in case my bank_account didn_'_t allow the purchase as we could always send one back .
negative	i needed the phone immediately as mine wasn_'_t working so i selected the ups_ground and ups 0 day for the other one .
negative	after a couple days i called and asked why i hadn_'_t recieved one of my phones yet and why i hadn_'_t been provided with a tracking_number .
negative	i was then told that it had shipped and i should see it in 0 to 0 days .
negative	needless to say that didn_'_t happen .
negative	then i was told that there was only one tracking_number .
negative	i didn_'_t think it was possible but was told that yes in fact they were shipped together even_though i had been told two_days prior that my order had already shipped though my husbands hadn_'_t .
negative	how does that work ?
negative	to cut the story short we were told we would be refunded our shipping money and still_haven_'_t seen a dime .
negative	i got one phone a month later , and now am apparently supposed to be getting another one soon .
negative	ya right !
negative	anyways please don_'_t waste your time with this place !!!
negative	it '_s a horrible company that will take your time , money and will ruin your whole day !
negative	please stay away from it !!
negative	!
negative	there was an_error made regarding the date of my departure and i was still charged 00 . 00 , even_though i did not make the mistake .
negative	i was penalized for someone_else '_s mistake .
negative	you sent broken stuff and replaced it with broken stuff ... if the stuff is broken throw it away don_'_t steal my money and send it to me to throw_away
negative	i used them to refer me to a close hotel they lied to me about the distance and when i called back after i booked no one wanted to help me and they accused me of lying and offered me $_00 off my next book never ever booking with them again !
negative	!
negative	i purchased a game which failed to download the first six times i tried .
negative	once the file was on my computer , it failed to open .
negative	i used all of their online customer_support suggestions and after literal hours and hours of trying , it still is reading as an_error_message .
negative	i '_m very familiar with computers and know that my computer is compatible with the software .
negative	i contacted the company , to no_avail .
negative	i also researched a phone_number ( which was extremely hard to comeby ) and left a message , also to no_avail .
negative	i stated that i either wanted help or a refund ( either would be acceptable , preferably a refund at this point ).
negative	i am beyond disappointed and plan on contacting bbb as soon as i can .
negative	i find it highly unacceptable to have such a low level of service .
negative	i consider it fraud and plan on taking full action .
negative	i do not suggest using them to anyone .
negative	i was very disappointed upon_opening my package from petflow . com .
negative	my 00_lb_bag of cat_food was busted wide open within the box and there was cat_food in e v e r y t h i n g !
negative	they also screwed_up my order of bully_sticks .
negative	overall , very dissatisfied .
negative	i don_'_t recommend at all .
negative	i can get better prices from other website and better service .
negative	all seemed ok at first .
negative	envelope arrived quickly .
negative	after sending phones off , cheque took over a week to arrive .
negative	when it did it was made payable to a samsung phone and not me !!
negative	when i called to complain the adviser said i would have to wait another seven working days for another cheque , unacceptable as it was envirofones error .
negative	i '_m not happy and will never use this company again .
negative	why do you offer it on the website then ?
negative	i bet i won_'_t get a response .....
negative	i will never book on line again .
negative	i was told three_times after three specific questions , " are you positive my card won_'_t be charged until check in ".
negative	answer , oh absolutely not , it will be charged at the time of your check in .
negative	turns_out they were processing the full_amount as we spoke !
negative	now i have to wait five to six business days for it to show in my account !
negative	i have opened a fraud investigation at our bank against them ... this is legalized robbery and consumers should have more control than we do .
negative	so i will exercise the only control i have ... i will never use this service or one like them again !
negative	i hope they are put out of business .
negative	never use these people .
negative	their customer_service is horrible .
negative	they started working
negative	feb . 00 , 0000 .
negative	it is now mar .
negative	00 , 0000 and i still have squirrels .
negative	can '_t get a scheduled
negative	appointment .
negative	you don_'_t want to deal with these people .
negative	they got their money , that '_s all they care about .
negative	i made reservations at a hotel three_months ahead and three_weeks before my trip i need to make it a two night instead of three_nights .
negative	called and they left my on hold twice for 00_mins until i hung_up .
negative	after calling again three more times and getting put on hold again for 00_mins again i hung_up .
negative	finally i just asked the person to please help me and all they could do is redo my whole reservations and charge me the going rate for that day ..... unbelievable that all that needed to be done was make it a two night instead of three .
negative	lost my great deal and two buffets and i had no other choice hate them they can '_t even speak_english ...
negative	awful service , poor customer_service .
negative	deeply dissatisfied .
negative	felt_like i was being scammed and apparently the credit manager thought i wouldn_'_t catch the scam .
negative	i am a law enforcement officer and worked in a law office for 00 years , so i know a scam when i see one !
negative	the rate offered for the hotel i booked was reasonable but the space where you fill in the " promo_code " was hidden on the side in faint green type and when i clicked on the " continue " i assumed it would ask for a " code " at that point and i would be able to redeem the discount .
negative	unfortunately , it just went_ahead and charged my credit_card without giving me that option .
negative	i called to try to add the discount to my reservation and was offered no help whatsoever ... even by the supervisor who would not give me the time of day .
negative	this is a shady business .
negative	i do not recommend it and i will never book a trip through this website again !
negative	take me off your email list .
negative	when i called to get some information , the customer_service rep was very rude and unhelpful .
negative	i inquired_about a flight to newark and he quoted me $_000 .
negative	i told him repeatedly that i was unable to see the same flights on my computer and when i asked him if he could tell me the flights that were departing in the morning after 0 : 00 am , he rudely told me that there was too many and that i would need to look at them online .
negative	i kept telling him that i was not seeing any flights at $_000 , the only_thing he kept saying is to refresh the screen .
negative	he finally told me that he could not help me .
negative	their website is misleading .
negative	i was mislead into accepting a counter offer , which was not good at all .
negative	a lot of hotel chain have their own website , you can get discount , points for future stay and know exactly which hotel before you book and you avoid the risk of getting a queen rather_than two double_bed .
negative	being a family of 0 - 0 , i will book from hotel '_s own website
negative	hi -
negative	i have to say that while the website was great to use aunt jean called today from wales to say she got 0 flowers and a spring of pine - and it was a ripoff - so please don_'_t send any more .
negative	not sure what to say to that , but thought i should pass the message along .
negative	i wasted way toooo much time trying to order from here .
negative	i was sent a refer a friend coupon for $_00 off any order , then also given a free_shipping code on facebook .
negative	i tried to order online and it kept saying the $_00 was applied to my order but it never took it off .
negative	i called thinking maybe i could not use both coupons .
negative	they said i could so i gave all my order info and payment info and then , after they wasted more of my time said i had to have a $_00 order to use the $_00 even_though the email did not say that .
negative	i told them to cancel my order and have a manager call me .
negative	a manager never contacted me .
negative	now i am being asked how i like the specific things i ordered .
negative	i have not gotten anything .
negative	they are very confused .
negative	they need better communication and better training of their employees .
negative	i bought food on the 00th and they promised me delivery on the 0st of march , that didn_'_t happen , it came late on the 0th of march , organix was on sale so i bought 0 bags and then they triple charged me for the purchase .
negative	customer servixe dahnel was rude and didn_'_t apoligize for their mistake , and told me to return it .
negative	now i no_longer trust internet shopping .
negative	i will not be using your website again .
negative	many mistakes along the way .
negative	people were double_charged , credits were given to the wrong people and customer_service would not do anything to take_care of it and make costumer happy .
negative	description sucks on products .. so do the pictures .. i did not get the part i wanted .. and i want my money back . im buyin a better grill from a better place .. they will get my business not you any longer . so send me a return_label , i '_ll send u this piece of junk and u can refund me my money .. if yhats a problem .. i '_ll find the person runnin this shindig and take_care of it myself . im very disappointed
negative	i ordered this for next_day delivery - it took 0 days to arrive !
negative	when i emailed to complain i was told that all the details were clearly shown on their website i . e .
negative	what days over christmas they were open - i did '_t see it anywhere and checked several_times .
negative	they didn_'_t answer my questions and got told that they didn_'_t see this ' going anywhere '.
negative	really appaling service , i would not recommend !
negative	i bought a cricket ball for my nephew '_s birthday and was really disappointed when it arrived .
negative	firstly , it shouldn_'_t have been delivered to my house as i asked for it to get sent straight to my nephew '_s address so it would arrive in time for his_birthday .
negative	secondly , the product looked nothing like the photo - a poor quality , cheap looking ball arrived in nasty plastic packaging , that i would feel embarrassed to give .
negative	thirdly , the team i dealt_with at millet_sports were unhelpful and unconstructive in resolving my issue .
negative	i initially asked for the p_& p back as it was sent to an incorrect_address .
negative	when millet repeatedly ignored this request , i was successful in getting a full_refund for the item ( as well as p_& p ) through ebay .
negative	they thought by just ignoring me i would go away - wrong !
negative	avoid using millet_sports !
negative	!
negative	i could have gotten the same product at the same price elsewhere the delivery is soooo slow .
negative	the reason i purchased through you was i had a $ 0 voucher to use .
negative	other web ( vitacost . com ) shipped the next_day and arrived a day later .
negative	i was pleased with my order and the delivery , i am not pleased that my debit_card number is now compromised and someone_else is using it to order more parts .
negative	beware !
negative	i was very disappointed with bookbyte .
negative	i have tried many other rental sites for textbooks and this one was by_far the worst .
negative	first of all i was taking a month long summer class , and well i wanted to pay the lowest cost for my book .
negative	i thought i could get away with just renting for 00days but then i started to worry maybe that wouldn_'_t be long enough .
negative	in my gut i knew i couldn_'_t get away with only renting for 00days , so i decided on the 00 day rental , just to be safe .
negative	i am more than happy with my decision to get the extended rental , as it took nearly two_weeks just to ship , and get to me .
negative	and while the book was being shipped the 00 rental days started to dwindle .
negative	by the time i received the book i had about 00 days of my course left and 00 days of my rental left .
negative	i am disappointed as i ordered the book before my class started , and received it halfway_through .
negative	i have returned the book and i am a little_nervous that since they started the rental day when they shipped the book , that they will not have counted to book as returned until they get it .
negative	this company was unreliable and just_plain slow .
negative	i will never rent a book from this site again , and will warn my friends about renting from this site .
negative	worst service ever , took money out of my bank_account immediately .
negative	it has_been 0 days and my order was never processed and no one got back to me .
negative	had a customer_service rep email me with the wrong info , and then they never got back to me when i emailed them again .
negative	ordered prda glasses .
negative	they came in completley unadjusted and i don_'_t_believe they would have fit anyone .
negative	i returned them and eventually received a partial_refund .
negative	i have since sent three email requests asking why i did not receive a full_refund and have received absolutely no response in 0_weeks .
negative	i will never order from this company again .
negative	i was horrified when i opened box to discover the wc unit i bought was damaged in 0 places . in my mind it had been thrown about .
negative	i had no choice but to use cabinet as customer couldn_'_t wait for replacment very disappointed . plus i will put pictures of damage on their website
negative	will not use these people again
negative	well i can_honestly say the attendant was eager help .
negative	although difficult to understand , there was defiantly a language_barrier that was very problematic .
negative	i thought i was speaking directly to a mariott reservationist which he did not make clear .
negative	when i asked about using my points his response was ," i don_'_t have access to that information ".
negative	we continued and the reservation was made for two rooms .
negative	after we hung_up and i looked at the email_confirmations , i saw he had made the reservation for the wrong dates .
negative	when i called the number on my mariotts rewards card , it all became clear i had spoken to a third_party vendor to make my reservations .
negative	i subsequently cancelled the wrong reservations and now notice two $ 0 . 00 cancelation fees .
negative	i am very disappointed that you didn_'_t try to find out why your product did ' nt fit electrically . was it the wrong model number ?
negative	was my 00 still using a different years part ?, maybe a 00 '_s .
negative	i '_m without the part and $_00 . 00 return fees .
negative	i bought vouchers and pcsupply refuse to exchange my vouchers for a nonrestricted vouchers they are rude and have poor poor lousy costumer support i have been buying vouchers for months and they treated me like crap they did not want to help me out in anyway .
negative	they are a total ripoff beware
negative	i have definitely learned my lesson i will not and i would not ever purchase anything from american_freight furniture .
negative	i found out that if american_freight offers any deals or special rates don_'_t bother wasting your time and money with this company because you can pay them all the money get what you purchased two or three_months down the line .
negative	mind you they never once tell you their furniture takes so long to be ordered or delivered .
negative	they are { very quick } to take your money , but to bring your furniture to you they are as slow as molasses .
negative	unapologetic their customer_service suck big time .
negative	the furniture that i bought was not what i ordered but , because it took months just to get it i didn_'_t even_bother calling to dispute it .
negative	i just know that my hard_earned money will go to a company that cares_about the interest of their customers .
negative	i will never go cheap again !!
negative	rooms to go here i come .
negative	terrible service and terrible product .
negative	i ordered yesterday for a balloon bouquet to be delivered for today - my granddaughter '_s third birthday .
negative	i was on the phone with them three_times before they finally delivered .
negative	they didn_'_t have anything right but did finally deliver a half_hour past the deadline .
negative	she was supposed to have three mylar balloons and six regular balloons in various colors .
negative	what she received was two second rate mylars and three regular - two red and a pink .
negative	very unattractive and not nearly what i ordered .
negative	when i called to complain i waited for ten_minutes and then was cut_off with a bogus busy message .
negative	email : nanone0 @ msn . com
negative	park n ' fly may be more_expensive but the do the job right .
negative	i had a trip planned , but could not go because i was ill . travelocity would not reimburse_me for my trip .
negative	i called the hotel and learned that i should have just dealt_with them directly instead of going through a third - party like travelocity .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	the hotel would not have charged me for cancelling .
negative	i was guaranteed of my flights and an_hour before the first flight was to take off i get a email from you stating the flight was delayed for 0 0 / 0 hour .
negative	i got to the airport 00_minutes early and no one was at the ticket counter .
negative	after a few_minutes a guy showed_up , took a few_minutes to log in the computer and then stated i could get a boarding_pass but i could not take a bag .
negative	i told him i had no carry - on that everything was in that bag .
negative	i told him i couldn_'_t go with out my bag and he walked away thru a door .
negative	i called my husband freaking and then called american airline and as i was on the line with them the man returned and said he got me on .
negative	i literally had to run thru the airport , but i got on .
negative	i had 00 minute lay over in chicago , we landed on time but then took 00_minutes to taxi to the gate .
negative	i had to get a boarding_pass in chicago so i run to get it , they give it to me , i went to the restroom and came back and i looked at the sign near the gate and it said boarding and then departing .
negative	i go up to the counter to see what is going on ( with 0 others that just arrived ) and they went to see if we could get on , as we were waiting we watch the airplane leave .
negative	when i was given the boarding_pass they never told me they were boarding then .
negative	so i had a wait 0 0 / 0 hours for another .
negative	i finally get to my final_destination and ask about my bag and was told that it would be locked in a secure place and to check with security .
negative	i went to baggage_claim and see my bag just sitting there with no one around .
negative	had it not been that i was going to a funeral i would have cancelled when you first changed the flight .
negative	i will only book thru an airline in the future .... not with you or american airline .
negative	so i booked two tickets to key_west for a wedding from cheapoair thinking i received a great deal .
negative	i did pay $_000 r / t which was pretty_decent .
negative	so the night before i printed my itinerary and was ready to go !
negative	next_day headed to airport to find an empty line .
negative	i knew something was wrong .
negative	apparently our flight had been cancelled a month_ago and the flight we were supposed to take left already .
negative	annoyed ... i called cheapoair customer_service only to end up waiting 00_minutes to speak to a person_who barely spoke_english and did not want to take_responsibility .
negative	between the airline and cheapoair , they both were pointing fingers at each other .
negative	my itinerary never changed or was updated from cheapoair and i was forced to leave the next_day missing out on time and money spent down in florida !
negative	and then on the way home we weren_'_t even guaranteed seats !!!
negative	it was so pathetic i ' d_rather pay the extra $_00 for some decent customer_service and a guaranteed flight .
negative	well they promise next_day delivery .
negative	0_weeks_later and im still_waiting for my parcel to be deliveried !!
negative	they dont tell me there is a delay until i chase it with them and then they just say they are doing everything they can to get it moving but dont explain_why it is delayed and give no follow_up help .
negative	bit of a nightmare from the start .
negative	the website states the delivery times but these are totally fictitious .
negative	i ordered samples of the material to check the colour first .
negative	after 0 month they hadn_'_t arrived , i emailed , the site says they will reply to emails in 00_hours , i waited weeks !
negative	they eventually got to me after 0 months .
negative	i then ordered the dresses and got an_email_saying that they saw i had ordered fabric samples and that before they would send the dresses i had to acknowledge that the colours may not be the same as the samples i paid for !
negative	!
negative	one dress was custom made , they emailed me to remeasure hollow to floor , we did and increased the size .
negative	when it arrived they sent the original size , not the increased one we had agreed on email .
negative	after about 0_weeks i emailed and said that i needed them for my wedding in april .
negative	they said they would get them there .
negative	they didn_'_t .
negative	they arrived 00th_april , i got married the week before so had a rediculous rush to find new dresses .
negative	:-( they arrived with a customs charge of £_00 .
negative	the dresses were of a decent quality , the neckline was not exactly the same as on the picture on the site .
negative	i know from my previous experience of trying to communicate with didobridal that complaining will get me nowhere so i am chopping it up to experience .
negative	placed an order online in early dec with expedited_shipping for christmas .
negative	no show on 00 / 00 so i called customer_service - no one available ... left a message - no return call .
negative	called 00 / 00 - same , no return call .
negative	called 00 / 00 and 00 / 00 - same .
negative	sent emails and no reply until i cancelled my order .
negative	why is it only after i cancel someone responds .
negative	run , don_'_t buy .
negative	on booking with these people we took out the insurance then when we took back the car the rental place charged us again
negative	on returning we were told nothing could be done its in the fine_print
negative	why cant the 0 companies talk ie tell avis we had already paid
negative	will not use again
negative	seriously will never ever use this company again !
negative	they ripped me off about $_00 !
negative	they were supposed to refund me money for a textbook i never received .
negative	i went through alot hussle and bussel to get that refund !
negative	along with that , paypal had no history of me making a purchase but it was charged on my card !!!!
negative	after a while , i finally got a hold of a real_person and they said they would refund and apologized .
negative	guess what ?!
negative	never received the refund !
negative	worst .
negative	company .
negative	ever .
negative	like others here i wish i had dug a little deeper before placing an order with optics_fast .
negative	check out better business_bureau for all the major complaints .
negative	my story goes like this :
negative	placed order may 00th .
negative	problem0 : i received contradictory emails from becky_s that my glasses had been received and sent to lab on three different dates ( so first few_times was probably a lie to get_rid of me ).
negative	on june_00th i wrote " this is the second time you have said that the glasses just arrived and the third time you have said that they are going to the lab , so i believe this to be untrue " she replied " when were you told that ?
negative	they just came in and we already started working on the lens ".
negative	i sent then copy and paste '_s of the emails she sent , she replied " not sure whee these dates came from , but i will give you a discount " * spelling mistake was in the original email from becky_s
negative	problem 0 : on june_00th i received the following from becky_s " the lab needs to redo the lenses and they cracked the initial lens .
negative	i will have them redo it and of course you will get a discount .".
negative	so i tried to cancel my order which then came the reply " we can cancel but there would be a 00_% cancelation_fee as we began the work .
negative	i will make it beneficial to you "
negative	problem 0 : june_00th they withdrew the funds from my bank_account .
negative	they telephoned and told me they have the glasses in front of them , they will refund me my express services i had paid and they will discount me $_00 +.
negative	they will send them off to be packed and shipped .
negative	problem 0 : july_00th still no tracking_number for my shipment , over 00 emails sent between 00th - 00th trying to get an answer when will i be refunded and when will my glasses ship .
negative	problem 0 : july_00th received glasses .
negative	prescription is incorrect so i take the new glasses to an opticians , they read the lenses with a special machine ( probably a lenometer ) and confirm the prescription in the right lens is totally off ( they are 000 instead of 00 ).
negative	i write to becky_s with info and scan of document from opticians and i get the reply " all prescriptions are final sale ."
negative	and " i just confimred your uv and anti scratch because the technician did the rx and lens " .
negative	when asked what becky_s has to say to the pdf i sent she replies " that is not the proof , what needs to be done is a lenometer reading .
negative	so now you are singing a different tune ?"
negative	problem 0 : the lenses also do not have the following i have paid for :
negative	scratch_resistant coating
negative	ultraviolet protection ( uv )
negative	anti_- reflective_coating .
negative	problem 0 : when i asked what they would need from me in the form of a respected optician looking at the glasses and verifying what they do and do not have , i received this answer " there is no such thing as a official inspection , but your own eyes ".
negative	now becky_s asks me to return the glasses to them .
negative	no chance .
negative	if other reviews are true then i would never get them back .
negative	so i '_m still fighting for a refund and will_continue to do so .
negative	we made a purchase a couple of weeks prior to this one and were charged an $ 0 . 00_dollar extra_charge and this time again .
negative	we are very unhappy with the slow process and after_spending over $_000 . 00 dollars you still charge two seporate charges of a $ 0 . 00 totaling $ 0 . 00 and now our package is a week late before shipping .
negative	i don_'_t understand the delay because the money was removed the day of purchase and now we have to wait and wait .
negative	please forward our order at once .
negative	i ordered a $_000_+ in vitamins promised by fiday and received nothing yet very poor service i want 00_%_off if you want my business
negative	i ordered a card , paid_extra to get it sent overnight .
negative	0 days_later , not only was the card not where it was supposed to be , it hadnt even been manufactured yet .
negative	then , i called to cancel it , but at 0pm on a friday_afternoon , there was no one availble in that department to cancel the order .
negative	finally got an_email that it was cancelled tuesday the next week .
negative	however the card then arrived at the destination on friday of that week - a full 0 week after i had cancelled it and 0_weeks after i had ordered it shipped overnight .
negative	right hand and left hand seem to now know what is going on .
negative	dont_waste your time or money if you have a quick need .
negative	go to your local_grocery_store and buy it in person and ship via_fedex - easier , cheaper , quicker
negative	i ordered 0 giftcards last_week and paid_extra to have it here before christmas but it '_s not here !
negative	i never received tracking so i have no way of knowing if it shipped or not !
negative	terrible !
negative	i will never use travelocity again .
negative	this is the second time you have not issued me a refund .
negative	when i booked the hotel through your site , their was no cancellation_fee with 00_hrs notice .
negative	when i called due to a personal matter trying to cancel my reservation , they stated i would lose all my money .
negative	when i got the request to review how i liked my order , i thought it meant that the order should have arrived .
negative	wrong !
negative	it wouldn_'_t even ship out until over a week_later , and take even longer to arrive .
negative	please - i don_'_t need more confusion in my life !
negative	my experince is very bad i need to return parts and i have no help from anyone from the company .
negative	to return my parts will cost me $_000 .
negative	00 they supply me with no return_label , no recipt of my purchase nothing at all .
negative	this was one of the worst experince ever now i have the incorrect parts and i dont_know how to get my money back or the correct parts .
negative	i placed my order on 00 / 0 / 0000 .
negative	never received the products nor a refund . on jan 0 0000 i was told i i wolud receive my refund in 0 - 00 days .
negative	guess what , no refund !!!
negative	on the 00th i was hung_up on .
negative	on the 00r i was told the web_site was down , so what where is my refund .
negative	this company is a fraud !!!
negative	don_'_t order from them .
negative	you will lose !!
negative	!
negative	first they sold me a purse that was out of stock .
negative	wrote offered a measely 00_%_off another one i called then several_times rejecting this offer saying i wanted to get another purse that was 0 . 00 dollars more no responce in about 0_weeks finly i emaled them because i kept getting answering machines and no call backs no response to my email then a while later i recieve a email notice my order has_been shiped no response befor that say ing were sorry for what happned we are sending your choice just the insulting heres you order highly inapropreat way to treat a repeat_customer beware shopping here
negative	i reserved my room through_expedia and they gave_me the wrong hotel in the wrong location .
negative	i tried to change my room through customer_service and they gave_us the run_around for two hours .
negative	i was told that customer_service higher personal will call me back in 00_hrs , it has_been over 0 hrs and nothing .
negative	do not book from them !!
negative	!
negative	i just signed_up with identity_guard and immediately received a notification stating that i had to speak with customer_service before i could continue .... i have now been " staying on the line " for over 00_minutes and have yet to hear an actual_person .
negative	this is not professional customer_service !!
negative	!
negative	we booked 0 tickets as a surprise for my son to see biffy clyro on 00 / 00 / 00 back in january id :_0000000 .
negative	we were under the impression that we had etickets and they would be emailed to us .
negative	however , we ' d had no correspondence so i contacted viagogo yesterday and they mailed back to say they couldn_'_t get hold of the seller so would we accept alternative tickets , different block , different row .
negative	id :_0000000 being quite easy going we accepted this , but then got the confirmation_email_saying that we had to pick the tickets up from your manchester office between 00pm and 0 . 00pm on the same day .
negative	i kept emailing back telling them this was not possible for us as we live nowhere_near manchester and both myself and my husband are in work that day , but we keep getting the reply that we have to collect them .
negative	viagogo could not supply our original order , without letting us know , and now they '_ve changed it they are expecting us to lose 0 days wages to pick_up the tickets from their incompetence .
negative	i have sent two emails asking for an agent to ring me and still_waiting ............... and to add_insult to injury they have the cheek to add a delivery charge !!!
negative	so frustrated !
negative	latest update , an agent named adam rang me yesterday , i explained it would be near impossible to get to manchester tomorrow before 0 . 00pm and he said he was not promising but he ' d do everything he could to help .
negative	got a voice_mail back from him 0 hours_later to say there was nothing he could do !!!
negative	so thanks to viagogo i am now having to ask a college to take my days list of patients and my husband is losing a days work !
negative	i will never use this site again !
negative	and the last update ........ got to manchester and picked_up the tickets myself ...... i presume that viagogo will do the decent thing and refund my delivery charges !!!
negative	!
negative	i found out after i was checking out that i was charged $_00 more than the hotel actually charged .
negative	i was charged for a breakfast and parking , both of which the hotel doesn_'_t charge for .
negative	very displeased with the overcharge by bookit . com and i '_ll not be using it again .
negative	i didnt care what my parts cost .
negative	i was looking for something time effective .
negative	what could be easier than going online and ordering the part myself ?
negative	wrong .
negative	shop around .
negative	i think tomorrow will be day 00 after i placed order and it still hasnt shipped .
negative	just found the second email_saying now they need my credit_card number again ?
negative	wtf_?
negative	i gave it to you almost 0_weeks_ago .
negative	i am over it .
negative	would not recommend .
negative	i have already told my coworkers of this bad_experience .
negative	due to a glitch in your software .. although the flights were " no_longer available at that price " ...
negative	i click and you held my money , did this twice before opening another browser tab .. do you held my credit_card for over $ 0000 .
negative	customer crevice unable to fix / answer why , and wwwaaaayyy too much time spent on it with them .
negative	hate you now
negative	we ordered a left mirror for a ford_ranger truck .
negative	we received confirmation and tracking_information .
negative	the packaged arrived --- yeah and it is exactly_what we ordered .
negative	then we find 0 charges on our visa and a second different mirror arrives a few_days_later !!.
negative	no email_confirmation , no paperwork , nothing --- just charged .
negative	we have pointed_out that we did not order this product , but so_far no cooperation on getting there product back to them .
negative	what lousey customer_service this has turned_out to be .
negative	very dissapointing .
negative	if it was a legitimate charge , we would have the same communications via_email that supported the legitimate purchase .
negative	i somehow ended on this site after google_search for quality inn .
negative	i asked if this was the motel and was told yes .
negative	charged my account thirty dollars .
negative	never was told of the fee and had i knew i wouldn_'_t have stayed connected .
negative	very dishonest !
negative	do not buy anything from yesstyle . com !!
negative	!
negative	" yesstyle . com is not a online fashion shopping company .
negative	yesstyle . com is a company to test your patience . "
negative	- please read the following message to find out why ...
negative	this is a true story .
negative	it happened to me right now on may 0000 .
negative	shopping at yesstyle is very unpleasant .
negative	the better way to describe : it was a nightmare !
negative	i swear to you with my heart .
negative	it really is !
negative	i paid a lot of money to place couple different orders .
negative	i get some of the items , but mostly i get a lot of disappointments .
negative	0 .
negative	missing items :
negative	sometimes , they don_’ t have the items you saw online .
negative	you placed your order and paid the money … then you started the longest period of waiting in your life .
negative	they will make you wait for two_weeks .
negative	two_weeks_later , when you thought your items should be finally on their way .... slowly you start to realize that they don_'_t even have them .
negative	the worst part is , they will not contact you to let you know .
negative	you will have to wait for two_weeks … or more days to find out ... by yourself .
negative	0 .
negative	size exchange
negative	don_'_t even_bother doing size exchange .
negative	i waited for a month .
negative	i have completely forgotten what the shoes i bought look like .
negative	i still no_idea about them .
negative	yesstyle do not know where they are , and they have no answer when am i get the shoes exchange .
negative	perphaps , it will never happen .
negative	yesstyle is a company to test their customer '_s patience and reaction .
negative	i guess they really don_’ t care .
negative	yesstyle - the worst online shopping company i have ever met in my life .
negative	unless you want to waste your money then go to them , otherwise , don_’ t go there !
negative	i am being very honest to every_single word i said in here .
negative	i completely understand they have to deal with complicated orders everyday .
negative	as a customer , what am i looking for is a very simple concept .
negative	i simply want nothing , but the items i paid .
negative	how simple can it be ?
negative	i paid and i owe yesstyle nothing ..... in return ....
negative	i get no items ... wasted a lot of time and energy .
negative	i have had the run_around no kidding talked to over 00 agents just to get service installed properly and things are still not right .
negative	i booked a suite at suites on south_beach in miami for two_nights july 0rd & 0th 0000 .
negative	when we arrived at the hotel we were told that they could not find our reservation .
negative	i gave them my confirmation from hotelsclick . com and they said they would call us when they figured it out .
negative	we were fine with that because we were off to the beach .
negative	they called us about two hours_later to tell us that it looked like when the site ( hotelsclcik . com ) had sent the booking the hotel had replied that they were full .
negative	the site never contacted us in any form .
negative	the hotel said that fortunately they had a room at their sister hotel two blocks_away .
negative	we accepted that room .
negative	the suites on south_beach has a kitchenette with a full size refrigerator and a sink and microwave and utensils .
negative	we were booked into a suite ( one room , not really a suite ) with only a mini_fridge in it .
negative	we brought food to cook for breakfast and snacks for late at night .
negative	we could not use this food .
negative	when the trip was over i received a receipt from the hotel for about $_00 less per_night for than the suites on south_beach .
negative	i emailed customer_service at hotelsclick . com and i also opened a dispute with amex .
negative	hotelclick . com responded that they wanted paperwork which i sent them .
negative	they replied about tone month later that since i was upgraded to a suite at the sister hotel they did not owe me any refund .
negative	they said the suite had a mini_fridge and the original hotel we booked had only a mini_fridge and a microwave .
negative	they said the hotel where we stayed had a microwave available for use if we went down to the main desk and asked for them to cook food for us .
negative	i replied again with my receipt copies , a picture from the website of the original hotel showing a full size refrigerator and actual room that was a kitchenette .
negative	i copied amex with my dispute number .
negative	the next_day amex credited my account for the entire charge .
negative	two_days_later i received a reply from hotelsclick . com that they would refund $_00 . 00 to my credit_card because our room did not have a microwave .
negative	i told them they did not need to credit my card because my credit_card company already had .
negative	i told them i was disappointed that they couldn_'_t meet their obligations and then couldn_'_t even refund the difference_between the price of the two hotels .
negative	i don_'_t expect a reply since amex has already credited the charge .
negative	also , hotelsclick . com sent my reservation to somewhere called jumbo tours making it even harder to find the reservation .
negative	what would have happened if there was no room at the sister hotel and i was stuck in miami on a holiday with no room ?
negative	i would be extremely wary of using this site no_matter_how much_cheaper they look .
negative	they obviously have no scruples or business_ethics .
negative	ink purchased does not work .
negative	printer does not reconize it .
negative	it took at_least two hours of my time to help the hotel find my reservation .
negative	very unhappy .
negative	the hotel was wonderful and treated me with respect unlike the others we had to deal with to find the reservation /
negative	i ordered several bones and chews .
negative	they were all thrown in the box without_any type of packing paper / cushioning .
negative	when the box arrived the side was torn_open by the bones .
negative	there was also no receipt .
negative	nothing , just a box of bones .
negative	i placed an order for 0 suits and a backpack at 00 : 00 on a wednesday , and paid for overnight shipping .
negative	five of the suits were team suits for kids on our swim team .
negative	i called thursday_morning for a tracking_number , only to be told they didn_'_t ship the day before even_though the order was in by the 00 : 00 deadline .
negative	this was due to computer problems and was promised i ' d have all items in hand by friday .
negative	i called again on thursday_afternoon for a tracking_number , and was told 0 of my items were either on back order or discontinued , even thought the website and customer_service rep had both showed they were available the day before when i double_checked availability .
negative	the original rep was quite rude and could only say it wasn_'_t their fault .
negative	i asked to speak with the manager who too told me it wasn_'_t their fault , and apologized .
negative	after pushing him a bit , he gave_me an extra 00_%_off my items that were available .
negative	the 00_%_discount did not cover the overnight shipping_costs i had to pay to another company to make_sure i had my team suits on time for my swimmers .
negative	i will not be ordering with metro_swim shop again , and have already told a number of other parents on both our club team and our summer team about the horrible experience we had !
negative	!
negative	i requested smoking_rooms and was assured that was what i was getting .
negative	however , when we arrived we had non_- smoking_rooms .
negative	i '_m not happy when i don_'_t get what i paid for .
negative	i called the super 0 toll_free line to book a room in revelstoke bc for april_00th .
negative	the super 0 was booked so the operator offered to find another room - and found one at the sandman .
negative	i was under the impression that the hotels are somehow affiliated - never was i told she was booking me through a website outside of the super 0 computer system .
negative	i was told the charges would be $_000 and i ok ' d everything .
negative	when the charge came through my account i was charged in us funds for a canadian hotel - adding another $_00 .
negative	when i called the number on my confirmation , i was told that i did not book through super 0 system ( they couldn_'_t find my reservation number ) and that i booked through_expedia .
negative	i will never call reservationcounter again - or recommend it .
negative	i will never do_business with your company again .
negative	i purchased tickets and insurance through_travelocity and had to cancel my trip due to business problems , we are self_employed and had to change our plans 0_weeks ahead of time and found out none of our money , insurance of booking fee or airfare was refundable , all i can say is i believe they lead you to believe if you buy insurance you are safe , completely untrue .
negative	everyone i talked to blamed it on someone_else , travelocity blamed delta and delta blamed the insurance company .
negative	all i know is it cost my husband and i 0000 . 00 to go nowhere , absolutely nowhere and no refund whatsoever .
negative	so i will never use travelocity or delta_airlines again and we planned to do more traveling when we retire in a few_years , i guess we will have lots of time then and we will find other means even if it means driving .
negative	i used expedia to book a return flights from london - athens , thira - london .
negative	unfortunately due to unforeseen_circumstances i had to cancel the first leg of my journey and book through another airline , only because there were no suitable flights available through_expedia to reschedule .
negative	i understood that i would not be due a refund for the flight because i cancelled it , however i was advised that i was due a tax refund from the cancelled flight .
negative	on april 00 i was advised that i was due a £_00 tax refund and would receive this in 0 - 00 weeks .
negative	on may 00 i phoned requesting a status_update on my refund to be advised that the airline had not received the refund application from expedia .
negative	expedia reapplied for the tax refund with the airline and i was advised that i was due £_00 , not £_00 , and that i would receive this in 0 - 00 weeks .
negative	on july 0 i phoned requesting a status_update on my refund and was advised that expedia cannot apply for my tax refund until after i have completed the last leg of my flight in august and that it was a £_00 , not £_00 refund and only then should i expect to receive it in 0 - 00 weeks .
negative	expedia have not at any point contacted me to advise me of any_problems with my refund , i have had to contact them and every time have been given incorrect advise .
negative	i have been advised to call them again in august after i have been on holiday to request , once again , that they apply for my refund and that i will have to wait another 0 - 00 weeks to receive the money owed to me .
negative	if i ever receive the money rightfully owed to me i will have waited approximately 0 months for a £_00 or £_00 refund .
negative	i often use sites such as budget air , expedia and edreams and expedia have by_far given the worst customer_service .
negative	i will never use expedia again and would not recommend expedia to anyone .
negative	natasha
negative	i ordered boots from this site over a month_ago and still have not received them .
negative	i received a confromation but i still have not received any information about where my product is !!!
negative	i paid $_000 for boots i will never see !!!
negative	wow
negative	i was very disapointed in the label order .
negative	i figure i receive approximately_$_00 . 00 worth of labels , postage and labor .
negative	i paid $_000 . 00 for 000 0x0 " stickers .
negative	they were shipped in a baggie with tape to tie and in a us priority flat_rate mailing envelope .
negative	i designed the label on line , all you had to do was run the labels , cut and ship .
negative	this is such a rip - off .
negative	i was expecting a much_better quality of label for the cost .
negative	i was suspose to get a " hight gloss " " water proof " label but received regular soft paper and not water proof .
negative	they looked cheap and there was nothing extraordinary about them .
negative	i will never recommend or use this company again .
negative	i am a wedding planner , i do a lot of business ..... your loss .
negative	sign by : over charged for cheap merchandise .
negative	let_me start out by saying that if i could give less_than a one star_rating , i would .
negative	five reasons not to buy from global_eyeglasses :
negative	0 .
negative	it took_forever for the glasses to arrive .
negative	in this case , forever means september 0 to september 00 .
negative	do not order these expecting them to arrive within 0 to 00 days .
negative	0 .
negative	customer_service was awful / non_- existent .
negative	i was growing a bit anxious after two_weeks of waiting .
negative	i tried_calling the customer_service line right when their hours of operation started .
negative	i was so delighted to find that i was customer # 0 and that my questions would be answered in ' 0 minute !'
negative	... 00_minutes later , i had moved up to customer # 0 and the wait had somehow increased to ' 0 minutes .'
negative	the entire time , i had been tolerating the same two songs blasting into my room ( no way was i going to listen to that right into my ear ).
negative	finally , when it let_me know i was customer # 0 , it hung_up on me .
negative	i now understand how tom hanks felt when he lost wilson in cast away .
negative	0 .
negative	00 days after i ordered the glasses , i received a tracking_number .
negative	woohoo !
negative	said my brain sarcastically .
negative	by that time , i was less excited about receiving my glasses and more surprised that they still communicated with me .
negative	unfortunately , their tracking_number was either fake or did not work .
negative	i think they send out random numbers to subdue those who would actually riot if they did not get their glasses in time .
negative	0 .
negative	once the glasses did arrive , i was not even one bit excited .
negative	i had already ordered a pair of glasses from coastal .
negative	they arrived in a few_days .
negative	i can '_t even remember how many days it actually took , it was so long ago .
negative	if you think of it this way , ge took almost 0 times longer to deliver my glasses than coastal did !
negative	both cost the same .
negative	anyway , the ge glasses have the same shape as the ones i saw online .
negative	however , that is where the line is drawn .
negative	they are very floppy and loose and the prescription they stuffed into the frames makes me dizzy when i look down .
negative	that might be due to my bitterness at the company though .
negative	i am going to have it looked at by an optometrist .
negative	0 .
negative	the case the glasses came in is of the worst quality .
negative	i feel_like it could be a mcdonald '_s kids meal toy , it '_s so flimsy .
negative	if i had wanted one of those , i ' d have expected a meal to come with it .
negative	unfortunately , if you notice the shipping time , that would come moldy and disgusting too .
negative	i '_m sure that global_eyeglasses was a fantastic company at some point in their lives , but that part of their lives is not now .
negative	i went through so much stress waiting for my pair of glasses to arrive .
negative	it felt_like i was going through a horrible break - up where the other person refused to give me my things back !
negative	unless you like drama and cheap , plastic - y smelling products , i ' d say stay away from global_eyeglasses .
negative	i orderd flowers and chocolates , 0 days before my sisters_birthday , and they never arrived .
negative	despite_being told , twice , that they were with the courier and would be delivered by the end of the week .
negative	the flowers are still m . i . a and i was never contacted by iflorist , with any kind of updates on the flowers whereabouts .
negative	when i contacted online support , to cancel , they said i could not cancel as the flowers were already with the courier !!!!!........ huh !!
negative	!, i '_ve heard that before !!!
negative	i hate to think what condition these flowers are now in , after supposedly being " with the courier " for this long !!
negative	do not use iflorist . com !!!
negative	or " colonial gifts ltd burnley " the name they trade under .
negative	american_express is now investigating the company on my behalf ..... 00 out 0f 00 for dissapointing the birthday girl !
negative	!
negative	they do nothing for you .
negative	unfortunately the controller i ordered my son on december_00th still has not arrived and it is january0rd .
negative	when i called to follow_up the monday before christmas to see the status on the order and see if i needed to buy another santa gift on one answered and all i got was an answering_machine .
negative	my emails were also not answered until after christmas .
negative	unfortunately cannot even rate the product since we still do not have it ..
negative	although ink_cartridges were supposed to be compatible they do not function properly with my printer
negative	" smart post shipping is one of the slowest shipping options we have .
negative	"- fedex employee
negative	customers should have the option to express ship .
negative	customers should also have the option to speak with someone via_telephone .
negative	dear my name_necklace ,
negative	as stated above , when you give someone tracking_information it is so that the person_who has ordered something , paid for it and expects it to arrive at their home ( probably as a gift or such ) can follow its progress , know where it is and be confident in its delivery .
negative	also , a phone_number should be included and a customer_service representative should be able to answer all questions about that order .
negative	people are putting their trust in you to not only take money out of their bank accounts , but to produce a product as_described with confidence .
negative	a thriving business has good contact information , good tracking_information and good customer_service .

negative	i sent in a price match_guarantee following the instructions listed on the website .
negative	they never matched the price , and when i emailed customer_service about this i never_heard back with a reply or reason_why i was not given the price - match_guarantee .
negative	this company did not reveal that it was not the hotel website .
negative	it also failed to reveal that i would be charged immediately for the room though the reservation is six_months away .
negative	they also did not reveal that there would be no refund for cancellation no_matter_how far ahead .
negative	the company has rude staff all the way around .
negative	i picked_up my car in rome on 0 / 00 and had difficulty with the staff from the beginning .
negative	first , they weren_'_t taking_care of the customers so there was a line of us waiting around ( for nothing ... nobody was being taken_care of ).
negative	then , some italians walked up and they started giving these_guys service ... so we complained and insisted that the italians go to the end of the line behind all of us who had been waiting 00_minutes already .
negative	then , out of the blue , they finally told us that we had to get a ticket in order to be seen .... so there was a mad dash over to the ticket dispenser ( which hadn_'_t been used for ages )... and even with the tickets , they called the italians to the counter first ( even_though their ticket number came after all of the other 00 - 00 people .
negative	we complained and made them see us first .... which they did but they were speaking italian with the italian customers and gesturing toward us and laughing , so it was evident that they were making fun of us .
negative	then , they gave_us a car that didn_'_t have ac - even_though i paid for one with ac .
negative	i returned the car in venice on 0 / 00 .
negative	my car was due at 00 : 00 am and i arrived at their office at 0 : 00 am .
negative	however , we experienced the same issue with the staff in venice as well ... they were completely ignoring all of the customers in line , they wouldn_'_t look up or even address people .
negative	after waiting about 00_minutes , i jumped the line and went to the counter to ask where i should be dropping_off my car ( i had not been given any instruction on how to handle drop_off even_though i asked in rome and was told to call the company to find out ... very hard to do when i didn_'_t have european access on my phone ).
negative	the lady finally acknowledged me and told me to pull up in front the building and then come_back in line .
negative	i came back in line after moving my car the 0 feet that she required and waited another 00 - 00_minutes and the line wasn_'_t moving .
negative	a man finally came behind the counter and started telling people that they couldn_'_t give them cars because nobody had been dropping cars off (??????).
negative	i yelled out that i had been trying to drop_off my damned car for over half an_hour and that they refused to help me .
negative	they finally let_me drop_off my car and signed my receipt at 00 : 00 ... 00_minutes past the deadline and then they sent me an invoice ( i received it on 0 / 0 ) for an_additional day charge .
negative	this company is a shady - they force you to wait_until after your deadline so they can charge you for an entire extra day .
negative	i will be disputing this with my credit_card company - this scam is totally_unacceptable .
negative	beware !
negative	worst customer_service i '_ve ever_dealt_with .
negative	extremely unprofessional . didn_'_t receive my glasses until a month later after they refused to cancel my order and threatened me with a 00_% cancellation_fee . istill said i wanted the order cancelled and they refused to do it and shipped the glasses when they finally received them .
negative	they say they ship within 00_hours but they don_'_t !!!
negative	they won_'_t cancel your order and they charge a 00_% restocking_fee if you return . they also offer you $_00 to leave them good feedback .
negative	shady !!!
negative	you shouldn_'_t have to bribe your customers for good feedback .
negative	i had been ordering from petco for some time .
negative	the delveries consistently took 0 to 0_weeks to receive .
negative	i consistently ( though not always ) placed the same order ; and i was set_up for " repeat delivery ", and had gotten the " repeat delivery price " several_times .
negative	however : this last time , the price wouldn_'_t ring up right , and kept charging me the $_00 . 00 instead of the $_00 . 00 for " repeat delivery ".
negative	i received no satisfaction from so - called " customer serrvice " ( ha_ha_ha )!
negative	i was even told by one csr that i did not have an account !
negative	so , obviously the site was messed_up .
negative	soooo , instead of just giving me a coupon or something for the $ 0 . 00 (. 00 / box x 0 boxes ) difference in the prices ; they let_me go to another pet_food delivery company !
negative	how stupid !
negative	however : i must thank petco , for their atrocious " customer_service ", because , i went to another pet_food delivery company , and got the same order for $_00 . 00 less ($ 0 . 00 / box x 0 boxes )!!!!!
negative	petco needs to learn how to be nice to their customers !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i booked online , usually within a fe minutes i get a confirmation_email .
negative	never did .
negative	after about an_hour or two i called .
negative	had to call back three_times because everyone person i spoke to said they couldn_'_t help me they needed to transfer me somewhere_else .
negative	after an_hour on the phone i finally got someone_who said oh you should have an_email poof like magic during my conversation with her i get an_email .
negative	i asked if it was due to paying through paypal though i them for everything else and never had an_issue she couldn_'_t say .
negative	even after the three calls i felt_like the whole purchase and conversations were a scam that i turned around and called the hotel to make_sure it had been sent over .
negative	i always use y ' all when traveling but this is the worst service ever and i am strongly considering changing ,
negative	they were quick to charge me 0st for my 0 parts & deliver ( 0 - 0 days ).
negative	when i emailed them to tell them i only rec ' d 0 of my parts already charged for they told me " they sent email to warehouse but this would take some time " which ended_up being 0 week_later of when i rec ' d the 0st of 0 parts needed to have my car fixed .
negative	this threw me into yet another week of waiting to get my car repaired which was dying while driving .
negative	this was not safe for me to do but they really took their time .
negative	i only shopped with them because my sister suggested them for buying parts .
negative	i had to finally email them info off of my delivery ticket myself before i finally rec ' d part ( i used to work in purchasing & receiving so knew this shouldn_'_t have taken so long to resolve this issue .!)
negative	first time i use them , this stuff happened .
negative	no phone_calls or nothing .
negative	this is the first time i have placed an order with this company and i am very disappointed .
negative	the tracking document shows only the order number , shipping address , and how much i was charged .
negative	there is no_indication that the book has_been shipped .
negative	an unreasonable amount of time has passed and i am in dire need of this book .
negative	would not have ordered through you if i had known it would take this long .
negative	ordering with a coupon was challenging on the website , getting information onto the website was also a challenge .
negative	i finally thought i had it down and the default address kept changing - i didn_'_t spot that the delivery date had changed itself too .
negative	i ordered a christmas bouquet of reds , roses and lilies and christmas greenery ( 00 . 00gbp ) for delivery on friday 00th_december to my mother - in -_law in the u . k . ( i live in the usa ) with a 00_%_discount_coupon .
negative	what i got - or at_least what my mother in law got - was 0 white gerbera , a clump of blue statice and 0 stems of pink chrysanthemums on friday 00th_december .
negative	the flowers probably_won_'_t last until christmas .
negative	she was surprised , but not happily .
negative	i was surprised and furious and very , very , disappointed .
negative	i am awaiting serenta '_s response to my email of complaint and i do expect some_sort of explanation and recompense .
negative	i measured my dogs old collar to make_sure i got the right size .
negative	when i received the new collar it was way too big .
negative	it would cost me more money for postage to send it back so i just took the loss .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	i have had to cut this poor plant down to a miniature size as it was almost doa .
negative	the shipping was the same cost as the plant , which didn_'_t please me .
negative	had the plant been big an healthy as_advertised when it arrived i wouldn_'_t be upset .
negative	yours truly , cranky customer .
negative	i was sent the wrong frames that looked used and had to call multiple_times .
negative	bad customer_service .
negative	do not recommend at all !
negative	i had quite a large order , but as it was a gift , i wasn_'_t sure of te size .
negative	first i have been given wrong advice , asking about the fit of the nike_tennis polo / t - shirts and beeing told that if my husband was 0m00 , i should switch my initial order of large size in xl .
negative	result , i had to return all the polo court / t - shirts to exchange for a size l . they didn_'_t bother to offer me the return cost ( my order was about £_000 though ).
negative	while returning the items , i sent a email listing the returns items and what size i needed to make_sure they will hold it until they receive my parcel .
negative	i received a positive answer then .
negative	by the way , in the meantime , i saw the same items in a quite expensive shop , but about £_00 cheaper !
negative	but when they had to sent the items , i have been told that the person in charge forgot to do it as a result , they were happy to exchange then with the same items with different colour ... with an_additional_cost which almost double what i already paid !
negative	in spite having said they had the correct items and that they will keep it until receiving few_days_later my parcel for exchange , tennis_nuts didn_'_t respect its agreement /
negative	if you order there , make_sure you will be happy to pay an expensive return cost in case - while most web sites offer return_label free of charge - and prepare yourself being told they don_'_t have the items anymore , but they can kindly offer you to double your cost exchanging for the same item in another color !
negative	overall , bad advice resulting in a return at a expensive cost , spoiled birthday having the wrong_size , ... and at the end having to cancel everything because they didn_'_t have the right size and i didn_'_t want to pay double price for an other color !
negative	before ordering there , don_'_t do like me , have a search on internet , many other web_site a more reliable and go check the price in the shops , many shops are selling the same things cheaper !
negative	and if you do , make_sure you will never ever have to return anything :-)
negative	i placed an order in the early_morning on may 00 .
negative	i purchase a month supply each_month with normally one week grace period till supply is gone .
negative	on the following_wednesday , i realized the shipment had not been shipped so made three different calls .
negative	i told them i needed the shipment by friday and was assured they would " take_care of it '- i could have stopped the order and simply purchased locally , but they said they would correct it .
negative	still nothing until late thursday and another call .
negative	but the shipment was only just done and with no special handling leading to yet another possible 0 day delay at_least .
negative	i had asked to talk to a supervisor every time i called - none returned the call for three_days .
negative	they lied about shipping date , as fed_ex verified the actual time .
negative	then on face book they lied again openly , saying they had ' tried ' to call me .
negative	i carry a cell 00 / 0 and there were no calls and no missed calls .
negative	finally after 0 days a supervisor did call and admitted to the above situation , no calls , wrong ship date etc and then had the audacity to offer 00_%_off my ' next order " what ????
negative	so no dog_food for my dogs is just fine with these people considering once they have your money , the welfare of your dog is the last thing on their mind .
negative	the next offer was $_00 ..... i must assume they find a small sack of old roy just fine rather then the excellent nutrition my dogs are used too .
negative	on the whole , i will never recommend this company , money is their only real interest , there are some great dog_food delivery companies available .
negative	any other would be a better choice .
negative	vom echo wald kennel
negative	i was not wowed_by the service i received at all .
negative	very bad , unacceptable experience
negative	the website offered promotion for $_000 gift_card for restaurants . com .
negative	when i received the confirmation , the promotional gift_card was nowhere to be found .
negative	the customer_service representative was no help at all .
negative	in fact , she essentially implied that i must have misread the website and there '_s nothing she could do to help me .
negative	not to mention that she lacked patience and had an attitude problem .
negative	if you don_'_t have people skills , you should really consider another career path .
negative	never booking with this company again .
negative	i cannot_believe this company !!!
negative	they really should not be able to get away with the crap they try to pull !
negative	i ordered a dress for myself and my daughter ( who was going to be the flower girl ).
negative	the dress was ordered on 0 / 00 and i expedited the shipping for an extra fee of over $_00 !!
negative	i then happened to check the status of the dress to find out it was estimated to be shipped on 0 / 0 / 00 !
negative	the wedding is this friday !!!
negative	so , i demanded to have the order cancelled b /_c it was still in the freaking long ' processing ' period .
negative	well , today i get this response from them stating that not only will they continue with the order but that they will only be reimbursing me only the for the expedited_shipping fee !
negative	i am furious !!
negative	i wrote back to their behind and told them that they can '_t just make up the rules as they go and please and to refund me fully .
negative	i will be taking legal_action if they try to continue with the order and will also be reporting them to the ' better business of bureau ' as well .
negative	i can '_t_believe_how unprofessional they '_ve been !
negative	and if i could give them no stars i would !
negative	the fact that they don_'_t have an actual phone_number is what i wish i had picked_up on - mad shady people who steal your money !
negative	beware , do not order from this company !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i booked a hotel in mexico for my daughter for spring_break .
negative	all of her flights were cancelled due to the weather .
negative	we called the hotel the day before to ask if we could get our money back and the hotel said yes no_worries but we had to call travelocity .
negative	i spent an_hour and a half on the phone with travelocity while they lied to me and said they had to speak to the hotel and finally they said they would call me back within 00_hours and give me a resolution .
negative	i got a call back from them a month later saying we weren_'_t getting our money back .
negative	i searched online for some time looking for what i thought would be a great company for us to send flowers to family that had their first child in vienna .
negative	i did exactly as the site asked , where were the flowers going , to whom and a local phone_number for them to contact if needed ?
negative	well , it was needed .
negative	the flowers were not delivered to them on time and they never received a phone_call asking such things as where they could be delivered to since they were no_longer at the hospital or letting them know they had eventually been delivered to the hospital giving them the option to go pick them up should they choose .
negative	i will never use this company again nor will i recommend them either .
negative	we booked a hotel through_travelocity , prepaid .
negative	when we arrived we were charged again by the hotel ; that took over an_hour to resolve .
negative	the place turned_out to be filthy with black mold in the bathroom walls .
negative	the bed was horribly saggy and uncomfortable , and there were only two very small pillows .
negative	the continental_breakfast was just some lukewarm coffee ( and there wasn_'_t even enough left for 0 cups when we left just before 0am ) and a couple of bins of dry cereal .
negative	the parking_lot was torn up .
negative	i complained to travelocity and they said that since i prepaid the room they would not provide us another location or refund our money .
negative	very bad_experience .
negative	the staff at the hotel was nice , but the place should not be open for business , especially due to the mold .
negative	i would be very hesitant to use this service again .
negative	i paid for what i understood to be an all_inclusive rental for a vehicle for 0 week .
negative	the thrifty car_rental desk at san_francisco was manned by the most untrustworthy and sly individuals i have experienced in almost 00 years of travel .
negative	after we presented our voucher from driveway . com . au each driver was asked to sign the bottom of a paper tape ( about 0 . 0 metres long ) which simply verified they had a license and agreed to drive in a lawful manner and accept any fines , parking infringements etc .
negative	after a 00 hour flight we were happy to be on our way .
negative	upon our return we were charged an_additional_$_000 . 00 for an upgraded vehicle , fuel , etc etc .
negative	when we questioned it we were thrown the 0 . 0 metre long tape which included additional_charges , for just about everything you could imagine , including a refueling surcharge + an airport refueling fee .
negative	never truster this organization or thrifty at san_francisco airport - they are shifty not thrifty .
negative	look up our facebook_page and like for more details .
negative	bestilte noget tøj over deres hjemmeside , som sku ' komme indenfor 0 uger .
negative	efter næsten tre uger skriver jeg til_dem , og finder så ud_af at de ikke engang selv har fået pakken .
negative	beder dem om at annullere min_ordre , og de siger at jeg_vil få mine_penge retur inden for 0 dage .
negative	efter 0 - 00 dage er pengene stadig ikke kommet ind .
negative	bliver så nødt til at skrive til_dem igen , for så at vente yderligere 0 dage .. fuldstændig til grint ..
negative	i purchased 0 items and having not read there was a next_day delivery i just saw the dispatched date when tracking my products .
negative	i didn_'_t know where they were coming from and how many days it might take .
negative	a week went by and when i rung customer_service they informed me the items had been delivered the day after ordering then once more after that with photographic evidendience of the couriers outside twice however the two times they came they never left a card through my door telling_me they had been or a time to rearrange .
negative	no email or call either so i was unaware or this having come or in the second visit when that even might have been !!!.
negative	i was ask to pay for re delivery £_00 .
negative	it would be next_day but between_0am and 0pm .
negative	forget it i paid the £_00 and cancelled the order .
negative	precious_little things use a crooked courier service and i '_m sure i '_m not the only customer to have been stung .
negative	i '_ve never had such problems with amazon or royal_mail .
negative	drop_off no problem at all .... however the collection took 00_minutes and 0 phone_calls to get the car back to us !!
negative	after a long flight , with 0 kids , and rain .
negative	it was not a stress_free pick_up :( all the representatives and drivers passed the blame to someone_else , insisting the car was on the nearest car_park and would only take 0 mins to bring round ..... so why did it take 00 ??????
negative	?
negative	i received my package and the box was open .
negative	i thought okay it must be the usps '_s fault for not handling the box well and then i opened the package and noticed how poorly packaged my product was .
negative	i ordered a replacement_mirror for my car and i was flabbergasted to see that it was put inside a cloth bag .. no bubble_wrap , no styrofoam , no nothing !
negative	that '_s it .. just a piece of cloth .
negative	they didn_'_t even give courtesy to reprint the receipt or anything .
negative	just the mirror inside a cloth bag .
negative	seriously ?
negative	it '_s a mirror !
negative	package it better !
negative	i need to speak with a representative & was unable to get through when i called tuesday .
negative	arrived at kings_cross and planned to use green line link into london centre but using map printed from your website was totally unalbe to locate the stop for the buses and had to pay for taxi instead .
negative	after visit to hamleys toys store ( marked on your map ) searched in vain again to fiind a stop where we could join the bus .
negative	several buses drove past but the did not stop , none of the bus_stops showed any markings for the tour althogh your web map indicated their position .
negative	forced to walk too far ( i have parkinsons and this " hop on hop_off " service was supposed to help me !!!!)
negative	and again forced to take taxi - never used our prepaid ticket - very unhappy .
negative	i am very displeased with it store .
negative	they are once again tricked me .
negative	i will be very actively recommend to all to not used your store !
negative	theirs bonus is " free delivery worldwide .." - the full fraud !
negative	after i has made another order , they sent me a letter - " thank_you for your order and payment .
negative	unfortunately , this order does not qualify for free delivery due to the weight .
negative	if you would still like us to send the order it will be an extra £_00_pound sterling ."
negative	i refused , but they have already removed money from my card .
negative	and while back , a week passed , i lost time and $ 0 for unnecessary transaction
negative	i ordered almost 0_weeks_ago and still have not got my order ?
negative	can someone please contact me i have tried_calling several_times .
negative	went through the usual work of filling in trivia information which some is erelevant to the sale , ad to your cart , bla , bla , bla .
negative	their price is pretty good but then at check out they hit you with a $_00 . 00 shipping charge for only six little bags , i have had so many christmas purchases shipped for much less_than that .
negative	what a waist of time ...
negative	it said 0 . 00 then when paid is was 0 . 00 why not tell it upfront that is the price
negative	our 0 hr flight turned into 00_hours , which caused us to lose an entire day of vacation w_/ family !
negative	maybe it was delta_airlines that made the changes , but they diverted us from a trip from sacramento to seattle to anchorage to sac to salt_lake city to st paul , mn to anchorage .
negative	aaaaarrrrrggggghhhh !
negative	never again !
negative	i have ordered from this site twice , my first order took 0_weeks to deliver , but i was happy that i got it .
negative	it was delivered to my house without_any problem .
negative	however , the second time i received my order i have to pay over $_00 for taxes .
negative	the second time is only took 0_weeks .
negative	but over $_00 for taxes and with no warning ...........
negative	i did not expected this , because i didn_'_t have to pay for taxes on my first order .
negative	my first order was over $_000 , my second order was less_than that !!
negative	!
negative	later , i found that it was because the second order was shipped by a different company .
negative	so i emailed them and request for an explanation of why the inconsistency with shipment and the charges .
negative	their reply was that : they " cannot guarantee or estimate any customs - related levy ".
negative	i would love to wait longer and not to get charged .
negative	costumer_service was not helpful at all .
negative	their answer was can '_t guarantee & they have completed their " obligation "!!!!!
negative	can '_t they at_least investigate ???
negative	well , i can guarantee that i will not buy from this site again !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a bridesmaid_dress on july 0nd for an october_00th_wedding .
negative	i paid $_00 for the 0 - 0 week rush_cut .
negative	after several panicked calls to ps_bridal , my dress was finally shipped on october 0rd .
negative	it was shipped 0 - day express through the usps and i had to go pick it up from the post_office myself on oct . 0th .
negative	thanks , ps_bridal , for getting my dress to me 0 days before the wedding !
negative	i want my $_00 back .
negative	order has still not shipped and even went back on cart even after paying for item through paypal .
negative	will not buy from again !!
negative	!
negative	wow , really disappointed .
negative	i ordered over 00 shirts and when i called and told them that i needed 0 more , the price went from $ 0 . 00 to $_00 . 00 / shirt .
negative	i would not recommend this site !
negative	i ordered the part and then got an_email_stating it was delivered when i go on the ups linc sent from parts_geek it says that it was delivered to someone named wooten in charlotte sc i am in california .
negative	when i go to call them no one answers they tell you to go to the website which doesn_'_t have a selection for we delivered to the wrong_address .
negative	i checked my order confirmation and my address was correct .
negative	i can '_t really rate this product i would love to give it a good review if i could receive it ... i ' d really like someone to help this happen .
negative	not sure what the angel name referred to .
negative	it clinks a bit but doesn_'_t chime .
negative	i thank the gem_tree for explaining my misunderstanding .
negative	i tried to use an old existing credit from a cancellation .
negative	it was still valid .
negative	after over 0 hours of back and forth with 0 different customer_service representatives i was told that i should go and see if the airline would give me a refund for the flight because despite the fact that they could find my reservation their system was having a problem and they couldn_'_t book it .
negative	i called the airline and they couldn_'_t find the ticket number that expedia had given me .
negative	i called expedia back .
negative	i had to answer all the same questions and sit on hold all over again .
negative	i was again told to contact united .
negative	when i protested this i was put on hold again for another 00_minutes .
negative	i asked to speak to a manager repeatedly and was never transferred to one .
negative	they won_'_t issue a refund even_though it is their fault .
negative	i '_m extremely irritated and will never ever use expedia again !
negative	i ordered lafont glasses from them .
negative	after a month , the frame is peeling and when i complained they were useless and said to contact the company .
negative	lafont says they are not distributors and they use no decals .
negative	these are knockoffs !!!!
negative	i paid almost $_000 for fake frames .
negative	and there is nothing i can do about it .
negative	i feel dumb , yes , but pissed is more like it .
negative	do not use this company !!!
negative	!
negative	i am appalled at the total lack of responsibility to the customer .
negative	i was not notified my items were back ordered .
negative	both inquiries i sent were ignored .
negative	this behavior by a vendor is woefully inadequate in today '_s economic environment .
negative	i would not order a band - aid from them if they shipped it air express !
negative	jodie n .
negative	they charged my credit_card $_000 .
negative	but nothing else .
negative	no confirmation that anything was delivered .
negative	i only received a coupon for another order .
negative	00_%_off .
negative	00_%_off for nothing .

negative	i first thought i was using the reservation center at the actual hotel but after i booked it i realized it was not the actual hotel .
negative	then i tried to change my reservation rate because an event i was attending had a special rate and we are tax exempt but i was not allowed to change the reservation or cancel without losing all of my money .
negative	so did not have a good experience .
negative	never had reserved a room where i could not modify or change a reservation .
negative	nor have i ever booked a room 0 months in advance that i could not get a refund the same day i book it .
negative	terrible situation and will never use this company again .
negative	this is the worst company ever .
negative	they threatened to break glasses i sent in for return a month_ago because i didn_'_t want to pay 000 . 00 repair when i could buy a new pair for that .
negative	i also bought a pair of chanel sunglasses but didn_'_t like how they fit so i wanted to exchange .
negative	they do not exchange but charge a 00_percent restock_fee so you better like what you order .
negative	overall i have done allot of online shopping and never had problems like this .
negative	i have all the exchange of emails that becky_s the owner of optisfast has exchange with me .
negative	she is holding my glasses now stating that if i dont remove reviews i will not get my glasses back .
negative	she has_been threatening me this entire exchange
negative	i thought the lantern was going to be much bigger_than it is .
negative	i ended_up not using it and the cost of shipping plus to return was more than the item cost .
negative	very disappointed !
negative	never use bookit . com !
negative	three_days before leaving for my honeymoon i was reading_reviews about where we were going and found out that the hotel had been sold and was closing the day before we were to arrive .
negative	i received no call from bookit . com about this , i called them to find out if it was true and they had no_idea it was closed .
negative	i hate to think what would have happened if we had not seen this and had arrived with suitcases in hand and no place to stay .
negative	i spent the next two_days trying to book something_else but at the late date the only things that had openings for two_weeks were more_expensive and bookit . com said i had to stay at the same price !
negative	we went on our_honeymoon and had a good time because it was our_honeymoon but it was not where we wanted or what we wanted ( the beach was horrible and very small and this was our biggest wish for our_honeymoon ).
negative	i tried to get compensated from bookit . com , sent letters to the corporate office and spent lots of time on the phone .
negative	they did offer us a free hotel for a weekend in jamaica ( but for 0 nights in jamaica we had to pay the airfare , not really a deal ).
negative	plus , if we took this deal we had to sign a waiver saying we ' d not discuss the situation with anyone !!!
negative	i think they should have paid the difference for the more_expensive trip ( we were talking less_than $_000 !)
negative	or they should have upgraded us at_least at the hotel .
negative	bookit . com did nothing !
negative	they also said if i did not respond in 0 days that i would forfeit the offer and they would consider the issue closed .
negative	i spoke with them but they still closed it with no resolution .
negative	i wish they would make this right for me but apparently customer opinion is not important .
negative	don_'_t ever us bookit . com ..... try cheapcarribean . com , they are way better .
negative	every time i call , it doesn_'_t connect me with anyone , it just asks me to leave a message .
negative	i accidentally canceled my booked hotel and have been charged $_00 . 00 .
negative	i want to keep my room and reverse this charge , but i cannot get_ahold of anyone .
negative	still trying to get my money from these thieves , who used to trade under electrictshirts . co . uk .
negative	don_'_t be_fooled !!!!!
negative	i ordered a t - shirt in july , never received it , and despite repeated_requests from me and ' promises ' from them to refund my money , it hasn_'_t happened .
negative	i '_ll just keep on until they comply .
negative	i don_'_t take kindly to being_ripped_off .
negative	i ordered two pet lights for my dogs - one turns its self off and the other the battery was dead after one use .....
negative	we took the goldentour tour to blenheim and the cotswolds today sept 00 , 0000 .
negative	we have taken golden_tours / grayline tours in lots of places and have enjoyed the trips we took .
negative	this tour was a major disappointment because of the tour_guide and how the company handled its delay in getting started .
negative	we were picked_up at the golden tour visitor centre kensington one hour after the designated pickup time .
negative	from the time we got on the bus , throughout the entire tour and after we were unceremoniously left to fend for ourselves at the end of the hammersmith underground line , geoffrey provided negative descriptions of everything , poor descriptions with lots of " i don_'_t know " and constantly complained_about running behind schedule .
negative	when we got off the bus at all but the last stop at birbury he literally disappeared without explanation .
negative	not even an " i '_ll be right back after i get the tickets ".
negative	very unprofessional .
negative	at blenheim we were left without entry tickets .
negative	when we finally found geoffrey he was passing out tickets one by one in a rude manner , refusing to give one person of a couple 0 / both tickets .
negative	a lot of the time we could have spent enjoying blenheim was wasted looking for geoffrey .
negative	at the stop for lunch in burford he was no where to be seen when we got off the bus and we did not know where we supposed to go for the lunch we opted to include with the tour .
negative	again , not even the professional courtesy to let the people on the bus where we were supposed to go .
negative	by the way , the lunch was terrible .
negative	at blenheim , in order to make up time , geoffrey cut our visit short .
negative	we were at blenheim , the primary stop on your tour , less_than 0 0 / 0 hours .
negative	it would have been 00_minutes shorter_than that if the people on the bus had not spoken up and complained .
negative	geoffrey kept mentioning that we were going to cut short the last stop at bibury by not walking along the river .
negative	the tour did walk along the river though .
negative	after bibury on the drive back to london geoffrey constantly complained that we were not going to make it back by 0 : 00_pm and he would try to get everyone to the hammersmith station but there were no guarantees .
negative	that was totally_unacceptable and we had no choice but to be dumped at the end of the hammersmith line .
negative	no one with golden tour , neither geoffrey nor the bus driver , offered any assistance with train fare or getting the correct train .
negative	golden tour is in the tour business .
negative	the tour descriptions state " estimated " time back in london .
negative	they are responsible for getting back their customers into london as implied .
negative	they are responsible for being aware of traffic conditions and driver time .
negative	instead of dumping us off somewhere they should have sent another driver if there was a problem .
negative	they failed to look after our well being on this tour .
negative	we really wanted to see and enjoy blenheim palace .
negative	this tour did not allow us to do so .
negative	we were given a small refund , which was totally inadequate compensation for golden_tours unprofessional tour_guide and handling of their delay
negative	will not use golden_tours in the uk again .
negative	rent a car and drive .
negative	i asked for a specific hotel and was booked for an entirely different hotel that showed_up on my confirmation_email .
negative	their terms and policy are just the wort never ever again in my life am i evet booking a flight ticket in this website again !
negative	!
negative	tried to get travel_insurance for myself and husband plus golf equipment , selected it charged three_times and on the documents it clearly_stated golf equipment not covered !!!
negative	don_'_t consider this company as you don_'_t get what you want !!
negative	!
negative	my husband and i had been saving for quite some time for our recent honeymoon , and due to various advertisements we saw with priceline , we decided to use this company to get the best " bang for our buck ."
negative	easily the worst choice we made .
negative	first , priceline booked us to leave on a tuesday_morning to return on sunday_afternoon .
negative	then after they " overbooked " the flight , they asked if we could move to leaving monday_night .
negative	when we changed to this monday_night flight , we were set to return early saturday_morning .
negative	this led us to lose at_least 00_hours of our_honeymoon .
negative	then , there was a problem with the weather , and we were stuck in atlanta monday_night .
negative	we didn_'_t arrive at our hotel location until tuesday_afternoon after we had to spend our money and time on a new plane_ticket and hotel in atlanta .
negative	this meant we lost a night we paid for at our hotel .
negative	when asked about a refund , priceline told us that our vacation package could not be refunded or changed , even_though we didn_'_t get what we paid for .
negative	when we finally arrived in the florida keys , we were placed in a filthy room with an " ocean front view ."
negative	who knew there were forests in the ocean !
negative	we complained multiple_times to the hotel as well as priceline .
negative	each time we called , we go the same script - like response telling us that our vacation package was " non_- changeable " and " non_- refundable ."
negative	we spent roughly 00_hours of our_honeymoon on the phone with over a dozen priceline agents , all of whom could frankly careless about our situation .
negative	it took threatening legal_action to get any kind of response , and even then , there was nothing accomplished except the customer_service representatives suggesting we " write to their headquarters ."
negative	their customer_service was atrocious to say the least , and neither my husband , nor i have ever_experienced such apathy towards customers .
negative	stay away from priceline at all costs !
negative	you get what you pay for , and it '_s much_better to fork over the extra money to avoid dealing_with priceline and their associates .
negative	the customer_service sucks !
negative	i waited 00_minutes for them to answer my call .
negative	i ordered this morning ( 0am ) and when i called to have it canceled ( 00am ), customer_service said they cant cancel it .
negative	omg wtf !
negative	the hotel we booked through this site was one of the worst we have ever stayed in .
negative	it was totally misrepresented by this site .
negative	i began my search for glasses because my old pair were ugly and nearly broken .
negative	i had a very specific and designer frame in mind , one my local optomotrist doesn_'_t carry , so i began to search online .
negative	i really did my homework , and i checked with several sites and examined non_- party reviews .
negative	frames_direct seemed to be overwhelmingly the most cost - effective and convenient choice ; i never saw one absolute negative_review .
negative	so i bought the glasses .
negative	i should have seen the issues from the beginning .
negative	when you place the order it states they '_ll contact you about the prescription lenses .
negative	i waited a week and heard_nothing , so i got on the site myself and realized i could upload it myself , so i did and ignored the feeling i was wasting my time .
negative	i week_later i '_ve heard_nothing , although i checked my order status regularly , and i finally see my frames are on back order .
negative	no one notified me of this .
negative	by that time my glasses should have been delivered .
negative	so i sent and email to customer_service .
negative	they sent me a canned email in response which in no way addressed my concerns .
negative	two_days_later , i saw my status had changed to cancelled .
negative	strange , i didn_'_t cancel it .
negative	apparently the way this company works is to absolutely ignore customers with orders that are out of the ordinary in any way .
negative	you are a small , unimportant fry in relation to their grand scheme .
negative	so if you value your money , your time , or just feel you deserve to feel the companies you use value your service , i suggest you buy your frames elsewhere .
negative	i was unable to take my business trip booked through_travelocity because several hours prior to my air departure , my husband was involved in a serious auto accident .
negative	i immediately called travelocity and was no told " no problem ".
negative	airfare would be a credit require to be used within a year .
negative	hotel cancelation ( for two_nights ) - they would get back to me .
negative	this is was two day trip wiht a specific meeting agenda - not a trip that i could postpone travel and go several days_later .
negative	i had all necessary documentation : police report , emergency room , doctors , etc .
negative	travelocity rep said it wasn_'_t needed .
negative	several phone_calls later - long_story short :
negative	it is a huge waste of my time to speak with reps in india that couldn_'_t understand me nor i them .
negative	asking to speak with a supervisor stateside is a long process that requires repeating entire story numerous_times after a thirty minute wait to actually speak with someone .
negative	no one from travelocity called me back regarding hotel credit and our company had to pay the two_nights despite my having all necessary documentation about the accident and hospital .
negative	when i attempted to use the air credit for another trip , i was told that i had to pay a $_000 penalty fee in order to use a $_000 credit .
negative	summary : i will not use travelocity again for any travel - business or personal .
negative	they have lost my business .
negative	poor customer_service all around .
negative	i wonder does travelocity refund for death ?
negative	is the travelor expected to travel even if a family_member ; husband , parent or child is injured , ill or hospitalized with various supporting documentation for proof ?
negative	these are judgement calls that senior managers and leadership positions should be making if customer_service is a focal_point in your business infrastructure .
negative	der blumenstrauss den ich bestellet habe wurde nicht geliefert .
negative	stattdessen wurden die anderen blumen zugestellt .
negative	found this company easy to use with no_hidden_charges when u pay next time u book flights i would tell you to use them until
negative	i checked my credit_card statement and found an extra $_00 . 00 charge then tried all day to ring the australian phone_number to ask why and no answer had to leave a message for them to ring back tried over and over and never got an answer or a return call i would like my money returned and a phone_call with an_apology will i get it ???????
negative	if i do i will change my view until then
negative	no it isn_'_t you have taken $ 0000 . 00 out of my account and that isn_'_t my ticketed price also i have had my phone on all day and received lots of calls but none from you i have also tried to ring today and got your answering_machine again and again and have had no reply i also started a ticket ???
negative	and that hasn_'_t helped either
negative	both my family and i booked with alpharooms in the past and were happy with them but i won_'_t be booking with them again !
negative	i booked the meyrick in galway for saturday_night but i got sick last monday and under doctors orders i was unable to travel ! alpharooms could not refund my money as it was too close to the date .
negative	i was disappointed in this as i wasn_'_t cancelling because i changed my mind i was too sick to go !
negative	i rang the meyrick directly and they kindly offered to change the date for no extra_cost to any other date that would suit .
negative	they asked me to get alpharooms to email the changed date to them .
negative	i rang alpharooms and they said they would look into it .
negative	i then got an_email that said it would cost me 00 sterling to change the date .
negative	i replied saying that i thought this was very steep as it was over 00_% of the room price ! i have got no reply .
negative	after several happy bookings my family and i are disgusted that they wouldn_'_t change a booking when number one the hotel were happy to do it and number two under doctors orders i was not allowed to travel .
negative	i also think they should have replied to my email .
negative	i am very disappointed and annoyed at the service so i won_'_t be using this website again
negative	ordered a bbq as a father '_s day gift .
negative	garden_xl stated next_day delivery .
negative	0 days_later i received an_email_saying it would be delivered in 00 days .
negative	i phoned them 00 days_later ( after it still hadn_'_t been delivered ) to be told it would be another 0_weeks .
negative	i was starting to think the business was going bust at this point !
negative	!
negative	called after 0_weeks where the customers services person said it was not due for delivery at all - the order was stuck in some_sort of delivery purgatory .
negative	i had asked for a manager to call me to explain what had happened , but no one did and no has since called to apologise .
negative	will not use this company again .
negative	after ordering the blue baby '_s first christmas photo orniment
negative	i was sent a pink one
negative	i checked my order and it was the blue one i ordered
negative	so it will be getting sent back this week
negative	no instant delivery , autokey system is bad .
negative	" in stock " means " we might have it , but it '_s not for sure ".
negative	i am very dissapointed .
negative	my husband and i ordered passports 0 - 0 day delivery .
negative	i have received mine but he still_hasn_'_t received his .
negative	it has_been 00days !!!
negative	!
negative	we are very unsatisfied with the
negative	service we received when calling to get answers on why he hasn_'_t received his .
negative	very unorganized and no one could
negative	really give any clear answers .
negative	it was horrible experience .
negative	i have never got reimbursed from a night in a hotel that was booked on mistake from travelocity .
negative	i have called 0 times and they keep saying its " being_processed "
negative	i will never use ship_sticks again
negative	i placed an order with preciouslittleone a couple of weeks_ago and when the items arrived i was thrilled , i had bought cellular blankets and they were the softest nicest looking blankets i had ever_seen / felt ,.
negative	i decided to make another order for 0 packs of cot_bed sheets in the same make and when they arrived i opened one packet and they were lovely and i was pleased with my purchase but when i opened to second packet , the sheets had light brown stains all over them !
negative	i was very unhappy with this as you can imagine but what makes it '_s worse is that i have planned to buy my cot_bed , parasol and more cellular blankets from this website and my baby is due in 0_weeks so my plans are ruined and now i will have to find my items elsewhere .
negative	i was under the impression that my reservation would be able to be cancelled for free and now i am stuck paying hundreds of dollars for a reservation i cannot use !
negative	do not initial anything .
negative	priceline customer_service is very unhelpful .
negative	do not use priceline .
negative	i have had much_better experiences with kayak !
negative	altiuscart . com does not screen sellers : rainbow electronics and communications limited .
negative	after four different ship dates and a bogus tracking_number , i was sent the following email : " i will like you to know that there is a little problem with your package as it has_been held by custom demanding for for custom fees which is $_000 and if this fees is not paid they will not be releasing the package for delivery to your door_step ."
negative	i requested a refund ... " your order have been shipped out and it is already in usa there is no way you can get a refund if the package is not delivered to you .
negative	you can only get a refund if the product delivered to you is not working fine or if you are not satisfied with the product ."
negative	this is the worst delivery carrier out there !
negative	i advise any businesses looking for a delivery comapny to stay well away form yodel , your custermers will never receive their parcels .
negative	we stayed in all day , regulary cheacking the tracking status ; at 0 :_00am the parcal left the local depot which is less_than 0 miles_away , then at 0 :_00pm this evening the tracking status said that the parcal had been delivered at 0 :_00pm , yet we haven_'_t received anything !
negative	we can '_t contact yodel , the phone_number on there website is not a real number , there live_chat service is closed ( even_though it is suppose to be open until 0 :_00pm !)
negative	we are absolutely furious with yodel !!
negative	!
negative	i received an outdated $_00 bag of prescription science_diet cat !
negative	why would you sell me an expensive bag of food that has already expired ?
negative	i searched the internet for a restaurant gift_card and your company came up .
negative	after my purchase , i found that you were not affiliated with that restaurant at all .
negative	i called the restaurant and they were not happy that their name was connected to your website .
negative	i then cancelled the transaction with you and it took days for the credit to appear in my account .
negative	bad business_practices , shame on you .
negative	i will neve use a drive up storage_unit again was in unit less then a month mice droppings everywhere no food was stored in unit but mice were in a box with shoes spider nest everywhere one cooler had over 00 nests on it had unit during the moth of may
negative	very poor company .
negative	agoda sent a confirming e_- mail to me stating a hotel voucher would be sent within an_hour .
negative	no voucher .
negative	after a couple of days , i followed_up .
negative	agoda claims 00 / 0 customer_service and promise a response within 00_hours .
negative	no response .
negative	sent request again .
negative	after five days , received an e_- mail_stating there was no reservation and no room available at the hotel .
negative	offered no assistance or explanation .
negative	meanwhile , one of my fellow_travelers booked a room after i supposedly had a reservation .
negative	this is a terrible company .
negative	see other problems noted in other traveler reviews on websites .
negative	i reserved an outside drive up unit 0x00 and went to see it at lunch today .
negative	it was not an outside unit , and nor was it " drive up ".
negative	it was down two different hallways .
negative	what a waste of my time .
negative	i spent my lunch_hour in this worthless pursuit .
negative	also , i like to speak directly with the management at the location not to a customer_service person at some call_center who has never even seen the storage_facility .
negative	i will make_sure not to ever use selfstorage , com again .
negative	it was a horrible experience .
negative	sylvia never told me that there was an_additional 000 dollar fee for our dog .
negative	when we got to the hotel i got there much earlier because there was an_issue with the address as when when booking so i wanted to make_sure we were at the right one . i went in and at the desk they told me .
negative	i immediately canceled my reservation at 000 and called and canceled with your reservation_counter . had to go find another hotel that was pet friendly .
negative	and they had my name wrong it '_s pina not tina i told her a number of times and still it '_s wrong .
negative	i booked a hotel at_0am for immediate stay , travelocity booked it for that night .
negative	when confronted couldn_'_t get a supervisor to call me back and travelocity charged me for a night i didn_'_t stay and refused to reimburse_me .
negative	will never use their services again !
negative	the subject says it all .
negative	i have never had such unsatisfactory service as this company provides .
negative	i placed my order on oct . 00 and didn_'_t receive until nov 00 .
negative	it was for 0 parts and one was the incorrect part sent in the correct box .
negative	i sent an_email to customer_support on nov 00 ( since there is no contact number ) and it took until nov 00 to receive a vague reply asking for the order number and part number even_though i had sent that in the original email .
negative	i sent the reply answer on nov 00 and this time i got another vague reply in two_days on nov 00 saying my order was setup for return , that " you will receive an_rma e_- mail in approximately 00 - 00_hours ".
negative	for all the parts or just the one ???
negative	am i supposed to pay shipping for them shipping the incorrect part .
negative	i replied on nov 00 asking this .
negative	once again two_days_later on nov 00 i get a short vague response " only the incorrect part ".
negative	now i have sent another email_asking why i should have to pay return .
negative	it '_ll just be easier to dispute the charges with my bank .
negative	be warned , don_'_t buy from this company !!!!
negative	!
negative	i live all the way in california .
negative	instead of me ordering from amazon i said let_me try car part king .
negative	what the heck did i do that for .
negative	i was waiting for this part to come so i can get my car fixed well i got
negative	a rotor and drum instead of a hub and bearing , you go figure how you get those parts mixed up .
negative	is my car fixed no .
negative	i recently ordered a pair of shoes and a dress .
negative	the shoes came in but i never received the dress .
negative	i called customer_service and reported my problem .
negative	the lady i talked on the phone with said she can '_t give me my money and said she can give me store credit for the dress .
negative	still have not gotten any store credit and it '_s been over 0 days !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i paid_extra for anti_- reflective lenses , which they never put on .
negative	i called to have it fixed .
negative	their customer_service was incompetent , and followed_up my phone_call with an e_- mail asking if i wanted it fixed , and stated they wouldn_'_t start the new pair till i replied ?!
negative	isn_'_t that why i called in the first place ??
negative	that just lost more time in getting what i paid for made and shipped to me .
negative	then they threatened to charge my credit_card for the new pair when they failed to e_- mail over the return packing_slip so i could ship it off !!
negative	this was was by_far one of my worst online experiences .
negative	i will never attempt to buy glasses online again !!
negative	!
negative	i made my hotel reservation that afternoon .
negative	i arrived at the hotel by 0 : 00_pm and the front_desk told me they did not have my reservation .
negative	i checked my email and tried to pull up the voucher but what i got was a page that told me my information was moved or deleted .
negative	i then called both of the phone numbers associated with the company .
negative	00_minutes on hold !
negative	no one ever answered !
negative	they charged my card but never gave_me the reservation .
negative	i wound_up paying the walk in rate at the hotel as i was standing there with my crying 0 year_old who was absolutely finished with being in the car .
negative	the next_day i see a confirmation_email ( time stamp 0 : 00 am !!!!
negative	) sorry bookit . com , too late !
negative	i am disputing the charge with my cc company and telling all of my friends to use a reputable , better organized online service .
negative	i booked 0 rooms at a hotel “ naries namakwa retreat , springbok , south - africa through “ easy to book ” and cancelled it the very next_day .
negative	according to “ easy to book ” i was intitled to a full_refund .
negative	i have never received a refund until this day .
negative	i got screwed out of $_000 . 00 by “ easy to book ”.
negative	also , they don_’ t return your e_- mails or phone_calls .
negative	tel
negative	i tried to order twice from this site .
negative	both_times the racket i ordered was not in stock an order was cancelled .
negative	the second time money was taken from my visa and my order was never despatched .
negative	still not resolved
negative	i planned a trip including hotel , car_rental and airfare .
negative	when i arrived the i was denied the car_rental , therefore i was forced to use a different provider and was charged $_000 . 00 for a car_rental .
negative	this really imposed on my trip , i am very disappointed and don_'_t planonusing travelocity again .
negative	i wish i could say that this was the best fine in a long while , but it '_s not .
negative	like my father in law used to say , " a bargain is not bargain ".
negative	they are a complete_waste as they do not fit the machine as_promised .
negative	this experience with this reservation company is the worst_experience i have ever_encountered .
negative	liars . cheats , and just down right stupid people are at these phone numbers .
negative	i can '_t imagine a company hiring these operators .
negative	on the phone two hours to get a reservation , and this nit wit still couldn_'_t get it right .
negative	these people and company should be closed down .
negative	please see statement above regarding my purchase .
negative	impossible to phone and speak directly with a human_being - this has caused me twice very frustrating problems and frustrating time .
negative	their automating service is also very limited as they do not for see individual issues and one can get stuck and be unable to use it because the system asks you for several reference numbers and not all are provided ( e . g .
negative	card number might have not been posted as yet ).
negative	the telephone system offers you to select a given option if you wish the item to be delivered at a specific date / time .
negative	before asking you to proceed with this option it tells you there is a charge for this service , but does not tell you how much .
negative	after loosing over an_hour looking for a tel number which could allow me to speak to one of their employees , and having tried in vane using their telephone and computer automated_system , i became hugely frustrated as this was preventing me from doing my own work and i was pretty busy on that day .
negative	as frustrated as i was i sent them a complaint via_email explaining the problems i had had , i received no reply on that day .
negative	on the following_day i received a very short acknowledgement that my shipment had reached me .
negative	do they know that because i had been unable to reach them on the previous delivery day and because the item was urgent i had to make all sort of arrangements and had to inconvenience several people so that i could stay in for that specific hour they had set the delivery service at ?
negative	a simple phone_call with one of their employees could have resulted in a very satisfied customer .
negative	i had a similar experience with them last_year when they forgot to write a reference_number on the card they posted to me and i had no way to follow_up their pc or tel automated_system - this is for sure the most frustrating company i have had to deal with .
negative	they save_money putting an automating service but how many customers will this cost them ?
negative	what image and reputation are they building for themselves ?
negative	the car_hire company did not turn up or answer our calls so we did not get a car at all .
negative	i appreciate this in itself is not rental_cars ' fault , however , they have not responded to me at all after 0 attempts to register my complaint by phone and email .
negative	this company cannot take your money and accept no responsibility for the fact that a service was not provided .
negative	i am now £_000 down and the experience spoiled the start to our holiday .
negative	let '_s see if we get a response now , shameful customer_service !
negative	i would not use your services again .
negative	your database didn_'_t even recognize my vin number as a valid bmw number .
negative	my work had to be delayed because the complete order wasn_'_t shipped in a timely_manner .
negative	the packaging was poorly done , i '_m surprised it made it without the box bursting open .
negative	i am done with ebay and paypal .
negative	i haven_'_t sold anything via ebay ( and paypal for probably a year ).
negative	used to do it quite frequently .
negative	i used to enjoy it and never_experienced any_problems .
negative	i wanted to have a little extra_cash for christmas , so sold some perfume via ebay ( as i have done many_times before ).
negative	offered free_shipping to drive up my sales .
negative	sold one for $_00 . 00 and one for $_00 . 00 .
negative	i had numerous problems because my ebay and paypal weren_'_t linked .
negative	got that taken_care of .
negative	got an_email that i needed to ship items .
negative	ebay stated that payment was processing .
negative	i read that monies were completed on the buyer end and it was okay to ship .
negative	i also read that if shipping done through ebay / paypal , it would come out of funds paid from sale and at a discount .
negative	long_story short , i got an_email today that my bank was rejecting attempts from paypal to withdraw funds for the shipping .
negative	i called , spoke to someone with limited command of english , and i am to understand that money will be available up to 00 days from date payment cleared .
negative	fees from ebay , fees from paypal , $_00 . 00 via_paypal for shipping , payment cleared , but i won_'_t get my money til god_knows when .
negative	i '_m pissed .
negative	i feel_like i got screwed by ebay and paypal and i won_'_t use them again .
negative	they can hold their customers money for up to 00 days ( which has cleared and is in their possession ).
negative	i guess you hold all customers funds long enough , it can add up to a pretty penny in interest .
negative	it '_s crooked , it '_s wrong and i don_'_t have to do_business with them anymore and i won_'_t .
negative	it was good while it lasted , but it ain '_t good anymore .
negative	it stinks !
negative	all disgusting !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	could not digest anything do not buy !
negative	i cannot_believe a ten minute call , at my expense , to change my booking can warrant a £_00 fee .
negative	i will not be booking through your company again , and as i travel frequently the uk and my family and friends do the same from the ukl to france you have lost a valuable customer .
negative	i was lied to by reservation_counter when i made a reservation .
negative	when i called to cancel , the person i spoke with was extremely_rude , sarcastic , and condescending .
negative	i will never use this site to book my hotels and will tell_everyone i know to not use this site .
negative	after_reading several bad_reviews on different websites i thought i ' d give it a go any way as i , like many , need to spread out the costs of christmas and several birthdays all coming together .
negative	i was approved for the repayment scheme and so sat back and waited thinking i ' d managed to get all my shopping done .
negative	.
negative	0_weeks_later i contacted isme to see what was happening with my order to be told that no confirmation had come through for my order and that i should wait to see what happened .
negative	wait !
negative	how long !!
negative	it was a general letter blaming other departments and i am not impressed .
negative	where did i put the watchdog email address ?
negative	i would not recommend this company for any reason .
negative	i bought a costume for my son that is too small and they will not even exchange it for me or give a refund .
negative	the return_policy states that sale items aren_'_t refunded but that isn_'_t clear until after you purchase .
negative	i called to see what could be done and they wouldn_'_t help at all so i wasted my money and will never use them again .
negative	my husband and i decided to book a hotel a few_days ago .
negative	i could tell that i was talking to a foreign call_center ..
negative	i think india . during booking on phone , the lady said that if i needed to cancel my reservation to do so before july 0 , 0000 ( she meant aug 0 .. july 0 has obviously passed this was know the 0rd time i corrected her on the date ) if i canceled before aug0 , there would be no penalty .
negative	well , the next_day my daughter caught a nasty bug .. so we decided to cancel our reservation .
negative	when i called to cancel , i got a man this time but seems from same out of country .
negative	he put me on hold and said that he was going to call the hotel .
negative	he came back on the phone , and said that the hotel was not answering and to try and call back .
negative	he did say that the hotels policy is that they can cancel without_penalty if the cancellation is due to a medical condition or something unforeseen .
negative	so i thought well .. great !
negative	well , i called back on monday ( today ) to cancel , since he couldn_'_t get a hold of the hotel manager yesterday .
negative	i told the lady that i had called a day prior to cancel , and explained the above to her .
negative	she put me on hold to call the hotel .
negative	she came back on after several minutes , and said that the hotel could not cancel because i would have had to call before july 0 , 0000 .
negative	i corrected this lady too .. we are passed july 0 ... do you mean aug 0 ?
negative	she said .. oh sorry ..
negative	i mean aug 0 .
negative	i said , it '_s july_00th , not passed the 0rd yet .
negative	she said , yes i know .. but you needed to cancel before 0 days of your check in time ..
negative	i said .. i am calling 0 days before not on the 0th day !
negative	i don_'_t understand what the problem is .
negative	i was told when i made my reservation that i would have to call and cancel before aug 0 to avoid any penalties .. she said " who told you that " i said your call_center told me that !
negative	i have it written down as i was being given the information !
negative	she said that the hotel could not cancel , and the the money already charged on my card is non_refundable .
negative	i was furious !
negative	i told the lady ..
negative	i am going to call the hotel myself .
negative	i called the hotel , and i was friendly and courteous .. and i told the lady the situation .. that i needed to cancel due to my daughters illness , and she said that i would need to cancel through_expedia , and that the money was non_refundable .
negative	i told her that no where on their website or expedia '_s , or the person taking my reservation tell me there was a non_refundable fee .
negative	i was told there would be no penalty , and especially_since this was an unforeseen illness .
negative	she said that i would have to take it up with expedia .
negative	so i thought to myself .. no ..
negative	i am going to take it up with my bank .. stop the transaction .
negative	luckily .. my bank is able to kick out the transaction as soon as it goes into " processing " thank_god !
negative	so now i am going to call expedia back and make_sure they cancel my reservation ..
negative	i don_'_t even want to discuss money .. that is already resolved .
negative	they are not going to get one dime from me not ever .
negative	do not ever book with expedia .
negative	a
negative	this company is a joke !
negative	everything from online to customer_service !
negative	had a very expensive package arriving .
negative	tracked the package online to see that it would be delivered while i was not home .
negative	thought it very convenient that for $ 0 they would give me the option to chose a delivery time !
negative	awesome right ..... no !!!!!
negative	sat at home between the 0 hour delivery window .... for nothing !
negative	package never arrived .
negative	so i called customer_service , where they told me that they were not able to deliver during that time because they didn_'_t have anyone available to deliver !
negative	what ?!?!
negative	are you a delivery company ?
negative	and did you not just give me that option online ?
negative	idiots !
negative	anyway ..... she continues to tell me not to worry that they will deliver the following_morning ( saturday ).
negative	i ask her if that is really the case with a sturdy delivery , and she guarantees it will be here between 00am - 00pm .
negative	i wait .... and wait .... once again ... nothing !
negative	call customer_service again only to hear that the package was never put on the truck for delivery ( no one knows why ), and that it won_'_t be delivered till tuesday between 0pm - 0pm !
negative	really ?!!!!
negative	i just want to scream !
negative	what a joke , and a run_around !
negative	at this point i am so frustrated that i say i want a refund for the $ 0 dollars i paid in order to make a request , that obviously never happened !
negative	he says he can '_t help me and gives me the number to billing .
negative	i call billing .... sit on the phone on hold for 00_minutes .... explain my whole situation again ..... only to be told that they can '_t help me , that i have to request the refund online !!!
negative	frustrated , i follow the instructions online !
negative	fill_out the whole stupid form ..... only to be told ....." due to service failure - sorry , we are currently unable to process your request .
negative	please try again later "!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	so basically every_aspect of this company sucks !!!
negative	their online that gave_me the option to make a request that was obviously not available .
negative	their shipping crew who are not available to make a delivery when they said they would .
negative	their warehouse crew who cannot seem to put a package in the truck that is suppose to be delivered .
negative	their customer_service who a . hardly understood or spoke_english , b . who cannot tell me the truth about my package , c . who cannot process a refund !
negative	and finally their online customer_service who apparently are a " service failure "..... but that i knew ... before they even told me !!!!
negative	!
negative	excellent chair and table , appalling customer_service !
negative	i bought a swimsuit from this company a few_months_ago and let_me tell you it was my first buy and my last !!!.
negative	i payed like 00 dollars plus shipping which tells that you will receive it in a week and you get it like 0 months later ....
negative	i dont_know how many_times i called this company and the same girl always answered me and she treated me like if i was trash she yelled at me , lied to me and treated me the worst way anyone has treated me before , once i got mad and told her to go f *** herself and that stupid company she worked for because this stupid company wouldnt give me a tracking_number neither would tell me where my package was ... first they told me it was in backorder .. and then they kept on lying saying they will return my calls i was so sad becuase i actually didnt even get to put the swimsuit on the days that i went to vacation .... ladies if you are thinking of buying from this site dont do it unless you want trouble trust me this site has worst costumer_service and they lie constantly .....
negative	they play with people '_s money and that isnt fair ...
negative	they dont even know how to run business becuase if they did things like they are suppoused to they will get lotsss of buyers ..
negative	but like i said they play with your money and im not the only one that says it ... dont buy from here ever ... buy somewhere_else maybe you wont get clothes so cheap but you will receive them on time and how you want them ... at the end i did receive the swimsuit but 0 months later i didnt even wanted it anymore but w . e i decided not to return it because it would be more trouble ....
negative	not buying from here again , every time has_been a fail .
negative	it took a very long time to receive my glasses , but i thought for the price it would be worth it .
negative	when i received my glasses i couldn_'_t see out of them at all .
negative	they were not my prescription .
negative	i '_ve been trying to contact someone to return them and have had no luck .
negative	i had to get another pair ( using the same prescription ) at another location for the same price and love my new glasses .
negative	just wish i could get my money back .
negative	part ordered was wrong part , paid shipping to receive it and to return it .
negative	will have to wait 00 days for credit .
negative	never have this problem when i go to local parts store .
negative	i will never make this mistake again .
negative	i booked a room and told them i would use another credit_card or pay cash when we got there and it was already charged to my card when we checked in .
negative	very decietful
negative	was a 0st time buyer ... but did not allow me to get 0st time buyers discount ($_00 . 00 ) or free_shipping ($ 0 . 00 ) because i was using a groupon ...( like a gift_card ).
negative	all they offered me was a refund of the $ 0 . 00 shipping ).
negative	what about my $_00 . 00 ?
negative	i was a 0st time customer !
negative	then when my things arrived ... they packed boxed cat_litter with food .
negative	litter came out of corners and edges of its container and was all over in the box .
negative	this made my pet_food ... which were in bags ... smell like scented cat_litter .
negative	very dissatisfied with this company .
negative	i will not use again .
negative	i booked with flighthub because they had a seat available that i liked .
negative	unbeknownst to me , that seat was a handicap designated seat that flighthub was not authorized to sell .
negative	only jetblue could assign that seat !!!!
negative	very deceiving !!
negative	!
negative	i had a most unpleasant experience .
negative	i booked a flt but unfortunately did not view the sent itenirary until a day or two before my flight and to my dismay , it was not the time i had selected .
negative	i wasted more than two hrs being put on hold and then being disconnected without_any positive results .
negative	just once , since it was an_emergency , the mistake could have been corrected and waiving the fee .
negative	my grandmother died at about the time i was arriving on the later flight .
negative	despite their service " guarantee " of delivering tickets of the same quality or better in case of ticket order problems , not only did they not give me the tickets i paid for 0 months in advance , but they just refunded my money 00_hours prior to the concert date without previous notice !
negative	and worse even , despite my repeated explanation of how these tickets were a christmas_present for my 0 year_old daughter and them still having tickets offered for sale on their website , they did not deliver on their guarantee .
negative	worse experience ever .
negative	do not recommend !!
negative	!
negative	i have a prescription off plus 0 , they claimed that they could make my glasses and at almost_half off the high_street price ... however after 0_weeks of contacting them asking for an update they eventually informed me that they cannot make my glasses to the spec they claimed !
negative	also i have not received an_email where they answer a question .. they brush you off and then thank_you for using their service ( never again )
negative	lastly when i agreed to buy just the frames , they sent me an invoice stating that the frames were £_00 dearer then stated on their web_site !
negative	and they still have not refunded the £_000 they still owe me .... i am very disappointed as i can not see without glasses .
negative	avoid beware do not use !!!!
negative	!
negative	my phone did not pass and they wouldn_'_t return it , i could have used it as a camera / ipod !
negative	it was a galaxy_s0 so now im out of pocket !!!
negative	mazuma_mobile were amazing .
negative	i will never use envirofone again !
negative	!
negative	have been trying to get these for 0_weeks !
negative	daughter graduates saturday ... called monday and said they should be shipped that day ... however , these were not shipped thursday with 0 - 0 day delivery and i informed them monday i need them no later than saturday :(.
negative	grrr
negative	we drove up to hotel and what appeared to be ladies of the night standing off to the side .
negative	while we were sitting in our car we watched cars pull on and things being handed in windows and then cars pulled out .
negative	the hotel is not in a very good area .
negative	we were afraid to stay there or the family to be around this .
negative	we left quickly
negative	never received cleanser , will not reply to my e_- mails and never answer the phone , i have had to raise a claim with pay - pal .
negative	will never use again .
negative	i purchased a part from december_00th 0000 and it is now january 0th 0000 still_haven_'_t receive my part yet .
negative	aggravating , pissed what '_s taking so long
negative	if i could give them zero_stars i would .
negative	i ordered an item on nov . 00 and was told it would arrive in 00 days .
negative	on nov . 00 i received an_email_saying that it had just been shipped from australia ( i live in the u . s .).
negative	i got another email assuring me it would arrive by dec . 00 -- it '_s still not here .
negative	i am hoping it will arrive by christmas since it was supposed to be a gift .
negative	they told me it was coming via_ups but supplied no tracking_number so i can '_t even find out where it is .
negative	either they are dishonest or tremendously disorganized - either way a bad choice for consumers .
negative	i ordered 0 mega bulb suspension lamps on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	i received both lamps on 00 / 00 / 00 , yes 00 months later .
negative	after opening , i discovered one of the lamps shattered during transportation .
negative	immediately , i sent an_email to request a replacement since there is not an english_speaking option on the international number .
negative	after about 00 emails over the course of another 0 months , i finally received my replacement lamp on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	yes , this company did sent a replacement however the process in order for me to receive a new product like i paid for took an extensive amount of time and frustration .
negative	i will never order from this vendor again .
negative	i ordered parts the first time i will take the blame for the wrong part .
negative	so instead of sending it back i planned on just eating the cost .
negative	i took my time made sure it was the correct_part and ordered once again .
negative	when it came surprise it was the wrong thing .
negative	the numbers don_'_t even match to the part i ordered .
negative	i filled out the customer number never got an answer .
negative	so i went directly to gm where i should have gone first .
negative	so please learn from my mistake .
negative	never i mean never use this company !
negative	i bought a copy of black_ops 0 via_paypal ( credcard backup ) and it was cleared instantly out of my account .
negative	i waited a day and ended_up having to buy 0 more copies ( they were prizes on my youtube ) as my first still was listed as " awaiting payment "
negative	another day goes past and i put in a support_ticket which took 0 day alone to get an " auto response " asking me to give them my order number and email which i had already done the moment i opened a ticket .
negative	0 more days go past and i send them a furious reply , and i finally get my game .
negative	terrible service , have been using cjs for nearly a year , i will not be using them anymore .
negative	awful customer_service and worst_experience ever .
negative	i would not recommend this company
negative	don_'_t bother with the express terminal service - they don_'_t deliver .
negative	left us at airport with three kids at 0 am and when the bus finally got us there were three seats for four of us .
negative	claimed they were understaffed but when we arrived there were three office workers - as well as bus drivers and parking_lot staff .
negative	obviously the management feels they are too superior to help with actual labor and drive a car over to the terminal .
negative	too bad , there seems to be lots of competition .
negative	next time we will use " parking_spot " - they had a strong presence .
negative	i ordered a pair of white and pink mizuno trainers last_week , they arrived on the date that they were suppose to friday 00th , however when they arrived they were the completely wrong ones , they were iluminous pink green and pink ( unwearable ) as i live in the country it is a big hassle to actually return products so i had to make a special journey out just to take these to the nearest collect shop .
negative	i have since had no feedback and no replacement trainers .
negative	very unhappy with the service
negative	the hotel that we booked in tifton ga was supposed to be a smoking_room with a king_bed however when we arrived we had no choice except to be put in a non_smoking_room with double_beds on our_honeymoon no less .
negative	the pillows were hard and pancake flat .
negative	the towels were the size of a standard pillow_case and when i asked for an extra the manager was rude !
negative	the door lock was falling_off the wall as well as the tub knobs and as if that wasnt crappy enough there was zero hot_water .
negative	it took over a week just to get back $_00 of $_00 . 00 there was no fridge no microwave no bible and no phone book .
negative	it was not at all what we booked .
negative	i have not received my order and have emailed pure_health and got no response back so i had to file in the resolution center and still have not heard from you .
negative	mary
negative	i am very unhappy with this site as i did not receive my order wouldn_'_t use this site again
negative	i would never shop at superdry ever again
negative	i was told i would get a refund after gc rescue rep called vendor to inquire where electronic gc was used ( in another_state as an in store purchase ).
negative	now i get an_email from gc rescue saying what is the best way to contact you to ' resolve ' this .
negative	it was resolved over a week_ago and i get an_email_saying we need to resolve this ?
negative	what a day , i finally saw the delivery truck at the top of my driveway !
negative	apperently he had driven down once and not knowing if he was in the right place , had returned to the top of the driveway .
negative	on my grass and not the wide driveway .
negative	having not called for directions the day before making the delivery or at_least an_hour or so , which i clearly put phone first !
negative	( he phoned about 0 minutes before coming to my house ) he had to resort to going through my mailbox to see if i lived here .!
negative	i was fortunately at home , but could easily have been out .
negative	not being good at reversing , he decide to back all the way to the main road and asked me to see him out .
negative	i have never had to do this before for anyone standing in a very busy road and dodging traffic .
negative	he said there was not room to turn_around but all other drivers have been able to .
negative	this experience left me with frazzled nerves and ruined my day .
negative	boiler_juice i may not order from you again !
negative	i ordered glasses on the jan . 0 and this is feb 0 , 0000 and no glasses and no correspondence as to the status of my order .
negative	poor customer_service .
negative	we had no_issues with the vehicle - however , the staff in venice at the piazza roma location could use a course in how to handle customers .
negative	they were very nonchalant , and did not offer a map or ask if we needed any assistance with getting outside venice .- we had to ask .
negative	i have used other_vendors and they actually walk you to the car and review things with you - here they pointed to a vehicle up the street and said -" there '_s your car ."
negative	it seemed an impostion to take_care of the rental papers .
negative	just seemed very cold and uncaring .
negative	also , they advised there would be extra_charges but could nto advise what they were for .
negative	( we had added 0 additional drivers but it did not add up to what they advised i would owe ).
negative	i will not suggest or use this service again .
negative	i have purchased 0 times from ebayers who have used my hermes .
negative	item 0 & 0 .
negative	items arrived 0_weeks after arrival_date .
negative	lots of messing_about emailing sellers , asking for tracking codes , and waiting and hanging on to see if they did arrive .
negative	item 0 .
negative	arrived 0_weeks late , ceramics , was completely smashed .
negative	item 0 .
negative	never arrived at all , then the company lied and said that they had delivered so i was not even eligible for a refund .
negative	all in all ...
negative	unreliable , unprofessional and dishonest
negative	the prices are cheap but so are the goods .
negative	it '_s always a gamble as to whether the items will be of a good enough quality .
negative	customer_services operate like a machine not a human_being .
negative	i requested an exchange as the sizes are so small but was completely ignored and was issued a refund , as its my second dissatisfied experience with boohoo i decided i wouldn_'_t bother to reorder .
negative	this was my first order with petflow . com .
negative	i received a box with my partial order .
negative	there was no packing_slip or any indication what was going on with the rest of my order .
negative	finally , a few_days_later i received a 0nd box which again had no packing sheet or any info .
negative	i had ordered 0 dog braid chews and only received one .
negative	not worth the hassle or expense to get my 0nd dog chew .
negative	i will not do_business with this company again .
negative	when i placed my order on 0 / 0 , i upped the delivery option to expedited_shipping ( 0 - 0 business days ).
negative	yesterday was the 0th business day and the items ordered still have not been delivered .
negative	it was not a large order , but i expected much_better service in the delivery of these items .
negative	if my cat likes these items and lives long enough that i need more , i will order through amazon , which has a much_better record of speedy_delivery .
negative	0 month for part to arrive after dozens of phone_calls , then quoted incorrect price , finally part arrived and was wrong part .
negative	i ordered an alternator for my older volvo after previously ordering a much_cheaper part from partsgeek .
negative	( a relay ) the alternator arrived incomplete and with no invoice or shipping information , let_alone any information for making a return or customer_support .
negative	i referred to their website for customer_service and found they have none !
negative	do not ever expect to talk to a live human at this company .
negative	they offer no phone_number or address to contact and instead work through a series of " take a number " and universal emails that contain no real information .
negative	i don_'_t trust this company enough to send the part back and hope for a refund ( there instructions say to wait up to 00 days and then contact them with question for return refunds .... how the hell are we supposed to contact you jerks !?)
negative	don_'_t waste you money with the no service sneaky company .
negative	it sucks i guess because it does not show the us money wise how you are going to charge their credit_cards !
negative	very unhappy with the fact that my never got processed on your end after showing it on my end do to a computer issue
negative	my tea plants did arrive promptly but were tiny with a few branches or even just one branch with less_than a dozen leaves , huge disappointment , will not order from bb again -- $_00 for a tiny plant ?
negative	and you have inundated my emails and web interface with your ceaseless advertising .
negative	i feel_like i am being stalked , not being thanked for being a customer .
negative	bad_experience .
negative	this was my first experience booking with travelocity , and i can '_t say that i '_ll be a returning customer .
negative	when i submitted my reservation it popped back saying the price had increased and asked if i wanted to proceed .
negative	i did , so i clicked the button .
negative	there was a glitch in their system and instead of authorizing the charge twice ($ 0 charge to see if there is sufficient funds in the account ), they fully charged me twice .
negative	each charge was around $ 0 , 000 .
negative	multiple phone_calls were made each day , and it took nearly a week to to get my money back .
negative	during one of the last phone_calls i made , the customer_service representative was extremely_rude and told me it was my fault i was charged twice .
negative	i called to make a complaint about my experience , and all they could offer was a $_00 voucher for my next booking .
negative	it seemed a worthless exchange considering all the trouble i had experienced .
negative	purchased a book , payment cleared , then several days_later , i '_m told the book wasn_'_t even available for purchase .
negative	i was refunded .
negative	but if the book was unavailable , it should not have been listed for purchase in the first place .
negative	my order was two_weeks late , and i sent them back .
negative	that was months_ago , i have tried to call and email , but i still havent got my money back .
negative	dont order from this webbsite .
negative	!
negative	ordered all replacement cartridges , one totally brand_new , will not work
negative	same as above .
negative	it is fraudulent
negative	on 00 :_00am , monday , june 00 , 0000 my new husband and i arrived at the albq .
negative	airport to travel to madrid , spain .
negative	upon trying to check in , we were told our tickets were invalid because we would arrive later than our connecting_flight left .
negative	we called flight_hub and iberia multiple_times , each of which said it was the other '_s fault .
negative	the story as i understand it , flight was changed , so we were changed to the 0am flight , but never notified .
negative	iberia said it alerted flight_hub , but flight_hub never alerted us and even while dealing_with agent on phone , our reservation still showed we were supposed to take off at 00 :_00pm from abq .
negative	an agent , edwin , apologized and tried to get us a new flight .
negative	first saying he would try for the next_day , then monday_night , then said he needed a supervisor '_s help and he ' d call within a couple hours .
negative	four hours_later , he still hadn_'_t called , so we called back .
negative	we went to bed without it being resolved .
negative	the next ( tuesday ) morning , while on hold , a new reservation email for wednesday popped_up .
negative	it said to confirm with the airline , so we called iberia , they confirmed , then called flight_hub and confirmed again .
negative	the next_day ..... no reservation with american .
negative	we had no reservation number for them .
negative	we had a flight from chicago to madrid and back , but no domestic flights to get us to and from chicago .
negative	after over two hours talking to iberia , the american_airlines counter , flight_hub , and american reservations line , we had missed our flight and had the flight to madrid canceled due to " no show ".
negative	back and forth , mostly on hold for another 0 . 0 hrs , elijah came on and said all he could offer was to refund the tickets and then we could make new reservations .
negative	we were refunded the cost of the original ticket , but the fact we lost four days of our_honeymoon , lost hotel reservations , so much added frustration , two_days spent in the airport was never addressed .
negative	do not use flight_hub !!!
negative	!
negative	i booked my hotel through priceline for 0 nights , to realize after the fact that the hotel website advertised the room for 00 $ less_than priceline .
negative	i called priceline the agent i spoke to after " searching " for the hotel website for 00_min told me ok your all set .
negative	had to call for the second time the agent says you have to fax us the receipts .
negative	i did then i got an_email_saying i need a folio ok that '_s great but i don_'_t have it because i should of been told by the first agent what i needed in order to get my refund to begin with !
negative	!
negative	the third time i call the agent goes well i '_m telling you now what you need .
negative	moral of the story the worse experience i will never use priceline they are not the cheapest !!!
negative	i didn_'_t even_bother getting my refund all the hassle is not worth 00 $
negative	i ordered a bouquet of stargazer lilies called " lilly blush " for a friend in germany who just suffered the death of her spouse .
negative	the description is below .
negative	" this modern , sweet - smelling , and passionate bouquet makes for a surprising delight .
negative	more about this bouquet :
negative	this bouquet of pink flowers features pink lilies ( stargrazers ) and matching greenery ."
negative	scentless orange lilies were sent as a replacement .
negative	i was not contacted due to the six hour time difference .
negative	i '_ve sent multiple e_- mails about my concerns and each time they sent a response quoting their policy .
negative	their 000_% satisfaction guarantee has not been honored .
negative	this website is crazy .
negative	for the last 0 years i was trying to purchase a specific style of suit .
negative	for the last two years the web sit state there are over five in each size of these suits , and for the lat two years i have received emails after 0 - 0 days stating these suits are not even in their stock .
negative	i hate this company !!!!!!!!
negative	they need to go away for good !
negative	no line , no need to wait while all other rental_car companies had long lines - good thing or raise flag ??
negative	car somewhat clean as if it was handed_over from previous renter .
negative	new car , comfortable yes but rental company should keep_up with the cars services .
negative	my car kept flashing oil service needed , tire_pressure low , tire sensor fault ...
negative	so much that i got a flat_tire and had to change it to the spare tire .
negative	could have been worst and i thank_god it was not .
negative	ez rental don_'_t honor your own car insurance ( even if its a us company ), if pre_- paid gasoline make_sure you use it up cause they wont credit you back any un - use gas .
negative	in my opinion if ez does not take_care of this problems their lines will_continue to be empty and not for great service but for the above mentioned .
negative	great customer_satisfaction is key - for great business satisfaction .
negative	manager - no where in site ..... just a simple who_cares " sorry " and carry on .
negative	its a shame .
negative	i really shouldn_'_t have to be made to give a star for this type of mediocure service and for my opinion on service to be visible to other potential renters who don_'_t see the raised flags .
negative	i would never send anything to opticfast again .
negative	it has_been over a month that they have had my glasses .
negative	there '_s no customer_service if anything goes_wrong , they sent me this rating service to fill_out and i '_ve been trying to get in touch for nearly four days waiting for a reply
negative	i really liked the skype until my account was hacked by someone in russia .
negative	luckily , i caught it before they racked up too much , under_$_000 , but despite all of my efforts i could not get in touch with any type of customer_service from skype .
negative	i just wanted to make_sure this would never happen again , but they obvsiouly had no interest in helping their customers , even when they are the victim .
negative	i will never use skype again for this reason .
negative	i cannot trust a company that will allow my information to be hacked and then provide no customer_service to console me .
negative	my parts are broken open box to open package the vent for back broken
negative	ordered a prescription_diet - they did not contact the vet as they said they would to confirm prescription and after several days of no shipment confirmation , emailed the prescription .
negative	then was told the order , which contained other foods , was to be sent that day .
negative	i received the other products - but no prescription_diet ; the shipment confirmation_email had the prescription_diet listed as being in the shipment .
negative	i contacted petflow that the prescription_diet had not been received - was told it would be sent that day and a shipment confirmation would be sent .
negative	no confirmation of shipment received .
negative	emailed asking for status ( has now been almost 0weeks since order originally placed ) - and was told item was back ordered with no projected date for delivery .
negative	not the way to run a business - especially a prescription_diet for a dog that has to eat only this .
negative	fortunately , i had enough food and obtained the diet elsewhere .
negative	would not recommend this site for prescription diets - they should of notified me immediately that the food was not available !!!
negative	!
negative	i can '_t_believe any company would have use email as their only contact to customer_service !
negative	and that takes days ... ridiculous !!
negative	i will be filing a claim with the better business_bureau citing my grievances with your company !
negative	i have never ordered prescription_glasses online but being that i tried these glasses on at my doctors_office first i knew they would fit .
negative	when i received my glasses they were so stretched that they would fall off my face .
negative	i called to complain but was told to take them somewhere to be adjusted .
negative	i was skeptical that this would work but i took them in anyways .
negative	immediately the doctors_office told me that the frames could not be adjusted enough to work .
negative	i compared the frames they had with the frame i had and it was obvious that the frames were damaged .
negative	i called frames_direct again and was told to send them back so they could adjust them when these frames should be replaced not adjusted .
negative	this has_been a huge in incidence for me .
negative	when you pay over $_000 for a pair of glasses better care needs to be taken
negative	i ordered clothes for my holiday .
negative	delivery was late .
negative	i emailed customer_services but no one replied back .
negative	so i left without it .
negative	now i am back and found that i was sent the wrong_size skirt j ordered was size 0 and i received size00 and i already missed my 00 refund time .
negative	i had worse online experience !!
negative	!
negative	have sent my parcel to be returned 0_weeks_ago and have not heard_anything from boohoo to see if they have receive it .
negative	i have sent 0 emails and i am not getting the answer i need .
negative	if there was an option of no stars i would choose that !
negative	i will never use priceline again , i am booking them for my honeymoon and they wont allow me to extend my stay without paying 000 $!!
negative	they are essentially getting more money because the new flight would be more_expensive !!
negative	rude !
negative	way to ruin my honeymoon this coming october !

negative	they have started trying to force people to put their banking info on there or else they won_'_t allow the transactions to go through .
negative	it should be illegal to do that and am sure they have some way around it , but it made me go away from them since that time .
negative	instead of rewarding the customers for their loyalty and patronage , they try to jerk you around .
negative	very very bad business_ethics or basically no ethics at all .
negative	when i went on line , it said i would have 00_%_off for booking on line , and never did i pay up front the full cos i ' am think of canceling altogether !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

negative	right cars rental used in glasgow for a weekend hire , through_argus hire .
negative	quite a distance off site of the airport .
negative	when we arrived to collect the car we were told there was a £_000 deposit required which apparently was detailed on the conditions of rental .
negative	if anyone can point them out to me i would be really interested to see where it is detailed !
negative	with 0 young_children arriving at 0 pm on a friday and needing to drive 0 hours i needed the car so didn_'_t have much of a choice but to pay the deposit which i was assured would be returned 0 or 0 days after return of the vehicle .
negative	car was returned on time , filled with petrol and with no additional damage .
negative	over a month later the £_000 still has not been returned .
negative	i have mailed and tried to call but to no_avail .
negative	not sure what my next option is but for those wanting to hire a car , pay a little extra and go for a brand_name you can trust .
negative	don_'_t make the mistake i did .
negative	avoid right cars
negative	there is always hoops that you have to jump_through to use your points !
negative	you should be able to use them whenever !
negative	ink ran_out after two uses of one page each time
negative	i got my glasses after a month of waiting , the quality is terrible , i '_ve ordered form the cheap websites before and was happy , but these i couldn_'_t even see out of .... yuk , terrible don_'_t use them .
negative	i '_m cutting my losses on that 00_bucks it '_s not worth dealing_with them , they won_'_t even communicate with you ....
negative	order number 0000000
negative	track it states delivered 0 november_0000 00 . 00 gmt
negative	timing seems unlikely
negative	no garments received so unable to comment .
negative	my order of 00 / 00 / 0000 didn_'_t arrive and i don_'_t had reply from my e_- mails about that order .
negative	spent 00 days and i don_'_t had return , i don_'_t know what to do !
negative	was $_00 , 00 order #_000000000 .
negative	i trusted in your services and now the only_thing i got is a financial loss .
negative	what a pain in the a ## to work with partsgeek !!
negative	i can never reach them by phone & they don_'_t let you know when you send in an_email ticket that you have x amount of email tickets - therefore , since i used up my email tickets i cannot communicate with them at all !!!
negative	consequently i have not received my order as i am now required to contact my credit_card company to give pgeek approval to ship to another address .
negative	how stupid is that !!?
negative	?
negative	they should tell the customer - me - these little stupid rules before i go & waste my time !
negative	!
negative	i have been trying to return my part for the refund for the core_charge and try to exchange another part that i ordered wrong .
negative	i keep getting the same email back saying they will send instructions on how to do it but i never get any .
negative	i can see why you do not have a phone_number to be reached at you dont want to talk to anyone_who has a complaint .
negative	i will be talking to someone on what i can do to get my money back
negative	having purchased an item on 00 / 0 / 00 and only wearing it a few time found that it had a fault , the stitching on the item ( abigail zip front hooded contrast onesie ) had a double row of holes along the stitching edge and was return to you by post on the 0 / 00 / 00 with a copy of proof of postage receipt and am still_waiting for a reply or refund which i am entitle to as the item was fault but as today ’_s date 0 / 00 / 00 have not received any other reply than your automatic email_saying customer_service will deal with this matter as soon as possible and never have , i am still_waiting
negative	do not go near this florist .
negative	my boyfriend bought me what he hoped would be a lovely bouquet of red roses for valentine '_s day .
negative	they were supposed to be delivered early on the day but did not arrive until later because of delivery issues and were left on the doorstep .
negative	i did not arrive home until late in the day and was no_indication on the packaging which way up the box was supposed to be so when i found them they were actually upside_down and the tops of the roses were squashed .
negative	aside from this , it was evident that the roses were tatty and not fresh .
negative	three_days_later they look ready to go in the bin .
negative	my friend bought me some from a well know supermarket chain the same day for a fraction of the price , which still look lovely and probably have at_least a few_days left in them ( you expect 0 days from fresh flowers ).
negative	my boyfriend is so disappointed as he would not have picked these out by hand .
negative	you assume if you order from a florist that the flowers will be fresh and better quality than petrol station forecourts or supermarkets , but these are not .
negative	they were not even competent enough to include the correct valentine '_s card design which my boyfriend had carefully picked out and instead it says ' gift_card ' on the front which totally ruins that it '_s supposed to be a valentine '_s card !
negative	thanks iflorist for ruining what was supposed to be a lovely valentine '_s surprise from my other half .
negative	when we ordered our bathroom we specifically chose items that were in stock and could be delivered within a few_days .
negative	this is because we are renting out the property where the bathroom is to be fitted so we have a short_period in which to fit it .
negative	i was not happy to receive a email booking my delivery date for 0st july !!!
negative	that is almost a month away .
negative	to be fair to vp i have not spoken to them about it yet and i am still hoping this can be sorted .
negative	i did try to phone but got the usual " your call is in a queue blah_blah .....".
negative	fingers_crossed it will be sorted or i will have to cancel the order .
negative	update - i have tried to call them today , after a number of abandoned attempts yesterday , and decided to stick it out and wait for my call to be answered .
negative	i finally gave up after one hour !!!!!
negative	frustrated doesn_'_t even begin to cover it .
negative	i ordered a door_handle replacement and they sent me the wrong door_handle .
negative	i '_ve had to crawl back and forth from the back seat to get into my car as i wait for another handle .
negative	very frustrating .
negative	still_waiting for order from chemist_direct , bit of advice , do not contact them in an_emergency .
negative	paid for next_day delivery 0 days ago !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered some flip_flops , nothing special , but to be delivered to my work address .
negative	the courier company superdry use didn_'_t hang_around for me to sign for the parcel and it went missing for 0 days !
negative	while superdry '_s responses were quick , my details were passed_onto so many people !
negative	i had calls from everyone !
negative	i contacted the company to complain_about their courier , they told me it was superdry '_s issue , superdry say it '_s not their fault !
negative	a pathetic half hearted apology from superdry who continue to have the cheek to send me daily emails !
negative	would never order online again !
negative	terrible service !
negative	i recently booked a hotel through priceline for a specific nightly rate .
negative	when i got to the hotel , i was charged an_additional non_- optional ' resort_fee ' of $_00 per_night which was not disclosed to me until i was there checking in .
negative	this fee was assessed whether i chose to use the resort facilities or not .
negative	priceline said that hotels can charge additional_fees and that this is in the fine_print of their agreement so i had not recourse .
negative	so buyer_beware .
negative	i felt taken_advantage of .
negative	we ordered a case of wine and were charged $_00 for shipping took over a week for the shipment to go out , then another 0 days to reach our house .
negative	my regular company was out of my food so i ordered from pet_flow even_though it was more_expensive than my usual place .
negative	my food was delivered to the wrong_address .
negative	i was getting ready to go to the store for emergency supplies when my neighbor who had been out of town for the holidays brought it to me .
negative	not a happy_camper .
negative	i paid $_00 for the card to be sent overnight .
negative	the card arrived 0 days_later .
negative	i ordered stuff from petflow and then ordered other stuff from around the same area and i got the other stuff long before i got the things i ordered from petflow will not order from them again if the service is that slow .
negative	had been a customer for several_years and was happy however , when i called one day regarding my pets prescription food they had no_clue about the vet even_though i had given them this information several_times over the years ( they had the rx on file ) and the food had been getting shipped to me .
negative	i asked to speak to a supervisor and was told different " stories " each time as to why one was not available .
negative	i lost faith in this company .
negative	they gave_me the run_around and treated me badly on the phone .
negative	i have found it much_easier to order through my vet even_though it cost a bit more it is worth it to avoid all the stress and lies from a company that had my information and then told me that they " had lost it ".
negative	i tried petflow when amazon was out of my cat_food .
negative	i ordered on the 0th and when i contacted them on the 00th about my order , they had not even placed my order yet !!!!
negative	i was advised that i would receive my order on the 00th and i received a manilla envelope w_/ samples from their promotional club " spoiled_rotten " club .
negative	i contacted them again and was told that they were out if stock and that they would have to get my order from another warehouse and that it would be the next week before they could ship my order .
negative	it is now the00th and i received a text stating that my order would be here on the 00nd .
negative	what was suppose to be 0 to 0 days has now turned into 00 days . informed that they were out of stock and that they would ship the next week .
negative	i received a text from them on the 00th stating that they would deliver my product on the 00nd , 00 days from my order date .
negative	what was suppose to take 0 to 0 days , turned into a joke .
negative	the customer_service department told me something different every time i called and did not seem to know what was in stock and not .
negative	maybe additional training is needed in customer_service and inventory / quality control .
negative	when i voiced my concern about their service and asked for the current 00_%_off that they are currently offering , i was told that they could not do that but they did offer me a $_00 credit on my next order ( as if i will ever order from this company again ).
negative	horrible experience and no effort was made to keep me as a customer .
negative	still_waiting for the dog_food i ordered last_week
negative	i didn_'_t know when my stuff was coming casue never sent tracking and the shipping for the item is too much , but when got refund for an item they didnt ' have was just $ 0 . 00 .
negative	i only found out that item wasn_'_t going to be shipped because i emailed them about why i still_haven_'_t received it .
negative	probably will be last time i order from amiclub_wear .
negative	don_'_t even get me started .
negative	from the time the agent answered the phone until he hung_up , it was nothing but a bunch of lies .
negative	they still owe me $_00 . 00 because i cancelled one night the same night that i booked .
negative	they changed the prices and said that the second night was only 000 . 00 , but the agent told me when i booked that their normal rate was $_000 . 00 per_night ; however , they were running a special for $_000 . 00 per_night .
negative	when i went to cancel the second night , they said the first night was $_000 . 00 and the second night was $_000 . 00 .
negative	the agent also told me that they were the only ones that booked the motels in the area that i was looking to stay .
negative	that was a lie also .
negative	also , when i ask his name , he said " mike ".
negative	that is not the name he gave at the beginning of the conversation .
negative	i will never do_business with reservation_counter again .
negative	was sent this e_- mail to rate futonland , but have not received my order yet !
negative	( 0_weeks )
negative	i opened the account on trail basis used a 00 cent stamp and was charged 00 $ fee fro every_month and when called to close the account they wanted to charge a closing fee and not help on the fees already charged .
negative	they truly cheated me on this .
negative	please do not try this they are ripping and sucking money out of us for nothing .
negative	when flights get redirected , arrival times and paid - for transportation pick - up times need to change .
negative	it is impossible to reach anyone by email or phone ( on hold for 00 + minutes without ever reaching customer_support on more than one occasion ).
negative	they do not stand_behind the services they provide , when you attempt to obtain recompense for services not provided as contracted , you are transferred to a manager who then disconnects the call .
negative	do not buy from travelocity !
negative	i ordered 0 tickets back in november for robbie at manchester for friday 00st june_0000 .
negative	i have not recieved my tickets as of yet , i have e_- mailed and rung but they say if i havent recieved my tickets by wednesday to ring back , what a joke we are supposed to be travelling early friday_morning so i dont_think there is much hope of us recieving tickets .
negative	i will not be using this website again and will be looking at legal advice as you have already taken my money for the tickets and we have already paid for the hotel .
negative	my transaction number is 0000000 .
negative	i ordered a dayco timing_belt kit wp000l0b on feb 00 - mon - 0000 .
negative	kit came in with a missing hydraulic timing_belt actuator #_00000 .
negative	partsgeek was notified of parts missing same day it came - feb 0 - fri - 0000 .
negative	we used all parts of the kit , but we had to purchase the missing hydraulic timing_belt actuator from autozone0our cost -$_000 .
negative	we need to fix the car a s a p for our needed use of car .
negative	partsgeek was notifed by usps - certified mail twice - hard_copy that we did not receive the complete kit .
negative	partsgeek wants us to send back the dayco timing_belt kit back to california when parts of it from the kit are allready used in the car .
negative	partsgeek is difficult to contact by phone - can '_t talk to someone - only customer_support_ticket from their website - andi was not able to e_- mail them - their e_- mail address was not valid .
negative	products were o k but communication problems with partsgeek is terrible .
negative	we reserved a car through_travelocity at the san_diego airport .
negative	not only was our car not there when we arrived ( they agency said they had zero cars in their lot ), but neither the agency or travelocity would do anything about it .
negative	we were forced to take an expensive taxi ride to our hotel and spend the rest of the evening trying to get a car for the rest of our trip .
negative	we were able to find another car through_travelocity with a different agency for the remainder of our trip but we did this all on our own and without a bit of help from travelocity .
negative	we do not feel they " made it right ".
negative	we were out our taxi ride expense , the difference in the car_rental rates , and valuable vacation time .
negative	we have contacted travelocity about our experience but have not heard a word back from them .
negative	i had the worst_experience ever today with a customer_service manager , and will be forced to dispute a charge on my account because of everything that resulted from my situation .
negative	i know that i correctly inputted my hotel reservation details and was really careful about it .
negative	i made a reservation and did not notice the mistake immediately but after an_hour passed and i re - checked my reservation everything was wrong !!!
negative	i called today to rectify a clearly obvious mistake that was made on the website and everyone refused to help me because of a policy that was in place .
negative	i understand the policy & work with policies everyday as a compliance agent .
negative	i also come from a cs background and understand there are times when cs meets compliance and depending_on the situations , changes can be made to assist a customer .
negative	my situation is simple ...
negative	i made a reservation to my liking but because i had multiple tabs open , something went drastically wrong with my reservation .
negative	the date , the room type and the discount were wrong .
negative	instead of helping_me the cs manager penalized me .
negative	he made me pay an_additional night per policies because today is 0 / 00 .
negative	my reservation was supposed to be for may 00th not april 00 .
negative	the room was for a king_bed not 0 double_beds .
negative	there was supposed to be a 00_%_discount , there was no discount .
negative	after arguing for almost an_hour .
negative	i was charged a night_stay for over 000_dollars to change my reservation date .
negative	this was sooo unfair .
negative	this company makes money by stealing from its customers who only need some assistance with special situation .
negative	waited over a month for glasses that never showed_up !
negative	after a month i asked to cancel the order and they told me that i would get charged a 00_% fee .
negative	avoided numerous_emails when i asked for a simple eta .
negative	after i asked for a refund they charged my card and said i would have a tracking_number by the next_day .
negative	0 days_later still no tracking_number !
negative	disputing with my amex .
negative	stay far away !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a visa_gift_card for a friend .
negative	i paid over 00 . 00 to be , what it sounded_like , delivered overnight by fedex !
negative	it did not arrive until 0 days_later !
negative	i think that stinks !
negative	would like to have my 00 . 00 refunded !
negative	i tried to cancel the second night of my 0 night_stay at a hotel , but what actually happened was that i cancelled both nights .
negative	i immediately called expedia and told them i only want to cancel the second night and was told that i was charged a 0 night_stay penalty for cancelling .
negative	i tried to explain i still wanted the first night and just wanted to cancel the second night .
negative	what i was told was that i had to pay the 0 night_stay cancellation and would not get the room either unless i paid another night .
negative	expedia and their travel now program are scams .
negative	won_'_t use travelocity again .
negative	good bargains but customer_service lacking .
negative	long_waits on hold when trying to get questions_answered .
negative	more trouble than it '_s worth .
negative	never again would i order anything from gamermodz
negative	i attended boots in holbury , southampton to purchase some headache tablets .
negative	there were some people already waiting for prescriptions so i waited in line .
negative	when it came to my turn the lady serving turned round went around the back and started to take a delivery .
negative	eventually a pharmacist came around to give a prescription to a customer and said to me " someone will be with you in a moment , you will have to wait ".
negative	00_minutes later as i went to leave ( with a good 0 - 0 people behind me as well ) the lady_who was serving came back round and said " you have to wait like everybody else ".
negative	00_minutes is not an acceptable time to wait when there is no - one else being served !!
negative	i work at a hospital and if i told patients on the phone you will have to wait 00_minutes before i can be bothered to pick_up the phone , i am sure they would not be impressed !
negative	this is not the first time my husband and i have received shoddy service from this particular boots branch .
negative	it is about time these people had a lesson in customer_service and good manners !
negative	the pharmacist should be at the top of the list !
negative	needless to say this branch will not be used again , appalling !!!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered lemon sorbet bouquet for my mum for mother '_s day and received three pink_roses , one with the head off completely and the other rose buds already going brown and not much else other than greenery !
negative	i ordered yellow specifically as it is my mum '_s favourite colour - what a total_rip_off for £_00 .
negative	worst florists i have ever_dealt_with and wish i had seen all these other comments before i used them , anyway i have advised friends etc never to use this useless bunch ( pardon the pun ) and i imagine if they carry on their shambolic way of running things they will hopefully be out of business very soon before they can rip_off anymore poor unsuspecting people .
negative	i wish their was a no star available on these ........... should have realised what they were like when i saw it was yodel delivering !!!
negative	!
negative	delivery was swift but unfortunately they sent the wrong product and trying to tell them so i can get a refund has_been too difficult .
negative	won_'_t use them again .
negative	my dress ripped the first night i wore it and they wouldn_'_t let_me return it or get any type of refund !
negative	terrible service
negative	found purehealth after_researching the net and thought it was a great company , read that they had to hire more because of the recognition of the product i ordered " green_coffee bean " anyway .......... ordered it on 0 / 0 / 00 online , nothing .. tried to call the phone # provided , it said the lines were full ( couldn_'_t leave a message ) noone answered .
negative	found a way thru their phone system ( i used to be in cust serv ) so i left a message to the only line it would allow me to leave a message .
negative	there was no way and still is no way to track my order .
negative	i did not receive a tracking #, have no_clue what is going on .
negative	finally on 0 / 00 / 00 ( 00 days_later !)
negative	someone calls me and says hey we got your order and we are going to be shipping it out today .
negative	so i should get charged , yadda yadda yadda ..... soo now it is 0 / 00 / 00 ..
negative	still no sign of my order , no email to tell me what the hell is going on ( you know could of apologized , sorry we had to hire on more people something as to what the hell happened ) and still no sign of it .
negative	now i get this email_stating .. to tell us about your experience .. well it sucks ..
negative	someone gave_me another website that dr . oz actually uses but i thought no i am gonna give this pure_health a go and look what happened ?
negative	horrible experience for the customer ( me !)...
negative	should be more communication as to why your taking over a month to provide my product , it your out of the inventory don_'_t waste my time i will go elsewhere .
negative	where if i don_'_t here something very soon ..
negative	this will be the first and last time i use this website .........
negative	i say if your looking for what dr . oz suggests and go to this site , check elsewhere .
negative	i bought a tap and a sink from this company in june .
negative	it was installed in mid august and the flat was tenanted in mid october .
negative	the tap broke in late january this year , after less_than 0 months of use .
negative	when i contacted the company i discovered you can '_t actually speak to anyone unless you are prepared to pay £ 0 . 00 per_minute on their premium line .
negative	otherwise you must open a " ticket " and someone responds to you , or not ...
negative	the tap listing included a prominent fifteen year_warranty sign so i was amazed when they told me the tap was only covered by a six month warranty and that this had expired .
negative	i repeatedly asked for a refund and advised i would take it further , with no success .
negative	i contacted which magazine '_s helpline and they agreed that the company had breached the sale of goods act .
negative	i then contacted trading_standards via the citizens advice consumer advice line .
negative	they also agreed that my consumer rights had been breached and advised me to write to the company .
negative	this is where i am up to at the moment , but in the meantime , i '_ve gone to homebase to buy a new tap !
negative	i would not , under any circumstances buy anything from this company .
negative	if anything goes_wrong then , based on my experience , you can forget about it .
negative	i am very , very disappointed that a company could so blatantly flout the legislation .
negative	i waited for 0 days for my order .
negative	i had to go to petco and buy 0 cans of dog_food
negative	we have tried many_times to get someone on the phone & hang up after 0 / 0 hour .
negative	the entire trip was a disaster .
negative	will not go through_travelocity ever again .
negative	i tried to utilize their express service .
negative	i chose an offer , accepted it , but they were unable to fulfill , as their screen message essentially said things are changing in real time and the offer was no_longer available .
negative	so , i refreshed screen and they made the same offer back again .
negative	i tried to fulfill and again was told it was no_longer available .
negative	this happened 0 times .
negative	i opened my checking acct .
negative	info online and saw that priceline put a hold on my account 0 times for 0 offers they could not fulfill .
negative	the holds were full price each time , or $_000 . 00 ( once i tried a different offer with a total of $_000 . 00 ).
negative	so i had 0 holds at $_000 . 00 and one for $_000 . 00 .
negative	when i contacted their customer_service because they literally had $ 0000 . 00 on hold in my checking_account which caused my available balance to dwindle by that number ( and interfered with other legitimate charges for other merchants ), they told me not to worry , the holds would drop_off in 0 business days .
negative	so , in other words , they were not the least bit_concerned or sorry that they had holds on my checking_account that can and did wreak havoc in the account .
negative	to ensure they cannot have this rating removed for inaccurate information , the holds were placed on their reservation numbers :
negative	00000000000 , 00000000000 , 00000000000 , 00000000000 , 00000000000 , 00000000000 .
negative	it took me almost 0 hours ( because they can only release one hold at a time ) to get these removed from my account , and they were not the least bit apologetic about the issue .
negative	no offers for amends were made , either .
negative	i closed my account with them today , but i still arguably have legitimate legal matters that i can and am considering taking up with them .
negative	the reservation that did go through was a nightmare .
negative	i did an express bid on 0 hotel_rooms .
negative	the reservation i got was for 0 condos on a compound that had condos literally miles apart_from each other .
negative	the company with the condos said they could not give me 0 condos next door to each other and even then , priceline would not cancel at_least one of my reservations .
negative	i was bidding on 0 hotel_rooms .... i needed hotel_rooms as we wanted a separate room for our children .
negative	what we got we could not use , because i could not use two condos that were a mile apart_from each other , with my children being in one of them and my husband and myself being in another .
negative	priceline advertised 0 hotel_rooms in the express bid and gave_us two condos , which were so_far apart they would require a car to travel between them .
negative	they did not give full disclosure up front and are , in my opinion , responsible for false_advertising .
negative	i am happy to be a former customer .
negative	my recipient had to look deep to figure_out how to use after registering ..... we didn_'_t realize it can '_t be printed and used anywhere ?
negative	if we are wrong , it '_s not clear .
negative	i did .
negative	your customer_service is the best thing about your company .
negative	i have asked a number of times for your customer_service to get back to me so that i can cancel this subscription .
negative	i havent used the site for such a long time and i cant even log in because i dont remember my log in details .
negative	i am getting very upset that no one has responded !
negative	it took three_days to place an order .
negative	customer_service would answer put me on hold and never come_back .
negative	finally the third day i was able to place my order but if service does not emprove i will find another_vendor .
negative	my order of almost $_000 was canceled because the shipping address and my billing_address were different .
negative	i tried their customer_service ticket system online giving them my phone_number stating to contact me with no response .
negative	after a few_days i tried again and their website told me i had too many open tickets .
negative	i tried_calling their 000 number several_times with no answer at all .
negative	i realize that the different_addresses can be a security issue , but with nobody at the billing_address most of the time i did not want all that stuff sitting out up for grabs .
negative	i would never order from parts_geek ever again .
negative	i have issues with the order and was not able to speak with someone .
negative	everything had to be done online .
negative	any time of the day you call you would get the same message which tells you that it is an auto message .
negative	it took much longer to receive the books then the estimated time and when i finally received the second book i ordered , it was the wrong one .
negative	i had to keep it and order the correct one through someone_else causing me to waste money and time .
negative	ordered emblem for auto advertised as trunk emblem for that make and model and it was not
negative	my order tracking said it was delivered but it wasnt and customer_service did not respond to my email about the missing package .
negative	i called wanting to extend my already booked reservation .
negative	the person_who handled my call was not very helpful and seemed like she just wanted to get off the phone .
negative	there was a lot of noise in the background which made listening very hard .
negative	i did get impatient and ended the call .
negative	then i went online and took_care of the booking myself .
negative	i should have done this in the first place .
negative	i will use this website again , if necessary , but hopefully not the call in service .
negative	the service that i have received from vision_direct has_been shocking .
negative	i have requested at_least twice_now an update of where my glasses are with no reply .
negative	they promised a reply in 00_hours and nothing !
negative	this has to be some of the worst service i have ever received in australia .
negative	i don_'_t even believe they are an australian based business .
negative	this is getting to the point where if i don_'_t receive my glasses i will be contacting the police because vision_direct have taken payment but not delivered on their_promises which in australian law is essentially theft whether it is from a business or an individual .
negative	i expect a personal response to this in 00_hours or i will be posting another review of your service .
negative	ordered the trophy at the begining of december , paid_extra for speedy_delivery , said i needed by december_00th , was told it had been sent a week_later .
negative	now december_00th and still no trophy .
negative	golf game is over and no trophy , very disappointed .
negative	ordered flowers as a thank_you gift 0 days ago and they still have not been delivered .
negative	i wanted to send them as a surprise , royal_mail informed me that the flowers we ' re took to a depot in a box where they would have to stay all weekend because the depot is closed .
negative	the company advised a card had been put through the recipients door i has to spoil the surprise and tell her about it and she advised me there was no card put through the door .
negative	what flower company instructs their courier to take undelivered items to a depot to be left there to die , now when she receives them they will probably be dead .
negative	i spoke to prestige_flowers who basically said it wasn_'_t there problem !
negative	no one will help me and all i can do is to leave this review as a warning to other potential_customers not to buy flowers from prestige_flowers once they send the items out they do not care what happens as they already have your money .
negative	all i wanted to of was send a thankyou gift to a very kind lady_who has helped_me with my wedding planning and the gesture has_been ruined by this company incompetence .
negative	i '_m very upset about the whole situation never again !
negative	the wesite offered one mower but i received another .
negative	when i emailed abbey gardens asking for an explaination i was ignored and i still wait for a reply !
negative	not happy !
negative	i could have purchased this mower cheaper elsewhere .
negative	awful experience flight was changed about 00 times , the last time being less_than 00_hours before our flight home very frustrating .
negative	spent 0 hours on the phone with travelocity agenda on my last day of vacation .
negative	one agent kept me on hold for 0 hours .
negative	delivery was not good at all - left flowers on the street .
negative	i received the wrong order not once but twice !!
negative	!
negative	we ordered two controllers for my kids for christmas and still have not recieved one of them .
negative	they won_'_t even answer the phone .
negative	i have emailed 0 times with no response .
negative	its been a month .
negative	terrible !
negative	if i could rate one star i wouls !
negative	i ordered a silicone jelly skin case for my atrix which showed was in stock on the website .
negative	i went through the order process where they promptly took my payment .
negative	i then receive an_email a few_days_later saying the cases are on backorder and i would
negative	receive an_email when was shipped .
negative	fast forward 0 months and i finally receive the email that my case shipped and i could pick it up at their warehouse which is only about 000_miles from my house !
negative	i ordered this case with the understanding it would ship via mail to my home .
negative	i emailed them explaining that the distance was much too far for a case .
negative	their reply was that i would have to pay out more money to have it sent directly to my house .
negative	i thought that had already been taken_care of when i originally placed the order .
negative	needlees to say , after they sent me several harassing emails trying to get me to fork over more money , they figured_out i wasnt going to buy into their scam and cancelled my order .
negative	if you order from this company , do so at your own risk .
negative	bolox bolox bolox
negative	this company is the worst i have dealt_with in over 00 years .
negative	first of all when you call , none of the customer_service people can tell you where your order is .
negative	i spoke to 0 .
negative	i paid for expedited_shipping and was sent an e_- mail telling_me the gift_card had been shipped usps and would arrive in 0 to 00 business days .
negative	none of the people could tell me when it was shipped , how or could give me a fed_ex tracking_number .
negative	the gift_card arrived in 0 days , even_though i paid for the faster shipping method .
negative	i was told by the customer_service people , " the card will arrive sometime between friday and tuesday .
negative	wow that narrows it down .
negative	i would never use this service again .
negative	the worst in service , customer_satisfaction and handling issues .
negative	none of the customer_service reps have a clue .
negative	i also was on the phone with the customer_service people over 00_minutes with each call and still did not get an answer .
negative	go buy the card yourself and send it 0 day , have no frustration and you can track it .
negative	not pleased with condition of glasses .
negative	had to go retrieve them from post_office since no one was home when delivery occurred .
negative	would like to give you minus stars for this experience . got on this site trying to book a room frm marriott .
negative	agent answers as " reservations and support ", so i didn_'_t realize not marriott site .
negative	explained i wanted to use points to book 0night hotel .
negative	agent did not identify site as 0rd_party booking .
negative	i kept questioning why iwas quoted nightly rate , when i was using points .
negative	agent insisted i had to book it with credit_card first .
negative	asked again if he could check on points .
negative	evasive answers ... didn_'_t ever say i was on wrong site .
negative	never got a straight answer .
negative	had a bad feeling , so cancelled it .
negative	had to beg for email cancellation proof .
negative	are these agents trained to film - flam customers , or just_plain stupid ?
negative	i rented my book from bookbyte for $_00 .
negative	and , when it arrived it was a review copy .
negative	a copy made by the publisher that is not to be sold .
negative	i guess they think they are being clever by renting it out instead of selling it , but it is still wrong that they are making money off of this book that was complimentary .
negative	booked two double_beds .
negative	when i arrived at the hotel , there was no reservation in my name at all .
negative	i called customer_support and was put on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	finally , got a room but not apology .
negative	when we got into the room , it was a king_bed and a very uncomfortable roll - a - way bed .
negative	will never use them again .
negative	my mum ordered a cardigan from their catalogue .
negative	they phoned her and told her they had no stock in the size she had ordered , and would not be getting more in , but would she accept the next size down as an_alternative .
negative	she agreed and they asked for her bank_account details again .
negative	of course she should have refused and told them this was not another order so they would not be needing to take further payment - but what can i say , she is 00 and naive and trusting .
negative	the very next_day the item arrived in the size originally ordered .
negative	she phoned them to ask them not to send the other item and was told that it had already been despatched but that she should refuse to accept it when it arrived .
negative	this she duly did .
negative	to cut a long_story short gray and osbourn took £_00 and £ 0 . 00 for postage and packaging out of her account twice .
negative	once on the 0 september and again on the 0th .
negative	they are now saying that they have not received the second item back from their courier company and that they cannot refund my mother '_s money until they ' investigate '.
negative	they are sending my mother something out to sign and return to them .
negative	if , and it '_s a big if , she does get her money back they will have had it for well over a month .
negative	this is entirely unacceptable .
negative	they accept no responsibility for the fact that the whole fiasco was their mistake .
negative	to my mind taking the second payment out was fraudulent .
negative	my mother only ever ordered one item .
negative	i have reported them to consumerline and am awaiting their advice .
negative	my advice to other consumers is steer_clear .
negative	flowers received were later than guaranteed .
negative	the flowers started to droop within 00_hrs and died after 0 days .
negative	paid 00 $ for a bunch , in walmart were worth 0 $
negative	tried numerous_times to contact the company , with no response .
negative	une commande passée le 00 juillet .
negative	aucune info sur_la_livraison .
negative	c ' est en relançant plusieurs fois le service que l ' on m ' a informée de_la non disponibilité d ' un article .
negative	au final , un article m ' a été livré le 00 août mais d ' une autre couleur et_j ' attend toujours un remboursement .
negative	aucune communication .
negative	aucun sérieux .
negative	plus de commande sur golfstoreeurope .
negative	i have a screen printout of the $_00 special bookit nightly rate plus 00_% tax and a $_00 . 00 daily resort_fee .
negative	then as soon as i paid it shows it charged me $_000 . 00 .
negative	i can only call to get help and they charge $_00 . 00 fee for a rep to put you on hold for 00_minutes and never come_back .
negative	i am writing the bbb about these scumbags .
negative	horrible company !!!
negative	!
negative	the sunglasses i ordered ( burberry ) arrived broken .
negative	when i contacted customer_service at smartbuy it took them about a week to respond and they asked to see proof that the glasses were broken .
negative	finally they gave_me an address where i could return the sunglasses , at my own_expense of course .
negative	it has now been over a month since i placed my order and i have not received a refund , or another pair of sunglasses .
negative	i also question the authenticity of the sunglasses - my optometrist friend advised me that they were fake , and they were shipped from hong_kong .
negative	i wish i had never purchased with smartbuyglasses !
negative	beware that the prices shown , even if they say they include all fees and taxes , do not .
negative	you will not see this extra amount until after you put your credit_card in .
negative	the customer_service in india is next to useless .
negative	my suggestion is - use the site to select best price for day , time and airline , then go to the airline site to make your purchase .
negative	at_least then you will get customer_service by someone in this country .
negative	visited wren '_s in jan_0000 and choose a kitchen and bedroom_suite , after many hours of design .
negative	all going well and order place , also be mistake paid up from wrong !!!
negative	ok date was set for progress to take place feb_00th 0000 kitchen was taken out and rubbish all dumped at front ready for collection .
negative	progress made on fitting kitchen then only to be told splash backs won_'_t be available till end of march , ok i '_ll wait progress continued then floor was fitted as ordered by wrens and measured by designer .
negative	there wasn_'_t enough phone manager and designer , designer argued i should pay for extra flooring and it wasn_'_t his fault also had missing door from kitchen unit .
negative	spoke to manager who was totally useless and never got back to me when promised .
negative	rubbish should be collected in 0 days nope it was over a week rotting away in front garden .
negative	constant phone_calls emails then told flooring would be ordered and they would pay it arrived 00th_march along with door .
negative	the splash backs arrived 0th april_0000 my kitchen was finish at last on the 00th_april_0000 .
negative	two months after it should of been finished , management terrible , customer_service disgusting and waste of time .
negative	never will i recommend wrens to anyone ever !!!
negative	don_'_t bother the only good thing great hard working kitchen fitters that have to did with wrens mistakes .
negative	you make constant calls and emails nothing gets done its a joke !!
negative	!
negative	i paid for the item through paypal and they said they would let_me know when the item had been dispatched and haven_'_t heard or recieved a thing since !!
negative	the money has_been taken from my bank_account and then i was asked to fill in a satisfaction survey !!
negative	great customer_service , con more like !
negative	!
negative	the jacket i ordered looked nothing like it did in the picture .
negative	i also ordered a small , but it looked like a medium or a large .
negative	i '_m very unhappy with it , so i won_'_t be buying anything_else from this website & i wouldn_'_t recommend it to anyone !
negative	bought deal and received it over a week_ago .
negative	accidentally bought 0 as paypal was v slow going through and thought it hadn_'_t worked so bought second one on credit_card .
negative	have emailed them 0 separate times over past week and had no response at all .
negative	i expect a full_refund of one of these as i am entitled too , having notified them within 0 days as contract states .
negative	if i do not get a response within next few_days will start make a claim through paypal or credit_card to be reimbursed .
negative	once this issue has resolved i shall unsubscribe immediately and share my experience with as many people as possible .
negative	a response by email is long overdue !
negative	appallled at this lack of customer_service .
negative	i booked a trip through_travelocity - air , and hotel .
negative	when i received confirmation from the hotel , i noticed that it stated a king_bed , when i had booked two queens for my family of four .
negative	i called the hotel to add a night and to confirm the room type because clearly a king_bed wouldn_'_t work for two adults and two children .
negative	the hotel stated that they would not guarantee a room type when booked through a third_party and i would not know what type of room i had until i arrived .
negative	when i called travelocity to discuss this problem , the response i received from the agent was completely insincere and the information was misrepresented .
negative	i cancelled our reservation and will not use travelocity again .
negative	amiclubwear is the worst place i have ever ordered from .
negative	no one picks the phone when you call .
negative	in my first order they did not include the sale which was 00_percent .
negative	i tried to call no one picked at all .
negative	i spent hours and hours ordering when paying they tell you some items are not available .
negative	y were they added to the bag ?
negative	when paying sometimes you click credut card and then you are sent to paypal then they say its a fraud .
negative	you call no one picks you write them emails no one replies .
negative	the worst shopping xperience .
negative	boohoo '_s service is just terrible !!
negative	they charge £ 0 . 00 for standard delivery which states your order will arrive in 0 - 0 working days .
negative	i have waited 00 days for my parcel to arrive and its still not arrived !
negative	they have no contact number just an_email which they take days to reply , when they do reply they are very unhelpful !
negative	for 0 months i have been trying to get my necklace sent back to me , which i have already paid for !!
negative	nobody will return my phone_calls or email me back !!
negative	i lost $_00 in this deal !
negative	they only care about getting your money !
negative	not satisfying customers !
negative	unfortunately i was not able to go because my wallet got stolen on the way to the air port .
negative	i called to see if there '_s anyway i can have a partial_refund since i didn_'_t go on my vacation the rep decided to cancel the entire booking not just my part and claimed fraud to the hotel leaving my friend without a room after she checked in !!!!
negative	and then forced us to rebook since the trip has gotten canceled .
negative	did not care at all that their rep made a mistake when i called about the issue i got hung_up on at_least 0 times until a decent human_being got on the phone and actually helped_us .
negative	and when i say helped_us i mean we had no choice but to rebook a room at our own_expense .... after your rep completely screwed_up , not even a discount !!
negative	!
negative	best believe i will be talking to a lawyer and if in any way possible what has_been done is illegal i will deal with it accordingly .
negative	horrible booking experience horrible
negative	i wasted my time .
negative	i was trying to get my credit_scores and it says sorry but you cannot at this time .
negative	it was a waste of my time .
negative	i need to call and cancel this .
negative	they told me a canceled reservation might take 00 days to appear on my credit_card .
negative	how dare they ???!!
negative	!
negative	the four bottles of acacia organic skin oil is stale and has an offensive odor .
negative	joan raciti
negative	greedy company .
negative	i used vetrx for the first time .
negative	they told me i would receive my order this last tuesday .
negative	it '_s thursday and i '_ve still not received it .
negative	i called and spoke to a rude rep and then erica a supervisor that explained that they use ups and transfer to us mail ... i received this survey and i still_haven_'_t received my order .
negative	00 days now .
negative	so if you use this company don_'_t be in a hurry .
negative	i asked if i could return the order since i had to buy at the vet anyway since this took so long .
negative	erica explained that the drugs cannot be returned and thats the law and i understand that but the other items i purchased could be returned for a 00_% restocking_fee .
negative	my advice is check with your vet .
negative	my vets price for the prescription_drugs was cheeper than verrx .
negative	plus they don_'_t do what they say .
negative	i would rate this hotel a 0_star not a 0 , but i couldn_'_t get the rating section to change .
negative	the service was excellent .
negative	the room was very clean amd spacious .
negative	the continental_breakfast had a lot to offer .
negative	our room was a dallas cowboy themed room , which was nice .
negative	there is a small kitchenette in the room .
negative	bought a tiger onesie for my boyfriend , sent it straight back , overpriced , poor quality , material was cheap and nasty , scratchy not soft , took a while to come , overall not impressed .
negative	i ordered a dress a few_months back .
negative	it was delivered to an address .
negative	ave asked for this to be investergated as the person said it was not delivered there , nor did she sign for any parcel .
negative	i am still_waiting for a response from boohoo
negative	if you can use another sistem , go very far away from paypal .
negative	there are a coyotes service
negative	i had paid_extra to have a set day / afternoon delivery between 00md and 0pm , yesterday .
negative	0 / 0 my order was delivered by [_external reference_] and they kindly texted me that they would deliver between 00 . 00 - 00 . 00hrs , which they did - fantastic service .
negative	i certainly can '_t say they same about yodel .
negative	i waited in for several more hours , constantly tracking the order on the link to yodel , and the parcel continued to say delivery for yesterday , but i decided to ring them as it was still saying it '_s at their depot .
negative	i found it near on impossible to find a telephone_number to ring them at first !
negative	it seems they make themselves near on impossible to contact by hiding their telephone_numbers !
negative	when i eventually found it and phoned it was an_automated voice saying press :
negative	0 .
negative	for ........
negative	0 .
negative	for ........
negative	0 .
negative	for tracking
negative	0 .
negative	for .......
negative	then press star to ' listen to numbers again
negative	then a long pause ( so you think they '_ve finished ) then
negative	0 .
negative	to speak to someone
negative	i really believe this a ploy to discourage callers !
negative	it wasn_'_t until my 0rd phone_call that i worked this out , but initially i used the automated voice for tracking , by pressing 0 but that wouldn_'_t recognise the reference_number that was on their own tracking_information !
negative	when finally , eventually , i spoke to someone , they didn_'_t recognise their number either .
negative	i had to make every_effort to be polite by the time i eventually got through , only to find they won_'_t deliver today , they told me that they have been busy and have put the delivery back to tomorrow , even_though we still have a couple of hours to go !
negative	i paid for this time_slot and what is the point of giving out tacking information saying delivery yesterday ?
negative	and even worse , no - one let_me know !
negative	i have to wait in again today .
negative	i '_ve told them , and they agreed , it has to be delivered by 0 . 00am as i have plans !
negative	i '_ve just looked at tracking again and it '_s still in their depot , i '_m not very optimistic .
negative	their service is appalling , i don_'_t understand any company use them !
negative	i will certainly inform the company that supplied my parcel , on the comparison between [_external reference_] and yodel !
negative	i ordered a book from bookbyte and waited a week for it .
negative	finally i emailed bookbyte to see what was going on with my order to find that they cancelled my order without my consent .
negative	i needed the book urgently to do homework for my class that week and they didnt even offer any store credit or free_shipping !
negative	cheap asses , im spreading the word not to use bookbyte .
negative	when ringing the customer_service to find out about my next_day delivery the response and feedback that i received was all about the small_print .
negative	very few people actually review the small_print but it seems to be used as a scape goat for the people on the end of the phone to give reasons for poor service .
negative	when someone sees next_day delivery in large letters they expect it to be on the next working day and not only if the order is placed at a certain time , this indicates in the advert that it should be next_day ( it does not say please read terms and conditions concerning next_day delivery ) this should be made very clear and wasn_'_t , very poor service and no straight answers given .
negative	wanted to cancel my order but was told that it would cost me even more money to do this so you have the customer by the b ** lls .
negative	i ordered about 0 items from born_pretty store just to see if i would be disappointed , and surely what i thought would happen , happened .
negative	i didn_'_t go overboard with my order .
negative	thank_god i didn_'_t .
negative	so what '_s the excuse for my small order not being shipped ?
negative	i sent two different tickets , closed one and made another still no response , but your false_advertising says you '_ll respond in 0day ... bull !
negative	.
negative	what '_s the point of having a customer_service button with no darn customer_service !!!
negative	wack , wack , wack !
negative	i '_m annoyed and i feel bamboozled !
negative	born_pretty store never again .
negative	i selected epson brand printer_inks and the code required for my printer and was sent an_alternative supposedly compatible product .
negative	as i have had previous bad_experience of such products , i have returned these inferior products , but have yet to receive a refund .
negative	maybe a once off as have used company before and no_problems .
negative	drivers were grumpy , in s rush ( though i ' d paid £_00 for delivery to include installation ) and not skilled enough to manoeuvre a large and heavy appliance .
negative	though it wouldn_'_t usually be a problem that they had little english , one couldn_'_t understand any in fact , they also couldn_'_t understand each other as their own languages were different .
negative	this was hugely problematic ; resulting to a lot of damage to property and significant damage to my new £_000 appliance !
negative	not impressed .
negative	first response following this on the phone was ' jobs worthy ' and disappointing but since then appliances_online have seemed to be doing the right thing .
negative	i will review again when damage dealt_with .
negative	perhaps expert logistics who provide the delivery deserve this review more .
negative	i cannot fathom how on earth it went so wrong !
negative	wanted to return an item - mailed it back with all the papers .
negative	they returned the " return " to me by mail about 0 months later - postage due !
negative	a note said i did not process the return correctly ; i needed a return code .
negative	i then tried to get a return code and they refused as the time period for making a return had expired .
negative	do not use this service
negative	i received the wrong goods and they won_'_t credit me .
negative	i '_ve been waiting a month .
negative	they don_'_t answer the phone and don_'_t seem to know what '_s going on in their own office !
negative	this was my first experience booking through bookit and it was not a good experience .
negative	0 ) i personally inputted all my personal information and my reservation has my name misspelled which caused a problem on arrival .
negative	0 ) i inputted 0 persons and names of those staying in room and it only had my name .
negative	once again this caused problem upon_arrival .
negative	the biggest disappointment was the hotel itself .
negative	the pictures must have been taken when the hotel opened because it was disgusting !!
negative	it smelled of smoke , the room was dirty ( i had to wipe counters with wipey ), the lights in hall were out .
negative	vegas rooms were cleaner than there .
negative	seems to be the answer for everything .
negative	with income exceeding $ 0 , 000 monthly i was " granted " $_000 .
negative	hardly worth the trouble .
negative	i ordered 0 bouquets , one for my mothers birthday and the other for my mother - in - laws 00th_birthday , 0 days apart .
negative	both deluxe bouquets .
negative	my mothers flowers were not in good co diction when they arrived and she threw a lot of them away after 0 days .
negative	my mother in laws arrived nearly all dead .
negative	some stems still had roots with mud on them and as she opened the package it smelt awful .
negative	she thought it was a cruel joke and was in tears !
negative	after many emails back and forth , i eventually had both bouquets resent
negative	i would never use this company again !
negative	i ordered 0 tins of exterior paint with a delivery advertised within 0 days .
negative	that was a week_ago , no sign of the order , but a text over the weekend to say that they were very busy and i should expect delivery within the next 0 working days .
negative	i '_ve therefore missed a weekend and the time i took off work this week to get the painting done .
negative	really poor service and they certainly haven_'_t provided the advertised service .
negative	i had used the home delivery as the ruislip store is chaos whatever time of day you go .
negative	lesson_learnt and i '_ll spend the time travelling to b_& q in future !
negative	worst online shopping_experience in my life so_far .
negative	this company is fake and should be shutdown .
negative	i am still_waiting i will review if i ever get them
negative	it was really annoying that i could not use my hilton honors account to book the reservation .
negative	# 0 - had to spend 00_minutes giving information that could have been looked up in two seconds .
negative	# 0 - am i going to get credit for having my hhonors in the system ?
negative	the dude wouldn_'_t even take it .
negative	# 0 - pure crap !

negative	i telephoned simplysupplements and my call was answered by gemma .
negative	i explained that i had had problems changing my password on the website and could i order by phone .
negative	she said she would reset by password as if i ordered on the phone i would not get free delivery .
negative	she did not ask what i was ordering so did not know the amount of i was paying .
negative	i said i would try to reset my password because of this .
negative	i am 00 yrs_old and do not fully understand the ins and outs of the internet so could not reset my password .
negative	i wanted to get the order sent off today , so i telephoned again , and gemma answered , i told her i would try to reset my password later , but could she take my order on the phone , as in the brochure as i was paying 00_pounds i would be entitled to free delivery anyway .
negative	she gave a big sigh , so i told her if she did not want to take my order , perhaps her supervisor could .
negative	she then_proceeded to take my order .
negative	after many years ordering from simple supplements i was very upset by this .
negative	i am not well myself so this was added stress for me which i am not able to take .
negative	i can_honestly say in the past your telephone advisors have been more than helpful when i have had to telephone to place an order .
negative	i would not give gemma any stars at all for the stress she gave_me this morning when all i wanted to do was spend some money with your company .
negative	please excuse any spelling mistakes if i have made any .
negative	after looking again on the website i understand i have to give a star so i give one very reluctantly .
negative	the part they sent me was used , and i paid for a brand_new one !
negative	i can '_t get my printer to acknowledge the inkfarm cartridge so it looks like i just waster my money .
negative	i am appalled at the way i was treated by this company .
negative	i originally ordered prescription_sunglasses for this site .
negative	when they arrived , they were the wrong ones .
negative	it turned_out that they had mistakenly shipped mine to another customer and theirs to me .
negative	i immediately received a garbled email and phone_call asking if i had the wrong pair of glasses .
negative	okay , sometimes companies make mistakes .
negative	however , the company then sent me several very rude demanding emails asking me to package the glasses up , send them back , and somehow include the receipt for the shipping so they could refund me my money .
negative	i let them know this was not convenient for me , as i work during all hours the post_office was open except for saturdays .
negative	this interaction took place on a monday and i heard_nothing from the company .
negative	on thursday and friday i then received a shipping label and a subsequent pushy and rude email_asking me to send it out right_away .
negative	i hadn_'_t even gotten the original email with the shipping code yet as they sent it in the early hours of the morning .
negative	all in all , i '_ve never had such terrible customer_service , or rude obnoxious emails from a company .
negative	i will never shop_here again .
negative	first at all i realy dont_know how you dare to ask us something , after you let us such a bad coments !!!
negative	?
negative	the second one , trust me we are very kind with people special with are guest and you dont do part of anione of this
negative	two categori , for me it was beter cause you lost in that night , cause i work veri hard to get a good coments for my guest
negative	i try to do all my best for they to have a nice stayng at us , the point is cause i dont_know the hotel and ifven if i now posibile dont tell you .
negative	have a good luck and try to be more kind in the future pls .. take_care bye

negative	i arranged for flowers to be sent to my sister - in - laws birthday which was on a sunday .
negative	they were actually delivered a day late when she was at work , they were left out on the door_step in the snow without the card that i had asked to be included so she had no_idea who they were from when she got home to a very sorry looking bouquet !
negative	i emailed to complain on the tuesday but didn_'_t even get an acknowledgement that they had been received .
negative	i telephoned them on the thursday but kept getting answerphone .
negative	when i finally got through , i was told that they could resend the flowers or it would take up to 0 days for the escalation team to respond about a possible refund .
negative	absolutely horrendous service experience .
negative	don_'_t use them - pay a little more for interflora and know that you will at_least get what you pay for !
negative	ordered two bags of food on line and waited 0 days for my delivery , after i received a confirmation of my order .
negative	when nothing arrived and i called to find out what was going on , i was told my money had been refunded as the food was out of stock .
negative	maybe some_sort of notification would have been nice , an_apology , something ........ even an_apology !
negative	i will stick with petco who always deliver within 00_hours of my order .
negative	when i ordered it said it would be shipped next_day and it did not ship until 0 - 0 days_later .
negative	the shippin tracking they sent never worked and there sizes are way toooo small i usually wear a xl i ordered a 0x and it doesn_'_t fit and i have no_clue how to return it !
negative	the confirmation stated i should receive my order in 0 to 0 days .
negative	i have not received it after a week .
negative	where is my order ??
negative	?
negative	i ordered a part and they cancelled with no notification .
negative	will never order from you again .
negative	booked a room and traveled for 00_hours .
negative	when we went in with a valid reservation number - he hampton_inn told me .
negative	have no room and reservation conter over sold this by 0 rooms that night .
negative	we had to spend 0 hours finding a room that night and got to sleep 0 am .
negative	shame on your company that told me " great news - we are going to refund all your money ".
negative	really pay me back for a room i didn_'_t stay in because you don_'_t know how to set valid confermations .
negative	i will never use this again and will do my best to help others a aid using you services as we '_ll .
negative	j
negative	still_waiting for refund over a month since item returned !
negative	i '_ve been to mavis before for this and i ' d thought they wouldn_'_t gouge me , but they did .
negative	i went in for a nys inspection on a 0 year_old car , and when i was called later to be told it was finished , they recommended i get a power_steering flush and upgraded wiper_blades .
negative	i declined , and the guys response was that these are necessary to pass the inspection and i was required to do it .
negative	thinking they wouldn_'_t pass my car it i didn_'_t do this things , i agreed and then came in to find they put $_00 wiper_blades on my car and the power_steering flush was $_00 .
negative	i will not be coming_back for future service .
negative	i had the very bad surprise to find out after a little more than a year that my marble slate was of very bad quality .
negative	not using it very much and never for a long time , in a few_days , it was covered with a lot of holes in the stone where the water digs up very quickly .
negative	i thought that this problem would be considered as a hidden defect and of course , the soothing company would replace the slab , but surprisingly , the manufacturer covered himself behind the warranty which ended only few_months_ago .
negative	$ 0 , 000 for a piece of junk !
negative	very mad and disappointed !
negative	i will never buy anything anymore from this company !
negative	no costumer_service at all !!!
negative	no one answers your emails and there is no number to contact them .
negative	shipping takes so long too .
negative	order else where .!
negative	!
negative	order was placed on 00 / 0 and have not received any further communication after saying the order was being_processed .
negative	since then nothing altho the orginal email said i would be notified as soon as the gift_cards were sent .
negative	please explain
negative	i '_ve been shopping at yesstyle . com for a couple years_now and i always loved it .
negative	the site is so easy to use , they have the cutest_clothes , and i would wait three or four days and my clothes would be in my closet , waiting to be worn .
negative	the last two orders i '_ve placed haven_'_t been the most pleasant experiences .
negative	the issue with the prior one was that my items took nearly a week and a half to get to me , despite_being shipped a day and a half after i placed the order ( and all the items were on a one or two day wait to be shipped and were shipped after a day and a half ).
negative	the other issue was that my card was overcharged !
negative	the latest order came quickly after the wait ( this item was on a seven to fourteen day wait to be shipped , so it was understandable ), but it was the wrong item !
negative	it was similar , but it wasn_'_t what i ordered .
negative	i looked up the item i received and lo and behold , it didn_'_t exist .
negative	and once again , my card was overcharged !
negative	if this is yesstyle '_s new constant , i will take my business to a fabric store and make my own clothes .
negative	update 0 / 0 / 00 : on top of everything that '_s already gone wrong with this order , i had to pay to send the wrong item back to them !
negative	yes , for some_reason , i am paying for their mistake .
negative	wtf .
negative	and the overcharge ?
negative	yeah , that '_ll only be fixed if they get a copy of my bank_statement .
negative	they could just go look at it themselves and see what they did wrong .
negative	i am more than displeased with this .
negative	really .
negative	this is what they call customer_service ?
negative	i would give this zero_stars if i could .
negative	order guaranteed for christmas won_'_t be making it in time .
negative	so , so mad .
negative	impossible to speak to an actual_person for customer_service .
negative	ordering from this website was a mistake , to do a return is taking far too long and will probably take longer to recieve my money back .
negative	horrible and a real inconvinience to me .
negative	i was sent an automatic message that my order was out of stock and would be shipped shortly .
negative	i am living in the country w_/ o transportation therefore cannot just go to the store .
negative	i ran_out of food for my dogs while waiting for the order to be stocked and shipped .
negative	i sent a message asking what was taking so long and at that time was told that the size of the particular_brand i order ( pedigree ) was no_longer carried in that size so would i change to a different size so my order could be processed .
negative	i did this and my order was shipped .
negative	why wasn_'_t i asked this originally instead of being told it was out of stock and would ship soon ?
negative	if i had not followed_up myself i would still be waiting .
negative	very disappointing as i had to feed my dogs brown_rice while waiting for their food .
negative	we paid $_000 canadian for a 0 door compact car for 0_weeks in france .
negative	the car was picked_up and dropped_off in different_locations in france but not at an airport .
negative	i was told that the only charges on drop_off would be for the two extra drivers 00_euros x0 and 00 . 00_euros road tax which totals 000 . 00_euros .
negative	at a conversion rate of 0 . 00 that would be $_000 cdn .
negative	on july_0th my visa was charged a whopping $_000 . 00 more canadian dollars on top ofthe original rental fee of $_000 cdn .
negative	i have not received any itemised account of why you would charge more than double the agreed_upon return car charges .
negative	pls .
negative	contact me immediately .
negative	i am very disatisfied with your company .
negative	dont ever use this crowd .
negative	i sent 0 parcels on different dates .
negative	0 arrived , 0 is lost and the others are still sitting in the shop i drop them at and 0 days have passed .
negative	customers emailing constantly wanting money returned and no wonder .
negative	ive got no answers for them .
negative	no way of contacting this crowd without costing more money .
negative	the 00 assistance chat called millie gets back after 0 day , or so they claim .
negative	never , never never use this crowd .
negative	i '_ve never booked a hotel through priceline until recently .
negative	i usually use alternative discount travel sites .
negative	got to the hotel after driving for hours ( and pregnant and with a toddler ) and they claim they only have one of my reservations .
negative	i had the itinerary clearing stating two and they told me to deal with it through priceline .
negative	called them , got the back and forth for over an_hour !
negative	finally they " figured it out " but stated that bc if pricelines screw up that the room won_'_t be ready for another three hours .
negative	then tried to just cancel the room and of course priceline would let us nor did they offer any sort of consolation .
negative	not impressed !
negative	signed_up and receieved a bill which stated " paid in full ".
negative	granted it allowed for extra_fees for city taxes etc .
negative	this came to roughly 000 $ extra .
negative	wrote to them via_e_- mail - no response .
negative	finally after being told no problem with returning car to avalon airport , returning car full and with no damage we got another bill for about 00 $.
negative	wrote again but again no response .
negative	would not rent again from this outfit .
negative	this company will make you pay for their error .
negative	i ordered one part , they charged me for two , then wanted me to pay return shipping and a restocking_fee for their error .
negative	their customer_service was appallingly unprofessional .
negative	after this incident , i looked up reviews online and found reference to many similar incidences on yelp and yahoo .
negative	arrived home to see a card for delivery of a table lamp i ordered , it said it had been left in a green box outside my house , i don_'_t have a green box !!!
negative	also on line it said it had been posted through my letter_box , a table lamp ?
negative	i don_'_t think so , i have rung twice and no one has come_back to me ....
negative	crap !!
negative	!
negative	we booked our hotel room 0 months before our trip .
negative	0 nights side ocean_view and a full kitchen .
negative	i never got a confirmation_email but a few_days after booking the first nights stay was taken from my bank_account ( didn_'_t know this was happening ) but didn_'_t question it because it was an expense out of the way .
negative	figured we were good to go !
negative	my family of 0 ( 0_adults 0 kids ) drive 0 hours for vacation .
negative	get here to only have the side_view and shorted us a day of our stay .
negative	we ended_up having to pay an extra $_000 for another nights stay .
negative	come to our room and we have no kitchen just a small fridge .
negative	we call expedia .
negative	on the phone for 0 hours and hung_up on 0 times .
negative	we were left with no answers out $_000 and no way to cook for our family .
negative	i will never again book with this company they are absolutely horrible !
negative	the only_thing they succeed at was to ruin my first day of vacation !
negative	it '_s been over a week since i ordered a gift_card and i still have no card and no shipping verification or tracking_number .
negative	i '_ve emailed customer_service twice asking for information and have received no response whatsoever .
negative	i will not use this company again and would never recommend them to anyone !
negative	i was very excited to receive the kraken rum and free kraken tumblr as it was meant to be a gift , however all i received was a box full of shattered glass and a big mess to clean up .
negative	it did have packing peanuts but somehow the bottle and glass were broken before i ever got to open the box .
negative	i don_'_t know if i '_ll try ordering again , though i know it '_s most_likely the postal service '_s fault
negative	i had the option of staying with orange or going with 0 .
negative	i ' d been with orange on an iphone_0gs for about 00 months and never had any_problems but when upgrading to an iphone_0s so many colleagues complained_about orange customer_service that i decided to go with 0 .
negative	i '_m so glad that i did .
negative	trying to unlock my iphone_0gs has_been extremely problematic .
negative	i contacted customer_services 0 times , each person saying sorry the request hadn_'_t been carried out , ' trust me ' i '_ll process the request , before getting through to someone_who did actually process it , only to be told that only one person processes the requests , 0 times a week , and it '_s going to take 00 days to process the request - well over a month where i can '_t use a phone that i own .
negative	prior to this i was an orange customer for about 00 years , with a gap of a few_years while i was living_abroad .
negative	i wouldn_'_t consider returning to orange , and couldn_'_t in good faith recommend orange , which is unfortunate as i work for a company that sells products with the orange network , fortunately we have other choices .
negative	very , very poor customer_service , orange , very disappointing .
negative	clearly no quality control , netball ring corroded and paint flacking off .
negative	okay i rented a textbook from them last semester and they don_'_t offer a portion back even if it '_s in good condition ( other_places do ).
negative	then i just sent them a book ( sold my old book to them i mean ) bought this past january and it was in excellent condition and only used a few_times .
negative	i bought it for $_000 .
negative	they didn_'_t answer an_email i sent and didn_'_t make it clear of fees or the possible sell back prices or how it works ...... nothing .
negative	do you know i just got an_email_saying i '_m being sent a check for $ 0 .
negative	like seriously , i could '_ve at_least sold it on ebay for $_00 .
negative	rip_off , i don_'_t even recommend renting from them since they ' re so shady , i '_m deactivating my account today .
negative	hostelworld used to be good .
negative	now all that matters is money .
negative	anyone can make a fake review and hw doesn_'_t care , they publish before trying to find out the truth .
negative	how can they make money leading customers to believe in anything that is published ?
negative	as a booking site they should be more acurate about reviews and publish only after having proof that things related did happen .
negative	my trust in their reviews today is 0 %
negative	ive been very dissappointed to work with trophiesandmedals . com and will not chose to work with them again .
negative	i lazily chose an online trophy company for convienince however i learnt the lesson the hard way .
negative	i will now always support my local businesses and would prefer to receive face to face advice and a friendly accommodating approach to customer_service .
negative	i run small sided leagues and purchase 000 trophies a year minimum .... any new customer is always a bonus however trophiesandmedals . com have lost out on potentially a lucrative one .
negative	none of the information i received identified them as a third_party even my confirmation .
negative	it was confusing and difficult .
negative	it has_been an awful experience and the room was very expensive .
negative	awful !
negative	i will be more careful in the future and only deal directly with the hotel .
negative	i won_'_t go into full details , however they promised us two rooms that were adjoined , even saying they called the hotel specifically ( which they didnt ) and we were out on the streets of las_vegas with two little girls at 0 : 00 at night with no rooms .
negative	they then said they wouldn_'_t credit us towards another room for our stay and further more said that they couldn_'_t give us a refund because the original hotel had the money .
negative	they said 0 different times ( even getting off the phone as if they were calling ) that they had spoke with the hotel and the hotel wouldn_'_t give us a refund .
negative	we then went down to the hotel and they said that no one from expedia had called and further more they couldn_'_t give us back the money because they don_'_t even have our card information rather they are paid by expedia and they weren_'_t holding any money .
negative	we had the manager at the hotel call expedia and they then said they would give a full_refund with in 00_hours .
negative	i had them e_- mail me in which they stated that they would give me a refund within 00_hours .
negative	it is now 00 days past with no money refunded and i have to wait on if their merchant says that they will refund the money within the next 00 days to my account .
negative	they are awful and i can '_t_believe these crooks can get away with this in america .
negative	i feel_like i '_m dealing_with a shady country from far away !!!
negative	don " t ever use them - and spread the message !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	the package arrived on time , well_wrapped , but with only 0 out of the 0 lights in working order - a situation which_meant they were totally useless for purpose .
negative	very disappointing and totally_unacceptable .
negative	i thought i had gotten a good deal but in realty i got charged too much didn_'_t realize until i was on my online_banking account .
negative	this company will not refund your money back an its a foreign company that you can easily mistaken the price an think its usa dollars when in realty is in pounds which is more in usa money they swiped all my money from my debit_card !!!
negative	i '_m so upset an unsatisfied !!
negative	hope this does not happen to anyone_else !
negative	i ordered four parts from parts_geek ; i have received three .
negative	no response from parts_geek after emailing .
negative	no phone_number available to contact them .
negative	this company needs to be put out of business for fraud .
negative	be sure to read all the reviews before ordering from this company .
negative	i think i was cheated by taunton_leisure they show on their website pictures that don_'_t match the items and when i wanted to return the item and explained the situation to them they said there was nothing they could do !
negative	when i looked that night on their website they had changed the details which was clearly because of my call !
negative	awful , waited in for 00_hrs and nobody collected the parcel .
negative	refused to give any reduction in postage_costs as it '_s not 000_% guaranteed that someone will collect ??
negative	nobody contacted us to inform us .
negative	don_'_t use !
negative	!
negative	devastated that my wedgwood dinner service is in bits .
negative	the breakages were beyond just an accident in transit .
negative	when we looked into it further we found that the driver stacked the boxes which stated fragile and knowing that there was china and glass .
negative	breakages - 0 serving plate , 0 dinner plates , 0 glasses , 0 saucer , 0 teacup , 0 coffee_cup .
negative	glasses cannot be replaced , other parts of the dinner service can be at a cost .
negative	very very disappointed with service - will never use again
negative	placed an order on 00 th december it is now 0 th january_0000 and have not recieved my order .
negative	i have not had any contact from the alzproducts in all that time .
negative	would not use these again .
negative	the flowers were supposed to be delivered on 0 march for a birthday - i even paid for a birthday card .
negative	apparently i missed the deadline for that day so i naturally thought they would be delivered the next_day !!
negative	after leaving lots of messages and receiving strange replies - there doesn_'_t seem to be any direct emails , just leave a message on the website - flowers delivered on 00 march .
negative	apparently they were lovely but not for a birthday 00 days previously .
negative	i ordered one thing , they sent something_else .
negative	no resolution , no nothing .
negative	just that they will check with the warehouse .
negative	last thing i heard .
negative	never notified when the shipment went out either .
negative	faster and more reliable sites out there .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	failed to mention that the boots i ordered for a specific event were on back order 0_weeks after i had ordered them .
negative	they are untimely , slow , stupid , and f * king suck .
negative	took them 0 days to respond to my emails .
negative	seriously reconsider ordering anything from them .
negative	you wont get it for weeeeeeeeks .
negative	i have been trying to contact claims department to file a claim , but minsy who is the only one who processes claims doesn_'_t call back or answer the phone .
negative	i have been trying to reach her for 0_weeks now and the only time she actually called after i called the main customer_service line and addressed the issue .
negative	when minsy called me the next_day but i was at work and i asked that she call me back after 0pm .
negative	she said she would call me at 0 : 00 .
negative	when i got off work at 0 , i tried to catch her , but she did not answer .
negative	no one called me at 0 : 00 or after .
negative	i called her back around 0pm and left a voicemail stating that i was upset with her service and that she is not responsible .
negative	i do a lot of my shopping online petflow is the worst company i have ever ordered from !!!!!!!!!!

negative	i arranged for them to be delivered on saturday march_00th but they never arrived .
negative	i emailed immediately , no response .
negative	they finally arrived yesterday , 0 days late .
negative	still no reply to my email .
negative	totally_unacceptable and very unprofessional .
negative	i won_'_t be using iflowers again !
negative	i only ordered a pair of boots ( 0 . 00 ) and a pair of tights ( 0 . 00 ) and my total ends_up being 00 . 00 ( including shipping ), which was fine with me .
negative	half an_hour later , i go back to the website to see how my order is doing and for some f - uped reason my total goes from 00 . 00 to 00 . 00 ... wtf .
negative	i just ordered my things and im already hating on them .
negative	i tried to cancel but it said i can only cancel over the phone so , i tried_calling .

negative	thanks for effing me over ami ... stupid piece of shitee !!

negative	i ordered scrub pants put them in my cart and checked out without a problem .
negative	a week went by i emailed " where '_s my order " and didn_'_t receive a reply , another week another email this time a rude unapologetic response .
negative	" you ordered discontinued merchandise and we emailed you your order was canceled " not exactly folks .
negative	twenty_minutes after my order confirmation_email i received an_email containing a small square box titled ' credit_card void receipt ' there was no text or explaination whatsoever !
negative	this was unclear and very unprofessional as was their eventual reply .
negative	zero star_rating in my book .
negative	the package arrived dirty , bent , and damaged .
negative	the product itself looked used , and there was a yellow liquid inside the bag with the product .
negative	apparently partsgeeks does not claim responsibility for the delivery of the product .
negative	i wasn_'_t home to deny the package .
negative	i ' d suggest partsgeeks gets a new delivery carrier .
negative	i was very disappointed and would not recommend anyone to order from this website / company .

negative	if you see a five_star review here , it '_s a five_star lie .
negative	they buy fake reviews .
negative	i wish i could give zero_stars as that '_s what they deserve .
negative	my sister made the mistake of buying her wedding_dress from tidebuy and it was a disaster .
negative	a cheap badly made rip_off with poor sewing and cheap fabric and plastic beads .
negative	thankfully she still had three_months to find a replacement so it ended_up costing her hundreds of $$$ more than she had wanted to spend .
negative	before buying my dress i did a lot of research and found out that tidebuy . com , tidebuybridal . com , tbdress . com and other_sites are all the same so please check before you buy .

negative	before buying my dress i did a lot of research and found out that tidebuy . com , tidebuybridal . com , tbdress . com and other_sites are all the same so please check before you buy .
negative	i wish i could give zero_stars as that '_s what they deserve .
negative	my sister made the mistake of buying her wedding_dress from tidebuy and it was a disaster .

negative	i ordered a textbook with two day shipping ( as i needed it for class asap ) and had the money taken out of my bank_account .
negative	i waited for a week and tried to get in contact with the company .
negative	don_'_t bother calling the phone_number as the system is a joke .
negative	i went through the prompt to check the status of an order and accidentally entered the wrong order number and was prompted that " my order was being_processed ."
negative	i then went through the prompt again and entered the correct order number and was prompted " my order was being_processed ."
negative	you can '_t get a hold of a person through the phone .
negative	i sent an_email to customer_service and two_days_later found out my order never shipped since it was not in stock .
negative	yet , i never received a notice saying the textbook was out of stock and was charged for something i was never going to receive . a few hours after i received that response from customer_service , paypal notified me that a refund was issued from bookbyte .
negative	i feel_like if i didn_'_t contact them they would have kept my money .
negative	i don_'_t understand what is so difficult about updating a website to reflect the availability of items and having a person at the other end of a phone line .
negative	i am really upset that they charged me for an item that i was never going to receive .
negative	this is the worst company with the worst operating practices .
negative	i will never shop from this company again , and i would strongly_advise others not to either !
negative	don_'_t use these_guys for expedited services ... you won ; t get it any faster or when you need it by paying double the price .
negative	they don ; t tell you until after the fact that the 0 day service you paid for is actually a week .
negative	when you cancell the order they ignore your cancellation and you are forced to take action at your own end via your card_holder and wait for results ... in the meantime you '_ve tied up $_000 '_s of dollars waiting for a resolution .
negative	which still has not come !!
negative	!
negative	you ask the same questions over and over again .
negative	i have deleted an account yet it still comes up .
negative	i use the correct password and it accepts it on some sites but not others .
negative	i '_m done with your service .
negative	i ' d prefer to give you no stars .
negative	was hoping to go to dinner at a favorite restaurant last_week .
negative	ordered gift_cards about 00 days ahead .
negative	no sign of them yet .
negative	first time dealing_with this company , and definitely the last .
negative	have ordered from another group [_external reference_] in the meantime and those cards are already here .
negative	i ordered a top from boo_hoo . com 0_weeks before christmas .
negative	i received an_email to say the item was despatched on 00th_dec and estimated delivery was 00th_december .
negative	when my parcel had still not arrived on 00st_december i emailed boo_hoo customer_services to find out where it was .
negative	i received a reply to say it was in transit & i had to wait 00 days from the despatch date before they could investigate .
negative	on 00th_december i received an_email to tell me boo_hoo had refunded my purchase as there was no stock !!
negative	the service and customer_services has_been appalling .
negative	if there was no stock it would have been nice to know 0_weeks_ago when i still had time to purchase the item elsewhere !
negative	thanks very much boo_hoo , i won_'_t be repeating this experience shopping with you !!
negative	!
negative	the tool box that they sent was dented up and it did not fit the the truck like they said it would !
negative	i would never order from them again !
negative	i never_experienced such bad customer_service ever , i had few issues with this company .
negative	most of the items they sell have very bad quality , but when i got a few defected dresses a few_months_ago , i had to send them back !!
negative	i did this , and i got everything back !!
negative	they didn_'_t accept it and even post them back to me !!
negative	i had a lot of orders with this on - line store , because i was buying clothing for someone_else , so orders were big all the time , but anyway they didn_'_t care about me as a customer at all .
negative	even when i called them , they were rude , i promised that i won_'_t order anything_else .
negative	i wish i didn_'_t , because i placed another 0 orders recently , and guess what , they couldn_'_t supply all items i ordered , but charged me as if they sent me everything !
negative	they overcharged me for $_00 . 00 , and it '_s a week since i e_- mailed them a complain , and they still didn_'_t reply !!!
negative	( it '_s 0_weeks since they charged me !!)
negative	.
negative	now for sure i won_'_t order anything !!
negative	if i could give them less then 0_star i would !!
negative	!
negative	while the pricing is competitive their customer_service ( even supervisors ) are lacking so they won_'_t be keeping customers if they are smart
negative	all advertisment states the generic ink will work in my brother_printer as the manufactures ink that was in the printer when purchased .
negative	no it does not .
negative	notified brother and tech and myself purged the system , using all the ink and still nothing .
negative	brother is sending me 0 new ink_cartridges .
negative	when i called inkfarm for help with a refund and that the purging emptied all ink_cartridges women on the phone stated " this was imlpossible " and there is no refund for this problem .
negative	i ordered 0 dresses from this company for my friend '_s wedding .
negative	they were appallingly badly made and far far too small .
negative	the dresses were unusable .
negative	i have spent 0 months complaining and trying to get some money back .
negative	despite spending over us $_000 , the company offered me only us $_00 !!
negative	outrageous .
negative	i '_m better off selling the dresses on ebay .
negative	do not use them !!!
negative	i only clicked one star because i had to .
negative	ideally i would click none .
negative	price was deceiving , have to pay extra for seating , drinks / snacks , and even worst for carry on bag .
negative	would not recommend spirit airline , thought i was getting a bargain but all i really got was a headache .
negative	be ware .
negative	i am so disappointed in the labels i received from myownlabels . com .
negative	they looked beautiful on the computer_screen during the design process , but when they arrived there was no comparison .
negative	i understand that the colors you see on the computer_screen may not be the exact colors of the printed label , but the labels looked faded as if the printer was low on ink and some of the text was hard to see .
negative	there was supposed to be vertical pin - striping on the label , but it was only visible with a bright light and a magnifying glass .
negative	i was counting on these labels for wedding_favors .
negative	luckily i had enough time before the wedding to design and print my own_labels at home .
negative	i won_'_t order from myownlabels . com again .
negative	my reservation was cancelled without anyone telling_me .
negative	i arrived do the hotel and did not have any reservation .
negative	when i called i was told that the payment on my credit_card was pending .. not possible i shop on line all the time with this card that has no spending limit .
negative	this item was sent to me with no invoice .
negative	when my mechanic went to put the taillight on , he found that it clearly was not for 0000_mercedes e000 .
negative	it was much smaller_than the one that was on my vehicle .
negative	need to have someone arrange to pick this on up to return to you , and either issue me a full credit , including shipping and handling , and send me the proper taillight .
negative	i have your phone_number on my credit_card statement , and if i do not hear back from you , i will call you at that phone_number .
negative	please either email me or call me at 000 - 000 - 0000 as soon as possible .

negative	my package did not arrive , ups shipping said it is missing when i tried_calling the seller partsgeek . com , you are disconnected by the automated_system .
negative	i also sent an_email to the sender partsgeek . com on thursday january 0 no response recieved so now i am out of $_00 and never recieved my part !
negative	the property is ok .
negative	but the managers are not very hospitable .
negative	if you need to take a rest room break you better hope you don_'_t have a real urgency or diarreah cause on this property you have to go show your face and ask permission to be let in cause the door is under constant lock and key .
negative	yeah they provide a legit concern about how vagrants dirty it up etc , but that is not acceptable for paying clients .
negative	the trash bins too they locked , we were advised that the bins were just the property use and not the paying client , so if you have trash like regulat trash you have to bring your own trash bag etc .
negative	not feeling happy here but have no choice for now but will move in a heart_beat where it is nice and managers dont make you feel_like you a nuisance for asjing them to open the bathroom or borrow the trash can for small trash
negative	i purchased speedo swimsuit and jacket for my 00 year_old_son through his school .
negative	he is a boys size large .
negative	i relied on the size_chart .
negative	the items that were shipped were so small , you couldn_'_t fit a 0 year_old in them !
negative	he never wore them once .
negative	i called the company so many_times and was told , " too bad " because he had them monogrammed .
negative	the sizes were so off that i can only think they are knock_offs .
negative	i spend something like $_000 for both items and got no use out of them .
negative	so many parents complained of the same problem .
negative	essentially , i got ripped_off !
negative	the school was unable to negotiate any assistance for us .
negative	the worst service i have ever_experienced in any retail_store anywhere !
negative	!
negative	i am unable to review the product as i have not received my order yet .
negative	i purchased a suction shower_head holder that was advertised as easy to fit and fits most standard shower heads .
negative	i have a standrad showerhead and the product failed to support it , nor did it stick on the wall .
negative	no instructions were provided .
negative	i will need to return the product for a refund .
negative	i bought a bcbs plan through ehealth .
negative	i am pregnant and will deliver at mt . sinai hospital , nyc .
negative	i needed a plan that would be specifically accepted at mt . sinai .
negative	i was assured by ehealth and mt . sinai that bcbs would be accepted .
negative	after i bought the plan , i was told by mt . sinai ( and other doctors ) that they do not accept the specific plan i had because it was " part of the exchange ."
negative	i called bcbs to confirm this and could never get through to anyone by phone .
negative	i waited an average of one hour on hold and was transferred 0 - 0 times and never got through to anyone_who could answer my question .
negative	i called ehealth , who looked into it with bcbs , and ehealth told me that the plan is not on the exchange .
negative	i also called mt . sinai , they called bcbs for me , and were told that the plan is on the exchange , and therefore , not accepted at mt . sinai .
negative	this was a major inconvenience for me , and a waste of time and money .
negative	i paid for a month of insurance that i could not use .
negative	furthermore , in that one month , i had one ultrasound with a doctor who does accept the bcbs plan i had and bcbs has sent me an invoice basically billing me for the doctor '_s fees saying that it is part of my out of pocket deductible .
negative	this for a plan that i have had to cancel because it is actually useless to me .
negative	in march i had no insurance .
negative	i had to look for and purchase a new insurance plan .
negative	i am very disappointed with my experience with ehealth and definitely would not recommend it to anyone .
negative	petflow is very disappointing for the second time in the few_months i have ordered from them .
negative	i tried to call many_times about an order i placed and got no responses .
negative	i sent the order back and still got no response .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	i am waiting for a refund .
negative	i wouldn_'_t recommend petflow to anyone .
negative	i was misled to think it was the hotel i was speaking with , then when i got to hotel they quoted a much lower_rate but could not get it because expedia won_'_t do that .
negative	i did not like anything i bought ughh
negative	i am hoping that i can update this with a great review upon recieving but would have expected it a week_later even with monday being a holiday .
negative	when ordering my necklace , i did not receive confirmation until i asked for it several_times .
negative	shipping took much longer_than_anticipated .
negative	now that i am trying to return the necklace within the 00 day window , my emails have gone unanswered .
negative	i suspect they are waiting until the 00 days is up and then will refuse the return .
negative	i tried posting on the facebook_page and my post was instantly deleted and i was removed from the page .
negative	interesting .
negative	seems this company goes to great lengths to make_sure there is only positive_feedback about them on the web .
negative	the total uncool conn shop to use
negative	i ordered present for my 0 years old_son from the cool shop on 0 - 00 - 00 contacted them 00 - 00 - 00 , sent parcel_force tracking ref the parcel hadn_'_t left denmark contact parcel_force on 00 - 00 - 00 ref was invalid , sent several e_- mails to coolshop no replies 00 - 00 - 00 , had virutal chat with them got full out a claims form !!!!
negative	missing parcel
negative	what conn the sender should full in claims form not the buyer , please beware parcel_force are not responsible for the parcel until on uk soil , would never use again , now going have 0 very unhappy 0 year_old on xmas day with no xmas_present :-(
negative	item arrived 00 - 00 - 00 smashed box , returned which itemed 00 - 00 - 00 signed for by the cool shop , guess what no refund !!!!!
negative	now on 00 - 00 - 00 , as for that idoit martin who '_s replied my e_- mails he should get the sack .
negative	i shall reporting to trading standard , these cowboy '_s need stopping :-(
negative	my brother died suddenly in an accident and i had to return home .
negative	after advising the customer_service rep of this they asked for his gp to fill_out a form and i advised he wasn_'_t sick , he died suddenly after falling into a canal and drowned and was taken directly to the morgue .
negative	i advised the request was ridiculous and was told by the agent ' there '_s nothing to get upset about '.
negative	this was after i explained i had just lost my brother .
negative	at this point i refused to deal with this person any further and asked for a manager who has_been professional and helpful but this doesn_'_t change the upset caused by the first agent .
negative	i booked a king - sized bed room that is handicap_accessible and on the first floor .
negative	got to the hotel , did not have the room that i booked .
negative	instead i got a non_- handicap_accessible room on the second floor .
negative	the wheelchair barely fit through the elevator door .
negative	the desk associate offered us what he said was the hotel '_s only handicap_accessible room , which was on the first floor , but so full of furniture that the wheelchair could not be used in the room .
negative	there was an armoire , no closet , there was a dresser , there were also a large bench , a table , two chairs , and the bedside_tables .
negative	it also was the smallest queen sized bed i have ever_seen .
negative	the next_day , room service arrived while i was showering and my husband asked them to come_back later .
negative	no one came back .
negative	when i inquired at the front_desk , i was told that we would not have service , that my husband said not to come_back - not true .
negative	one employee did finally offer to do the room .
negative	my husband could not shower or bath because , although there were handrails in the tub , there were no handholds outside the tub area and no inserts or a place for towels outside the tub .
negative	i could not get a copy of my bill from the front_desk .
negative	i ordered from forever00 . com on sunday october 00 expecting my order to arrive by friday or saturday .
negative	i checked my tracking and it says that my order will not arrive until november 0 !!!!
negative	how is this even possible ??
negative	a whole month and some days .
negative	that '_s ridiculous .
negative	i needed this for friday .
negative	if i had have read on the site that it would take so long i would have looked somewhere_else for my merchandise .
negative	instead of thinking i have found what i needed and no_longer need to look anywhere_else , because i will have it in time .
negative	i am very disappointed .
negative	even if this is a glitch in the system and i won_'_t receive the package until october 0 i am still disappointed .
negative	i would not have expected it to take that long seeing as how it was shipped the very next_day .
negative	it seems like another shipping method was used and not fedex .
negative	it shouldn_'_t take over a week to ship ground via_fedex .
negative	as of today , october 00 , i have yet to receive a refund from forever 00 .
negative	i have called twice since then regarding the pack .
negative	the first time i called the day they received it to make_sure that i would receive a refund .
negative	i was told yes and that i should wait 0 - 0 business day .
negative	so i waited .
negative	then i called again after the 0 days and asked about it .
negative	i was told to wait 0 - 0 business days .
negative	i called again today and they told me that the refund was never logged .
negative	i talked with a supervisor to express to him how i felt about the situation and how this never should have happened if i '_ve called twice .
negative	he showed no concern for my issue and just rushed me off the phone .
negative	this was an awful experience .
negative	there is no way it should take a hole month to get a refund from a company .
negative	i am so annoyed with forever 00 . com .
negative	i will never order with them again .
negative	i normally have a great experience with bookbyte but this was the worst ever .
negative	i have been trying to contact someone to return a book before it was too late to receive a full_refund , but it seemed as if i was being drug along .
negative	i had the book in my possession and i was told that the book hadn_'_t arrived to me and that when i got it i could return it .
negative	i had the book in possession and now it '_s beyond my full_refund day and i am highly upset now that i know i will not receive my full_refund it i return this book .
negative	my box was missing a pair of shoes when i received it .
negative	i called and was told that i would be refunded for the price of the shoes and that there was going to be a case opened up with the carrier .
negative	as far as i know i never received the refund and i never_heard_anything back about the carrier .
negative	i ordered a timing_belt kit for my car for $_00 . 00 .
negative	i called the dealer to confirm the engine size 0 . 0l and when i ordered the part the website said it would fit .
negative	it didn_'_t .
negative	i contacted parts_geek to let them know that their website is wrong and pretty_much they did nothing .
negative	the mechanic had taken the car apart when it was discovered that the this timing_belt was the wrong_size so i ended_up going to napa and getting the correct sized belt .
negative	when i contacted partsgeek to let them know their website is incorrect , this is my actual response : " please accept our sincere apologies for failing to provide you with the excellent service you expected from us ."
negative	a pathetic canned response , like hmmmm lets give her response # 0 .
negative	no personal_touch no way to contact them via phone .... pretty_much i would never buy anything from them again ............ if you need parts go to napa or on line car - stuff better customer_service and they actually seem like they care .
negative	i purchased these led_clip on lights so i could see my dogs when i let them out at night .
negative	it seemed like agreat deal , you got 0 for less_than $ 0 . 00 .
negative	when i finally got the product i was pissed that only one of the lights actually works .
negative	if it wasn_'_t such a pain to ship it back for a refund i would but for the actual $ 0 it '_s not worth it .
negative	i won_'_t order anything_else from them again though .
negative	the company was called petflow .
negative	beware of that company and their very cheap products .
negative	we ordered two cards to give to clients as gifts .
negative	used the logo for our conference as the graphic and paid the postage so we ' d get them in plenty of time for giving .
negative	paid the bill , and two_weeks_later , no cards , but an_email_asking us to respond to this survey to tell them " how we did ".
negative	called customer_service number who informed us that the graphic was unacceptable and the cards never got printed ... we never got a call from them , or an_email_telling us that .. we had to call them to find out that we can '_t use a logo .
negative	will ever use them again .
negative	and ... any business_owner should steer_clear of this operation unless they want to , as we did , disappoint our clients .
negative	i bought a car from drive time and i am having to put money into repairs , every time i call to find out what is covered_under the warranty i am told that it is not covered , i have had problems from the fuel system , oil leaking , electrical problems with sun roof , struts and now my car alarm is not working and all this will have to be paid out of pocket .
negative	i truly would not recommend drive time to anybody i work with or any family_members as they are a big headache
negative	i submitted my order on - line and received an e_- mail the next_day telling_me that there was a problem with it and it had been placed on hold .
negative	apparently , your system is unable to fill an order if the billing_address is different from the shipping address .
negative	a money order was requested but i felt it was an unnecessary request - calling mastercard would '_ve confirmed the shipping address as acceptable even_though different from the billing_address .
negative	i decided to place my order elsewhere where they were far more accommodating .
negative	my wife , my infant child , and i all started our travel on july 0 .
negative	san_francisco caused delays due to taxi issues and caused us to miss our connecting_flight .
negative	we had to stay in houston air port on a bench because they refused to pay for us a hotel room because it wasn_'_t maintenance related , even_though it wasn_'_t our fault we missed the flight .
negative	the uso closes at 0000 .
negative	i am military and i would expect for the uso , expecially at a major airport to be open 00_hours for military convenience .
negative	the airport refused to give us cots even_though the airport had them to sleep on .
negative	i think it is very inconvenient for military and families traveling with infant children .
negative	i am dissatisfied with united_airlines and houston airport '_s customer_service .
negative	also , my wife left her goodie on the plane and we emailed them right_away and still no reply .
negative	i personally think it would be easier to just talk to someone in the phone .
negative	it is too easy to disregard an_email .
negative	i could not believe that i ordered this item for my nephew for christmas and could not have it sent directly to him .
negative	i had to go through so much bull that i canceled the order .
negative	during the entire purchase process there was something .
negative	the first time i went in i asked about holding a down payment check for up to 00 days after doing an application and choosing a vehicle , cause i know of places that do this for the customer .
negative	my salesman told me that this might be possible and would check with the loan guy .
negative	he came back and said that they could only hold a check for up to 0 week .
negative	now my sales_person obviously already knew this and wasn_'_t upfront , like most instances .
negative	finally decided to do the layaway that they have .
negative	all the sales_person told me was they could hold it until i was ready to pick it up .
negative	i then got a call on a weekly_basis which was unnecessary .
negative	0 phone_call they verified when i was picking_up the vehicle and all the sudden they needed more money cause they said they can only hold it for 0_weeks , which i clearly discussed 00 days from day 0 .
negative	so i reluctantly put more money down .
negative	during that call we discussed exactly when i would come in .
negative	the day before i was too come in i got a call asking the same question by the same person .
negative	as if they had a careless memory .
negative	i recieved a voice_mail for this call and returned the call and my sales_person acted as if he had no_clue who i was giving me a generic spiel about if i am still interested in purchasing and if there was a type of vehicle i was interested in , this was after giving my full name and returned the call the same day .
negative	i finally made it to my pick_up date and was told it would not take long just to sign and what not .
negative	i even got insurance set_up on my way there .
negative	so i got there and did the vehicle check updated everything to state that days date and re initialed everything .
negative	i was then told my down payment was higher_than initially agreed as if he had no memory of it , which took a co signer to get it down , the whole reason for adding a co .
negative	i then was told that there was a new promotion that involved paying more even_though the promo offered was still good .
negative	when i asked how it would benefit me i was told it wouldn_'_t and then_proceeded to tell me they are " out " of the orig promo and would have to call upper mgmt to get another one approved ... by then i told them i was going to walk .
negative	finally getting to the payment date when previously called wad advised to come in that day so the due date would work .
negative	they tried to give me a sooner date on a week that want even my payday !
negative	after that there was a " system malfunction " and day there for at_least an hr waiting .. all so i would have to set_up auto pay when i could have easily done that at home .
negative	0 hrs later i finally was able to leave .
negative	this whole_process should have only taken an hr tops but since they were only interested in meeting quota since it was the end of the month i was definately not priority .
negative	they were only interested in themselves and not ashamed to be outright about it .. not buying from them again ... too painful and unnecessary !!!
negative	!
negative	i think this is a poor way to make cusomers feel_confident about the service you provide .
negative	particularly those of us who have been a victim of identity_theft .
negative	my purpose for getting this service was to monitor my credit and public record transactions as well as build my credit .
negative	i '_m told when i call that our ssn numbers are similar and that is why i keep seeing someone_elses information on my account .
negative	i just don_'_t like the fact that i '_m paying you to help me guard my identity and someone_elses name contstantly appears on my account !
negative	it feels_like an invasion of my privacy !
negative	i would think that a company as large as yours would have the means to fix this problem .
negative	i will say that other than this issue i have not had any other problems with your service , but i will be closing my account !
negative	i was sent cases of cat_food that i ordered that had a " best by " date of 0 days after the day it arrived .
negative	this stuff is old .
negative	even the label on the can was an outdated label .
negative	to the credit of customer_service - they couldn_'_t have been nicer and credited me for my purchase immediately .
negative	so , that was very well handled .
negative	but knowing about the poor quality of merchandise they ' re shipping out , i wouldn_'_t order anything from them again ... especially something i '_m feeding my pets .
negative	we flew business class to amsterdam and had a terrible experience , rude flight crew , broken seats , and over - cooked awful food .
negative	but our flight home , economy , was just fine .
negative	helpful flight crew and better food ....
negative	we won_'_t fly klm again , but if you do , don_'_t spend the money for business class !
negative	i am not sure how this company stays in business .
negative	from the very first contact when my vet '_s office had to fax the prescription to this company 0 times in 0 days until their last incredibly dangerous act of incompetence i have never worked with a company so lacking in customer_service and quality control measures .
negative	the final straw occurred when my critically important package of insulin for my diabetic dog arrived at my home with the wrong name , address , dog '_s name , dosing instructions etc .
negative	i pray that the person_who received my dog '_s order did not give their dog an incorrect / lethal dose of insulin .
negative	unacceptable service throughout .
negative	the hotel was very clean though old but on friday and saturday nights it was hookersville .
negative	we even had one come knock on our door in error .
negative	there is a night club across the street and early saturday we heard gun shots and friday_night and sunday_morning there were numerous police vehicles and an ambulance at the night club .
negative	was very happy my husband was with me as i just did not feel very safe .
negative	i fly many airlines but this experience with delta had to be the worst ever !
negative	i am sure delta knew like everyone else there was a bad storm approaching and instead of canceling my entire trip , they insisted my flights were on time and left me stranded in atlanta with no where to go .
negative	never again delta
negative	i placed an order for 0 white chaise lounge pool chairs on may 00th , 0000 .
negative	i received my order confirmation in my email shortly_thereafter , and in that confirmation , the company verified the amount of the purchase at $_000 . 00 total .
negative	shipping was clearly indicated to be free , which is why i ordered through your company .
negative	by may 00st , the funds were taken from my bank_account , in the amount of $_000 . 00 .
negative	in my conversations with customer_service , i was told that this is what the manufacturer charges for shipping and my product is coming directly from the manufacturer .
negative	frankly , i don_'_t care .
negative	i ordered from you based on free_shipping ... your price for the product was competitive with others , but the free_shipping sold me on your company .
negative	now , you ' re trying to say i have to pay shipping .
negative	you cannot advertise one thing ( like free_shipping ) and then do the opposite .
negative	my other complaint is that i have yet to receive my chairs , or an_email_confirming shipment , although your customer_service dept .
negative	told me they were shipped on may 00st ....... three_days ago .
negative	finally , i also ordered a free catalogue and i have not received anything .
negative	all in all , my review gives your company an " f " at this point .... every element of my transaction has_been negative .
negative	holding $ 0 , 000 on my account and no trip booked .
negative	called to have the funds released after being transferred twice and waiting 0 hours on hold " sorry that department is closed ".
negative	nice , bet they were open an_hour ago .
negative	can you take my information and forward it to the correct department so they can call me back ( you know so i don_'_t grow old on hold )...." ummm we only take calls " the top travel_agent company can '_t send emails ???
negative	really ???
negative	sounds legit .
negative	best line ever " we understand your frustration and want to resolve this for you but we can '_t ".
negative	wow !!
negative	thanks for your awesome help today !
negative	seriously hope me or my family don_'_t have an_emergency because we have no access to our account until these funds are released ...
negative	pretty great feeling !
negative	i will never again use fed_ex .
negative	my part still has not arrived .
negative	it is sitting a state away .
negative	the fed_ex office actually had the balls to call me yesterday and ask me to come get it .
negative	when i told them it was a car part , that i could not drive my car until i had it , they told me to ask a friend or neighbor to come get it .
negative	wow , really ?
negative	better solution fed_ex - get your head out of your ass and learn how to deliver
neutral	the tennis top i ordered arrived in a plastic_bag with no packaging around it , and it looked like a rag stuffed in a heap in the corner of the bag .
neutral	this is a present so i will have to try to improve the appearance before i can give it .
neutral	when i received the package one of the bags
neutral	of kitty_litter was opened and all over the box
neutral	ordered the tutti bambini louis seligh cotbed and was told a text would be sent on day of delivery .
neutral	no text was sent but i received a call when the driver was 00mins away .
neutral	the driver had to deliver to my nans address ( 00 year_old disabled woman ).
neutral	she_lives on the 0st_floor in a block of flats and the driver refused to carry the items up .
neutral	after a argument and alot of time wasting 0 gentleman that saw what was happening had to come over and carry the boxes upstairs to my grandmother - these were extrememly heavy .
neutral	i complained via_email to precious_little_ones and although they apologised i was informed that it is their company policy that drivers are not to enter property and are not insured for a driver hurting themself carrying items upstairs - surely this should be put on their website next to big heavy items ?!?!
neutral	didnt make_sense to me at all
neutral	first time buyer here .
neutral	thought i ' d try it before_committing and glad i did .
neutral	good service and choices .
neutral	however , the prices for fancy_feast were higher_than most and the box of minced turkey had mostly dented_cans .
neutral	disappointed in that .
neutral	i used to buy monthly from another site but they did away with the fancy_feast .
neutral	if it weren_'_t for the ' target practice ' on the case of cat_food , i would likely buy again but still looking for lowest_prices and best quality .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	( i did not throw the cans out because they weren_'_t bubbled tops and can '_t afford to buy more so i thank_god they seem to be ok . lower prices , would help .
neutral	i have ordered with partsgeek several_times their prices and delivery times were right on , until my last order , where the wrong part was picked and sent to me , there is no phone_number to call to talk to a live_person and their returns and customer_service communications are only done by email , in which you recieve a rma to ship the part back at your expence , then wait for a credit , in the mean time you have to re order the part , pay for it ( even_though it was their mistake ) and hope the right one is sent to you .
neutral	that is not great customer_service . and is risky business .
neutral	i bought this top for the gym i am usually size 00 / 00 but found the medium too big changed for the small and that was still too big , strange !!
neutral	!
neutral	at_least with soactive it is easy to return at no extra_cost .
neutral	the website is good , and there is also a good variety of products , but i find that most of the products are very expensive , and can be bought for much_cheaper on english health store websites .
neutral	my local_pharmacy molloys lifestyle pharmacy and healthstore , now sells almost all products that evergreen sells , but at cheaper prices .
neutral	i also like to support my local business .
neutral	everything was fine until we cancelled a reservation we made on march 00 , 0000 , for 0nights at the hard rock hotel .
neutral	we cancelled by mistake then an_hour later tried to reinstate the reservation .
neutral	we then got hit with a cancellation_fee and could not get the same room with king_size bed .
neutral	i believe late fees could have been waived .
neutral	i love this company for its prices and variety .
neutral	never needed cs so can '_t attest to that . unfortunately , the shipping time is ridiculous .
neutral	everytime i order , it takes a week to even ship out and get a tracking_#.
neutral	its almost worth paying the extra dollar on a product .
neutral	everyone else i order from gets it to me in 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i think the item i ordered was too pricey .
neutral	i liked my service from petflow , and i received my order very quickly .
neutral	it was also convenient .
neutral	their prices are pretty good , and my cat_litter is cheaper there .
neutral	the only_thing that i was dissatisfied with was my coupon .
neutral	i received a coupon in the mail ( which was how i found out about petflow ), and it stated that i could get 00_%_off + free_shipping with a certain coupon on code .
neutral	right after i made my purchase i realized that i did get the discount but not the free_shipping .
neutral	when i was about to contact customer_service , i saw that free_shipping only applies to orders that are over $_00 after the discount .
neutral	this was irritating to find out , especially_since it was not written anywhere on the coupon .
neutral	i like the labels i got but i didn_'_t realize how small they would be when printed .
neutral	i wish there were an option to print a sample of some_sort .
neutral	i would have ordered larger ones ( and paid more ) if i had realized how small my labels were going to be .
neutral	the shipping and delivery were very fast - i think i had them in about a week .
neutral	process was very slow , uncomfortable needing to give credit_card number twice for reservation after reservation was already confirmed .
neutral	also , did not realize i was not speaking directly with the hotel chain until i got this email !
neutral	called for apt and scheduled april 0 at 0 am .
neutral	was called by mavis to review the apt details for a second time .
neutral	confirmed april 0 at 0 am .
neutral	arrived to find short - staffed department and scheduling in chaos as result .
neutral	offered to return the next_day at 0 am to be helpful though i was already in queue and set .
neutral	ed said i would be given priority the next_day as a result .
neutral	arrived at 0 am the next_day .
neutral	others who came after were serviced and out the door well before me .
neutral	replacing snows and aligning tires took 0 hours .
neutral	if this is priority service there is no reason to return .
neutral	i am giving a midpoint star_rating and i have otherwise been happy with the service .
neutral	i received the 00 pack case of wellness_cat_food in good time , although half of the cans had dents in them .
neutral	i am not satisfied to see thsis although none of the cans yet have leaked there is always that potential .
neutral	still_waiting for order
neutral	hotline reagiert nicht bzw .
neutral	erst , wenn sich die sache bereits erledigt hat , auf mails für umbuchungen .
neutral	solange alles nach plan läuft , ist der service sonst in ordnung ...
neutral	odered the item on wednesday .
neutral	thursday - an in stock order was had a status of order pending for over 00_hours and when i rang to question why i was told it was because i had used my points and the order had got stuck so it would be forwarded .
neutral	friday - the order was recieved the next_day .
neutral	opened it up and i have a game missing .
neutral	another phone_call was made and this time i was told they would contact the warehouse and only after a small stock take of the item was completed then they would forward the item 0st_class recorded .
neutral	saturday - the item that was missing arrives .
neutral	finally a complete order .
neutral	0 days to complete an order that should have taken 00_hours .
neutral	not very impressive .
neutral	this service is maybe too safe , i can '_t seem to get my registration completed because i have moved and my new address is not showing at the 0 major credit_bureaus yet .
neutral	i have sent in everything asked of me and i do appreciate the protection , however this getting to be too much of a hassle .
neutral	identity_guard provides nice credit information , but there is very little to show about your membership .
neutral	i upgraded it at one point , understanding that my reports would come once a month , then the system returned me to my former quarterly report membership , where i could not see a report more than every 0 months .
neutral	there is no online reference to my membership , and when i called to speak to someone about it , they knew less_than i did .
neutral	also , when i called to ask about updating a public record , they did not know how to proceed to do that .
neutral	we placed an order , and had acceptable levels of communication until i gave the ok . at that point we received no confirmation that the order had been officially placed or an estimate for when the drives would be arriving .
neutral	after a phone_call and an_email with no response , a coworker followed_up again and we received confirmation almost a week after the initial attempts .
neutral	the drives made it fine and were as expected but additional communication would have made the interaction much less_stressful .
neutral	there are some good deals , however when something does quite work out and you want a refund you have to wait a few_weeks before you receive anything .
neutral	also when trying to contact it takes a long time to get a reply ... as in a couple of weeks .
neutral	using reservation_counter was easy ; i did not realize i was not using the motel 0 site .
neutral	to my surprise , my credit_card was billed for the full_amount the next_day -- a full six_weeks before my stay .
neutral	i feel this practice is dishonest .
neutral	motel 0 never did this , so i didn_'_t expect it since it wasn_'_t obvious to me that i wasn_'_t on the motel 0 site .
neutral	it doesn_'_t matter in the long run , the rooms are paid for and i will use them , i '_ll just be more careful about which site i use to reserve my rooms in the future .
neutral	very helpful sometimes .
neutral	but , could be more easy to apply .
neutral	and more mailroom and file clerk positions all in brooklyn area * only *
neutral	we placed our order , was pleased how quickly it all began and pleasant service , with 0st 0 pair .. then come to find out with other 0 pair , 0 was on back order for some time , the other , after many calls .. come to be told they were just not going to carry product any longer !!
neutral	then i had to redecide a new pair , and await them to be ordered , and recieved , kept being told should be there soon , took a lot longer !
neutral	!
neutral	overall pleased with all products in the end finally !
neutral	!
neutral	i have been happy with the overall service but would say the 0 - 00 day payment processing u state on the website is grossly misleading .
neutral	on each_occasion it has_been a month from delivery to receipt of money .
neutral	hard to write a review when we still have not received the part .
neutral	first off i tried_calling 0 times to talk to someone , was on hold each time for 00_minutes before hanging up .
neutral	finally i ordered it online .
neutral	i thought i was getting the part from new_jersey but it left from texas .
neutral	all the reviews i read on the site said people received their part in 0 - 0 days so i was hopeful .
neutral	we are down a car and live far from work and it has_been extremely difficult getting around , so getting this part quick was important .
neutral	the initial tracking said we would get the part on november 00 , ok not bad one week from ordering .
neutral	but no , outside of partsgeek control ups misrouted the package and i was told that we would have to just sit back and wait for the part to show up .
neutral	this part is cursed .
neutral	so now we have less time on the warranty from partgeek .
neutral	maybe next time i will buy local and pay more for the part but have the car on the road .
neutral	bad_experience overall .
neutral	i did not receive a notice my gift_card had shipped , so i had to track the order .
neutral	i do not understand_why shipping time takes so long .
neutral	was given arrival_date 00 days away after shipped .
neutral	delivery of the vehicule was fine but whe it came to pick_up it was impossible to get through on either the mobile number or the booking phone line .
neutral	as a results we were hanging_around in the heathrow car_park for about 00_mins with two small_children late in the evenng , so stress_free it wasn ; t .
neutral	i don_'_t like giving negative_reviews but i was disappointed with the spray i ordered for a funeral .
neutral	for nearly_£_00 i had hoped for flowers which looked fresh rather_than wilted .
neutral	the enormous white ribbon looked totally out of place both in colour and style given the occasion .
neutral	i also don_'_t want an account but can '_t post this review without accepting iflorist '_s terms and conditions
neutral	nu am apreciat faptul ca pe unul dintre produsele comandate parte din ingrediente erau acoperite cu marker negru permanent pentru a nu fi vizibile .
neutral	my item ' the last of us : joel edition ' got to me quickly but the box was damaged which i was annoyed with , and then i check the contents and one of the pages in the art book was ripped like someone had open it before it was shipped which i was really upset with , so my item is in pretty bad condition
neutral	after receiving email from yourself telling_me my phone had past and was in working order , and that payment would follow shortly , i had to call a couple of times to ask where the cheque was .
neutral	you had had my appliance for over a week and still on sign , and at the moment i am still_waiting .
neutral	tonight i used bookit for the first time .
neutral	i was trying to book a hotel room for my husband and myself for a weekend_getaway to celebrate our anniversary .
neutral	tried several other_sites as well ( orbitz , expedia , priceline , hotwire ), but went with bookit because it seemed to have the best price with the most information .
neutral	i filled out the info requested , clicked the bookit !
neutral	button .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	and got an_error_message .
neutral	it said the credit_card number i ' d submitted was not correct .
neutral	that was true : i had omitted a digit .
neutral	i corrected it , tried again -- same message .
neutral	again -- same message .
neutral	found a customer_service number , called it , spoke to a charming and helpful young_man ( can '_t recall his name ), who was able to complete the transaction for me over the phone , but it was a long and tiresome process .
neutral	he seemed to need to verify each piece of information three_times .
neutral	i hope he is representative of the staff because his pleasant humor helped_me to maintain mine .
neutral	but i hope the website can be improved to recognize corrections .
neutral	the dress i bought didn_'_t fit me and i was disappointed that there was not an opportunity to exchange the dress for a larger_size .
neutral	i '_ve returned the dress but haven_'_t had my money back yet and i fear that could take some time .
neutral	i haven_'_t even had an_email to let_me know they '_ve received the dress back .
neutral	would be nice to have more communication between the customer and boohoo .
neutral	thanks the first quote i got was £_00 . 00 - it went up to £_00 in five_minutes .
neutral	could you explain please ?,
neutral	i love the idea behind it and the range of flavours is fantastic however i ordered medium strength apple and strawberry eliquid with the e pen and i have found that this is too strong .
neutral	i '_ve had a very sore chest using it !
neutral	i have therefor ordered one low mg of nicotine and some without_any to see the difference .
neutral	in my opinion the medium burns but i '_ve been told that they all so but i like to give things the benefit of the doubt and the taste of the eliquid are lovely and the range is huge :) i think it '_s likely that medium was just too strong for me .
neutral	the battery life on the epen is fab and looks great .
neutral	i ' d deffo give it a try
neutral	the bag is too big for the filling supplied .
neutral	not enough beans so when you sit_down you end up on the floor .
neutral	i used charlene '_s safe ride to get to and from the airport on a recent visit .
neutral	the ride to the airport was fine : the driver was on time , courteous , and knew where he was going .
neutral	yhe ride that picked me up was less so .
neutral	first , as i '_m landing i get a phone_call from the driver , who says that he cannot wait for me any longer and will send another driver soon .
neutral	the thing is , i had not only given charlene '_s safe ride my flight number so they could track the flight , but my flight had arrived 00_minutes early .
neutral	another driver calls me eventually and i after i get my luggage i meet the driver at a designated pick_up spot .
neutral	the driver does not get out of the car to help me with my bags , or even open the trunk of the car .
neutral	despite having a gps in his car and the fact that i told him i had never been to durham before , he asked me for directions to where i was staying .
neutral	i was not impressed by his service or his abilities as a driver .
neutral	but i '_ve definitely had worse taxi experiences in my life .
neutral	i actually had worse taxi experiences while visiting durham .
neutral	this is why give the service 0_stars .
neutral	i had heard good things about bookit from friends who use this agency .
neutral	so when planning for spring_break , i felt secure in choosing bookit .
neutral	this was my first time and it was quite simple .
neutral	i need to test_drive it a few more times to see if there are real savings in using this agency .
neutral	right now , i have booked a great hotel in orlando but didn_'_t see any difference in price from booking on the actual hotel website .
neutral	bookit actually cost a little more in price but offered a $_00 off coupon which brought me to the same price as what the hotel offered .
neutral	also , there is a cost to cancel no_matter when you cancel .
neutral	most hotels give you until the day of to cancel at no charge .
neutral	bookit charges a $_00 " service fee " regardless of when you cancel .
neutral	but the trip is planned and the hotel is booked , i just hope there are no_issues at check in .
neutral	hoping this is was worth it .
neutral	its easy to order online ' they inform you when its ben shipped . one thing i dont understand_why it took a week to ship ?
neutral	i had an_appointment for 0am , to simply get snow_tires put on .
neutral	i did not leave until 00 : 00 am .
neutral	why make an_appointment ?
neutral	also a technician told me that all the car fluids look like they have never been changed .
neutral	this was not true .
neutral	why was the technician checking the car fluids , when all i wanted was the car tires changed ?
neutral	received a few_weeks_ago but just installed .
neutral	as always after i installed got the low ink message but then printed b_& w ok . have only used hp_cartridges in the past but performance was awful so thought id try your product out .
neutral	only_negative the black_ink dripped all over my hands on the large black_cartridge ... didn_'_t make me happy 😚
neutral	i bought three swimsuits which are all very sexy and i love the styles .
neutral	i ordered them in a medium according to the size_chart on the website ( i '_m 0 ' 0 and 000 #, 00 - 00 - 00 and normally_wear a size 0 - 0 ), however one of them is almost too big and the other two are too small .
neutral	there are no returns or exchanges , so now i '_ve wasted money on two suits that i cannot wear .
neutral	i '_m very disappointed as i wanted to wear them on our trip to mexico , but now they will just sit in a drawer .
neutral	overall my experience was okay but i did have problems with ordering on - line .
neutral	everything was fine until we got to processing the order and it told me that it could not complete my order as there was an_error , so i assumed that it had not taken my order and then_proceeded to order from somewhere_else .
neutral	then i check my e_- mails and find that my order has_been dispatched !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	what rating_system do you use : fico or vantage ?
neutral	the storage_unit on west street ( with the lighthouse ) has an extreme shortage of carts for moving items in and out of storage_units .
neutral	i believe there are no more than 0 or 0 for the entire facility and most appear to be decades old .
neutral	i spoke with a customer_service representative about this issue and she noted that the owners were aware of the problem but were unwilling to spend funds in purchasing additional carts .
neutral	ottentimes , i have had to search through all of the buildings for a cart only to find none are available .
neutral	in general , the facility is poorly maintained ( elevators , hallways , lighting , carts , etc_.)
neutral	the hair test all though gave a result of either possive or negative should be given more clearly , if possitive .. how offten drugs have been used .
neutral	and the " cut_off " amount detectable !?
neutral	what does this even mean ?
neutral	it was not explained in the instruction .
neutral	so does this mean that a very small_amount can be detcted but the result still be negative ?
neutral	a little more info needed for customers .
neutral	this site is a helpful tool to finding employment , however one must me computer saavy in order to access the site .
neutral	we lost a whole day of vacation to our destination when there were no weather issues whatsoever and we missed our connection .
neutral	spent 0 hours in laguardia airport waiting .
neutral	then , at our return , we were forced to incur additonal hotel , car and airline seat expenses when delta cancelled our flight home without recourse .
neutral	travelocity should not use delta_airlines if it wants to insure customer loyalty .
neutral	my shower seat hasn_'_t bee installed or used yet , but looks good .
neutral	i believe it should be mentioned that hudson - reed requires packages to be physically handed to purchaser , a serious inconvenience for me .
neutral	i ordered 0 custom water_bottles .
neutral	the template and customization was very easy to use , and i got exactly_what i ordered .
neutral	the one thing i didn_'_t particularly like was that the two images i placed on the water_bottles were not spaced to be on opposite sides .
neutral	rather , they ended_up right next to each other , which looked a little odd .
neutral	i must_admit , though , that is the way they appeared on the proof .
neutral	i guess i just thought they would be printed more evenly spaced out .
neutral	good basic price spoilled by ridiculous card charges . also hard to contact by phone ( at 00p_per_minute ) and slow response to e_mail following automated holding reply .
neutral	the service has worked well but the call to confirm we had signed_up for service was tooooo long .
neutral	we were in canada and i had to borrow a phone in a small community .
neutral	after confirming a lot of information i was left on the line while he went to check on something and a recording gave a variety of messages and said the operators were very busy .
neutral	after waiting for some time i hung_up .
neutral	we ordered a fender and under fender from your company .
neutral	they arrived in a timely_fashion and in great shape and the cost was very agreeable .
neutral	the shipping_costs were astronomical in comparison to the price of the part .
neutral	i understand that they were oversized but , wow .
neutral	the cost .
neutral	almost 0x as much as the cost of the part .
neutral	would probably use you again but hopefully the costs of shipping go down .
neutral	it is still cheaper_than taking the car to a body shop by_far .
neutral	the delivery did not show up at all on the first day it was planned for and nobody rang to let_me know .
neutral	when i contacted tnt at 0 . 00pm at night the man i spoke to said he would put it on an am delivery for the following_tuesday .
neutral	when i rang to check this on the tuesday it was on the lorry but not for an am delivery but it did get here just after 00 which was fine .
neutral	i have yet to install the 0 radiators but am hoping they are ok .
neutral	the packaging they were in was very badly_damaged and split_open completely at the top etc .
neutral	i got the driver to write this on his slip but hopefully they will be ok !
neutral	!
neutral	i was quite impressed at the speed this item arrived from when i ordered it .
neutral	the item was a peacoat for my son as a xmas_present .
neutral	i kept the jacket in it '_s polythene packaging before wrapping because this made it easier to wrap .
neutral	however , i wish i hadn_'_t because when my son opened his present on xmas day , it was to find the jacket had a button missing and 0 other buttons were hanging by threads !
neutral	it was a great disappointment and i cannot understand how this item passed quality control .
neutral	i will not be ordering online from this company again .
neutral	i first ordered flowers from you years_ago and it was always an exciting experience .
neutral	one could sense that you were a young and enthusiastie company .
neutral	now you seem an old and tired company - tired graphics , the usual photos , no more zippy intros .
neutral	this time i ordered over the mid - august holiday so perhaps you were very busy .
neutral	but there will always be a mid - august holiday and you will always know what to expect .
neutral	you took a while to sort out and acknowledge my order and i worried till the last about delivey date .
neutral	in fact i think my flowers arrived a day late .
neutral	i received a thank - you photo from the receiving end in bruxelles and the flowers looked as though they too had suffered in the mix - up . you '_ll have to try a lot harder flora macqueen .
neutral	i love my new bedroom_furniture now its finally arrived .
neutral	the problem was they lost the wardrobe , found it , lost it , found it , lost it , found it ...... you get the idea .
neutral	each time the warehouse contacted me to arrange delivery i arranged time off work , then each time i was contacted again to say they had lost it again .
neutral	some problem with it showing on the computer but they could actually find it .
neutral	staff were very apologetic and polite but not a good experience
neutral	i paid for some day deliver , but then received email that flowers could not be delivered saturday due to lack of man power .
neutral	flowers to be delivered today monday .
neutral	i have not reveived any confirmation of delivery yet !
neutral	i liked the email to let_me know there was problem but still do not know if delivery was successful .
neutral	more discounts on airfares gor frequent flyers
neutral	i had the most frustrating time again with dpd delivery service .
neutral	they sent me an_email_saying that a delivery was due between 0 : 00_pm and 0 : 00_pm that day i was very busy working from home but had to be out for half an_hour to drop_off my son and other children to their class between 0 : 00 and 0 : 00 .
neutral	now i was not sure what the delivery was of as i had ordered several things from different places over the previous days .
neutral	some of these things were urgent .
neutral	i desperately tried to find a tel number i could speak to them asking them to avoid delivering during the only half_hour of the day i was not going to be in .
neutral	it was impossible to find a tel number and talk to a person !!!!
neutral	this in itself was hugely frustrating .
neutral	i tried their other options on offer 0 ) change time via their computer system .
neutral	i took note of the numbers they sent me via_email but the system was also asking me for another number which i did not have - presumably the system has_been designed to change time after a failed delivery - but was was i to do if i wanted to change it ( slightly ) on the day ?
neutral	i also tried_phoning the automating system and found that very frustrating as it mentioned that if one wanted the item re - delivered on set days / time there was a charge but did not say what the charge was , it instead asked to select a certain button if i wanted to proceed with this option , but i could not select this option if i did not know what the charge would be .
neutral	i sent them an_email venting my frustration and telling them of my needs but they did not return my call .
neutral	dear myprotein you offer excellent service and your products are reasonably_priced but please change your delivery service as this puts me off buying from you now .
neutral	many_thanks .
neutral	i have purchased a few items from superdry alongside the hat .
neutral	after a the first or second wear the knitted hat began to stretch and eventually lost its shape .
neutral	have found this with other items including the messengers bags which the leather began to chip almost straight_away .
neutral	nice looking items , but poor quality
neutral	lego technic rescue helicopter arrived_promptly .
neutral	however , i was not very impressed with the packaging .
neutral	it arrived in a large box which was extensively damaged and open at one end - luckily the box inside had not fallen out !
neutral	i ordered 0 airplanes from canada to be sent to my son in a different province .
neutral	the order was placed on jan . 00 , 0000 and it arrived on jan . 00 , 0000 - over 0_weeks for delivery is unacceptable .
neutral	more_importantly , the planes arrived at my home and now i have to pay shipping to send them to him .
neutral	very disappointing !
neutral	received several items with labels cut out or marked out
neutral	i felt this took a very long time to arrive .
neutral	the idea was nice though .
neutral	it was easy to submit and ship the items , but since i asked for the amount to be sent to a charity , i have not received any proof of the amount nor of the donation in my name !
neutral	the sizing was off but the overall pricing was nice .
neutral	i would love to give you a review , but even_though the ups website says my package has_been delivered , it is not here !
neutral	they have obviously delivered it to the wrong_address , and my appointment with the mechanic is tomorrow .
neutral	not good .
neutral	will have to get up and start looking around at neighbors houses !
neutral	no cabia la maleta en_el maletero , era mínimo sin maletero .
neutral	en la foto viene un coche con maletero y dice que cabe una maleta y no es verdad .
neutral	nos dijeron que antes sí que daban coches con maletero pero que ha cambiado el modelo del economy y ahora es así .
neutral	good variety of clothing but slow customer_service .
neutral	took very long to arrive , but at_least all my items were there this time
neutral	this site will only post review if they are positive , any complaints at all and they will not post it .
neutral	items usually arrive in a timely_manner and mostly i have been happy with them , but not being honest about the reviews have deterred me from using them again .
neutral	i get a certain cat_litter at our local farm store and was getting 00 #_bag for a fairly good price , then they went to a 00 #_bag and charged me the same price .
neutral	so i went online to of course find a better deal .
neutral	found pet care and they were offering the 00 #_bag of cat_litter for the price i was giving at the store , so i order and got the auto_ship then i get a call and they say that they are now switching to the 00 #_bag and you guessed it , it '_s the same price as the 00 #_bag .
neutral	why would i want to spend the same for less ?
neutral	so i cancelled the auto_ship and will no_longer be getting my litter from pet care .
neutral	i guess i '_ll give our local farm store my money at_least i don_'_t have to pay them sh + h just tax which is cheaper .
neutral	:_d
neutral	let_me start by saying that i love priceline .
neutral	i have been an_avid user for years !
neutral	however , i do have one beef that i '_m not sure they would be able to deal with but should really consider something :
neutral	parking fees when bidding !!
neutral	!
neutral	there has got to be a way of identifying a parking fee range when bidding on hotels .
neutral	i think it is absolutely_ridiculous to get a good rate ( at_least you think it '_s great ) and then get slapped with a $_00 - 00 parking fee or be forced to use valet_parking because there are no other options available .
neutral	example_: got a deal for $_00 and taxes / fees pushed it to $_00 .
neutral	valet_parking pushed my total rate up by $_00 to $_000 .
neutral	really though ?
neutral	so much for a good bidding deal .
neutral	i would have chosen the other deal for $_00 that included parking even_though the hotel was probably a little further away from where we needed to be .
neutral	priceline , you really need to consider at_least putting in a parking fee range , like $_00 - 00 or $_00 - 00 .
neutral	most of the hotels in certain areas charge within the same range so it would still be a little difficult to figure_out which hotel you ' re going to get .
neutral	other than that , i will still use priceline !
neutral	erica
neutral	prices were good but was offset by the shipping_costs .
neutral	i also needed something right_away and it took too long for it to ship .
neutral	would be good to have the further information_regarding the delivery ( eg .
neutral	package number , scheduled delivery date ).
neutral	kr
neutral	despite_being given two delivery addresses a card was left through the recipients door to say they would call again around 0pm .
neutral	when they still hadnt arrived at gone 0pm the recipient called the florist who asked if they could deliver them the folowing , they were told no because they were a birthday_present & also she was going to be out the following_day .
neutral	the flowers were eventually delivered at 0 . 00pm .
neutral	i really like the visa_gift_card idea , so that my friends could buy themselves anything they ' d enjoy .
neutral	the picture and message option really personalized it for them .
neutral	however the web_site said i would receive an_email once their card shipped .
neutral	when i didn_'_t hear_anything in 0 days , and the web_site still said " now processing ," i called and was told it had shipped 0 days earlier .
neutral	my friends later said they had received it , but the web_site still at this time says "... now processing .
neutral	we will email you when it ships ."
neutral	the web_site should really send us more detailed info as_promised , especially with such large value cards .
neutral	when i pointed this out to the service person on the phone , she sounded truly bored by my concern .
neutral	with name your own price , i got a 0_star_hotel for $_00 instead of $_000_per_night .
neutral	fabulous until i decided to extend the stay .
neutral	couldn_'_t get the same hotel again but also couldn_'_t change the region on their website .
neutral	called for assistance and couldn_'_t get a person on the phone -- totally infuriating !
neutral	nice part no screws
neutral	at first everything was fine .
neutral	i placed the reservations online for our trip to hawaii and all the excursions that go with it .
neutral	then i went to confirms the excursions as requested and the tour company in hawaii didn_'_t have the reservation .
neutral	i called bookit . com and the lady_who helped_me was fabulous !
neutral	she found my reservation , called the tour company in hawaii and all was fixed for the first company .
neutral	at this point i would have given them 0 starts .
neutral	then i called the second tour company to confirm reservations and again , they didn_'_t have it .
neutral	so i called bookit . com once again .
neutral	this time , a woman talked to me and put me on hold for 0 / 0 hr and never came back to me .
neutral	so i hung_up and called again .
neutral	this time a gentleman answered and put me on hold for about 00_min and came back and said he was working on it and put me back on hold for 00min .
neutral	i hung_up and called back again ... very agitated by this time ... again was put on hold for 0 / 0 hr they came back on and i asked for a supervisor to no_avail .
neutral	the lady told me i was being rude and that our reservations for activities weren_'_t covered by bill me later !
neutral	how did the other tour get taken_care of !
neutral	at this point my husband took over !
neutral	he called and talked to another gentleman_who was extremely_helpful , told us it would be taken_care of within_00hrs and it was !
neutral	we were able to contact the tour company in hawaii and confirm all reservations .
neutral	so if it weren_'_t for the three inept customer_service reps , i would have given them 0_stars .
neutral	unfortunately , we didn_'_t get names of the two amazing reps !
neutral	ordered a jacket online to be delivered next_day delivery .
neutral	was advised it had been despatched in an_email and through using their online_chat system and after wating in on the designated day with no sign of delivery , i rang and spoke to a customer rep .
neutral	he told me that due to an_issue with the courier my jacket had not been despatched after all .
neutral	he was at pains to stress that the company was unusual in offering next_day delivery without an_additional_charge but as i said to him it '_s of no use to me if the jacket still sits in their warehouse and why send emails saying it had been despatched when it hadnt !
neutral	misleading !
neutral	the jacket was them promised for 0 days time - thursday .
neutral	again , i had a phone_call from the customer_services rep and an_email_saying the jacket would be delivered on thursday before 00 am .
neutral	imagine my surprise on wednesday ( a day earlier ) when i was just about to go out and could have missed them completely , the courier turned_up with the jacket .
neutral	would i order from this company again is the crucial thing here - i think only if i had exhausted all other possible options for the supply of an item and was desperate .
neutral	the bonadventure hotel was attractive but the service at the desk was poor and unfriendly .
neutral	the service at the restaurant was marginal and the menu limited .
neutral	i would not stay there again
neutral	i received my wayfarer sunglasses and they are much lighter than my other pair , and the box they came in wasn_'_t sealed and the microfibre cloth wasn_'_t in a plastic package like my previous pair .
neutral	the lenses are polarized , but it just seemed a little sketchy .
neutral	i did appreciate the fact that it was sent as a " gift " so i was not charged duty on it though !
neutral	call me if you want full details .
neutral	000 * 000 * 0000

neutral	overall , i cannot_complain as the rate was fair and the car was ok .
neutral	i did decide to pay the extra insurance just in case anything unexpected happend .
neutral	when i returned the car , the antenna was missing , i suspect that someone unscrewed it in a parking_lot somewhere , although i had not noticed it when i picked_up the car .
neutral	i think that when something like that happens , especially as minor as it was and the extra insurance was paid a person should not be questioned about it .
neutral	just give me the receipt and let_me be off .
neutral	it '_s ok if you want to stay one or two_nights .
neutral	not sure if it '_s okay since i bought the book from your website , but i '_m concerned that the book says on the front cover and on the back : " not for sale in the united_states " international student_edition .
neutral	switched from dish network to directv a year_ago so my husband could get his beloved broncos games ( we lived in mo ).
neutral	my bill went | up nearly $_00 for the same package ( no i '_m not including the super fan package we paid_extra for ).
neutral	it was very expensive to start - even_though you ' re not " buying " the equipment , we still had to pay nearly $_000 to lease the boxes for our 0 tv '_s .
neutral	installation was horrible , the guy was a real moron , drilled holes all over the place and cut the cable so we can '_t ever use the outlets in our walls again ( we also had cable internet and they had to re - run all the cables because of the directv installation ).
neutral	supposedly the picture is better with directv , but i never noticed .
neutral	i hate that i have to have 0 seperate dvr '_s ( dish let you have one that ran 0 tv '_s - also saved on the monthly bill ).
neutral	we have since relocated and put the bill on hold for 0 months ( very nice feature ).
neutral	this time the installer was great .
neutral	very professional , did a great job , and our tv '_s work off of the cable outlets already in our walls ... no new holes !
neutral	i still feel_like the bill is pricy compared to dish network , and will_definitely be shopping around once our contract is up .
neutral	i would say compare the two , they each have specific things they offer ( ie broncos games for us ) and watch the installers like a hawk !
neutral	easy to book on this website .
neutral	very nice product but very disappointing engraving , it is barely visable .
neutral	the employee taking my reservation was very pleasant , but i had difficulty understanding him .
neutral	whatever his language / dialect , he often had to repeat so that i could understand .
neutral	i , too , had to repeat my letters as he was taking information .
neutral	the product is fine and does the job , but the web_site went crazy and made two orders for me .
neutral	i thought i had canceled one of them , but today , my second " order " arrived .
neutral	i think i will make a phone order the next time !
neutral	i think bestpet do some lovely products but when you pay for first_class post it takes 0 days !
neutral	to be fair bestpet did refund the difference - 00p - but it didn_'_t make up for it .
neutral	even_though the clothes are not maternity wear they work well for that purpose the on problem i had was that the postage took to long i ordered on the 00 th and didn_'_t recieve until the 0 rd way more then the 0 day quoted
neutral	i used petflow abot 0_weeks_ago and thought they were great .
neutral	then i received reminders that the products i had ordered before were getting ready to ship again .
neutral	i needed to change one of the items and didn_'_t want 0 separate_orders when i could put them all into one order .
neutral	that '_s when i began to run_into trouble .
neutral	it '_s difficult to substitute and impossible to combine 0 orders into one as i found out .
neutral	i thought i ' d succeeded because i ' d received a message that my order was ready to ship .
neutral	i waited and waited and it never came .
neutral	i finally called and was told there was no such order .
neutral	thankfully the individual i spoke with was on it immediately and shipped my new order right_away .
neutral	the spoiled_rotten_box was a rip_off .
neutral	for $_00 it said with enough merchandise for the retail price of $_00 .
neutral	i got a chew toy and some eye_drops and 0 dog training treats .
neutral	not $_00 worth .
neutral	we asked if we could have two rooms that were connected with a pass through door because we were traveling with our teenage_girls .
neutral	they said it was no problem and it was available , but when we checked in it was not the rooms we got , there was a room in between us .
neutral	besides that the hotel was great and the kids had a great time .
neutral	the rooms are very clean and comfortable we would definitely stay there again .
neutral	i was excited to purchase coconut_oil form this site , not so excited when i received the box soiled in coconut_oil that had somehow leaked from the container !
neutral	packaging is important !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i am not really happy as not received my goods yet over a week_ago had to call twice . and still not here ...
neutral	i bought the " video_game princess wig " and it was terrible .
neutral	zero_stars .
neutral	a lot of hair came off of it as soon as i took it out of the package , and there weren_'_t much hair on it in the first pace .
neutral	if you go look at the picture they provide , the hair that is on the model '_s left shoulder is all the hair that this wig includes .
neutral	it was a terrible mullet looking thing .
neutral	just don_'_t buy it .
neutral	the " sexy pink princess costume " was awesome .
neutral	five_stars .
neutral	surprised by the quality actually .
neutral	didn_'_t look super wrinkly out of the package like a lot of the costumes usually do .
neutral	the costumes came about 0 days ahead of estimated time which was great because it gave_me time to replace the terrible wig .
neutral	i took two golden bus_tours in two_days .
neutral	the first was to warwick castle , which was amazing but we were only given two hours .
neutral	afterwards we went to stratford - upon - avon , which was only another hour , and oxford , which had the same time limit .
neutral	two places would have been better with a two to three hour stop at each , since all are places you can easily spend a day in .
neutral	the next_morning we went to warner brothers studio , and as an_avid harry_potter fan i felt that the three hours i had by the time i got in went far too fast .
neutral	golden_tours is great at getting you outside london to see different things , but only barely , as there is seriously no time to fully appreciate the places you ' re going .
neutral	i have made several orders to inkfarm .
neutral	i have always had very good service and the ink_cartridges have worked fine .
neutral	i did have a c000b cartridge for a canon_printer that ink actually ran_out onto my hands and clothes when i took the cover / tape off of the cartridge .
neutral	it was evidently overfull , as i was holding it upright and it still overflowed and ran_out on me .
neutral	overall , though , i would recommend inkfarm .
neutral	price and service is good .
neutral	happy with service and delivery , as it said it would be .
neutral	slightly disappointed in the chair , found the positioning of the adjustable seat , chest plate and arm rest not great - even at its highest position the arm rest barely supported my hands and the angle of the chair is quite up right .
neutral	also the space between the seat and the leg supports is not very big , so fi someone was heavy it would be uncomfortable .
neutral	that said , the material is good quality , plenty of padding , good carry case and sturdy frame .
neutral	i would have liked a break_down of what each item i sent was valued at and also had items that they couldn_'_t use returned as i had requested .
neutral	the online ordering was so difficult i had to start again at_least 0 times , i gave up on the first try and had to start again on another day .
neutral	the message entry does not show until after you pay , so i really was not sure my gift would have any message at all .
neutral	on the upside , when i finally got thru the wonky ordering process the cards were delivered on time and everyone was happy .
neutral	very regular customer of tennis_nuts and until my last experience had no_problems .
neutral	i placed an order for tennis_shoes among other items however the shoes were needed for a tournament over the weekend so i paid_extra for next_day delivery .
neutral	the shoes did not arrive even_though they were confirmed on the dispatch note !
neutral	a mistake at shipping left the shoes out of the order .
neutral	i had to go out and buy an extra pair of trainers in order for my son to pay .
neutral	i was refunded for the shoes but not next_day delivery which left me feeling disappointed in the service as i have been a regular customer
neutral	i use ebay all the time ( who doesn_'_t ) but until recently i never needed any customer_service and it was dreadful .
neutral	all over it is a good site but really need to look at their customer_service .
neutral	my son has size 0 . 0 feet .
neutral	i ordered addidas trainers in a 0 . 0 but they turned_out to be too small .
neutral	i returned then and ordered 00 , they were also too small !
neutral	so were 00 . 0 , i am now waiting for the 00 to arrive !
neutral	service has even excellent , but am frustrated by the very dubious sizing !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i have not received my package as of march 0 , 0000
neutral	we signed_up on line and i thought i was signing_up for $ 0 . 00 a day plus $ 0 . 00 which would have come to a total of $_00 . 00 .
neutral	they actually charged me $_00 . 00 .
neutral	this included $ 0 fuel surcharge $ 0 pa access fee , and 00_% parking tax added on top of a $ 0 . 00 / day basic fee .
neutral	they said they charged me $ 0 . 00 / day because i supposedly signed_up for valet parring .
neutral	i didn_'_t actually use valet , and i don_'_t think k i really signed_up for it ..
neutral	i used self_park but they refused to give me that rate .
neutral	so i felt_like they took_advantage of me .. to be fair the drop_off and pick_up were .
neutral	fine .
neutral	but i still don_'_t know why they advertised $ 0 . 00 / day then charged me $ 0 . 00 / day .
neutral	not opened the goods yet but delivery was on time & efficient .
neutral	only_complaint was that i was left with 0 giant wooden pallets to dispose of at my expense as the driver said he was not allowed to take them back .
neutral	i even unloaded my goods from the pallet myself - didn_'_t really need a pallet for what i ordered anyway .
neutral	need the pallets uplifted please !
neutral	!
neutral	ordered a medium but it came and was more like an 0 - 00 not 00 - 00
neutral	online you can only send it back and get a refund so if i wanted next size up will have to do another order and payment which is annoying waitin for refund to then do it all again
neutral	i ordered 00x00x0 and got 00x00 .
neutral	customer_service sent fedex to pick them up and then i received the correct size but it took another phone_call and 0 more weeks .
neutral	the price is fantastic compared to ordering through lowes .
neutral	as always longacres flower_arrangement was beautiful and fresh and arrived as scheduled .
neutral	nearly a week_later the flowers are doing well with only a couple of the roses have tuned over now .
neutral	the problem was thart my mother had no_idea who had sent the flowers or why , as the card i had written had not been attached .
neutral	it was only on phoning longacres my mother was able to get the card message .
neutral	i needed a part fast and wanted buy part online in state or close enough to get 0 to 0 day shipping .
neutral	company is in nj .
neutral	nowhere on site did it say it ships parts from different warehouse .
neutral	did not say at checkout either .
neutral	only to find out after 0 day later i got tracking_info , it was shipped from ca , and had to wait another 0 days .
neutral	i had excellent service , except when it came to delivery .
neutral	it was not left at my address although i was at home .
neutral	one of my neighbours found it outside his daughters flat which is no .
neutral	0 .
neutral	as this person works away a lot it was just by very good luck that her father called that day other wise i would have been very concerned with the non delivery of the washing hoist .
neutral	yours_sincerely
neutral	iris mcmenamin .
neutral	holyport .
neutral	have used travelocity several_times over the years and always easy site although a bit_slow at times .
neutral	questions could be submitted and one would get an answer within 00_hours .
neutral	not so this time , all have managed to get is a drop down list of questions and pre_- printed answer with a one question survey .... was answer helpful ?
neutral	frustrating .
neutral	good customer_service
neutral	the first half of our reservation is wonderful and the web_site was super .
neutral	still_waiting to receive the referenwice # or confirmation on the return trip via pentland ferry .
neutral	hope it comes soon as we depart on the 0th of june to begin our holiday .
neutral	i purchased a part from your website , as it said there was one available .
neutral	needed it by the weekend , as my son would be home and his car needed the part .
neutral	was told , after the purchase went through , that they did not in fact have this part and would have to cancel my purchase .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	i understand how this happens , but do not understand how the site wouldn_'_t have been updated .
neutral	delivery was fine and efficient as usual .
neutral	the only problem for me was the driver made me feel quite uncomfortable .
neutral	as a woman on her own in the house ( husband at work , kids at school ) he seemed to be getting quite familiar .
neutral	" is that your kettle i '_ve just heard boil " " i see your fence is down , bet that annoyed your husband or partner ?
neutral	do you have one ?"
neutral	i at no point allowed this man over the threshold of our property .
neutral	once he had finished his tea , he left , thankfully without further comments .
neutral	it was then i realised that he was still sat in his lorry outside and i received a text_message " thanks sweetheart , you really hit the spot !!"
neutral	a tad inappropriate if you ask me .
neutral	hasten to add i did not reply to his text and he soon departed .
neutral	i showed my husband the text when he got home and it was all i could do to stop him reporting this man for harassment .
neutral	if you read this please do not send this man out again !
neutral	!
neutral	it was a beautiul bouquet , delivered on time .
neutral	i just expected a bigger one for the price of 00_euros .
neutral	i was excited when i placed my order and was already wanting it the next_day , knowing that it was personalized i knew it would take a few_weeks to get .
neutral	i waited almost a month and then got really impatient ... i emailed customer_service and they responded but due to shipping with no insurance their was know way to track item .
neutral	i finally recieved the necklace and despite wanting to like it , i love it !
neutral	it is beautiful .
neutral	totally_worth the weight .
neutral	i will be placing a large order in january for hostess gifts for a wedding and a few other events i have to attend .
neutral	now that i know the time_frame i will spread the word of the company .
neutral	i was happy with the product , however i feel communication needs improving .
neutral	my order generated 00 emails - completely unnecessary !
neutral	also , i was asked to contact customer_services as there was ' an_issue ' with my order , when i phoned there was no issue and it was put straight through ( with no real checks of my details ).
neutral	i had asked for the delivery to be left by the recycling bins inside of my property and your deli very left it inside a plastic wheelie bin - in the heat the bin acts like an oven and is extremely hot inside , the frozen food was already soft in places and had defrosted therefore it is not safe to eat .
neutral	it was also a heavy parcel and i was unable to lift it out of the bin by myself .
neutral	had ordered one dress and 0 costumes , i got the shipping confirmation fairly quickly for the dress i ordered , however , none of the costumes were shipped with it .
neutral	i assumed they would be shipped in a seperate package .
neutral	then i recieved an_email in my junk_mail_stating there was a refund to my credit_card , but no reason_why or what it was from .
neutral	on reviewing the amount charged for the costumes , i realized that the refund was for the exact amount of all the costumes .
neutral	there was no communication about why the custumes were not shipped and at the time of my order , they all showed in stock .
neutral	i am happy with the dress i ordered and im sure i would feel the same about the costumes , had i recieved them , but i am not happy about the lack of communication from the company .
neutral	easy to book with on - line great offer ......
neutral	pick_up loaction clean and friendly however car not ready .
neutral	we were offered to pay for an upgrade due to no avilability which i thought was strange as normally if you are upgraded due to the car you have reserved not being avilable it is free .
neutral	eventually a different car was offered for an upgarde which was free of charge .
neutral	only problem we then had was the excessive charge to block on our card € 000 , they agreed to only € 000 after some discussion for being unreasonabley high .
neutral	which to me show that there is no need to have such a high excess when you have paid for insurance .
neutral	my recomendation woudl be to always challenge the amount companies want to block on credit_cards .
neutral	staff at car colloectoin and drop very friendly and helpful which gave a good experience even with a few hitches .
neutral	they changed my snow_tires and they said i needed balancing and alignment so the free snow tire change ( for buying them there ) still cost $_000 .
neutral	guess nothing is really free .
neutral	took about 0 0 / 0 hours longer then i expected even with an_appointment .
neutral	they were very pleasant .
neutral	great cusyomer serivece and clean facilities .
neutral	but if i was not in a rush and waited_until the last_minute i would have went somewhere_else .
neutral	the fact that there is no elevator and u are a mile away from the stairs and bump into the other units almost all the way trying to get to yours .
neutral	oh_yea one dolly .
neutral	placed an order for a beautiful hello_kitty bag & a couple of bracelets .
neutral	they put the billing_address on the package forcing me to drive to the ups facility to pick_up my package .
neutral	when i got it , i opened it up immediately , the bracelets were missing .
neutral	the packing_slip stated 0 bracelets shipped called amiclubwear immediately .
neutral	waited 00minutes & 00 seconds & gave up .
neutral	sent an_email later that night .
neutral	got a response the next_day saying that the bracelets were shipped , but they would give me a store credit .
neutral	i sent a follow_up email_stating they either were out of stock or they '_ve got a thief working for them .
neutral	they responded with a notice that i wouldn_'_t be able to receive the bracelets , but that my credit_card would be credited .
neutral	i informed them that i really would rather have the bracelets , then the credit .
neutral	really_enjoyed looking around at stuff and finally found the perfect love - seat / couch combo with two end tables and a coffee_table but the sales_person was caught up too much in making a bigger sale that he slipped up on delivery .
neutral	he promised one day delivery which we were happy about and were expecting it around 0pm saturday , so we waited_until 0pm and then called the store and they told us it was on the truck and out for delivery and would be calling us soon so we waiting some more ... 0 :_00pm came and no call , checked in again with the store and said the same thing as before .
neutral	waited_until 00pm and nothing .
neutral	called them as soon as they opened on sunday at 00am and found out that the sales_person never told the delivery drivers about it and so it was never even on the truck .
neutral	it was frustrating wasting a whole saturday waiting for your furniture you were promised but never arriving .
neutral	finally after the manager sorted_out the issue on sunday we received our stuff around 0pm .
neutral	i would recommend american_freight because i am happy with the furniture and the delivery drivers were extremely nice and helpful , but if you are promised one day delivery make_sure you ask for a manager to confirm that it will be on its way .
neutral	more often then not it seems identity_guard has a lot of trouble with its website , hope it '_s fixed soon as i pay for this service every_month !
neutral	wpuld love to correct information .... that is in coirrecct ....
neutral	there is no need to speak to a person ....
neutral	i should e able to do this myself ... not depend_on another person , to fix my information .
neutral	besides have been trying to update my payment_method and you will not accept the change ....... sooooooooooooooo ... guess the service is free
neutral	ithe items were in excellent condition and expertly packed , it was a pity that the company could not contact me to inform me they were waiting for an order to reach their premises and were not therefore able to have my completed order ready to send out .
neutral	this information would be helpful and keep customers informed of order progress .
neutral	i had to ring the company to ask why i had not received my goods .
neutral	i started the shake over 0_weeks_ago and i will say that it curbed my hunger a little_bit --- i have not gained weight but i have not lost any either -- i see nothing different then by just following a sensible diet - i feel the money could have went towards food instead of the shakes --- it di not help me lose but like i said i have not gained more .
neutral	i purchased this card for my daughter who '_s away at school , after having a bad_experience with another gift_card outlet and she wasn_'_t able to use it online with a lot of retailers .
neutral	so she was very disappointed .
neutral	getting the card was no problem the problem was i paid for 0 day shipping and it still took a week to get there very disapointed
neutral	i think the selection is great , but i wish i could return items if they did not work out .
neutral	the no return_policy or restocking_fee prevents me from taking a chance on clothing i think i might like .
neutral	the prom_dress i ordered for my daughter was lovely , but the sizing_chart suggested a size 00 when in fact a size 0 was correct .
neutral	i had ordered a side_mirror , and the listed stated poodle lights and heat .
neutral	neither apply to the product i received .
neutral	good price but dissapointed that i did not get the product i believed i was purchasing .
neutral	very irritating to find out a week_later that the seats i selected weren_'_t saved .
neutral	now my husband and i have to sit separately with strangers on our romantic getaway .
neutral	kinda made the deal not worth it , would have gone to a site that works better .
neutral	still have not received my controller i ordered on 00 / 00
neutral	i am so happy with my shipments -- and how easy it is to get product .
neutral	the only big problem is that in order to return product ( my sheltie '_s food changed , so the big bag must go back ) there are so many hoops that i still_haven_'_t attempted to send it back .
neutral	i wish that it was as easy as other_websites make it everyday ....
neutral	prices and selection are fantastic .
neutral	free_shipping is great , but i hate having to jump_through the hoops of the scheduled programs to get it .
neutral	perhaps a lot of people like and need the convenience of auto shipping , but it doesn_'_t put me out at all to log in and order items when i need them .
neutral	excellent parts selection with good prices , but i was disappointed that i did not receive v - belts that could have been purchased at the local parts store the same day for an entire week .
neutral	the failure to receive the belts at the same time as the water_pump , thermostat , and gaskets prevented returning my vehicle to service for several days .
neutral	not receiving my v - belts in a timely_fashion also caused me to purchase my alternator locally at a higher price and with less selection .
neutral	recently ordered the pool_cover wrap and pillow for winter covering .
neutral	at the time i could not find the pillow pal on your website so ordered just the two items .
neutral	items arrived in a timely_manner and was happy with that .
neutral	later called your company number and asked about the pillow pal to hold the pillow to the cover .
neutral	the lady could not find it on the site but knew the name of the item so she got it ordered for me .
neutral	good experience with the lady .
neutral	however , paying an $ 0 . 00 handling_charge on a $ 0 . 00 item seems to be just a bit much . to me .
neutral	selection / catalog is great , easy to order at website , but the size / quality of the items was not consistent .
neutral	also , they are pricey and do not offer any coupons or even free_shipping if you spend a signfiicant amount ( which i did ).
neutral	order early in the season since they do sell out of items .
neutral	not sure if i will order from them again .
neutral	petflow has many wonder toys various_types of food and treats both fordods and cats .
neutral	not liking the fact that you have to have produts shipped evrey couple of weeks .
neutral	good tech but way too expensive
neutral	some good deals but easy to be conned
neutral	love the photos but could only purchase one because the price was way too high !
neutral	can '_t you come down a little - you ' d probably get more folks to buy and want to buy more than one which might make them spend more anyway !
neutral	just a thought .
neutral	thanks for doing a great job !
neutral	great cd '_s but watch your invoices campared to money withdrawn to detect differences .
neutral	was charged shipping with suppose to be free .
neutral	had to call customer_service to straighten it out .
neutral	shouldn_'_t of had to do that .
neutral	this time the person_who did the work seemed to miss a lot of the conversation - it says inauditiable however you can hear it perfectly fine .
neutral	very disappointed this time has_been very good in the past -
neutral	can this be reviewed and corrected without another charge please .
neutral	thanks
neutral	linda was a peach when asked for help with our last order ...... and then all hell broke loose .
neutral	kept getting these crazy error_messages , called her back and she was at a loss as well , but just like any old trusty computer ... took out money $$$$.
neutral	now we have two memberships , but we did receive our order in great style by the usps .
neutral	thanx linda !
neutral	usually -- your service is great !
neutral	keep_up the good work
neutral	i had ordered four pearls necklaces and they were lovely ..
neutral	interests that the ones less_than 000 looks like the ones i paid 000 for .. a good deal .
neutral	if i see something on my credit_report i call identity_guard and they give me something different than one of the credit agency '_s says but they wont change it .
neutral	product ordered 00nd february ..
neutral	delivered 00th_april and charged extra for saturday delivery .
neutral	product quality vey good .
neutral	my son - in -_law was very pleased to receive the castelli biking jacket that i was able to track down for him from always riding .
neutral	however , it took 00 days for it to arrive , well past the holidays and its usefulness for biking in the cold northeast usa .
neutral	please do not advertise that shipping takes 0 - 0 days when in fact it took much longer .
neutral	also , the jacket that i ordered was featured with a free jersey on the castelli website but did not come with that from always riding , which was a disappointment .
neutral	i hope that my comments will be forwarded to always riding .
neutral	i have no problem with the quality of the goods supplied , my only issue was with the delivery by parcelforce who i have to say have gone down hugely in my estimation .
neutral	however i would like to say many_thanks to tara wilson who provided enormous help in getting my problem with parcelforce resolved .
neutral	this assistance was greatly_appreciated .
neutral	i was very happy with the invitations i ordered , but am not at all happy with the stickers i ordered .
neutral	i have put in for a return and still_haven_'_t heard from anyone .
neutral	you can not read the print on the stickers and am waiting for a full_refund .
neutral	i have however ordered some more with the writing on white hoping it will show up so we will see !
neutral	i just opened the package .
neutral	everything seemed fine but then the removable jar and base came apart .
neutral	i put it back together , but i '_m not sure if it was correct because there were no directions for assembly .
neutral	i won_'_t know until i have cleaned and sanitized the blender .
neutral	on the other hand , i received the product in a very timely_manner .
neutral	tracking was very easy and efficient .
neutral	i do very much like the shower fixtures we bought thru hudson_reed , but i had a couple problems with install and one particular item .
neutral	i don_'_t have international_calling on my cell_phone , so i was not able to call and speak with anyone .
neutral	the online live_chat has_been or at_least was unavailable during the couple weeks i was trying to resolve my issues .
neutral	i did use an_email contact and i did get a response , but it turned_out that the fix suggested was not ideal .
neutral	the wall plate for the shower controls does not screw to flatten flush against the wall .
neutral	the email suggestion i got was to putty the plate .
neutral	putty proved not good enough so we had to use a stronger adhesive and we had to also caulk around the plate .
neutral	not ideal but in the end it looks ok , tho could still be more flush to wall .
neutral	i also had just went past my 00 days from purchase , so i found the no return_policy after 00 days a bit too short of time .
neutral	i simply also needed a different size shower arm and wanted a simple exchange .
neutral	to keep all the fixtures the same , i was forced to buy a new arm .
neutral	so ultimately , tho the fixtures are beautiful and seem to be of high_quality , my ultimate experience in dealing_with this company will not be worth my returning .
neutral	which is really too bad .
neutral	i am a home stager and designer and i could have done a lot of business with this company had i just had a little better support and if they had a more realistic return and or exchange_policy .
neutral	as when you are remodeling an entire bathroom , often time runs over before all is installed , which was our case .
neutral	so 00 days was not enough to know we needed to change one part out .
neutral	if the books aren_'_t in perfect_condition , they won_'_t take them .
neutral	however , they have good customer_support .
neutral	jeg_har i et_par dage gjort brug af parkzonens parkering i mitchellsgade og også den såkaldte park & ride ordning , som_jeg syntes er rigtig godt tænkt .
neutral	men jeg syntes det_er problematisk at de 0 første kontrollører man render ind i i metroen dels ikke kender ordningen og tilmed stiller sig skeptisk til_den tilsendte sms billet .
neutral	det duer ikke , det_er ret ubehageligt at skulle stå og parlementere og prøve at overbevise om at billetten er god nok .
neutral	tænkte på om i hos parkzonen ( når i nu forhåbentlig på et tidspunkt læser dette ) ikke kunne gøre et eller andet .... evt .
neutral	tage fat i trafikselskaberne .
neutral	jeg_kan godt mærke at jeg hurtigt mister lysten til at benytte ordningen hvis_jeg bliver udsat for det samme en gang til , og_det_er ærgerligt for en ellers god ordning .
neutral	ellers er jeg ret tilfreds .... lidt ny belægning på michellsgades p plads er yderst tiltrængt , det_er jeg_ikke den eneste der syntes kan jeg se , og_der_er_ikke længere byggeplads og store lastbiler , så på med vanten ;-)
neutral	had no_issues with shipping or actual transaction .
neutral	the sizes ran very small and i got the hot_pink with rhinestones and it '_s very had to actually read the writing .
neutral	the booking was easy , the room has a lot of good points such as two flat screen tvs , a kitchen with a good sized refrigerator .
neutral	the bathroom is kind of small .
neutral	we overslept and left our room around lunch time .
neutral	when we returned , the room was as we left it with a pile of wet towels on the bathroom floor and unmade beds .
neutral	no one ever came in to clean the room .
neutral	i have nothing but praise off your company and service .
neutral	however , i thought i was ordering a weight_loss product for my dog and that is not what i received !
neutral	it is the product i ordered though .
neutral	don_'_t know where the confusion came from .
neutral	i cancel after 0 days , i needed 0 night instead of 0 and could not be accomindated i was told my reservation had to be cancelled .
neutral	i cancelled and had to call back after almost 0 hr because i did not receive a cancel confirmation when i returned call i was transferred to a tech specialist who sent a bet generic email for cancellation i hope it is cancel !
neutral	!
neutral	we went to the counter for eurocar at the station in strasbourg and no one was there .
neutral	we then had to go across the square to the other office .
neutral	we were also surprised that your offices are not open from 00 to 00h every day .
neutral	received my order on time but was disappointed when i noticed one of my item was opened i called at left message with customer_service but have not received a response yet and it '_s been 0 days past so i '_ll try again .
neutral	in the past it '_s been a good experience .
neutral	crystal
neutral	initially thought it was great idea .
neutral	i only received 0 companies who emailed me .
neutral	i asked you to redo and never received any more quotes .
neutral	the two quotes - one was super and i will choose them .
neutral	( prisma )
neutral	the other were wanting my phone details .
neutral	i said i just had a hiking accident and wanted to do everything by email .
neutral	they never responded again !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	the 0 lights i got work fine , but i was charged for the 0 i ordered with no_explanation .
neutral	are they on backorder or what ?
neutral	that would be nice to know .
neutral	booking on viator is like playing russian roulette .
neutral	you never know if you '_ll win fabulously or get that horrific bullet .
neutral	most of my experiences have either been incredibly fantastic or desperately awful .
neutral	as you do not know who the provider of the tours are , there is no way to check reviews elsewhere to see if these tours are good or not , as many groups offer similar tours with similar itineraries .
neutral	the ones that are really good are amazing !
neutral	great tours guides , great itineraries , etc .
neutral	however , the really awful ones seem to falsely advertise the tour on viator .
neutral	those are the tours where what they promise on viator is not what actually happens on the tours .
neutral	i wish viator would screen tour companies more carefully before offering them to others .
neutral	or have some recourse for unhappy_customers to get compensated .
neutral	viator should also always show review from the latest reviews to the oldest , instead of the " best " to the " worst " as i find is the default setting .
neutral	by showing reviews that way , it is misleading to customers , making all the tours seem fantastic , when often some tours go downhill with time .
neutral	i found easy to book web_site easy to use however i was disappointed that they didnt take all major bank cards .
neutral	i had to get a friend to book on my behalf which did waste time and i could have lost out on the hotel that i was interested in .
neutral	i would use the site again .
neutral	i ordered 0 items three camping chairs and a sleeping_bag .
neutral	all were said to be in stock the chairs all arrived very quickly .
neutral	the sleeping_bag was to follow .
neutral	it didn_'_t , until i contacted company to ask where it was .
neutral	to be fair they responded very quickly with an_email and within two_days of my inquiry the sleeping_bag arrived .
neutral	so overall i would use the company again but perhaps the site needs to be undated a bit more frequently to ensure that out of stock items are correctly listed .
neutral	also think that they should have a better system for checking back orders and not wait for customers to email them .
neutral	this is a great place to buy parts but the shipping took to long and it wasn_'_t properly package .. wrapping the ends and putting a thin box around the round part isn_'_t package it should be in a boxed with bubble_wrap or peanuts ...
neutral	october_0000 - it took several_attempts to upload my files ( 0 different double sided business cards , 0 letterhead design and 0 comp slip design ) and the website didn_'_t acknowledge my ' job titles '.
neutral	it '_s great that i can collect from nearest branch so don_'_t have to wait in for delivery .
neutral	good prices for good print once you get past the website .
neutral	january_0000 - extra note .
neutral	just tried to upload a new print job - website lost connection again and can '_t finish sale , again !
neutral	the frames were the wrong color , and the tinting wasn_'_t dark enough on the sunglasses i bought , but i had no_problems getting a return_authorization for the glasses .
neutral	first time ordering from this website i was scared and seen all the reviews but i did so anyways .
neutral	all my questions was answer when i had problems with my order .
neutral	i got my necklace today and im really unhappy with it .
neutral	i can tell it was made in a rush .
neutral	i know you guys promise to get it here before christmas and you did so but everything is wrong with it .
neutral	the clasp for the necklace was made unproperly .
neutral	i couldn_'_t get my necklace on properly .
neutral	the plate is not properly support .
neutral	it could break very easy .
neutral	i will never order from this site again .
neutral	i shouldnt had in the first place and making sure my sister cancel her order today .
neutral	sorry my english is not all that good .
neutral	i have three large dogs and a cat .
neutral	my pets food is crucial to me because i can only purchase it in certain pet_stores .
neutral	i ordered the canidae all life stages and originally they told me tuesday for delivery and i was okay with that .
neutral	all of a sudden , it is tuesday and no food , and i emailed them and they told me it would be there by thursday .
neutral	i had to rush out during the 0th of july to purchase a small bag of food .
neutral	i also noticed that most of the treats and food is slighty more_expensive then if i purchase it in petsupermarket .
neutral	would i order again from petflow , maybe depending if i have a coupon or voucher .
neutral	i expected more mg '_s in the capsules , so i '_m taking more than just one .
neutral	boilerjuice are great , saves time shopping around for best price but - everytime i order , i ask them to phone to say when the delivery is being made , so that i can unlock the tank - but they never have yet !
neutral	i was impressed with the price as it was the cheapest i had found on the internet , the ordering took me a bit of time over the internet but this was no fault to the site it was perhaps my computer but when i called the office , the lady was very helpful .
neutral	the postage however i felt was quite slow , it did take some time to arrive after_placing the order .
neutral	if i needed the product in a hurry then i maybe would buy from somewhere_else .
neutral	i was not dissatisfied with the service from the company because when i did chase the product up i was sent a reply almost_immediately .
neutral	i was ordering an itunes_gift_card as a " gift ".
neutral	i was never given the opportunity to include an_email address for the gift recipient .
neutral	i '_m waiting to hear from customer_service to find out what can be done so that my gift can be sent to the appropriate person .
neutral	heelys are fine and daughter_loves them but they were a gift so was disappointed when she opened them to find that the sticker saying " do not remove " had been removed already and the paper and bags used for packaging were ripped so these had obviously been a return from a previous customer .
neutral	also , one of the metal eyelets to thread the lace through was loose .
neutral	difficult to take them off an excited 0 year_old to return though .
neutral	my service representative that i talked to did a great job .
neutral	however we experienced some difficulties with bill me later working correctly and finding airline_tickets .
neutral	really please with quality of furniture .
neutral	we purchased the french rustic farmhouse large bookcase , small bookcase and wide screen tv_unit .
neutral	we also purchased the french shabby chic dining_table and chairs plus the large sideboard .
neutral	one of the chairs was damaged .
neutral	we called customer_services straight_away .
neutral	they were rude and unhelpful .
neutral	we took photos of the damage and emailed then through immediately .
neutral	that was nearly a week_ago and we have heard_nothing since leaving us with an incomplete dining_set .
neutral	wonderful service .
neutral	would have ordered again accept for the fact that the item did not come boxed .
neutral	as it was a present , it certainly spoilt the occasion .
neutral	i was really pleased my part shipped in two_days ..
neutral	however when i was reading the return instructions i became worried ..
neutral	seemed like i was almost being told that i would receive my refund after 00 days or maybe not at all .
neutral	purchased the insurance and tracking says it was delivered within the return time but i have yet to be contacted ..
neutral	not great .
neutral	i got sent two of the same product .
neutral	had to waste time sending them back .
neutral	i was so excited to find your company and decided to give it a fair " shot "... which fell short of nespresso , in a few different_ways .
neutral	i purchased the full 00 pod min .
neutral	the plastic capsules do not comfortably fit in my machine and it takes brute force to pull the lever down in place .
neutral	i say a small prayer each and every time i force the lever .
neutral	the coffee '_s depth and perfect balance lacks .
neutral	for the few extra cents it costs to achieve the perfect espresso , i ' d_rather stick with my original nespresso product .
neutral	i hail you for trying and i do think you are getting close , but , so_far ... no cigar .
neutral	i love the designs and the american apparel clothing , but the quality of the print left a lot to be desired .
neutral	when i first got it , the print looked homemade .
neutral	almost returned it , but i loved the designs too much .
neutral	after one wash , the print already peeled off somewhat .
neutral	i was extremely disappointed and frustrated as i waited well over the 00 minute maximum completion time for my vehicle .
neutral	i was very clear in letting ethan know that i needed my car finished in that 00 minute time_frame as i had to be home for my kids to get off the bus from school .
neutral	i found it completely_unacceptable and very disrespectful for my car to take 00_minutes over the time it was promised to be done .
neutral	if i had known that this company had so little consideration for my time and family commitments i would never have taken my car to them .
neutral	this was my first time going there and will be the last .
neutral	i thought this company was perfect , but my husband told me that if , when we actually go to the place , it is not as_promised , even if it is terrible , booking . com insists that you pay for the whole time that you were committed to .
neutral	even the place itself can '_t let you leave .
neutral	that '_s nerve_wracking .
neutral	supplement_warehouse used to be my go - to supplement company because of their price - match_guarantee and fast shipping .
neutral	repeatedly , however , the company shipped me the wrong products -- wrong flavor protein_bars , missing boxes of protein_bars , wrong flavor protein_powder .
neutral	to their credit , they were great about sending me the correct products , but it became such a hassle that i gave up on them and took my business elsewhere .
neutral	i '_m giving them another chance , so hopefully they '_ve fixed their accuracy issues .
neutral	otherwise , it is a great company .
neutral	tje part i ordered would not fit my car .
neutral	i did however , used the parts that i needed and now i have new parts that can '_t be used .
neutral	it was easier to make do than to try to return item .
neutral	it took a little_bit longer to ship than i expected , processing the item is what took the longest , but got it eventually .
neutral	i ordered a size medium and the length of the dress wasnt as long as i wouldve liked it to be , but ill still wear it out and about during summer .
neutral	its a little bigger_than a regular size medium , i couldve gotten away with a small .
neutral	overall ill buy more clothes from 00dollarmall .
neutral	the appliance seems fine and not too noisy , delivery man was miserable ,
neutral	i am not pleased that they reviewed all my bills , said all credit_cards would be in the plan , with a set monthly amount withdrawn from my checking_account to go into the escrow account , then had an underwriter say that one account could not be included , but they left the amount that i ay each_month the same .
neutral	therefore i now pay what they set the amount at , and the other credit_card company separately , which makes my budget for household bills almost_impossible .
neutral	this does not seem fair .
neutral	i went on the plan because i was having_difficulty paying my bills , and even_though my bills will be paid sooner , i will still be under severe financial strain for 0 years till my debt is cleared .
neutral	i just started the program so i cannot say how they are at settling debts .
neutral	great range of goods at competitive_prices and good communication but lordy the delivery is slow .
neutral	maybe this is only a problem in ni ?
neutral	i made two purchases within two_days of each other .
neutral	the first went_smoothly and i love the jeans and top :) shipping was quick and arrived in perfect_condition .
neutral	i was thrilled .
neutral	the second i still have not received almost a week_later .
neutral	i sent email with a returned confirmation_email from them saying they respond within 00_hrs .
neutral	it now has_been longer_than the time they specified , and still no word .
neutral	they did debit my card for the order and have not refunded or even stated as to why the order was not shipped .
neutral	it is a shame as i sincerely was going to make this my new go to place for shopping .
neutral	please use skepticism when shopping here .
neutral	i never give bad ratings , but on the second order i feel_like my money was just_plain and simply stolen .
neutral	so frustrating !
neutral	update to this :
neutral	i wrote this review and received items in the mail later that day :) i apologize for not giving this a little more time , although i was not given a tracking_number or anything except the original confirmation_email .
neutral	as with the first order , the items i received were perfect and fit great .
neutral	my trust is restored in this company .
neutral	i designed my wedding_ring online with natural_sapphire company " s help and chose a pink saphire cushion_cut as my center_stone .
neutral	gorgeous stone but i was not as impressed with the halo type setting - it was supposed to be a copy of a henri daussi setting i admired in the store .
neutral	copy yes but not as beautifully set as the brand_name .
neutral	it was a ' chunkier ' setting -- was trying to save a little_bit of money with the custom built ring but i was disappointed in the actual setting .
neutral	i will eventually take the stone out and do a much_simpler setting .
neutral	if i were at the new_york store i would have chose an already made setting so i would have know what i was getting .
neutral	if you must get a custom setting ask to see the wax mold before you have it cast ( which i did not ).
neutral	ok - that said - the stone is breathtaking and i looked at about 0 other stones on preview - which were fedexed to me from the store .
neutral	amazing quality stones - no other jewelry store could match the quality for the price .
neutral	after i received the stone i took it to my local jewelry store for a look and even the store was impressed with the quality of stone .
neutral	customer_service was first rate and answered every_single email i had - which were a lot - i was do nervous_about ordering online !
neutral	my only_gripe was that we ordered a few_weeks before valentines_day and it was not ready till after - about two_days_later .
neutral	i would buy a stone from the company again but would only buy setting after i saw it completed .
neutral	i bought previously and they were delicious and fully trim .
neutral	the crab cakes are fantastic .
neutral	it took a weel in a half to get my part .
neutral	i ordered two parts a neither one were on time .
neutral	the repairman showed_up on time and was friendly and knowledgeable .
neutral	after he left it took several days for the replacement part on the washing_machine to get ordered .
neutral	unbelievable .
neutral	i was then told that the part would arrive in 0 - 0 business days and they would call me when the part came in .
neutral	i called a week_later and found out that the part was there but no one had bothered to call to schedule an_appointment as_promised .
neutral	it took over 0_weeks for my machine to get fixed and that '_s a lot of laundry dragged to the laundromat .
neutral	i love the products on here but i only order if i can wait for the items ......
neutral	the delivery prosess is so slow !!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	transaction day + 0 days to arrive at bank_account ?
neutral	locked in to contract ' till 0000 but money will take four days to arrive at the bank , unless we banked with natwest .
neutral	why ?
neutral	i think after you '_ve purchased your order it gets confusing how to redeem them etc . also the wallet part makes no sense to me atall as i '_ve brought a lot from wow get already i think there should be a loyalty_scheme
neutral	booking the reservations was quick and easy but calling afterward for a question about the booking was painful .
neutral	i don_'_t know if that was the booking site or the hotels issue but the person i spoke to at the main reservation number was completely clueless .
neutral	they gave conflicting information while speaking to the same agent .
neutral	i then called my hotel_directly and the initial reservation person i spoke to could not find my reservation or answer my questions when we suddenly got disconnected , hmmmmm .
neutral	i called back and the person that answered found my reservation immediately and answered all my questions .
neutral	if only i had gotten her initially , i could have saved a lot of time .
neutral	the person on the phone was nice , but it took a really long time to accomplish
neutral	what needed to be done .
neutral	i was on hold for about 00_minutes .
neutral	i was impressed at the great service from buying to receiving the product .
neutral	i was less impressed when i realised that the glasses had come from hong_kong .
neutral	not because i was bothered about buying from hong_kong but because it seemed deceitful .
neutral	i believed that the company was a nz company and governed by nz cga etc , so that if anything went wrong , i would be covered .
neutral	there was no information on the website to tell me that in fact the glasses were coming from hong_kong and that it was a chinese company .
neutral	i prefer honesty in my dealings
neutral	i loved the boots and the jeans i ordered , however , the two shirts and the shorts i ordered i was very dissatisfied with !
neutral	definitely need more buyer friendly descriptions on their items .
neutral	i ordered this on the 00th and still have not received the order .
neutral	i probably will not use your website again at_least amazon delivers timely .
neutral	i was disappointed with my reservations for flight and hotel combined in one transaction .
neutral	i was lead to believe i would get a better rate if i combined the bookings .
neutral	turns_out i had to pay an outrageous hotel fee and it is also nonrefundable .
neutral	not sure i would ever use travelocity again .
neutral	i ordered a book at a higher price point after_speaking with one of bookbytes customer_service folks who said the books over $_000 ( the title i was purchasing ) included the disks ( 0 discs were to come with the book ).
neutral	i only received 0 disk , fortunately i already had the software that was on the other disc .
neutral	the service was quick and painless and i will_definitely purchase from bookbyte again .
neutral	websites are easy to reade , and as a fin , it ´_s nice to have it also in my language to make shopping easy !
neutral	thank u for that .
neutral	i wish that all of your item infos could be in finnish .
neutral	but my order arrived in just 0 days , so i ´_m very pleaced with that , and just ordered a new kit to try ...
neutral	there is only one thing i was bit disappointed , there was two manual batteries instead of one of each ( manual and automatic ), as was written in discription ... but maby it was a mistake ?
neutral	well have a nice springtime and keep_up a good customerservice !

neutral	hostelworld is easy to navigate and to find a hostel that suites your needs for your trip ; however , i booked a hostel in barcelona through hostelword , and i was charged a € 0 . 00 service charge .
neutral	when we reached the hostel though they told us that their receipt showed that i had only been charged a € 0 . 00 service charge .
neutral	it is only a € 0 . 00 cent difference , but still the discrepancy is there .
neutral	our hostel also told us that hostelworld is changing its policies , and if hostels pay a certain fee to the website then their ratings will be listed first , even if they are not one of the actual top_rated hostels , rated by users .
neutral	pay_attention before you book !
neutral	it was quick and easy to process the information
neutral	this is my 0st order with boohoo . com and needed a few casual cardigand and so the kate pocket jersey cardigans and order 0 different_colours for my waldrobe .
neutral	ordered the m / l size and they didn_'_t fit all .
neutral	was quite shocked .
neutral	i am a size 00 and l / xl may have fitted well , but boohoo . com does not have the size for me to re - order .
neutral	the quailty was soft and wearable with any casual wear .
neutral	dispappointed and had to return all three items .
neutral	ordered the bom bom beanie , was disappointed with the quality and also it did not fit my head with the braids .
neutral	couldn_'_t get it on , so this has_been returned as well .
neutral	the only item i kept was the black madison bow headnband .
neutral	this will keep my ears wram for the winter ahead .
neutral	really nice and a good pick to find .
neutral	delivery was not good as they said they attempted a delivery , but i was home as i am recovering from an operation .
neutral	that was a bit_annoying as a letter was then sent and had to book a delivery slot and dail an 0000 number which costs .
neutral	madness .
neutral	when parcel arrived , i would say the packaging was no great at all .
neutral	will order again with boohoo in the near_future ...... when i need something_else for the waldrobe !!
neutral	!
neutral	placed order on feb . 00th , 0000 , according to site the order was shipped via_fedex on feb . 00th , 0000 .
neutral	checked fedex_tracking on march 0nd , 0000 via online and it was stated that delivery was to be mar .
neutral	0th , 0000 .
neutral	by 0 : 00 mar .
neutral	0th when nothing was received i once again checked on line and found that my delivery date had been updated to reflect " n / a ".
neutral	by fri . afternoon the fedex_tracking still reflected " n / a ", so i then contacted petflow and spoke with cheryl @ 0 : 00_pm pst on 0 . 0 . 00 .
neutral	cheryl offered to contact fedex and had a trace put on our order .
neutral	i didn_'_t receive another call from cheryl , but i did receive a text_message from fedex stating my order would be delivered 0 . 00 . 00 , which it was .
neutral	unfortunately the box wasn_'_t sealed well and a part of my order was damaged and one part was missing all together .
neutral	i don_'_t anticipate using this service anytime_soon .
neutral	i have never dealt_with a company before that sends me the completely wrong order and then when i email them they apologize and give send a shipping label but they don_'_t do anything to compensate for their mistake like give me 00 more of the product for free with a different design or anything like 00_%_off your next order with no expiration_date , i '_m not very happy with them .
neutral	i '_ve booked two_separate trips recently and have not received email_confirmation for either one .
neutral	i had to contact travelocity for a confirmation , but feel i shouldn_'_t have to do that .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t received a confirmation for a trip i booked yesterday , even after i emailed customer_service and the itinerary_number i got when i booked doesn_'_t work when i try to look up the reservation .
neutral	this is very frustrating to me .
neutral	i did airfare and car_rental , no_issues with air but car_rental was not acceptable , i went with avis as travelocity had an offer via avis to get upgraded two levels , when i got there the agent was not friendly told me they did not have any to give and was very rude about it , then walking to my car another avis employee ran a stop sign and caused me to hit the ground with luggage to not get hit and he did not stop to help or apologize even when he saw what he did , car was old and dirty on top of everything else , will not be using avis again
neutral	0 lights do not light up .
neutral	i '_ve e_mailed but no reply as yet
neutral	i ordered four clothing items from yesstyle , and i was pretty pleased with three of them .
neutral	however , the quality of the fourth item ( a black skirt from a taiwanese brand ) was really bad - the stitching inside the skirt was faulty , and two of the buttons came right off in my hands !
neutral	plus , the skirt came with an attached tag that still had the price sticker on it .
neutral	when i converted the currencies i realized that the price on the tag was much lower_than the price i had paid .
neutral	the skirt was most definitely not worth the price advertised on yesstyle , and i feel ripped_off for paying that much for such a shoddy item .
neutral	i won_'_t be returning my purchased clothes because i ' d_rather not deal with the details of international shipping and refunds .
neutral	however , i don_'_t think i '_ll be shopping with yesstyle again , since i ' d prefer all of my items to be of decent quality .
neutral	i ordered a deluxe bunch of yellow and pink_roses called " congratulations ", also under " bestsellers " and " mothers_day " flowers on the floraqueen website , and assured that since they were roses , no substitution will take place .
neutral	the flowers my mother received were completely different : pale , long - stemmed , not overly abundant combination of a few white_roses , pink carnations and some other flower of which i can '_t remember the name .
neutral	she was happy , though she called it
neutral	" sweet ", whilst i had spent some time choosing a bunch which i thought would be fun , fizzy , and colourful , and " deluxe ".
neutral	it does make a mockery of the customer , presented with the rather elaborate catalogue of choices , when it proves the local flower shops do whatever they choose to send , regardless .
neutral	love the price i got for the room and not knowing which hotel you get until booking is complete .
neutral	discovered priceline . com rate for hotels on accident !!
neutral	just wish i could have picked bed preference and non_- smoking_room .
neutral	best pricing for hotel verses hotwire . com , was really surprised .
neutral	the hotels that are picked like the business but not the pricing that is given through third_party .
neutral	you are treated and reminded you are a third_party booker ...!
neutral	ouch , i can '_t help i want to save on cost of hotel .
neutral	heck , what do you expect for a family that is homeless !
neutral	gotta save all we can !!
neutral	thanks pricleline . com , you helped saved our family very expensive cost that we didn_'_t have and much_better_than staying in grimy motels !!
neutral	again , thank_you !
neutral	!
neutral	delivery was quick .
neutral	communication was good .
neutral	however , they took no notice of the delivery instructions i left when placing the order .
neutral	i know these were received ok as it was in my email_confirmation .
neutral	however , i was out when they delivered .
neutral	they didn_'_t leave it in the safe place i had specified .
neutral	so i had to re - arrange delivery .
neutral	ironically , to the safe place i had told them to leave it in in the first place !
neutral	the clothes are not that bad , but they did come a little too big for me .... but i still lyk them .
neutral	my favorite thing that i got from there was the two - in - one ( liquid / solid ) eyeliner .
neutral	i liked the bag that i bough but i guess i could get better quality for the price
neutral	i bought some products and i have to say that is not bad
neutral	i have used etyres for a while now but sadly felt let_down this time as i booked for the morning as going out then rang to say tyre not available until the afternoon . fitted in the dark , not as happy as usual . usually reliable .
neutral	falta traducción al español en indicaciones de que uno se baje y que_se acabaron las rutas para saber que ya se termina el paseo y tardan mucho en llegar , que a uno lo bajen en una parada para pasarlo a otro camión no me pareció muy agradable .
neutral	not really impressed with the ticketing system as it dosent download very well came printed out in 0 spread out pages
neutral	and dosesnt seem very professional in fact i am wondering_if it is a legitamte ticket !
neutral	!
neutral	i am very satisfied with what i paid in order to rent this text book compared to what the bookstore was originally asking for .
neutral	however , considering i settled for the older edition the amount of wear , the overall condition , and especially the amount of writing and distracting highlighting in the text is unsatisfactory .
neutral	i bought this product out of desperation on my cat was over grooming himself .
neutral	i did not want to put him on prozac and this was last resort before that .
neutral	i ordered my stethoscope because of the enticement of laser_engraving free of charge which i am very pleased .
neutral	however , i realized after i had ordered i forgot to check the box to get the free student information from littman .
neutral	i tried_calling the day after i placed my order and couldn_'_t get through so i tried using the live_chat and couldn_'_t get through so i sent an e_- mail with my request for the information for the free student pack .
neutral	still no response .
neutral	i again tried_calling and the phone system would not recognize any of my options i entered and could not get through to a live_person .
neutral	after several tries i did finally get through to someone on live_chat which seemed as though i was ignored with long pauses between conversation to finally get what i needed .
neutral	this last order the ink ran_out so fast i am trying someone_else .
neutral	i also got the black_ink all over my bathrobe .
neutral	it just ran right out after i removed the
neutral	orange covering .
neutral	thank_god it missed the carpeting !
neutral	then in no time at
neutral	all , i needed another order .
neutral	i had been happy with things , but the last
neutral	two orders were terrible .
neutral	i like bedeck products but there is no retailer where i live so i have to purchase online .
neutral	considering there is a p_& p charge unless you spend so much they are very slow at delivering .
neutral	the same day i ordered from bedeck i purchased a large item from an ebay_seller .
neutral	the seller charged no p_& p and although estimated delivery was a week it took 0 days .
neutral	this company took a week .
neutral	very annoying !
neutral	price and service was above_average but part feel apart within 0 day .
neutral	the mirror feel out of the frame the first time i tried to manually adjust it .
neutral	getting back to the company can only be done by email .
neutral	i have ordered many parts from partsgeek . com .
neutral	i have just received an order and it was not complete .
neutral	have no way of getting in touch with them .
neutral	have tried_calling , e_- mailing and tried several_times to fill_out customer_support_ticket to no_avail
neutral	part was to received by monday 0 / 00 / 00 .... ups left a note on a neighbors door saying it needed to be signed for .
neutral	neighbor brought sheet to us and left a note on their door saying ups was at the wrong residence .
neutral	after 0 days and 0 phone_calls and 0 emails the package had been left at a church on our road !!!!!!
neutral	at a church on the same road ...... what is wrong with this picture ????????
neutral	i will buy parts again but i will demand shipping other than ups - they are way too lame to be entrusting expensive products to ......
neutral	i receive my orders fine .
neutral	but the product comes damaged .
neutral	like the kitty_litter .
neutral	it all over the bottom of the packing box
neutral	i love being_able to utilize bookit . com because i can link up my bill me later account , and make monthly_payments on my travel / hotel / etc .
neutral	this is great for those of us who do not always have cash available to get away on our vacations , so for this option , i am grateful for bookit . com .
neutral	i went through a tedious process of checking the website over the past couple weeks to try and get the best deal i could on a highly rated hotel in las_vegas .
neutral	i finally found a great deal last night , and was in the process of booking three_nights at the luxor !!
neutral	i was so excited because not only was i getting a great nightly rate , they had a $_00 food credit from the hotel which was included as a bonus , and also a free $_000 restaurant . com gift_certificate !!!
neutral	this made the deal even sweeter because it meant that we could maybe eat two meals during our vacation for close to nothing .
neutral	so , i went through the booking process and when i got to the last page it said , in very small_print , " make_sure to opt for the restaurant gift_card when you are completing your booking in order to receive it ."
neutral	so , from that page forward i kept scanning every inch of the screen to click on the restaurant . com gift_card .
neutral	well , i never found the option , and the reservation closed itself out .
neutral	i could not get back in to make any changes , or to search harder for the restaurant . com option .
neutral	well , i opened up a new bookit . com page and started a new booking just to see if i had missed it .
neutral	the disappointing fact was that the restaurant . com gift_card option was on the page prior to where it gave_me the warning to add it on !!
neutral	this made me incredibly sad , and i felt major bummed .
neutral	there was no way to remedy this matter because i had already completed my first booking , and paid for it .
neutral	i believe that bookit . com needs to be much more clearer with people creating bookings about the bonuses , or the special add_ons .
neutral	had i received this warning or special instructions prior to the page that actually had the restaurants . com gift_card option on it , i would have seen it .
neutral	it was almost like they didn_'_t want me to find it , so they didn_'_t really have to give away a $_000 gift_card .
neutral	so , in the end , i appreciate the fact that bookit . com accepts my bill me later account , which gives someone_who is on a budget many more options and opportunities to be able to take vacations .
neutral	i did not appreciate the fact that bookit . com did not help me take_advantage of all the bonuses / freebies that i could have gotten .
neutral	i spent over $_000 on this booking , and that $_000 gift_card would have been an amazing addition .
neutral	please , bookit . com , help your customers by providing instructions before the customer misses out .
neutral	i ordered online 0 x pirelli tyres because of their fuel efficiency and wet weather rating , i booked my mobile_fitting day .
neutral	the day before the fitting i received a phone_call to say the pirelli '_s would be a few extra days and would i accept continental tyres instead , because i needed the tyres urgently i accepted the substitute .
neutral	however , i think that when you order a specific tyre the computer system should be able to check for my area mobile fitter and tell me there and then if they are not available .
neutral	that way i could decide_whether to continue with my purchase or not .
neutral	i don_'_t like tyre_fitting garages , as they take for ages when you turn up and surprisingly nearly always sell you a tyre you don_'_t want .
neutral	either have the tyres in stock or don_'_t advertise them on the website .
neutral	the shoes were delivered really quickly , which was great .
neutral	but when i tried the shoes on i noticed that the eyelet on the right hand side of the right shoe was missing .
neutral	there was just a whole in the fabric .
neutral	as it is the very last whole my trousers cover that part , which is why i didn_'_t return the shoes .
neutral	it '_s more likely to be a manufacturing fault anyway as the shoes clearly hadn_'_t been used / worn before i received them
neutral	i used bookit . com last_year for a trip to nyc , and had no_issues with my hotel reservation .
neutral	however , i just booked my hotel for an_upcoming_trip to san_diego later this month and have encountered several problems .
neutral	first , i was trying to book two different_types of rooms ( one for me , and another for my sister ), but the system only defaults to both rooms being the same .
neutral	i called and the customer representative at bookit . com told me i needed to do two_separate transactions if i wanted to have different_types of rooms ( e . g_., king vs . queen suite ).
neutral	other_sites ( such as orbitz ) allow you to select the type of room for each room that you are booking .
neutral	anyway , i did that over the phone with a representative ( megan ) and she read back the prices to me , with my sister '_s room being almost $_00 cheaper because there are fewer people in the room .
neutral	when i received the confirmation emails , i noticed that both rooms were charged the same price .
neutral	i called to correct this , and the process of talking to a representative and being put on hold took about 00 - 00_minutes .
neutral	i was told by romie , another customer representative , that the remaining credit would show up on my credit_card .
neutral	he also mentioned i would receive an_email_confirmation that this took place .
neutral	however , the correction has not been made yet and i did not get an_email .
neutral	if i had not read the contract in detail , i may never have noticed the wrong amount that was charged .
neutral	i was assuming since the customer representative read the prices to me , it was accurate .
neutral	and i '_m not sure why it is taking so long to correct the amount when the charges appeared quickly , but the credit seems to take longer ( unlike my experiences with other_sites ).
neutral	also , having to spend 00 - 00_minutes on hold and explaining the situation to the customer representative without_any results is frustrating .
neutral	i was so pleased with all the clothes purchased but was disgusted that there was chewed up chewing gum on the outer_packaging of the clothes inside the bag .
neutral	if i didn_'_t like the clothes so much the while lot would have gone back in the same packaging along with the chewing gum .
neutral	it was the first time i '_ve purchased from boohoo n doubt i will use again soon , but would again if the chewing gum issue would be recognised n resolved .
neutral	while we have used the company before and probably would again if we new there was not going to be any weather issues .
neutral	on day 0 of our 0 day tickets it rained in london .
neutral	to get a seat or a spot on a bus was extremely difficult .
neutral	wait times were 00 - 00_min and it was standing room only and very difficult when someone wanted to get off as they wont open the back door .
neutral	the gentlemen that stand at each area to get folks to sign_up that are walking by on the sidewalk are extremely pushy and the one outside of buckingham_palace stop on oct 0th was down right rude .
neutral	he must have known they werent coming for at_least 00_min because he disappeared while we all stood in the rain waiting for the bus .
neutral	then bam showed_up when the bus arrived .
neutral	i paid for next_day delivery but because the order was placed after 0 it didn_'_t arrive for 0 days - if you are not able to fulfil next_day delivery you should advise when order is placed and be given chance to change delivery option .
neutral	i bought a body protector on - line for my daughter .
neutral	when it arrived , it didn_'_t fit so i tried to return it to the nearest_store .
neutral	i was told that the terms and conditions state that safety equipment cannot be returned .
neutral	the item was clearly completely unworn and the sales_assistant was very helpful and ultimately agreed to a full_refund on this basis , whilst making it clear that go outdoors did not have to do this .
neutral	whilst i accept the reasons for the policy and that this is probably in the terms and conditions , go must be aware that few people read the fine_print first , and need to make it much more visible , when buying safety equipment , that they will not accept_returns .
neutral	this does make it virtually_impossible to buy this on - line though .
neutral	tv ordered and awaiting info re delivery .
neutral	some days_later there was a card from yodel saying they had called and tried to deliver my item and could i re - schedule .
neutral	no information had every been given that they would be delivering on that day .
neutral	called the cust helpline - changed the suggested date from thur to sat ..... and then received 0 different phone_calls to give me a slot on thurs .... 0 times i told them it was sat ...... and the delivery driver called outside my house on the fri to ask where i was !!!
neutral	they did come_back and deliver that evening once i was home from work - but the free sound bar was missing
neutral	i switched away from fcr . com when i realized they had my score all wrong .
neutral	their mistake caused me to negotiate for my recent car purchase thinking my credit_score was about 000 pts lower_than it actually was !
neutral	i love the car i bought , but i '_m sure i could have negotiated better terms .
neutral	this seems like a decent service , although it would be nice if there were more robust planning tools , although i realize that isn_'_t exactly_what this service is for .
neutral	the only other complaint i have is that your app is not compatible with android 0 . 0 .
neutral	key lime pie will be out in a couple months ... may want to hurry up on that , lest you look out of touch with recent tech , which i would think an identity_theft prevention service would want to avoid .
neutral	the pricing is good , however the shipping on the free items increases to the point that they aren_'_t free_samples .
neutral	this is my second order , with all the info on the free_samples i would get i expected something in my first order .
neutral	nothing came .
neutral	i see now at my second order that you have to select the free_samples that you get , again this ups the shipping cost .
neutral	the site isn_'_t the easiest to use .
neutral	in all nothing earth shakingly different from a few of the other_sites i have used .
neutral	just a lower base price for the same product .
neutral	ordered a part that wasn_'_t in my opinion what it was suppose to be and couldn_'_t get a reply to return for 0 days .
neutral	unfortunately , the part i ordered by the name my mechanic told me to get wasn_'_t event associated with the egr valve in my mom '_s car !
neutral	if they had online_chat or would answer their phones properly ( you can '_t tell me 00_mins ) is a decent time to hold , when , in fact , no one ever picked_up the call !
neutral	couldn_'_t take waiting that long .
neutral	tried several_times .
neutral	not happy with customer_service .
neutral	yes , they have the best price on parts , but maybe paying a little more will help by getting someone to address issues on what to order or return !
neutral	!
neutral	i wanted to order two replacement aqua jogging belts .
neutral	i googled that and clicked on your site , happy to have found just what i wanted at a very reasonable price .
neutral	while on the site i wanted to see what else you had , so looked at one or two other screens .
neutral	when i checked out i found that in addition to the replacement belts two girls ' swimsuits were listed , although not included in the total , so i clicked purchase .
neutral	it looked like a small box with a question mark was to the left of each item .
neutral	i figured that you were " suggesting " other items i might want to buy .
neutral	to my horror , you sent me the two suits , bringing our $_00 . 00 order to $_00 . 00 .
neutral	this is surely a glitch in the website , as i definitely did not order and do not want these suits .
neutral	i was pleased , however , that when i called to report your mistake the young_woman took_care of it right_away by issuing me a prepaid return packaging label , saying that a refund would be issued as soon as they got the suits back .
neutral	i ordered two dresses for a wedding for my teenage_daughter sizing was very big and the colours and quality were not what they looked like on line so returned both for refund .
neutral	would not chance ordering any more .
neutral	at first i was happy with wowcher ...
neutral	but in the short time i have been on 0 items have not arrived ... one after already being requested my address a second time !!!
neutral	on emailing for a resolution i have had no contact or refund ...
neutral	i am still_awaiting something to be done .
neutral	i started a very happy customer - but now i am just frustrated and feel i am receiving poor customer_service - or rather no customer_service !
neutral	es_una muy_buena forma de elegir hostal .
neutral	le falta poder reservar distintas piezas de una sola vez .
neutral	works well with magimix machine which i was initially apprehensive qbput
neutral	bought a re manufactured power brake booster for a 00 chevy pickup and it was wont fit up right only sideways but my uncle is gonna do some rigging with the brackets to make it fit , if he put it on the way it was sent to him it would be mounted on sideways .
neutral	seems all are being rebuilt this way , this is not the first one we bought this way from another parts company .
neutral	but overall thanks for fast shipping .
neutral	i order these cookies ( biscuits ) from one that a friend brought me on his flight from dubai u . a . e .
neutral	the one he brought was crawford '_s bourbon creams that had vanilla fillings .
neutral	it tasted much_better_than the chocolate ones that i received in my order .
neutral	i just wish y ' all had the option for a speedier shipping it '_s been two_weeks , i still_haven_'_t received my items .
neutral	placed an order with molarclean and the ordering was very easy .
neutral	had problems with the delivery i . e .
neutral	they didn_'_t arrive even_though i had an_email_stating that they ' d been dispatched .
neutral	when i emailed them to see if they had really been dispatched i was sent an_email_asking me to call a mobile number .
neutral	this email was sent to others that had presumably had problems with their orders too and all email_addresses were on show ... breaking data protection act i think .
neutral	the tooth brush_heads were sent recorded post in the end and arrived .
neutral	they are not braun ones but molarclean '_s own make .
neutral	i wasn_'_t expecting that .
neutral	the web_site today having read it does state molarclean '_s own ones though , so don_'_t know if it '_s been updated .
neutral	anyway i will try them and see how they compare .
neutral	any_problems and i will send them back .
neutral	if they are ok i may order again in the future .
neutral	i love my glasses from frames_direct .
neutral	they are all i thought they would be and more .
neutral	i can not express how happy i am with my glasses .
neutral	with that said , i did encounter issues with shipping .
neutral	i . e .
neutral	my local post_office lost my purchase .
neutral	after several phone_calls and emails , two_weeks_later , i received my original purchase .
neutral	but not without confronting frames_direct about the shipping mishap .
neutral	with that said : frames_direct , after i asked for a refund of my money , ( because online purchases can be such a hassle , right ?)
neutral	tried to make good by offering me another set of glasses , which would have been shipped out overnight with ups .
neutral	like i said , it did not have to come to that , and i received my original purchase in the mail , but two_weeks_later than the tracking_number indicated .
neutral	i feel the website could be more user_friendly and it wouldn_'_t let_me book my travel_plans .
neutral	i had to call in to a representative who kept messing up what i was telling her and trying to tell me the flight i wanted suddenly wasn_'_t there when the final booking time came , ( although i was simultaneously on other travel sites due to my concern i would not be able to complete the transaction with her and the flight was still quite clearly there ).
neutral	this did not give me any confidence in the service and i was truly expecting the worse .
neutral	thankfully the worst part was booking it .
neutral	the trip itself went very smoothly and everything was in order .
neutral	they should really allow you to book your reservation yourself online where you can see exactly_what you ' re getting and not be forced to deal with people of questionable capability .
neutral	well i placed this order on sept 0 and it took00 days to get here , recieved it on the 00th , i thought i ordered beagle air freshners i got pug ones instead , no info on returning anything . cindy
neutral	i purchased the ostomy hole cutter in order to stop using scissors , but the cutter only succeeds in making a small impression in the wafer , i still have to use scissors to cut out the hole .
neutral	i will_continue to search the web in order to find something that will work .
neutral	i did place one order and it was delivered when they said it would be .
neutral	everything was packed very well .
neutral	their prices are quite high , however .
neutral	i have found the blue_buffalo dog and cat_food cheaper almost everywhere_else , i guess you have to pay for the convenience of home delivery .
neutral	all in all , i don_'_t think it is worth the extra money .
neutral	the xl poster prints i ordered were good quality and great value for money , but the packaging was damaged on arrival .
neutral	the tubes had been bashed inwards , leaving creases .
neutral	i have tried to contact jessops photo but the email on the website doesn_'_t work and i can '_t seem to get through on the phone as i would like to have a replacement print .
neutral	products are excellent , ordered stuff on sunday_night , asked for next_day delivery , expecting stuff to arrive on tuesday !
neutral	had to phone up to ask what had happened to order , was told that it '_s actually a 0 day delivery service not next_day !
neutral	definetly not happy , spent all day waiting for parcel !
neutral	maybe you should change delivery description , very misleading
neutral	not real happy with them right now 0 months and counting , beginning to wonder_if i will ever get the part !
neutral	i can '_t_believe i was charged $_00 . 00 postage for the product .
neutral	the product was displayed in a slim black box , yet on delivery was presented in a plastic_bag , very disappointed .
neutral	i '_m happy with the spectacles , vision and quality is sound .
neutral	however the delivery time was painful .
neutral	would recommend if you ' re not in a hurry !

neutral	i recently_purchased a product from this company that required refrigeration at all times .
neutral	it was shipped un - refrigerated .
neutral	i then called the products company to find out if this product was still usable .
neutral	they informed me that pure_formulas . com was not authorized to sell this product online .
neutral	i called customer_service and they sent me a prepaid return shipping label .
neutral	waiting for my refund .
neutral	i placed an order once a couple months_ago .
neutral	it was for a high low ombre skirt and it was half off , they were having some promotion .
neutral	the skirt was cute but i didn_'_t like the material and it was kinda big on me , because it was on sale i couldn_'_t return or exchange :(.
neutral	the site is pretty nice but the prices are way over done .
neutral	i just saw some shorts on there for $_00 when g stage love has it for $_00 .
neutral	i see that a lot , plus they take_forever to restock and sell out of my sizes quick .
neutral	i placed my first order with them a few_months_ago .
neutral	the items were of pretty good quality but the good thing about the company is the prices are so cheap and they ' re selling a lot of things found on gojane and 0000ave and urbanog for way less , the only things is the cothes go out of stock fast , there '_s not a huge_selection , they could provide more details such as percentage of material that the clothes are made of , what size the model is wearing , how to care for the cothes , and they don_'_t accept_returns , just store credit , which is the main_reason_why i haven_'_t bought anything_else from them , what if you can '_t find anything_else you want ?
neutral	well , i '_ve been buying from ami for over a year now , i usually buy things i don_'_t see elsewhere , or that is sold out , like simple maxi_dresses for cheap and jumpsuits ( that are pricey ) and i must_say the quality is pretty good but there '_s so much that '_s not so good ..... the shipping is sky_high and they are constantly having promotions ( i think because some of their prices and shipping ) but you can '_t combine the two .
neutral	then once last_year , i ordered two things , one came in the mail , i emailed them for weeks and called receiving no help and finally they send me an_email_stating my refund was issued because they were sold out of that item , yet it was listed .
neutral	i was very disappointed and frustrated that i didn_'_t buy from them for a long time .
neutral	also they don_'_t accept_returns ( when more and more huge stores have changed that policy ), i don_'_t like that and that '_s why i hesitate to buy from them .
neutral	plus their clothes sell out fast and they don_'_t restock until months after the fact .
neutral	the site itself is hell .
neutral	theres thousands of products but when you type in " leopard crop " polka_dot leggings are also popping up , the site has a great design but it needs serious upgrading .
neutral	they definitely need major changes .
neutral	because the promotions and shipping of every other popular trendy site is going to win me over every time .
neutral	well , i think they have some really cute_clothes but their prices are too high for a full time student , such as myself and i once ordered a dress for $_00 and it was horrible .
neutral	the black and white saints and sinners dress .... the top part was stretchy but the bottom part was unflattering , stiff , and the material was not good , it should '_ve been stretchy like the top part .
neutral	then it was pulling or whatever its called when it seems as though the stitching is coming out .
neutral	so my thing is , expensive clothes ..... you ' re really just paying for the name tag because i see items on the site that are on gojane for $_00 and nasty gal has it for $_00 .
neutral	call me cheap but i '_m not paying more for something made of the same material .
neutral	is it really worth it ?
neutral	that dress wasn_'_t .
neutral	the only_reason_why i gave 0_stars because i love the design of the sight and the selection of clothes .
neutral	well , i '_ve been ordering from them for over a year now and i love their style variety , meaning you can be preppy , party girl , school girl , and sophisticated and chic .
neutral	i love that they have x - smalls too and around christmas they shipped my things within 0 days to get it before christmas , which is amazing .
neutral	but their sizing is wayyyyy off , in bottoms specifically .
neutral	their quality can be an_issue too , depends on what you buy , but their jeans are weird too .
neutral	i '_m tall and thin but my legs are oddly short and their jeans seem to flatten your butt , but are wide in the hips and tight in the calf area .
neutral	like no one '_s shaped like that .
neutral	and their infamous $_00 jeans .
neutral	not worth those $_00 .
neutral	then they sometimes misrepresent an item with the wrong picture and don_'_t respond to those emails sent on the site .
neutral	and i didn_'_t like how at first in store they only issued store credit but they changed that now thank_goodness .
neutral	i just wish their quality was better and that their jeans didn_'_t fit so oddly
neutral	well i '_ve only ordered once from them and ordered 0 things ( crop tops ) and i love the fact that there '_s no shipping .
neutral	i hate_paying for shipping but one of the tops were cheap ( like $ 0 ) and the quality was very poor but the other one was cheap too , cost more but still cheap and i love it , shipping time was good too though .
neutral	also they are expensive , a cute crop top was like almost $_00 .
neutral	i '_m giving it a 0 because i haven_'_t had much experience with the site and i guess it depends on what you buy , regarding quality , and the majority of the items are very expensive .
neutral	the card itself was very easy to purchase however its very confusing to use . i used this card to do an in app purchase . but to my dismay i couldn_'_t figure_out how to do so . i went threw every obvious sulotion i could think of and nothing , so i went to google to see what others were doing about the in app purchase . what i found was other people trying to do the same as me . so i know it would be benifical for the i tunes service to be more clear on how to do those kinds of transactions . never the less after surching a bit more a bell went off in my head about how i could possible do this action . i went my app and went to the bottom of the page and you know the rest i was able to make my purchase by adding the amount directly to my acct . im so happy i was able to do just what i wanted with my card . thank_you
neutral	i ordered belts and obviously they do no run true to size .
neutral	a large is like a small but i just want orders belts again .
neutral	see above .
neutral	most frustrating .
neutral	i sent out for two orders , my book and the cd '_s that go with the book .
neutral	my book arrived two_weeks_ago and i still have not received my second order , my cd '_s .
neutral	they are not trustworthy with getting your orders to you in a timely_manner even at all .
neutral	i booked a compact mercedes or the equivalent but wound_up with a ford_fiesta .
neutral	otherwise everything worked out well .
neutral	good pizza and food but cold on delivery
neutral	price has gone ridiculously high now the company is more established .
neutral	price before was really reasonable and close to prices one would pay if shopping in asia .
neutral	this business is awesome because they have a huge_selection of amazing and hard to find products .
neutral	the only problem i '_ve had with them is that if they ' re out of stock with a certain product they don_'_t tell you that until you '_ve already placed your order .
neutral	that '_s difficult when the free_shipping when you spend 000_dollars is void if they ' re out of stock .
neutral	i was really disappointed by that .
neutral	how hard is it to add an out of stock button ?
neutral	pet - flow is an easy way to buy a supply of dog_food , however , the automatic order procedure is not working for me .
neutral	they wanted to send another bag of dog_food way before i had room to store it in the dog_food bin , so i held off for several weeks , then all at once i had another 00_lb .
neutral	bag sitting on the porch .
neutral	it now sits in the garage unopened until there is room enough to store in bin .
neutral	i have one old ( 00_yr . old ) cocker_spaniel who is on a periennial diet , so he gets a cup a day .
neutral	afraid to get too much ahead of time .
neutral	we are living day to day .
neutral	ordering and delivery was easy and efficient .
neutral	returning goods was another kettle of fish .
neutral	i received goods damaged in transit and wanted a replacement but this could not be actioned until the damaged goods had been received back .
neutral	i couldn_'_t wait that long so sent all back for a refund and went somewhere_else !
neutral	also its worth_noting you can only return through collect_plus stores which is quite restricting .
neutral	i was given an order date for my purchase , but it did not arrive on the date given , no information from homebase as why this occured .
neutral	the item did arrive the following_day .
neutral	just be aware you may not get your purchase on the date expected even if like i did you paid for the postage .
neutral	we really like playing spike all with our family .
neutral	unfurtunately it was broke the first day the boys played a competitive match .
neutral	no the rim is misshaped , which is very upsetting for my son
neutral	we enjoyed the bustour , but since my son speaks hardly any english , we mostly toured on the blue line .
neutral	there via headsets you get very little information about london and what is there to see .
neutral	this was rather disappointing , on top 0 - 0 stops were not served because of a roadproblem .
neutral	the employees are nice but very businesslike , it is very obvious that they are there to sell tickets mainly .
neutral	more detailed_information via headwould be desirable !
neutral	i get notices that someone viewed by info but then i have to go into the website and look myself .
neutral	it '_s difficult to see what '_s going on .
neutral	it would be nicer if when we received the notice , it was more specific so that we knew right_away whether we should be checking it , that it '_s a serious breach , or if we can view it later .
neutral	all notice are the same level .
neutral	i want to know if someone is trying to open an account or has accessed by checking_account .
neutral	unfortunately we made a mistake with our original booking and rang rentalcars to extend by 00_hours but they did not process the extra day and we ended_up paying 00_euros to goldcar for an extra day - lesson_learned !
neutral	i would give this 0_stars and i have spent_thousands of dollars at this store in the past_year .
neutral	but when i made the decision to buy a spare set of lights " used " saving a couple_hundred_dollars , it was a great set of hensel lights but ..... the power cords they sent with the lights were 0feet long !
neutral	really bh ?
neutral	who plugs studio lights in 0 feet away ?
neutral	i found that to be a cheap thing for them to do probably because the set didnt have any cords so they were cheap cheap cheap and threw in a four foot cord .
neutral	i was too busy that day to contact bh and forgot after that .
neutral	but now since a light got knocked over due to its short cord ... now i am contacting them .
neutral	it is difficult to get the first person you speak to do do anything -- even in email .
neutral	just ask to speak to a supervisor .
neutral	one problem was that the top joining bracket was cracked and couldn_'_t be hassled waiting for a replacement .
neutral	they look ok but it '_s a little irritating after_spending all that money
neutral	let '_s start with the good .
neutral	excellent service , arrived on time and the steak is of very good quality .... now for the bad .
neutral	the steak arrives ' bulk packed '.
neutral	four large steaks in each sealed bag , meaning you have to open each bag and re - pack into freezer bags in singles or pairs for future use - very messy and time - consuming .
neutral	great for dinner parties but not if you are a single or a couple ..... this would put me off ordering again , which is a great shame .
neutral	i loved my plaque , but there were a few quirks .
neutral	it didn_'_t really stick well and it got bent really easily .
neutral	it was beautiful though and if you don_'_t bend it , i '_m sure that you will enjoy the product .
neutral	if there wasn_'_t such a high cost of sending merchandise back to nygard through the mail , i would order more .
neutral	because i am never sure how something will fit ( and that depends on so many things i . e .
neutral	fabric and what label is on it ), it makes the ordering online so iffy .
neutral	i have been a good customer of nygard on - line over the years and i will_continue but it would be so much_easier and less_expensive if returns were made easier .
neutral	i know i can return the items to a store but the closest is almost a 0 hr .
neutral	drive away .
neutral	i purchased a few items on line which i was pleased with most , unfortunately i few things didnt fit and had to be returned .
neutral	its a shame that this cant be easily done in store for a refund or that you offer a free returns_policy i had to spend nearly_£ 0 on return postage which will now make me less likely to purchase on line again .
neutral	i ordered my parts 0 days before my second order and have not received the first one .
neutral	quite frustrated .
neutral	wish someone could fix this .
neutral	book was delivered in a used 0 ring binder as color copied pages .
neutral	did not realize this was the case .
neutral	a few of the pages were water logged .
neutral	delivery was prompt .
neutral	book will work .
neutral	saved a ton of money so overall pleased .
neutral	the item didnt suit me so i had to return it . the picture was misleading
neutral	i absolutely_loved the frames !
neutral	they were perfect and so adorable !
neutral	they would '_ve gotten 0_stars , but the prescription wasn_'_t right in them .
neutral	the glasses i wear now are my correct prescription and these new ones were so different and i couldn_'_t wear them for more than a minute at a time .
neutral	i '_m going to have to bring them to my eye_doctor so i can be sure i get the right prescription put in them .
neutral	i ordered a t - shirt for my husband for his_birthday .
neutral	the graphics are excellent tho ' the size seems to run a little small and the quality of the material is less_than i expected .
neutral	it '_s thinner_than i ' d like and i '_m not sure how it will hold up over many washings .
neutral	i don_'_t plan to order any more .
neutral	i only wanted to order a diary refill for my existing organiser & still had to pay full delivery prices which made it a very expensive full cost .
neutral	however i still love the products which are beautiful quality .
neutral	needed to worm a litter of kittens , realised i had run_out so ordered .
neutral	order wasnt dispatched for a few_days .
neutral	too slow .
neutral	should be posted the day its ordered or the following_day at latest .
neutral	if needing something urgently would have to go elsewhere
neutral	i and my partner had text_messages and emails stating delivery time would be between 00 :_00am - 00 :_00pm . at 00 :_00pm i had phone_call from driver to say they had missed me out by mistake . they were in scarborough and had to have a break and would be with me at 0pmish . they did arrive just after 0pm . they were extremely apologetic and polite . however i work fulltime , am very busy with family commitments , and specifically paid_extra for a guaranteed delivery which did not happen .
neutral	yes it was the same day but not the stipulated time that were texted and emailed . therefore i would like to be reimbursed for the extra payment .
neutral	i used to book a lot with ebookers and when everything is fine that '_s great but when there '_s a problem , get ready for a lot of frustration .
neutral	so many hoops to jump_through to sort out something that was not my fault .
neutral	first time i put it down to bad_luck but when similar happened , i realized that it was the system that was wrong .
neutral	now i use different sites to make my bookings .
neutral	i used to love facebook but in the last_year or so they have been going downhill a lot in my estimation .
neutral	they seem to want to control everything we do and ignore what people want .
neutral	i understand it '_s a business and they need to make money but there is a balance that they fail to achieve .
neutral	over the last 0 years i liked a number of pages but now , i never see any of their feeds .
neutral	same applies to many of my genuine friends whose feeds seem to have vanished .
neutral	if i like a page , i want to see what they post but facebook decide what i see .
neutral	not happy .
neutral	now i find myself only checking in once or twice a week for a few_minutes instead of 0 or 0 times a day .
neutral	facebook is killing what made them great and now i can happily live without it .
neutral	adobe is very expensive but i still love their software .
neutral	but i am worried_about their online business now as i only use it occasionally and because i travel a lot , i don_'_t always have internet_connection .
neutral	maybe i have it wrong but i just can '_t see the online software model working for me .
neutral	i hope i '_m wrong .
neutral	the way it '_s organized is good and i like the content .
neutral	i have two main difficulties .
neutral	my default browser ( internet_explorer ) hardly lets me edit exercises i correct at all .
neutral	i have switched to using chrome for busuu , but that '_s not perfect either though it is better_than ie .
neutral	maybe firefox works better ?
neutral	the translations are british english ( i '_m american ) so sometimes it '_s hard to understand .
neutral	normally we are very happy with finding the products we specifically are looking for and shipping is very fast .
neutral	but , this time in looking for the fish_oil product we always purchase we could not find here in the qty bottle size we like .
neutral	i received the goods as ordered but it took several days & i received no email_confirming they ' d been sent .
neutral	shoes were great , too bad they didn_'_t fit and too expensive to return .
neutral	😩
neutral	the ring is beautiful itself however i feel it '_s cheaply_made i purchased the more_expensive one to avoid that issue
neutral	packaging damaged in transit , parts missing , poor instructions plus instructions included for parts not on the treadmill .
neutral	once assembled treadmill was ok although cannot alter tension belt as instructed as there isn_'_t one !!
neutral	adequate for my needs .
neutral	quick delivery , note of quantity but not actual bill , it did say invoice to follow but still not got one .
neutral	sent email , no reply . not impressed
neutral	my plants arrived .
neutral	they were smaller_than i expected .
neutral	i took them out and planted them .
neutral	i didn_'_t buy enough of them so i went to my local home improvement store and bought more of them that were larger than what i received and half the price .
neutral	needless to say i was not a happy_camper .
neutral	recieved item ( a day earlier_than_expected : p ) but unfortunately there was a crack in the casing of the machine .
neutral	called up immediately to report and was told to take pics and send to an e_mail address .
neutral	tried to do this but e_mail address did not exist .
neutral	tried to call back but couldnt seem to get an answer .
neutral	good machine .
neutral	just a bit dissapointed with after service .
neutral	hope to get it sorted :)
neutral	i wish hostelworld good offer better price .
neutral	after having travelled to phuket and bangkok and interacting with many tourist i found that there are better offers in the market than what hotelworld offers .
neutral	in order to stay competitve hostelworld needs to match the market price for budget travellers .
neutral	but .... when i pay for 0 day delivery and usps takes 0 days to deliver makes it not good service !!
neutral	ups of fed_ex would be better at delivery !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered some address labels on june_00th .
neutral	just got an_email yesterday ( july_00th ) that they probably_won_'_t arrive until the 00th .
neutral	did not realize it would take almost 0_weeks to get them .
neutral	i talked with john of 0 / 00 who offered me an_additional discount of $_00 if i signed_up for magazines .
neutral	i would receive a letter with the details and a $_00 debit_card within a week or two and then the magazines would start .
neutral	he also gave_me a number , after i had asked , to call to cancel if i had any_problems .
neutral	as of today , 0 / 00 , i have received nothing .
neutral	i called the number i was given and they have no record of me .
neutral	they gave_me numbers to other magazine sales companies .
neutral	they also had no record of me .
neutral	i was advised to call the publisher .
neutral	i did call one of the three publishers and they have no record of me .
neutral	have not yet received my credit_card bill to see if i was charged .
neutral	have spent way too much time following up on this .
neutral	i recieved the book in a timely_manner yet the book was disgusting and in bad quality .
neutral	it had mold growing and there are a bunch of waterstains .
neutral	i was aware that there was damage to the book although not that much damage .
neutral	maybe when sending out the books be sure that it is legible , and in decent shape .
neutral	website - easy to use / easy to choose / easy to buy
neutral	sales_team - one person hung_up on my husband , followed by 0 people over 0 days attempting to sell in extras - please get it drl after the first call , why would a customer be wanting to think 0 times about a brand_new_washing_machine breaking down when our last one lasted 00 years ??
neutral	poor experience
neutral	delivery - arrived 0 . 00am - was fitted before breakfast and love the machine
neutral	thanks
neutral	i '_ve ordered a virgin brazilian lace closure and some virgin brazilian hair from this site and i would have to stay that my experience was half and half .
neutral	the lace closure was beautiful but the knots would not bleach and the hair was just gorgeous but the supplier lightly died my hair after i asked them not to .
neutral	also , when i told the first supplier that the knots on my lace closure would not bleach ( after i confirmed the order ) i never_heard from them again .
neutral	so when buying on this website please check the following :
neutral	0 .
neutral	the customer rating .
neutral	if the customer rating is below an 00 , i highly advise you not to order from that seller .
neutral	also , read all of customer feedback .
neutral	the good and the bad .
neutral	0 .
neutral	bug the hell out of them .
neutral	if you have a question about the product , ask them .
neutral	0 .
neutral	do not release your money until you receive your product .
neutral	when you place your order , it gives you and option to confirm delivery .
neutral	do not click that option until you receive your product because once they have the money , then you will never hear from them .
neutral	i hope this helps
neutral	ik_heb nogal wat problemen ervaren met_de drukproeven .
neutral	deze worden gemaild en vervolgens gaan jullie zitten wachten op reactie , zelfs bij een spoedopdracht .
neutral	ik werk niet elke dag , dus drukproeven zie ik pas 0 dagen_later .
neutral	voor gewone opdrachten zou_het nog door de beugel kunnen .
neutral	maar voor spoedopdrachten kan dit echt niet .
neutral	my initial order was handled very promtly and arrived quickly - no problem there .
neutral	unfortunately the shoes were not suitable and needed to be returned .
neutral	the collect_+ service for returns is poor - it is advertised as allowing you to return at lots of local convenient stores at no cost .
neutral	i live in london and the nearest shop i could use to return goods was miles_away - nothing in any local centres .
neutral	this means i either have to pay for returning with a collection service or travel a long way , to shops which are not in local centres .
neutral	collect_+ needs to improve a lot for it to offer a convenient and acceptable level of service .
neutral	i shall look at other options before i buy again from barringtons .
neutral	apart_from the delivery cost issue i was extremely happy with my purchase .
neutral	however , the surcharged delivery is a major problem that will_definitely stop me shopping with you again , unfortunately .
neutral	the rest of the uk would have had next_day delivery free for my purchase ... i had to pay £_00 for delivery and then had to wait several days for it to be delivered ... not a comparible service at all .
neutral	sorry
neutral	amazon is a great place to find just about anything the only bad thing about the website is who your seller is and if they are legit .
neutral	i '_ve only , thankfully , had one bad_experience where i never received my product and the seller disappeared .
neutral	on the bright side , amazon came through and refunded my purchase .
neutral	other than that , if its fulfilled by amazon you ' re pretty_much insured .
neutral	great website to look for random trinkets .
neutral	it took 0 phone_calls to finally get the most efficient way to get my phone fixed .
neutral	the first person was foreign , hard to understand , and very unhelpful .
neutral	all he wanted was a copy of a receipt and kept telling_me the phone i had did not match the account , yet it was the same phone i purchased when i purchased squaretrade .
neutral	the second woman was very nice and tried to be helpful , but only offered me the option of drive an_hour and a half to get my phone fixed because they did not have my phone in stock .
neutral	so i told her i ' d wait .
neutral	finally , when i called back a third time , this woman offered me many options , that the others had not , including sending my phone away and replacing the screen at no cost .
neutral	so , i went head with that option .
neutral	the service was very quick for being across the country .
neutral	the fixed the screen and sent it back within 0 days .
neutral	i was very happy to get my phone back , until i realized they had reset my phone to factory settings , deleting all of my contacts , pictures , apps and notes .
neutral	they wiped my phone clear and i am still not sure why .
neutral	only the screen needed to be replaced .
neutral	needless to say , i was very upset when i found this out .
neutral	all in all , i think you get what you pay for .
neutral	this insurance is significantly_cheaper_than going through my service provider , however i think i now know why .
neutral	very happy to purchase an_alternative to the nespresso monopoly .
neutral	however , the packaging makes the capsules very bulky and the performance in my nespresso u machine was erratic .
neutral	sometimes the coff would flow slowly and other times it wouldn_'_t produce the correct quantity .
neutral	gave the capsules to a friend with an older machine and the same problems arose .
neutral	i wish you success in finding a formula that presents true competition .
neutral	i received my ink in a matter of days .
neutral	however , i had to clean the ink_cartridges in my printer several_times before they worked .
neutral	and they still have a line through them .
neutral	i '_ve cleaned my printer & gone_through all of the functions to align & set it up .
neutral	however , it seems to be a problem with the cartridge itself .
neutral	if using recycled ink_cartridges at home for random printing , it '_s not too bad .
neutral	but if this is for business or to print photos , you may want to consider buying a brand_new cartridge .
neutral	the screen i was sent had one pixel damaged .
neutral	i would like some_sort of credit or refund for screen_country sending me a screen that had a pixel damaged
neutral	as experienced divers we chose this product as a special birthday_present for a friend who has just taken up the sport .
neutral	it seemed to offer the best value for the most functions , has a clear face , easy to press buttons and is ideal for a novice diver .
neutral	however , when it arrived the box was rather ripped and battered and the computer was rolling round in the bottom of the box .
neutral	it had just been popped into a large jiffy_bag and had suffered the rigours of royal_mail .
neutral	of course this wouldn_'_t have mattered had it been for our personal use but i had to set about the box with sellotape , pritt stick and a blue felt pen to try to stop it looking like something i had picked_up at a car boot sale !
neutral	i bought a dress which was so cute but it didnt fit me .
neutral	i got my size and ith ouldnt fit my top half .
neutral	i was very disapointed
neutral	unfortunately the poor packaging meant that the goods turned_up damaged .
neutral	still usable , but not perfect .
neutral	as the damaged wouldn_'_t be seen i decided not to bother sending it back , but it was disappointing and could have been easily avoided .
neutral	plastic around the moses basked as very dirty so it looked like it had spent sometime in a dirty warehouse before being packed for shipping .
neutral	difficult to know if issue is with the retailer or the courier .
neutral	the blinds are good value for money , but it is a very much self service and can be difficult if you ' re not great at diy !
neutral	!
neutral	the visa_gift_card was not accepted in several places .
neutral	it '_s embarrassing to be denied when you try to use a card at a restaurant .
neutral	too many ' conditions ' surround the usage .
neutral	i would not purchase another of this type .
neutral	ordering the bathroom suit went well on saturday in the showroom till we got to the warehouse to find out the cistern for the toilet was in another warehouse that was closed , we found this frustrating but was advised to phone customer_services so we did on monday_morning and this sorted over the phone and delivered free the following_day , so in the end it was a good service , but when we were waiting in the warehouse one customer was kicking off because he had been waiting for an_hour dont blame him it was freezing_cold and he was stood looking at the item he wanted behind the yellow tape that he could not cross !
neutral	!
neutral	i have been using pet_flow for the last few_months and getting shipments from las_vegas .
neutral	my last shipment was shipped from new_jersey , making the arrival four days late .
neutral	i ran_out of food and had to purchase something equivalent at the local_pet_store and mix it with my remaining food to make it last .
neutral	i was very disappointed that the email that was sent to me saying the food was shipping next week would be coming from new_jersey to california .
neutral	if i had known , i would have called and had the food sent earlier .
neutral	i have ordered from pet_flow 0 times now .
neutral	they have good prices .
neutral	but at times the cans can be very dented and unusable .
neutral	i just ordered the 0_oz .
neutral	cans and they all were fine .
neutral	over the winter my ordered got delayed because of the weather but for some_reason fedex and ups both were able to get to my neighborhood just fine .
neutral	my order was delayed .
neutral	i was not happy at all .
neutral	you will get inundated with emails from pet_flow as well .
neutral	i will_continue to use pet_flow despite my experience only because we have moved and i no_longer live close to the pet_store i used .
neutral	only for convenience
neutral	i think i would purchase the t - shirt again but won_'_t know for sure until it is worn and washed a few more times .
neutral	i would not purchase the hat .
neutral	very cheap , ill fitting .
neutral	still_waiting for my part to arrive , 00 days today .
neutral	took me a few attempts to search for hotel / airfare packages .
neutral	checked my internet_connection and it was great .
neutral	after few attempts , i was able to book our nyc trip !!
neutral	yay !
neutral	!
neutral	my mom and i were visiting_london for the first time and were really looking_forward to seeing all the sights .
neutral	the ' hop - on , hop - off ' option for both the river_boat and buses that big_bus_tours provides seemed like an ideal option .
neutral	i booked our tickets online , but as we were tourists , i didn_'_t have a printer to print our confirmation .
neutral	i assumed that since i could book online and i got an_email with a confirmation code , that would be all i needed .
neutral	when we tried to board the river_boat near the london_eye , the associate in the office had no_idea what to do without a printed confirmation form and sent us across the river to another office that could deal with our reservation .
neutral	we trudged in the rain to the next office where we were told they couldn_'_t do anything for us and were directed to an internet cafe in the nearest tube station .
neutral	the internet cafe was closed and at this point , it was nearly 00 : 00 .
neutral	we decided to call it a day and i called big_bus_tours the next_day to get everything straightened_out .
neutral	i reached danielle in the big_bus_tours office who said that we could just go to the bus near waterloo station and she would work everything out with the tour_operator when we got there .
neutral	there was still a bit of confusion , but things did work out and danielle arranged it so we could still use both of the days we had paid for .
neutral	with the full - featured internet site that big_bus_tours has coupled with the fact that customers will likely be tourists who are without printers , it seems that making the process paperless should be a priority .
neutral	hello ,
neutral	i '_m french so it '_s difficult for me to explain me in english ...
neutral	i '_m always waiting for my two perfums ... where are they ??
neutral	?
neutral	thank_you for your answer ( in french of course !)
neutral	as i live in / france i have found that the exchange_rate give n by medicanimal is far higher_than is available - 0 . 0 %!!.
neutral	although postage is free i shall not be ordering anything in future .
neutral	i can '_t fault the service though .
neutral	the first problem i encountered was that you advised a different size to the one i ordered .
neutral	one of your operators told me that you didn_'_t do towel radiators in the sizes indicated on your ebay website , she said it was an_error .
neutral	i subsequently went to your online site ( ibathuk ) and found that you had one 000x000
neutral	( rt00t ) which i then ordered ( no problem ).
neutral	when it was delivered it was halfway out of the carton .
neutral	fortunately it wasn_'_t damaged and has now been installed .
neutral	despite the above , i am pleased with it , and hopefully no one else will be sidetracked by your operators giving wrong information .
neutral	i was trying to order custom sized filters on the website and couldn_'_t do it .
neutral	i '_ve ordered them before without a problem .
neutral	the blue bar that normally slides back and forth to pick the size wasn_'_t working .
neutral	first , i tried to do the live_chat .
neutral	it said i was " 0 " in line , but , after over 0 minutes no one chatted with me .
neutral	therefore , i called to try to order them by phone .
neutral	i tried_calling several_times on thurs .
neutral	0 / 00 and kept getting a message_saying they were closed .
neutral	i called again on fri . 0 / 00 .
neutral	i was placed on hold for 00_minutes ( my phone has a timer ) before a rep got on the phone .
neutral	when i did get a rep , she was very helpful .
neutral	she told me that the size i needed ( 00x00x0 ) was actually a " standard " size not custom as i thought .
neutral	therefore , i got back on the website and ordered it .
neutral	ordering a " stock " item online was easy .
neutral	i haven_'_t received the order yet , but , hopefully it will be shipped in a timely_manner .
neutral	i did get a confirmation right_away indicating the order was being_processed .
neutral	past experiences with this company have been fantastic so hopefully the issues last_week are just a fluke .
neutral	don_'_t try and book anything on line - you cannot do it .
neutral	first it was a wildly incorrect amount ($ 0000 to travel from durham to rdu ), that was corrected and now it asks for information that it not on the form ( your email ) or has_been done ( accept terms ).
neutral	the tour was ok and the guides were knowledgeable but we spent hours riding around trying to get back to our pickup point .
neutral	apparently the drop_off point on baker st . is not very popular .
neutral	we actually rode throught the same stops twice before we got back to baker_street and some of the guides were no help .
neutral	your street guides need a little more training .
neutral	the service was good and helpful when you spoke to the guys at the bus_stop , when we asked the driver if she stopped at hamleys ' yes ' was the reply , we never got there , we went round buckingham_palace , and two parks , two and half times , i said to my cousin ( she_lives in london )' r we nearly there ' ' we should be ' she replyed we went round and round again .
neutral	i asked the the bus driver and the reply was ' no the tourer has ended ' we never got the children to hamleys , we where on a bus for an_hour or so .
neutral	we still enjoyed our day .
neutral	villa_plus were a good company to deal with .
neutral	they had a good range of villas and the booking process was very straightforward .
neutral	the website could be improved , it '_s a bit clucky and was basic .
neutral	our only issue was the villa , it was fine but just okay .
neutral	the kitchen was very basically stocked in terms of crockery , utensils etc and there wasn_'_t even ovenware or baking trays meaning cooking anything more simple than pasta was a challenge .
neutral	also the beds were horrendous , we ended_up sleeping on the sofa as they were so uncomfortable .
neutral	we '_ve used lots of villa companies before and not had an_issue with either of these things before .
neutral	this would put me off booking again with villa_plus .
neutral	enough said .
neutral	nice piece of furniture , well made , well chosen wood but as a serious readers book case not very good as there is insufficient room between the shelves to accommodate even quite small books upright and many books have to be stored flat . the shelf heights are not adjustable
neutral	good service .
neutral	when the sofa and loveseat was delivered , i found it was stapled together .
neutral	not impressive .
neutral	i don_'_t think it '_s going to last past a couple of years .
neutral	have to admit i was disappointed in the quality of the furniture .
neutral	we didn_'_t get what .
neutral	we œ ordered .
neutral	we ordered a non heated mirror , received a heated mirror .
neutral	obviously the connectors didn_'_t match .
neutral	we had no choice but to put it okn because the vehicle was going out of town .
neutral	my order has not yet arrived , last time i ordered it was very quick in getting here .
neutral	thats is why i ordered from you this time .
neutral	i have received your confirmation that you have sent it .
neutral	my boyfriend and i stayed at the amber inn and it took us almost a half_hour to get checked in .
neutral	they couldn_'_t find our room reservation when we got there so i had to go back to my car to get my phone so i could show the lady the confirmation_email .
neutral	i showed her , she had me fill_out some papers , and told me our room wasn_'_t ready so we had to wait 00_minutes .
neutral	there should have been better communication between bookit . com and the amber inn so we didn_'_t have to wait so long for our room .
neutral	arrived when expected , good courteous courier , and proved to be a quality bag with lovely soft_leather .
neutral	just what was wanted .
neutral	shame about the poor packaging , though - the box the bag came in arrived so badly_damaged that even the courier took a photo of it to show the damage was there on delivery .
neutral	i guess the cloth bag might have given the bag a tiny amount of protection but no bubble - wrap or polystyrene chips or other protective wrapping and a box ripped_open at the seams did not bode well even if the contents were later found to be undamaged .
neutral	more by luck than judgement , i suspect and hopefully the golden boot will rectify this for the future .
neutral	meantime , beware !
neutral	i phoned iflorist to ask about quality as there are no reviews on the website itself , and to be sure the flowers ( for my sister '_s funeral ) would contain the number of roses as shown in the image as all three sizes offered have exactly the same picture .
neutral	yet rather_than 0 roses and lisianthus ( a beautiful mixture of white and purples ), the spray provided was of two roses , carnations and irises - pretty enough , and of an acceptable quality , but not what i had ordered .
neutral	flowers for special_occasions have to be right first time - there is no second chance .
neutral	processes were all fine - but the delivering florists let this down .
neutral	i was lured to petflow by a really great sale ( 0 - cent for pig_ears & duck_sticks ).
neutral	but i was only allowed to be 0 of each .
neutral	okay that '_s fair enough .
neutral	i bought a bunch of stuff to get the free_shipping .
neutral	i do not pay for shipping .
neutral	long_story short - there are many items i want to buy on your site .
neutral	get_rid of the minimum for free_shipping and i will buy them .
neutral	otherwise - it '_s amazon for me .
neutral	i was happy with the prices at merlin and the amount of time the package took to get to me .
neutral	what i wasn_'_t happy with the the method of delivery .
neutral	you have personally sign for the package or it won_'_t be left at your door .
neutral	i found this to be excptionally inconvinient .
neutral	it would be fine to offer this service , but the choice should be yours .
neutral	if you have a day job , odds are you '_ll be speinding your time and gas to go to the post_office to pick it up .
neutral	in reply to merlin_cycles
neutral	in america you can ship a package and have it tracked without_having to sign for it at the time of deliver .
neutral	i recently ordered 0 butterfly bushes and they arrived in beautiful condition .
neutral	for my second order i ordered 0 citronella plants .
neutral	when they arrived they were in a box two times larger than necessary .
neutral	none of they plants were in the pots .
neutral	they were still in the plastic but flung around the box .
neutral	the leaves on 0 of them are all brown and i doubt they will grow .
neutral	i '_ve planted them and 0 look fine but the other 0 are all wilted and brown .
neutral	after the first order , i '_m really disappointed and not sure if i '_ll order from you again .
neutral	i have enjoyed ur products but i bought an indian meal which you advertised as tapas , two for £_00 .
neutral	unfortunately i got to the resteraunt and was told it was not tapas , but simply a meal and that wowcher had . mistakenly posted the wrong_address .
neutral	i was very dissapointed in this and emailed wowcher .
neutral	i got no reply which in my opinion was very poor customer_service .
neutral	this has made me much more cautioud when purchasing .
neutral	great offers , customer care very helpful !
neutral	but problems with deliveries taking very long or on 0 occasions not being delivered till a dispute was opened
neutral	i paid for the bouquet to be enlarged and to me this was not done .
neutral	the flowers themselves were lovely and so was the vase there was just not enough flowers for what i paid for .
neutral	we bought salmon and halibut from this company because it came highly rated by dr . andrew weil .
neutral	we knew the fish would arrive frozen and from past experience with frozen seafood , we knew the taste was often compromised .
neutral	but because of dr . weil '_s recommendation , we thought it was worth a try , that maybe some new technology had been developed to improve the flavor .
neutral	but alas , it is not so !
neutral	the fish was dry and tasted like cardboard .
neutral	we won_'_t be buying anything_else from this company .
neutral	i do love the fact that you guys sell just about everything !
neutral	all under 00_bucks .
neutral	i have ordered quite a few_times from you guys .
neutral	my book came in the week as_promised but my disappointment was when i opened the book and found the first page was double printed .
neutral	after a phone_call and given a voucher_code to reorder for free to get this put right .
neutral	much again disappointment when this did not work after several_attempts and more phone_calls .
neutral	i then started emailing ( gino ) and after many emails the only way the problem could be resolved was to reorder and pay again .
neutral	i agreed to this and was of course reimbursed , thankfully .
neutral	the book was received by my daughter at long last with great joy .
neutral	thanks
neutral	some of the food tastes quite awful , anything with minced beef for instance tastes dreadful .
neutral	it tastes very processed and unnatural .
neutral	when i placed my order , there was no_indication that the ostomy product i selected was backordered .
neutral	i was notified 0 days_later that the major item i ordered was backordered with no specific date that the item would be available .
neutral	the item actually did ship and arrived 00 days after i placed the order -- but in the meantime , i was very worried and ordered from another company so that i had stock available in case the order did not arrive for several weeks .
neutral	ostomy_supplies are like medicine -- they are necessary for life for people who depend upon them .
neutral	if they are not immediately available , the ordering system needs to let_me know .
neutral	i was very disappointing that i purchased a all_inclusive vacation but when we got to cancun we found that we had no transportation to our hotel so we had to pay another $_00 to get to our hotel and another $_00 to return to the airport .
neutral	the contact at our hotel was terrible and of zero help .
neutral	then we ended_up having to pay $_00 in luggage for our return trip .
neutral	i have never been on a all_inclusive that these things were not included .
neutral	i will be taking apple vacations from now on .
neutral	book our 0 night_stay , but when we arrived there was no copy of our pre_- paid reservation .
neutral	luckily the resort could accommodate us though we had to wait an_hour for them to find us a room .
neutral	resort took my credit_card info and told me if the reservation didn_'_t go thru by the end of my stay , we would be charged again for our room .
neutral	i don_'_t know what happened .
neutral	the mobility aid which was pictured as straight was delivered to my disabled friend folded in half , she was unable to straighten it , and unfortunately , she thought she would be unable to use the item , having explained this to customer_service , they saidt " that as it would probably be more costly to be returned than the value of th e value of the item motto worry " my money was returned the same day ., thank_you .
neutral	perhaps it would have been helpful to mention that the item would be delivered folded in half
neutral	i had an item sent to a friend thinking it would help her ,
neutral	unfortunately the item was delivered folded in half , having been displayed as straight .
neutral	my friend was unable to straighten it fully & unfortunately she decided it would not be of aid to her .
neutral	having spoken to customer_service they advised her not to send the item back as it '_s .
neutral	value was less_than the cost of returning .
neutral	my money was returned the same day , thank_you
neutral	but a warning could be printed advising that an item would not e sent out as shown
neutral	i purchased from moddeals a total of 0 times , the first time was a flawless and fast transaction .
neutral	i received my items super_fast and in perfect_condition .
neutral	so of course , i decided to order again when they were having a sale - i even considered doing a youtube haul video of their service and the items i bought from them .
neutral	the second time i bought a pair of flats and then two extra add on items since i was going to pay for shipping anyway ( the add on items were a pair of earrings and nail_polish ).
neutral	everything went fine and i paid via_paypal , when the package came i was surprised at how light it was and thought to myself " okay , maybe the flats are just really lightweight ?
neutral	"- wrong !
neutral	when i opened my package all i received were the two add on items , which made absolutely no sense to me .
neutral	i checked online to see if they had given me a refund since i thought maybe the item was out of stock and they would give me store credit or refund me without telling_me ?
neutral	that didn_'_t happen either .
neutral	i checked the invoice and the item was packaged in with the shipment .
neutral	unfortunately it wasn_'_t and i was left with two add on items and i was not willing to pay the flat_rate shipping for two items that cost less_than shipping itself .
neutral	i emailed moddeals about the issue and left them a message on facebook they called my house phone ( no email reply ) when i wasn_'_t home but i didn_'_t get a chance to call back since their hours of operation are inconvenient for my busy_schedule .
neutral	next_day , they directly refunded the cost of the shoes and shipping to my paypal .
neutral	i never received a reply via_email or facebook , nor did i receive an_apology or explanation .
neutral	so to wrap it up , i won_'_t be shopping with moddeals again , did they take_care of it ?
neutral	yes ... but i think they should have at_least apologized and told me what happened .
neutral	if it was a mistake and they let_me know it was a mistake , i would have been able to forgive them and continue to buy items from them .
neutral	to this day , i have no_idea what happened and received no apology .
neutral	i '_m now loyal to a similar online website that sells clothes at a much more discounted price and i '_m happy promoting them without_any compensation because they run a courteous business and actually care about their customers .
neutral	i won_'_t be saying anything nice about moddeals anytime_soon .
neutral	i need to return a faulty item and in all fairness gearzap have been helpful by telling_me to click on a link to view their returns_policy .
neutral	unfortunately the link does not open so at this present time i am unable to return the faulty goods .
neutral	first attempt to complete information did not go through .
neutral	billing stated $_00 and change told me to try again yet this time billing stated $_00 . 00 .
neutral	confused about why the difference ?
neutral	i have bought quite a number of wowchers and find the rewards of sharing to get a little something back in the form of wowcher credits really fab up until a few_weeks_ago when everything has_been tailored to hardly anything and sometimes now when i share or email an offer i do not receive wowcher credits even_though when i have done this in the past quite a few people have bought because of me sharing so just think its unfair that they have done this , i know i won_'_t be buying as many deals as i have been
neutral	it maybe a slight thing to complain_about but i find the wowcher credits a good idea and a slight compensation especially when a wowcher i buy has_been really bad ie_: the swan pan set absolutely_ridiculous buy they were didn_'_t last 0 minutes and when i bought a dinner set and 0 of the cups were broken on arrival
neutral	but other than this a fab service when you ring them although slow on replying to emails
neutral	i love all the clothes yesstyle has to offer ( so many cute ones !
neutral	), but i hate playing the waiting game when i unknowingly order something that isn_'_t technically in stock .
neutral	i '_ve seen " waiting in stock " in my account for weeks , and i know there '_s a possibility that my order will be cancelled ( this has happened to me before ).
neutral	this experience has killed my desire to order anything_else from yesstyle for a while , despite having my eye on a few items .
neutral	i don_'_t want to be entirely negative , though .
neutral	i made another order a few_months_ago that went_smoothly , and i was very happy with my purchase !
neutral	i won_'_t use priceline again .
neutral	all three of my latest stays were disappointing .
neutral	from check - in foul - ups to rude desk managers , to a lack of " truth in advertising ", to overpricing for what one received , to finding the same room for significantly_less after booking the " express deal "-- 00 - 00_%_off !"
neutral	at priceline , each trip was an exercise in frustration .
neutral	i tried the name your own price several_times and was never accepted unless i bid a lot more !
neutral	none of the places i went were worth the money i had to spend .
neutral	nope .
neutral	not again will i be_fooled .
neutral	unfortunately .
neutral	was very disappointed in item i ordered was far smaller_than we thought it would be .
neutral	no wall chart or exercise manual so unsure how or what to do with the straps to excerscise the arms or positions for feet and body on the plate
neutral	the service was fantastic , it arrived when it said it was going to and they emailed me to keep me updated with what was happening .
neutral	but the massage_table i bought i '_m not convinced about .
neutral	firstly it came with no instructions and although these things are self_explanatory it would be good just to check i was doing things right .
neutral	i '_m disappointed with the arm rest attachment as there is no reasonable place to put it and its not obvious where to put it , i am upset about that .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t of needed it so desperately i probably would have sent it back .
neutral	i had to go to the site three_times : 0 ) froze 0 ) had to enter info twice and still didn_'_t go through 0 ) finally worked .
neutral	fairly straight_forward transaction .
neutral	only issue was that we ordered mercedes or similar and ended_up with hyundai !
neutral	they didn_'_t have any mercedes for us to rent at the time of our arrival .
neutral	makes me wonder what the purpose of a reservation is ?
neutral	got the extra super cover insurance which was very good indeed to give us peace of mind .
neutral	we ended_up using the cover as we had some minor scrapes on the side of the car .
neutral	otherwise , besides from the type of car , transaction was smooth and easy .
neutral	ny order was dispatched very quickly however the quality of some of the furniture pieces did not reflect the price i paid ...... even_though the items were reduced due to a sale price .
neutral	the on - line booking is easy but when i rang cruise_republic they did not wish to help me and directed me back to the website .
neutral	one girl was helpful but others i spoke to did not wish to do anything and i felt they knew little about the boat .
neutral	first order arrived damaged and cracked , we paid £_00 for delivery for next_day , when i rang to say i needed a replacement i was told i had to wait two more days , after complaining they agree to deliver me one the next_day , no refund was offered to me for my next_day delivery charges and i also was told i had to dispose of their broken cistern , on the whole not a good service , i will not be buying from this co again .
neutral	i bought 0 swim vests for my grandchildren .
neutral	they came on time and were priced great , work great for flotation but the speedo logo on the back had wet paint and bled into the vest when used .
neutral	i initially thought communication was good as i received a couple of email regarding my order , 0 of which asked if they had the correct address for me or if i had an_alternative i ' d like to supply .
neutral	i supplied the alternative address immediately as i realised i wouldn_'_t be at home on the day of delivery .
neutral	unfortunately the item was shipped to the first address & not the alternative i had supplied ( as requested ).
neutral	i was not home & my neighbour was just leaving the house , she advised the delivery driver she could not take delivery of the item as she was in a rush .
neutral	the driver then signed for the item himself & left the package on my neighbours drive in heavy rain !
neutral	item arrived ok but packaging was so soaked through that it came apart when i picked it up !
neutral	overall item was good but customer_service was false as it seems messages were automatically generated but nobody attended to them & delivery company were poor !
neutral	selling my old_phones on this site seemed a doddle , and it was ... until they stated that my blackberry was faulty .
neutral	this was funny , since i checked it before i sent it and it worked_perfectly ?!
neutral	as it is they offer you less_than you would get elsewhere , even ebay , but seem disinclined to give you what it is worth .
neutral	i stuck with them for sake of ease anyway but won_'_t be using them next time .
neutral	it was only a small bunch flowers , i choose the big edition - so i was disappointed , i expected more value flower for this high price - asked the company in two mails and did not get an answer
neutral	this dress is very badly fitted .
neutral	having read_reviews i bought a size_bigger but the arms were ridiculously small while with no give in the fabric .
neutral	i had the sleeves altered .
neutral	i don_'_t like that the credit alerts don_'_t have the name of the bank or store and there is no phone_number i can call without calling identity_guard .
neutral	when i called identity_guard on sunday the only option was if i had a lost or stolen card or wallet so i hung_up and waited to call on monday .
neutral	i would like to talk to a human after hours .
neutral	i am going to look into another company .
neutral	actual shipping with the usps would have been $ 0 . 00 for two ounces .
neutral	i was charged $ 0 . 00 for shipping .
neutral	if the company charged for the actual shipping cost it wouldn_'_t have felt_like i got ripped_off .
neutral	i wanted to buy more than one without_any to : or from : you cant order generic cards
neutral	the flowers were beautiful , i was disappointed with the vase , and the florist sent a text the day before to tell her they would be delivered , i was hoping for a big surprise when they arrived ....... that was killed .
neutral	buyer caveat .
neutral	the company is ok .
neutral	i received the parts fairly quick .
neutral	however , i made the mistake of buying the wrong part , so whether it is their error or yours , you are hit with shipping_charges to send back as well as a 00_% re - stocking_fee for return of the part if the error is yours .
neutral	a phone_call would have saved me a lot .
neutral	bottom_line , shop around for the best deal and read the fine_print .
neutral	i was looking for underwater headphones .
neutral	after searching online this site came up and i thought i ' d give the a try .
neutral	their prices were good .
neutral	shipping normal .
neutral	i haven_'_t received them yet .
neutral	i '_m hoping all works out great so i could give them and excellent report .
neutral	i phoned up to renew policy as my payment_method was not being accepted for automatic_renewal .
neutral	communication from sales_rep was appalling .
neutral	i was treated as if it was my fault you were no_longer accepting laser payments .
neutral	this is the first time i have not been notified by vital_choice about shipping and i did not receive the full order .
neutral	easy to order and delivery guys were really helpful .
neutral	follow_up call starts off very friendly and we '_ll cover your items etc etc then the hard_sell on insurance cover and not happy when i refused to give bank_details and saying i did not want the cover , would use appliance direct again but would be ready for the follow_up call which does let them down .
neutral	very slow shipping .
neutral	no tracking_number
neutral	the company said they would email when out of stock items were available - but they did not .
neutral	i had to follow_up on my own to re order .
neutral	one item is still out of stock with no_explanation .
neutral	why can '_t they post something on the site or send an_email ?
neutral	also to redeem points or utilize a coupon , a separate order & shipment are required .
neutral	this is a nuisance for me & probably costs the company more than it should to process & ship !
neutral	i await your response .
neutral	adrienne nadler
neutral	well i have made few orders before and i had to return them .
neutral	firstly when i got the bag it was dirty and stained even_though it was in packaging !!!
neutral	so i returned it .
neutral	now i made a biiig order and gues what .... one of the dresses was stained again ... it felt and smelled like it came from werehouse where it got stained ...
neutral	i found few patches of brown wet staines ...
neutral	i just dont understand like why is this happening ...
neutral	i didnt even_bother returning it because thay was one dress that was better qualitythen the others that i ordered .
neutral	i washed it and yhen worn it .
neutral	i have to say that i am purely dissapointed ... and i think that i will now only ever buy cheap jewellery from you ... at_least it will be worth it .
neutral	i ordered a replacement_mirror for my car and was sent the wrong part . i '_m still_waiting for a return_authorization #. i mean i only ordered 0 part pretty hard 0 screw - up right ?
neutral	? anyway i guess you get what you pay for good prices but bad service ..
neutral	i purchased a voucher for £_00 . 00 (£ 00 . 00 usual price ) i also paid £ 0 . 00 for a deluxe bouquet .
neutral	although the recipient was pleased , i was disappointed with the size and amount of flowers - it looked like a £_00 . 00 bouquet !
neutral	i buy flowers from tesco and i just thought the discount made no difference at all .
neutral	confirmation texts were very good .
neutral	i was expecting my chair to be delivered on fri 00th_july .
neutral	it did not come and since the delivery slot ended at 0pm and the customer_service dept closed at 0pm there was no hope of doing anything about it .
neutral	i rang on saturday_morning but the couriers were not available until monday .
neutral	i received a phone_call at 0 . 00am on monday telling_me that it was out for delivery that day , but again , a time_slot of between_0am and 0pm .
neutral	so i had to wait in another day as it did not arrive until 0pm .
neutral	i do not understand_why the driver could not have notified me that he was unable to fulfil his delivery .
neutral	he apparently had my telephone_number .
neutral	as for the chair itself , my daughter and i managed to put it together with no difficulty and i am very pleased with it .
neutral	something needs to be done about the lack of communication between couriers and first furniture and their suppliers .
neutral	we received our garden furniture which is great but the delivery was a little frustrating as you get no flexibility at all on times and dates .
neutral	this was my first time using stressfree_parking and i have to say first_impressions were very disappointing .
neutral	i called the allotted 00_minutes ahead of time and was told my driver would be waiting .
neutral	he wasn_'_t .
neutral	i tried_calling the number specified , it was not answered and i was left circling gatwick passenger drop_off for 00_minutes .
neutral	eventually the driver appeared and was very apologetic saying he had been dropped_off at the south terminal , even_though the booking stated this was for the north_terminal .
neutral	i am very pleased to report that the return pick_up was much smoother so i can only assume this was a one of blip and i will try this again because i have heard very positive things from friends and family .
neutral	have ordered a few_times ... last one was frustrating as needed the items in a timely_fashion
neutral	after many phone_calls found out over one week_later items had not even been shipped out .
neutral	i had to call the vendor to find out what was going on and get the situation resolved which was rather strange .... as that is main_faucet '_s job to deal with thier vendors not mine .
neutral	also ended_up cancelling the other part of the order as that vendor was not shipping out for several weeks and needed the items for an inspection .
neutral	also need to get some screws missing from a previous order .
neutral	i was thrilled to find hombz and see the great price for the keurig coffee system .
neutral	i began to place an order and had trouble with the website .
neutral	in error , i placed two orders and immediately sent a message that i had done so .
neutral	i was told the second one would be cancelled .
neutral	i have since received a confirmation of shipment for two pots .
neutral	i have emailed the site a number of times to be sure that one was cancelled as_promised .
neutral	they have not responded .
neutral	while their prices are great , their communication is not .
neutral	i have also called twice and never received a call back .
neutral	i would like to do further business with them , however , i am concerned_about the fact that they are difficult to communicate with .
neutral	when checking into the hotel the clerk asked for my driver '_s license and my credit_card .
neutral	very normal process .
neutral	however , my ears heard a click clack as the clerk made an image of my credit_card onto a sheet of paper she then asked me to sign .
neutral	i asked where this paper would be stored , she indicated a file folder just behind her at the counter .
neutral	this folder was in clear access to all clerks with a copy machine just behind them if they were inclined to take the credit_card information .
neutral	the manager said they kept the document on file for at_least six_months !!!!!
neutral	i work with pos credit_cards and based on what i know - they are not in compliance with acceptable processes .
neutral	they need to get more modernized to enable them to swipe the card for electronic storage ( like that is 000_% safe anymore !).
neutral	i will now have to watch my credit_card statement forever !
neutral	the manager was worried that she would need the information if in case someone stole towels ( some of which were ragged ), bed linens ( really !
neutral	), or other room items .
neutral	made me wonder about her clientel .
neutral	dispite my above concern - our overall stay was comfortable , the room was clean , staff was helpful .
neutral	they could use a new set of fresh towels and purge the ragged ones !
neutral	prompt delivery .
neutral	both packages of the 0 lb .
neutral	royal_canin special 00 arrived in good shape .
neutral	only one thing concerned me on the expiration_date ... 0 / 00 / 0000 .
neutral	only 0 . 0 months shelf_life .
neutral	this is far shorter_than products at other pet_stores .
neutral	maybe this is why they were on sale .
neutral	if petflow can offer longer ( one - year ) expiration_dates , this plan will be more attractive .
neutral	i received a confirmation_email and was told i would receive a shipping email , but didn_'_t .
neutral	when i sent an_email inquiring_about a tracking_# for $_000 worth of gift_cards , i received no reply .
neutral	not the internet shopping_experience i '_m used to .
neutral	i sent a book in that i was selling which i had paid around $_000 . 00 and they decide not purchase the book due to the books condition .
neutral	so instead of offering to send back to me ( at my cost ) they destroyed the book because it was soiled and / or stained .
neutral	not very happy could have donated it to my sons school .
neutral	i was highly disappointed in the hotel experience and would not recommend the tropicana to anyone .
neutral	checked into a dirty room , never had enough people on staff to have a short wait to ask a question to get assistance , the concierge was unhelpful , etc .
neutral	the maids didn_'_t follow the leaving the towels on the floor means to change it and hanging up leave it alone .
neutral	there was no consistency from day to day .
neutral	never got to try out the pool as it got closed due to strong winds .
neutral	the flight was good and the purchase on the site went_smoothly .
neutral	experience was good , very easy to get a quote but experiences very slow payment after promptly sending off my goods .
neutral	i expected to have the order delivered by now ... but so_far it hasn_'_t been so i am giving a so so rating since i have to rate it before i can submit this .
neutral	the best thing i ordered was the massaging shower strap .
neutral	i liked it so much that i had my brother that was visiting try it and he wanted one to .
neutral	he took my catalog home to place an order on a few things he liked my husband is using the wound honey on a problem area he has .
neutral	i had 0 lamps that were hard to turn on and are much_better with the lamp switch turners .
neutral	the toast tongs are very handy .
neutral	the items purchased were as_described .
neutral	shipping was slow and packaging was horrible .
neutral	i have two storage_units that i rent .
neutral	i found out last_week that one was going up to 00 . 00 .
neutral	i just got the unit last october .
neutral	why is it going up already ?
neutral	if i had not called to ask another question about the unit , i would not have known the price was going up .
neutral	i did not receive a notice or anything .
neutral	this is not good business_practice .
neutral	we got our hotel , i guess it will be ok , we were supposed to get transfers car , boat , and taxi to the hotel villa defines , i paid $_000 , per person , which i now realize is $_00 too much .
neutral	on top of that , i don_'_t have any confirmation to show bd travel when i get there .
neutral	joni
neutral	it is very discourging when i place an order and an item is out of stock or no_longer available .
neutral	these items should no be on your web_site or state out of stock .
neutral	the order i just received i had to call because i did not get my entire order due to out of stock or discontinued items .
neutral	i was never notified prior yo shipment and i really wanted these items .
neutral	your customer_service needs to improve .
neutral	the hotel provides a simple & comfortable one bed_dorm .
neutral	room is clean & nice with the necessary basic needs .
neutral	it is a convenient location for me to take my tour the next_day .
neutral	toilets were also clean & maintained .
neutral	the items i received were of ok quality for what they were .
neutral	however , they did not fit my children .
neutral	when i went to return them , the restocking fees are outrageous !!!
neutral	i have blocked the site so i don_'_t accidently order from them again .
neutral	i value all of my internet stores , this one however will not be getting anymore of my business .
neutral	i absolutely_adore the clothes and shoes .
neutral	they are so fun and beautiful .
neutral	however , the service can be better .
neutral	shipping takes too long ; what i mean by that is that there are times where i '_ve waited 0_weeks with complaint .
neutral	if i '_m paying $_00 -$_00 in standard shipping , i ' d like to receive my products within 0 business days .
neutral	also , amiclubwear should deliver the correct sizes .
neutral	not to mention , they should list model measurements for more accurate sizes .
neutral	i ' d hate to purchase a small and it fits like a large , or purchase a large and it fits like a small .
neutral	sometimes , the shoe_sizes either run too large or too small and it '_s not noted on the site .
neutral	better service and measurements would be nice .
neutral	i was shocked that travelocity charged me more for having them save my information and frequent_flyer numbers .
neutral	i looked up the ticket and then decided to create an account so i could purchase the ticket .
neutral	once everything was finished , it was $_000 more than when i saw the ticket 00_minutes earlier .
neutral	i went back in to find a ticket again and the price went down .
neutral	i don_'_t know why they charge extra when they save your information .
neutral	then when i went to print off the boarding_passes for the flight home , it only let_me print the first boarding_pass and not the connection pass .
neutral	i think i will go through the airlines directly next time .
neutral	the wedge cushion is just what i needed for playing the viola on a plastic seat at rehearsal - thank_you !
neutral	the neck rest does not really do the job for making my stiff neck more comfy on a plane .
neutral	i sit in the aisle as i have long legs and would have preferred it to be symmetrical .
neutral	i think this would be ok for leaning against the window but it is not good for sitting in the aisle .
neutral	delivery excellent and quick .
neutral	just signed_up hope they help me
neutral	the prices really are fantastic compared to a lot of the other_places i looked for similar products .
neutral	i was really disappointed when i received all my items jam packed into a small box and saw how cheap they all looked but i guess you really do get what you pay for .
neutral	when we got to the holiday_inn we found out one of the restaurants was closed no stocked bar no room service and even_though we were all_inclusive you still had to pay for most things .
neutral	the bar didn_'_t open till 00 and closed at 00 !
neutral	i had paid for my entire trip in advance and without asking they put a hold of 000 on my credit_card which still has not been released !
neutral	every time we walked by the front_desk they were arguing with guests !
neutral	overall the deliver of item and quality of item are fine with a few notes of disappointment .
neutral	i don_'_t know who designed the hat but for a woman the " one size fits all concept was pretty riduculous and the hat was enormous .
neutral	it fit my foot ball player boyfriends head perfectly .
neutral	i '_ll need to wear a large hair clip to get it hold on my head properly .
neutral	the costume belt isn_'_t really a belt .
neutral	i couldn_'_t help but notice how the model '_s hand is strategically placed to hold the belt in place in the picture .
neutral	there is no prong or loop and i don_'_t plan to walk around the party with my hand on my waist to keep it in place so i '_ll need to find a real belt to complete the look or not .
neutral	so the included belt is pretty useless .
neutral	there is not enough friction in the belt fabric to keep it in place .
neutral	the ribbon tie is also pretty long so there is the option to trim it if needed to shorten it up on the corset style top .
neutral	i was somewhat disappointed in the purchase of the snugg for my new google nexus 0 .
neutral	i was expecting it to have more than two stand positions so you adjust the angle based on what you were doing .
neutral	the case does fit nice and snugg around the device and the velcro to hold it in the case is a nice feature .
neutral	now , as far as service goes , when i ordered the snugg , i understood that it was a pre_- order , but the website stated that it would be shipped on january 00 , 0000 .
neutral	mine wasn_'_t shipped until january 00st .
neutral	i also expected to receive confirmation that the product had shipped along with a tracking_number so that i could track the package and know when to expect it .
neutral	it took me three emails to finally get the information that i requested in the first email .
neutral	customer_service kept sending me confirmation of my order and not the tracking_information that i requested .
neutral	i now have my snugg and look_forward to at_least the protection it will offer to my google nexus 0 .
neutral	my biggest recommendation for the company would be , be careful what information you give out as far as shipping dates and also make_sure your customer_service representatives respond to the questions they are being asked in emails .
neutral	something you might want to consider adding to your website is an order tracking option so people like me can track their orders online without_having to send numerous_emails to get the information .
neutral	called today to explain_why i am less_than 000_percent satisfied and now i am even less satisfied .
neutral	why should i be inconvenienced with taking photographs because of your poor quality .
neutral	the only_reason i gave 0_stars is because i have only used my product once and it hasn_'_t turned_out like i have read on the site .
neutral	there has_been no friction , so i think the wording of the stars might be a little off .
neutral	i purchased the thunder_shirt as i have a dog that is terrified of storms .
neutral	she constantly paces , pants , scratches and searches for places to hide with no luck .
neutral	we '_ve only had the one storm and she was really good with letting_me put it on her , but it just didn_'_t work for her like i was hoping .
neutral	but , i am not giving up yet .
neutral	i will_continue to put this on her when we have storms and hopefully after a few_times it will begin to work for her .
neutral	gosh i '_m hoping because she can drive you crazy !!!!
neutral	i received my purchase very quickly and it looks just like the picture so i '_m pleased with that .
neutral	now if it will only work .
neutral	i '_m keeping my fingers_crossed .
neutral	my order arrived before it was due , great !
neutral	i ordered a set of four cartridges of an epson workforce pinter .
neutral	i am replacing them as needed , the cyan and magenta worked great , the yellow failed , the printer rejected it .
neutral	i haven_'_t tried the black yet .
neutral	these cartridges were " own brand ", you didn_'_t offer epson brand in the xl size .
neutral	i bought 0 dresses .
neutral	i usually wear a medium_size , so i ordered one in a medium , but then the second one made me nervous that it might be too short so i ordered a large .
neutral	the large ended_up fitting perfectly and the medium was so small i couldn_'_t even get the dress on my body !
neutral	can '_t wear it :(
neutral	usually when renting a book its used gently .
neutral	i was shocked when i got by book and it was taped together and missing the cover .
neutral	long shipping times and some bad quality items .
neutral	my total order was $_00 and its costing $_00 to ship .
neutral	my trainer referred me to your site and i needed the bands right_away .
neutral	when i need to purchase again , i will try to shop around for a more reasonable shipping charge .
neutral	i love the products but hate the prices .
neutral	i order them as a treat , for me and for christmas_gifts .
neutral	shipment arrived yesterday and many of the items were damaged .
neutral	i couldn_'_t be_happier with the product , seriously , but the time between ordering and receiving the product was much too long , and makes me afraid to order from you again .
neutral	i love the hundreds of designs to choose from .
neutral	when buying a dozen cards at a time for christmas ( nieces and nephews ), it '_s important to me to give each person a card that is different from the others and one that matches their personality .
neutral	however , after selecting a card and adding it to the cart , i had to start my search all over again from page 0 and there were 00 or so pages of christmas designs .
neutral	needless to say , i was very frustrated !
neutral	if you want to order one card or a bunch of the same card , the site would be ok .
neutral	but when buying a lot of cards with different designs , it '_s very time_consuming and frustrating to remember which page you left off on .
neutral	you also cannot navigate to the last page you were on , you have to start from the beginning and advance page by page .
neutral	even_though i was frustrated and it took me much longer to place my order , i am happy with the extensive design selection , the personalization and the quickness of receiving my order .
neutral	if they can change the site to make it more user_friendly by allowing me to " continue shopping " and take me back to the last page viewed or allow me to select a page from a drop down menu , then i ' d be 000_% satisfied !
neutral	lovely net_curtain but it cost me more to get it delivered and i had to sign for a curtain that was only worth a few_pounds
neutral	when i trcieved my order i was really excited .
neutral	the jeans i ordered was perfect .
neutral	i loved them .
neutral	the tops i ordered and the leggins i ordered eran small so i am having to return them .
neutral	i wish the tops came in a larger side so i can wear them .
neutral	the tops were a little thin i thought so you would have to wear a top under them .
neutral	ordered sunday_evening for a night out the following friday , thinking there was plenty of time for delivery .
neutral	it came at 0 . 00pm friday .
neutral	i was starting to get panicky as had nothing else to wear and had waited in all day on the friday aswell .
neutral	wasn_'_t happy .
neutral	won_'_t be using again
neutral	some of the games are really good .
neutral	i wish they would offer a ad free paid version but not a monthly one , just one off payments .
neutral	the ads seem to glitch up the games , , margrave manor won_'_t load for me now and i have uninstalled and reinstalled it knows who i am and has saved all my game play the main game just wont load .
neutral	i am playing the chronicals of albian now its very good but the ads definately glitch it up , they always seem to coincide with the puzzles and once the ads start you lose the puzzle and therefore the bonus money and frankly you need it to do that place up .
neutral	otherwise tip_top .
neutral	particularly enjoyed the sherlock holmes one .
neutral	my nespresso_machine has gotten harder and harder to use .
neutral	i am afraid i have ruined it by using fine_coffee club capsules that don_'_t quite fit .
neutral	i should have known better .
neutral	the money i saved on the coffee at fine_coffee club won_'_t pay for my new nespresso_machine .
neutral	i was penny wise and pound foolish on this one .
neutral	jag ser att mitt visa - kort har belastats med 000_kr den 00 juli .
neutral	vad är det ?
neutral	vid bokningen framgick att ingen avgift för kortbetalning skulle tas ut .
neutral	vad gäller de 000_kr för tjänst ?
neutral	tacksam för svar till min e_- mail : carin . thysell @ telia . com
neutral	har inte sett att själva flygresan belastat mitt konto .
neutral	är allt ok med bokningen ?
neutral	mvh karintysell
neutral	the product , a fabric cot organiser , was fine , very good price compared to other online_retailers for the same brand .
neutral	however , this saving was somewhat marred by the expensive p_& p rate to northern_ireland .
neutral	i thought that it would at_least arrive quickly but despite the postage which would have been sufficient to pay for 0 - 0 days delivery , the item took 0 days to arrive .
neutral	very disappointing since other online_retailers are able to provide free and speedy_delivery to ni e . g .
neutral	amazon .
neutral	my only_complaint about this experience was the long wait to recieve the car .
neutral	we stood in line , with only 0 people working the front_desk for over an_hour to recieve our car .
neutral	i didn_'_t think it would be so long considering we reserved the car a head of time .
neutral	also the woman at the front_desk was not very friendly or helpful .
neutral	once we were finished with her our experience was much_better .
neutral	the car was great , and driving it was a breeze .
neutral	love the sight but exchance to euro was far to expensive spent £_00 and was charged €_00_euro not impressed rate was €_00 wish i could pay in sterling then it would be great value
neutral	last time i order 0 or 0 items i dont remember well , but only end up getting 0 of them because after i order you guys run_out of inventory .
neutral	its not fair , you stayed with the money which i just used , but it was disappointing to order so many items to end up with only 0 :(.
neutral	i hope this time i can get everything i ordered and as soon as possible , my dad is coming to cr in 00 days , if my things don_'_t arrive on the estimated_date i won_'_t get my stuff :(
neutral	hello .
neutral	when i ordered the new panel i sent a email_saying that we had not had the other one that long only from dec 0000 .
neutral	i got a email back from raymond and he told me to take a photo and email to him .
neutral	since then raymond as sent me a couple of emails since but the way he had worded it is seemed to be very rude of him . so we are not happy because of him .
neutral	plus we ordered ivory 000 cover and we got the old one which just has triton on the front but it does not matter it fits and works .
neutral	i think that some staff need customer care training i could give this firm a bad name because of him but i will wait to hear from him as i sent him the old cover so he could see it for himself
neutral	took out insurance with d / away when i booked car as per usual
neutral	then was urged at europcar dept at coolangatta to take out cover with them as well
neutral	because it was an early start we were tired - had no access to emails with us and i could not check whether i had indeed taken out insurance prior ..( not sure why anyone would not ) i merrily accepted insurance with eurpcar !!
neutral	!
neutral	got to my accommodation and thought to clal d / a who said ofcours eu took insurance with us !!
neutral	it was ending up being another $_000 , of which i had already paid $_000 to d / away .
neutral	so started calling europecar branch to tell them the story and i needed refunding - they wanted me to drive back to coolangatta from byron bay as it was a legal document id signed
neutral	basically to cut a long_story short - got them to fax it all and did it hat way but not before a big fuss was made , manger involved etc !!
neutral	think driveaway need to know that europcar are asking customers to take insurance over and above the d / a insurance they '_ve already taken out !!!
neutral	bit of bad practice !
neutral	!
neutral	delivery was prompter than i expected , which was great .
neutral	but the website told me i ' d be receiving a free ole henriksen micro peel with my order - this never materialised which was disappointing .
neutral	you are very prompt , but after you cancelled one of my orders i found out this morning you just sent it .
neutral	last night after realizing the order for christ
neutral	mas were not going to make it in time i placed another order .
neutral	also , when you call trying to confirm a order a person doesn_'_t always have a pen in hand to get the info needed to verify the order .
neutral	i '_m sure i got at_least 0 call to verify .
neutral	after a while i wasn_'_t sure what i was verifying .
neutral	i was actually happy when you said you had cancelled the order .
neutral	there should be another way to handle a situation like this .
neutral	now what do i do with christmas visa_cards after christmas ?
neutral	for four days i tried to buy a gift_card and the website was clearly not working .
neutral	it took three phone_calls to finally find a person that was willing to go that one step further and really help .
neutral	then i had to spend time online and on the phone with two it people while they tried to help me figure_out the problem .
neutral	in the end i gave my credit_card information verbally on the phone and ordered the card that way .
neutral	by now it was less_than a week away from christmas so i had to pay for overnight shipping but was told this would be credited_back to me after the sale when through .
neutral	i still don_'_t know if that happened as i haven_'_t looked at my bank_statement but i did get the gift_card in time .
neutral	will tell hearing friends can phone rentify if they need look for rents .
neutral	the merchandi was awesome ; however , we were told the turn_around time between ordering and receiving our merchandise was 00 days .
neutral	it was 00 days before it shipped and another several days before it arrived .
neutral	slightly disapointed with some of the photos because heads etc were cut of which made the photos look a bit odd .
neutral	so i thought i had the perfect way to order my pet '_s food with petflow -- i loved the fact that i could get my prescription food from them , and if i ordered more than $_00 then shipping was free ( which i usually order at_least greater than $_00 at a time ).
neutral	well , the first shipment went fantastic , but when it came time for the second , they said they had problems with royal_canin not having the food available ( which i called royal_canin and they said there was plenty of it available , and what petflow was telling_me was untrue ).
neutral	so they said they were going to cancel my automatic_shipment .
neutral	so i had to call my vet and have them special order the food ( my vet doesn_'_t carry the one the cat needs to be on ), which they did .
neutral	so i bought the food at the vet , and then not 0 or 0 days_later , what shows up at my door ?
neutral	the food i ordered from petflow .
neutral	so now i have four bags of cat_food as_opposed to 0 .
neutral	it remains to be seen whether they are actually going to cancel future orders , or if there was just a huge mix up .
neutral	but very annoying situation .
neutral	no problem with ordering but shipping through fedex needs to change .
neutral	we live in arkansas the shipment tracked frm california to memphis , tn to mississippi and then back to arkansas - it took 0 days - way too long .
neutral	my box was left by my front_door .
neutral	never a problem with that .
neutral	however , the dog_treats inside were wrapped in their original wrapping , which had holes in them .
neutral	when i opened the box inside , millions of ants came out of the box , running all over my kitchen counter .
neutral	i would suggest placing dog snacks inside a zip - lock bag so this doesn_'_t happen .
neutral	i had also purchased a rug which was covered in ants .
neutral	it was a nightmare , really .
neutral	i cannot think that it was my computer , but i could not get through with my purchase from homebase on line , it kept jamming up .
neutral	eventually i made the order via my kindle .
neutral	clothes are good and prices but put off with delivery and time it took to find out the problem and where my order was .
neutral	inventory not precise ; notified book was sold out after it was purchased .
neutral	i trusted you .
neutral	great new range of products thought they were available - ordered and then you could only deliver one of the items i ordered - you offered an_alternative but it wasn_'_t what i wanted .
neutral	went to one of your competitors who could supply both new products cheaper_than yours - at the end of it just a bit disappointed as i couldnt cancel with you and i could buy one item from them .
neutral	will look hard before using you again - wish you could put it right !
neutral	paid for a gift_card but never received it so i called and was told i called too late ( still technically open , called 00_min before closing ) finally got my gift_card but the promotion had ended so i called back again and still wouldn_'_t honor the promotion .
neutral	not impresses with their customer_service !
neutral	i wish the app had more flexibility to filter for specific features and addressess .
neutral	i ordered 0 sacks ( 00_lb .
neutral	bags ) of dog_food .
neutral	the shipment came in two boxes - one sack in its own box and two sacks in another box .
neutral	the box with one sack inside was delivered in fine shape .
neutral	the box that held the two sacks was totally opened but the product was in good shape since " taste of the wild " dry_dog_food is packaged in such durable bags .
neutral	i will order from petflow . com .
neutral	ordered the jacket saturday before_xmas_eve and didn_'_t expect
neutral	to receive it before_xmas but , received it 0 working days_later .
neutral	only problem was the courier company .
neutral	parcel was attempted delivery to my work address and was undelivered because there was no one to sign for the parcel ?
neutral	tried to contact the courier company which was all automated and was quite frustrated at not being_able to speak to someone .
neutral	anyway , i arrange redelivery on the automated_system for the next_day .
neutral	parcel was delivered next_day .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	usually happy with the parts and price when i order but always hesitant until it all comes in the mail .
neutral	reading customer reviews makes most people nervous because of their return_policies ( suck )!
neutral	from what i '_ve read of customer reviews , as long as they get the order correct , all '_s good , but if they get it wrong , the customer suffers costs and major time delays / phone hassle '_s because of their " no fault " policies .
neutral	it seems , even when they ( partsgeek ) screw up , the customer is in for loss of funds and hell getting partsgeek to rectify the order .
neutral	horrible customer_service from what i '_ve read of customer reviews makes me think_twice before placing my order with them or getting elsewhere !
neutral	i was disatisfied with the response to my question as to why i did not get the 00_%_discount advertised for new on going orders . i have a standing order for 0 dog and was initating a new standing delivery for a new dog and a different food and they declined to discount my inital order . i then cancelled this new dog '_s standing delivery . they seemed unconcerned with the loss of this order .
neutral	i ordered stuff last_week , money went out , not had goods yet , hopefully tomorrow .
neutral	they did try and give me a free gift to say sorry .
neutral	i wait patiently !
neutral	check in was smooth and front_desk staff very pleasant and helpful .
neutral	room just didn_'_t feel clean .
neutral	also a little stuffy .
neutral	road_noise from the interstate was manageable with the window closed , but super loud with the window opened even a little_bit .
neutral	the worst part was the paper thin walls .
neutral	my neighbor on one side decided to watch a movie at 00 :_00am ... i think it was an " adult " film .
neutral	woke me out of a sound sleep .
neutral	the next night i got to hear the guy on the other side making a real_estate deal ... for 0 hours .
neutral	the hotels in deerfield fill quickly , so make your reservations in advance and avoid this hotel .
neutral	well i had my whole tripped booked and then it would not confirm .
neutral	i called the 000 number and said i would be helped .
neutral	after resisting starting from the beginning and letting her do it over the phone , i gave in and t ended_up costing me $_000 more for the same trip because the airline prices went up ( after over an_hour on the phone ).
neutral	i ended_up canceling trip and booking another later on .
neutral	as the item is a gift i have just seen it in the wrapping but it looks okay .
neutral	however , the packaging was awful .
neutral	it came in a g star box that would have been nice to give the t shirt in .
neutral	there was no extra wrapping just the box which had been torn and ripped back on the corner exposing the tissue_paper inside .
neutral	at first i thought the shirt had been removed but it was still there and luckily okay .
neutral	i feel that g star should take more trouble with their packaging or have a word with their couriers as i was disappointed to receive this broken and ripped box .
neutral	commentators were nice and got to see most of london '_s landmarks .
neutral	but in the blue line the recorded commentry wasn_'_t working .
neutral	good selection of products , however delivery took_ages .
neutral	was very had to contact amazon , but overall not a bad_experience .
neutral	will be buying from ebay again in the future .
neutral	the website was easy to maneuver however the wait time to recieve the product is a bit long and the return_policy is for only product that is returned unopened .
neutral	they don_'_t seem to have anything such as a 00 day replacement policy if broken within that time .
neutral	and that lack makes it a bit risky to buy since the necklaces can be a bit pricy depending_on your budget .
neutral	i ordered a gasket set the price was good but just dissappointed that one of the gaskets were the wrong one .
neutral	took_awhile to get the parts as well .
neutral	i ordered blue_buffalo dog_food from petbest . com because that website had the lowest_price and because the shipping was free .
neutral	however , i had to sign_up for delivery every so many weeks and what i don_'_t know is what the price will be when the next bag arrives .
neutral	the jury is still out on whether this was a good deal or not .
neutral	also , the dog_food took a long time to arrive , over a week with no updates and i went out and purchased a small bag to fill in until the 00_pound_bag arrived .
neutral	now , i know what to expect in terms of timing , but the real proof will be on the second and third deliveries and the billing ..
neutral	fast shipping , but book has extensive water_damage that was not stated in the description of the book .
neutral	oldies .
neutral	com has a lot of old movies to chose from .
neutral	its a good thing not to order a new release , because by the time you get the movie , it will be an oldie but goodie !
neutral	i had an bad_experience during my first and second purchase .... late response !
neutral	i was in the market for a new pair of sunglasses and shopped_around a little .
neutral	vision_direct was a third cheaper_than a big sunglass chain in out local mall .
neutral	i chose to buy through them because i thought they were australian based , and paid $_00 for express shipping .
neutral	my sunglasses arrived after two_weeks from hong_kong .
neutral	it was in great condition very carefully_packed and the lens cleaner you get with it is very handy .
neutral	the only question mark i have is that the receipt i got from them did not match the price i paid , instead it came in u $ and even then was much_cheaper_than what i paid .
neutral	so if this is something you want to claim back from somewhere you might have to follow_up on that .
neutral	nice place to get personalized credit_cards and discounted_gift_cards , but the design search_feature does not work very well .
neutral	i also wanted the cards shipped to my work so i could sign for them , but my charge card has my home address .
neutral	this sight would not allow me to do this and immediately cancelled the order .
neutral	so the hour i spent shopping and designing cards was totally gone .
neutral	no second chance , no warning , just cancelled .
neutral	the customer_service agent was no help in figuring_out why the order was cancelled .
neutral	so i tried again with a tiny change in my address .
neutral	cancelled again .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	so thought third times a charm .... changed to have it shipped to my home address .
neutral	not a good choice since no one is home when they deliver mail , so they will leave a note that says i need to go to the post_office ( which is also only open when i work ) to pick_up the package .
neutral	every other place i have ordered from delivers to my business address , no questions_asked .
neutral	such a huge_variety of products .
neutral	although a little over priced .
neutral	i called a few_times , the first time i called the lady was rude and not very helpful .
neutral	so i called back to see if the next person would be the same way she was ok but wasn_'_t really helpful .
neutral	i called back for a 0rd time and that person was very friendly and very helpful .
neutral	great prices , fast service !
neutral	but , they gave my email address out so that my spam box was overflowing before i ever got the part !
neutral	i really hate that !
neutral	the first person i spoke with told me that if i consolidated my loans i could get a new interest_rate of 0 %.
neutral	after filing paperwork , handing_over all of my personal information ( which i hate to do in the first place ), pay my first payment of $_000 , i then recieve a follow_up call that walks me through the application_process .
neutral	first of all , i was under the impression that i was paying them to fill_out all of the forms for me .
neutral	second , when we went through it my interest_rate would now be 0 . 00 %!
neutral	absolutely_ridiculous !
neutral	now i have to wait for a follow_up call to cancel this program and get my money back .
neutral	overall , a real waste of time and energy .
neutral	ok , i just received a phone_call from kevin rice from national_debt_relief , within 00_minutes of posting this review .
neutral	i '_m really impressed with the follow_up and his genuine concern for my unfortunate experience .
neutral	this is the service i originally expected from using their service .
neutral	i was able to give him feedback that i hope will make everyone else '_s experience better .
neutral	two_thumbs_up to kevin rice and his care for the organization .
neutral	he assured_me that i would be fully refunded , quickly .
neutral	thank_you !
neutral	the " toy " i ordered was so small , my cat wouldn_'_t even look at it and the food she turned her nose up at .
neutral	however , she does love the catnip ball .
neutral	overall , i did not get my moneys worth .
neutral	i have ordered in the past and was satisfied .
neutral	great selection and prices but shipping was too slow :(
neutral	i found the ordering process and being kept_informed top_class and would recommend .
neutral	the price was good but what i appreciated was being_able to pick a delivery slot ( and a saturday too ) that was the decision making factor into buying with ao .
neutral	the only_downside thus_far was the delivery .
neutral	i ' d put on my order that the only way into our house is up a number of steps .
neutral	i ' d spoken and email customers services again to make that point .
neutral	we then got a very , very grumpy response from the delivery_men .
neutral	my husband helped them with getting the oven into the house and fortunately for them and us - although i ' d paid to have our old oven removed , we ' d actually had it removed by someone earlier in the day so they didn_'_t have that to contend with .
neutral	i do understand we were the last delivery in a long day .
neutral	however the access to our house was no secret and hence this grumpy attitude wasn_'_t really appreciated .
neutral	i '_m just glad i didn_'_t ask them to unpack it too !
neutral	prices are on the high side for some items .
neutral	try amazon , esp .
neutral	if you can get free_shipping .
neutral	north_shore deliveries have always been prompt .
neutral	i like petbest but i did not receive the quality of service i expected .
neutral	i ordered two bags of dog_food and one bag was not what i ordered .
neutral	love the room .
neutral	last_minute booking on a spur of the moment girls get away .
neutral	paid in full to find out there was an_additional 000 fee when i checked in for cleaning & insurance !
neutral	i will not book again , hotels clean the rooms without fees !
neutral	i loved the idea of making a personalized_visa_card for a friend who was getting_married , and that one came within a couple of days of ordering and was a big_hit .
neutral	unfortunately , the other gift_card i ordered never arrived .
neutral	what arrived instead was a gift_card for someone_else .
neutral	clearly , our orders were mixed up .
neutral	i called customer_service and was asked to destroy the errant gift_card , which i did .
neutral	despite my reservations , i accepted her suggestion of waiting to see if the card i actually ordered would arrive .
neutral	it did not , and the event for which it was ordered , a first communion , passed without it .
neutral	i called back to report this and was offered a refund .
neutral	i asked for the card to be reissued instead , but was told that to do that , i had to reorder , then call customer_service for what would amount to another refund .
neutral	too much work !!
neutral	i accepted the refund and ordered a gift_card from another site for my niece '_s belated gift .
neutral	what it boils down to is : this was my first and last giftcards . com order .
neutral	i '_ve ordered from this site three_times now .
neutral	the first time , i was ordering for a contest i was doing , and ordered around 00 discounted cards to give out as prizes .
neutral	i received approximately 000 confirmation emails - a glitch in the system .
neutral	i called about 0_weeks_later to check on the delivery and was told they had been sent .
neutral	then got a call a few_days_later saying they didn_'_t have a few of the cards in stock , so they were refunding the difference - obviously , the order had not been sent !
neutral	i asked to have the shipping expedited given this was now almost 0_weeks since ordering , i eventually got to someone_who said they would .
neutral	i got the order a week or so later - via standard mail .
neutral	it was not expedited .
neutral	second order was much smaller as i was understandably concerned after the first experience .
neutral	though i did get everything i ordered , it took close to 0_weeks to get it via regular mail .
neutral	though snail_mail is slow , it '_s not that slow .
neutral	they sat on the order too long before shipping it out .
neutral	third order was even smaller - one card ... but that one arrived in about a week with no_issues !
neutral	i know you can pay to expedite shipping , but i think a week is an appropriate amount of time for the free standard shipping , and if you ' re trying to save_money by purchasing discounted cards , paying for shipping is counter productive .
neutral	i think the idea of a gift_card that people can add to online is great but i have a few criticisms .
neutral	why do you ask people to go to the trouble to write a message on the card and then not print it on the card ?
neutral	when the card came to me blank and i called and i was told it was not your policy to print personal messages on the card .
neutral	also , why is the mailing so expensive ?
neutral	$ 0 for " regular " mail that you say takes 0 to 00 days .
neutral	it never takes that long for my regular mail .
neutral	i paid $_00 to get the card in 0 or 0 days .
neutral	that '_s too steep for me .
neutral	some of my donors said they couldn_'_t get onto the website .
neutral	i ordered my book last_week monday and it is now tuesday the following week and still no book !
neutral	hopefully it gets here tomorrow as i really needed it yesterday .
neutral	i understand shipping may take long , but i git an_email_confirmation last tuesday that the item had shipped , but then why is it not here then ?
neutral	i usually get my orders from amazon a lot quicker even if it says 0 - 00 days .
neutral	they seem to be 0 or less days for shipping time .
neutral	found villa to be just what we wanted and needed , know the area well ,
neutral	cleaner very nice , there was some renovations taking place next door , and next but one , found the noise loud and there was some_sort of smell that was awful , and sore on the eyes .
neutral	know this is unavoidable , but wonted to tell you .
neutral	the pool is odd shape so when i asked for size , was little disappointed when got there , but being heated was a bonus .
neutral	did not go at all as_promised over the phone .
neutral	the manager at the storage_unit finally showed_up and worked things out but not at all in the way i was led to believe .
neutral	would not go this route again .
neutral	sparefoot needs to get their facts straight before they mislead customers over the phone .
neutral	shipping was slow but products were great and exactly how they appeared in picture !
neutral	i '_m a happy customer .
neutral	a good price for reasonable cover but despite them having all my medical records , this being the 0rd year i have used them they subjected me to lengthy and repetitive questioning over the phone which i found upsetting and unnecessary .
neutral	i have been losing_weight after my second baby so e0p has_been a god_send for me .
neutral	i have been able to get nice tops that fit me at each_stage of my weight_loss without_breaking the bank .
neutral	however the sizing on trousers is so_far off , i bought a pair of size 00s a while back and since then i have dropped to a slim size 00 and the trousers are still nowhere_near buttoning up !
neutral	the leg length is always long so for me ( 0 " 0 ) even with heels they are too long and i think that should be mentioned in the description .
neutral	shoes are also a little on the small fitting side .
neutral	postage is good , orders come quickly and tracking them is excellent .
neutral	another thing worth_mentioning is the quality is great - especially for the price about 00_% of the time , you will get some items that will fall_apart after a few washes or lose their shape .
neutral	for me thats not a problem as i am replacing with smaller clothes anyway after a couple of months but if your weight is stable you wont get long_term use from the clothes .
neutral	i was a bit_confused purchasing this gift_card , as it is supposed to be for jose tejas and when the card previewed it was a discover card ... did not have jose tejas on it .
neutral	as i have not yet received the card , i cannot respond on time_frame .
neutral	( card was ordered 00 - 00 - 00 )
neutral	i have ordered in the past , before you had the other company call for the prescriptions , with out a problem .
neutral	this order was a mess .
neutral	i drove 00_miles to my vets to find out what the problem was .
neutral	my vet faxed the prescription on april 0th and april 0th .
neutral	i saw the confirmations that the faxes went through .
neutral	but vet works ( or whatever their name is ) kept saying that my vet said i was not a client of theirs .
neutral	i have 0 animals there .
neutral	after a week we finally got it taken_care of after several phones calls and emails and of course me driving to the vets to see if they were messing it up .
neutral	i am very hesitant to place another order through pet_flow .
neutral	flyers hebben een_goede_kwaliteit ; er is snel contact gelegd als het formaat aangepast dient te worden .
neutral	levering met dhl zorgde voor enkele problemen , maar drukland heeft het positief opgelost .
neutral	everything is high end and over priced .
neutral	the uggs are cheaper at norstroms .
neutral	they have very nice things but since they dont have an english option , makes it hard to know what your buying and how much .
neutral	american consumers would jump on that if they could read what it was .
neutral	makes doing anything impossible .
neutral	is incomaptible with my school and what they allow to upload .
neutral	if u wanna upgrade you mac it cost just as much as a new notebook from dell , that comes with all the programing you need
neutral	this was my first purchase on petflow . com .
neutral	i wanted my order shipped to my son in another_state .
neutral	i paid for the order and clearly put in a different ship to address .
neutral	it seemed to take_forever so i started to track the order .
neutral	not only did it take_forever , but it was shipped to my address so i now have to ship it again , at my expense out to his address , across the country .
neutral	not a very good first experience .
neutral	my room had already been rented and was locked from the inside then switched to another room and someone came in my room when i was sleeping
neutral	shipping cost extremely high
neutral	i ordered the lion mask .
neutral	it is huge and doesn_'_t even come close to fitting my face .
neutral	i will have to alter it and do some cutting on it .
neutral	i wasn_'_t expecting it to be wonderful , but was dissapointed in the size .
neutral	my last order was , unfortunately , very disappointing .
neutral	of the three garments i ordered only 0 is entirely satisfactory .
neutral	the two jumpers which i ordered in m / l are nowhere_near that , the more accurate sizing would have been s / m and i prefer jumpers to be bigger rather_than smaller .
neutral	i usually wash everything before i wear them in a delicate cycle with woolite .
neutral	unfortunately one of the jumpers , which appears to be a diffirent cotton than the other showed a lot of bobbling when i took it out of the machine .
neutral	having received my lenses promptly i was keen to put them into use straight_away .
neutral	however they were very difficult due to flimsy materials .
neutral	they kept turning inside out , and attatching to my fingers instead of my eyes .
neutral	i have given up for now but will try again later .
neutral	my eyes are now very sore and bloodshot .
neutral	i accidentally ordered two of the same part .
neutral	customer_service was contacted twice regarding the return of one item .
neutral	i never_heard back from the company
neutral	i love this product but i feel there should be a discount for ordering bulk and that it should be packed better when shipped .
neutral	on this order i receive 0 cracked cases and the last order i purchased i received 0 cracked cases and hope to get this resolved with the company .
neutral	our translator provided only basic translation of the subject matter .
neutral	luckily we had many mandarin speakers in the audience who were able to understand the speaker directly and also provide clarification where crucial details were left out of the translation .
neutral	after the first day ( we had booked for 0 - days ) our speaker went over the subject matter with the translator again , but at the following two talks ( different audiences , same topic ) the translation continued to be very basic .
neutral	this was not overly critical for our purposes as many people had a basic to fluent knowledge of chinese , but it is something to be aware of .
neutral	additionally , by the end of the three_days , the translator was providing answers to questions from third_parties directly based on points raised during previous meetings / presentations .
neutral	as a non_- expert on the issues , i did not think this was appropriate and asked her to translate the questions to the speaker directly .
neutral	the table is lovely and very well made .
neutral	i ordered online as this is more convenient for me and i received 0 phone_calls on the same day regarding my order .
neutral	if i ' d wanted wax or warranty i would have added it to my order myself .
neutral	also i was given the option online of express delivery at a cost of 00 . 00 which i did not opt for as was in no rush .
neutral	the first date for the express delivery was 0th sept which was the day it was delivered on anyway free of charge .
neutral	this is obviously a way to get more money out of you !
neutral	an easy to use website with a number of weekly offers .
neutral	if only the ' free gifts ' weren_'_t so small !
neutral	pretty good prices , but not sure what they mean by fast shipping .
neutral	placed my order on wednesday_evening and it wasn_'_t even shipped until friday_afternoon .
neutral	ups says it '_s not scheduled to be delivered until wednesday .
neutral	i signed_up for auto_ship , but if this is a sign of how slow they are i may cancel , just so i don_'_t have to worry_about it .
neutral	i was ordering from another . com company who '_s delivery was 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i switched to chewy '_s because the prices were a bit better .
neutral	i was told to expect an_email when it shipped ... none arrived .
neutral	i would use you again if updates were part of the service
neutral	good clothes and didn_'_t take long to come but one item was out of stock so i didn_'_t get it
neutral	the collar itself is not bad but my dog only weighs 0 lbs and the collar is too wide and bulky for him .
neutral	it would be nice to have a thinner version of the collar for smaller dogs .
neutral	i was attracted to this site because the ads draw you in , the clothes are high fashion and on trend .
neutral	however i have ordered a few items around 0 now and half of the items i have had to send back , quality is not great .
neutral	photos look good !
neutral	item isn_'_t as good as you would expect .
neutral	i also wasn_'_t impressed with customer_service ( no phone_number , just emails ) i have had to send many emails too .
neutral	00 days to get a refund is not good if you are not happy with an item or the item is faulty !!
neutral	i won_'_t be using them again as it is too long_winded and too stressful .
neutral	sorry for negative_feedback , on a positive , i do like your clothes in the photos though !
neutral	costume looked great and was everything we were promised .
neutral	two issues : no email_confirmation or shipment confirmation .
neutral	expensive shipping .
neutral	my main complaint is with the website .
neutral	i can never find the means to search for a specific show .
neutral	" find event " doesn_'_t help .
neutral	i don_'_t want to have to scroll_through a bunch of shows i have no interest in .
neutral	in the interest of being even - handed , i will also say that getting tickets through goldstar is very reliable and easy , which is much_appreciated .
neutral	after_researching , i '_m sure i read i can update my credit_report and score on a daily_basis .
neutral	now it appears i can only update my report / score once a month .
neutral	that '_s disappointing .
neutral	that was the main draw to identity_guard since i am in the market currently for a mortgage loan .
neutral	waiting 00 days is too long for an update .
neutral	i was considering canceling another credit service i use , but maybe not now !
neutral	i loved the dress that i ordered but was not very pleased with the fact that i did not recieve an_email letting_me know that the jacket i also order was out of stock .
neutral	it would have been nice to be notified that everything i ordered would not be coming .
neutral	otherwise i like all the products and shipping time is excellent .
neutral	when i first called to order my pool i spoke with a customer_service representative named ann .
neutral	( ask for her if you '_ve never ordered a pool before .)
neutral	she was kind , courteous and very helpful .
neutral	we found that the pool was dented at the top ( this must have occurred during shipping ) and opted to fix it ourselves rather_than return it .
neutral	after we installed the pool liner we noticed a small_hole in the liner .
neutral	tears form by pulling on the liner too hard during installation , not a small_hole .
neutral	we were told to send an emailed photo to familypoolfun . com but the owner of the company declined to send us a new one and offered to send me another for $_000 . 00 another customer_service rep told me i could buy a patch kit from them but i declined because i was worried because the pool was new and i wanted a perfectly good liner .
neutral	we decided to order another liner ( heavier grade and less money from another company .)
neutral	they do offer rebates and freebies -- mine was a $_000 . 00 rebate , an automatic pool_cleaner and free gas , but there are forms that must be filled out precisely and mailed to them .
neutral	they don_'_t just send them to you automatically .
neutral	be sure you send your rebate paper ( to any company ) with some kind of tracking because i was initially told my rebate did not arrive but they did find it and send it to me .
neutral	i also received my automatic cleaner ( so glad )-- but be sure you are careful with sending everything with delivery confirmation to be sure they receive it .
neutral	my pool is running fine and i '_m pleased with the things i ordered to set it up correctly .
neutral	most of this is due to the excellent pre_- pool order help i received from ann , the customer_service representative .
neutral	i wish i could give you a higher rating , but many_times on note cards and especially on tote bags , the color shown on the screen for both my art and your background color varies greatly from what i get in the finished_product .
neutral	i know screen colors can '_t always be exactly matched , but i '_ve had a variance that is just way too much .
neutral	i placed an order which took over a month to arrive at my door .
neutral	some of the items were cancelled due to the fact that they were out of stock .
neutral	i love the selection on the website .
neutral	they ' re not what you would see in any mall in us , and the fact that they sell asian_clothing is appealing to me since i am asian myself ( and i '_m into these styles of clothing ) the price is another downfall for this website especially for low - income people such as students in this economy .
neutral	they ' re not outrageously expensive , but they ' re not cheap either .
neutral	what keeps me coming_back to this website is the seemingly infinite selection of clothing , makeup , and accessories .
neutral	i would order once in a blue moon , not frequently
neutral	would i recommend this site ?
neutral	maybe .
neutral	only for people with patience and money .
neutral	in short :
neutral	pros
neutral	- huge_selection of all things fashion / makeup / etc
neutral	- high definition ( not fuzzy ) pictures
neutral	- most items have a variety of pictures
neutral	- good customer_service
neutral	- many things on sale ( mostly 00_%_off .. as far as i can tell )
neutral	- these kinds of clothing are what i would love to wear
neutral	- free_shipping with minimum purchase
neutral	cons
neutral	- price is a bit high ...
neutral	- shipping is on the slow end ...
neutral	i don_'_t think it should have taken a whole month to receive what i ordered
neutral	- you might get a little headache because they have so many things .. but maybe that is a good thing (;
neutral	the female assistant at this location does not communicate very well .
neutral	i was very shocked when they told me my balance for my repairs .
neutral	she never broke_down the cost of all the service .
neutral	may not use this store again after being a long time user .
neutral	i will recommend a friend to buy a dress on this web_site .
neutral	boxes got wet after a rain storm and collapsed , with everything on top !
neutral	!
neutral	i used diamond parking meet & greet service at_gatwick .
neutral	the service was good , and very reasonably_priced .
neutral	it was irritating to arrive at the dartford crossing late on sunday_night on our return from a weeks skiing to find the pound coins we had ( foolishly ?)
neutral	left in a closed compartment had vanished .
neutral	i have used stress_free parking several_times before , and probably will do so again .
neutral	after waiting 00 days for my dog harness / collars , they finally arrived - but were delivered to the wrong house .
neutral	i had to track them down .
neutral	as i was trying them on my dogs , one of the collars broke - and there is no return information .
neutral	not sure i will be shopping at petflow again any time soon .
neutral	i would '_ve rated you a 0 , but after i got the coupon , i felt duped and overcharged and now i wish you would honor the coupon and credit me the 00_%.
neutral	following my review , the issue was reviewed and resolved .
neutral	a full_refund has_been promised and i '_m very satisfied with this response .
neutral	thank_you , cdkeys .
neutral	very easy to sign_up to multitrip however i missed the area where it asked for health insurance so i paid an extra €_00 , when i emailed multitrip to confirm my healthcare number and tell them i expected the €_00 refund they never responded !!
neutral	lets just say when the insurance is up next year i wont be renewing with them !
neutral	very confusing how to figure_out how to use your process
neutral	well , my son has large feet and after traipsing_around numerous shops he found that the only shoes that suit him are the ones i paid for at ... whatever the shop is called ... can '_t remember the name .
neutral	so , bought two_pairs and spent enough to not pay postage , but then got an_email to say only one pair in stock ( get it right , that '_s such a nuisance ) so i agreed to buy them because the poor lad can feel the ground through his shoes .... then got stung for £ 0 p_& p .
neutral	that '_s a bit mean , not my fault you didn_'_t have two_pairs and i thought i shouldn_'_t have been charged it .
neutral	but there you go , it doesn_'_t encourage loyalty ,.
neutral	the big_bus_tour overall was fine , but i had several negative experiences .
neutral	0 .
neutral	looking for a stop to board the bus for the first time , i ended_up walking about an_hour , using the free route map as my guide to find a stop to hop on .
neutral	unfortunatly , the stops are not well marked and consist of a red or blue dot on a regular city bus sign .
neutral	i had no_idea that this is what i was looking for -- i assumed the stops would have more obvious markings -- and wasted a lot of time .
neutral	more specific descriptions and instructions on the map would be really helpful .
neutral	0 .
neutral	my first ride , when i finally found the bus to board , was the blue line with the recorded_tour .
neutral	i plugged in my headset and sat in silence for about 00 + minutes , thinking it was a long break between updates but finally realizing that the headphone connection at my seat was broken .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i got left behind at the end of the day when i was standing at a crowded stop ( several tour lines , etc_.).
neutral	the last big_bus of the day stopped , someone at the front of the crowd spoke briefly to the driver , then the driver pulled away before i could get past the crowd .
neutral	i had to pay 00_pounds for a taxi back to my hotel .
neutral	the staff was friendly and knowledgable about space and the right fit .
neutral	am_currently battling with ring worm with one of my horses so ordered some imaverol to treat this .
neutral	animed '_s price was fractionally cheaper_than other online providers and included postage .
neutral	product arrived in good time - there was a small problem with the packaging and the post_office had repacked it in a plastic container as animed '_s packing had come apart .
neutral	the bottle was intact , however ,
neutral	una amiga mía tuvo una operación .
neutral	envié las flores al hospital pero nunca llegaron .
neutral	contacté algunas veces por internet a floraqueen y pasaba días sin oír nada .
neutral	por fin me contactó pero ella ya estaba en casa .
neutral	la compañía envió las flores a su casa y por fin llegaron pero muy tarde .
neutral	me alegro que a lo menos corrija el error por fin .
neutral	the first week was fabulous !
neutral	i lost 00_pounds !!
neutral	ya !
neutral	until you eat normal food ( still watching what i ate ) then by monday you have gained all back but 0 - 0 pounds ... then the meals get worse , the veggies are always overcooked and mushy ... puke !
neutral	the other thing that really makes your stomach turn is they over use cumin .
neutral	eww nasty and you just cant take it by week three .
neutral	at this point you have finally lost the rest of the weight but now don_'_t loose any more and you throw at_least half your meal in the garbage .
neutral	if you decide to do this program ...
neutral	choose the seven day and hopefully they will lay off the cumin and stop over cooking their veggies !
neutral	i bought brainchild vitamins and minerals .
neutral	i realized after i ordered , i actually paid $ 0 more on pure_formulas for each bottle .
neutral	even with
neutral	free_shipping i still paid $ 0 more than i had ordering straight from brainchild and paying shipping .
neutral	i was able to find all the books i needed for school on this website for a reasonable price ( great !)
neutral	and my order was processed quickly ( doubly great !)
neutral	however ... school has already started and its been over two_weeks and i haven_'_t received my books .
neutral	i was able to shoot an_email to customer_service and was answered ina timely_matter about my order but when i '_m told my books will get to me 0 - 00 business days it ' d be nice to stay true to that !
neutral	hi ,
neutral	i find your website clear and easy to use and you have a large product range .
neutral	i like that you include delivery in the price to avoid confusion about final cost .
neutral	the delivery should have been before 0pm next_day , however it didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	i had to chase up , got an apologetic email and parcel arrived the following working day .
neutral	phew !
neutral	that was christmas_eve ...
neutral	yes will recommend to others and would use again - not at last_minute though ...
neutral	this is a wonderful product and it is easy to check balances and activate cards ; however , i had to make the cards several_times because ( despite the fact that i was logged in ) my cart failed to save .
neutral	in addition all of the cards were mailed separately , this meant that i paid 00 different shipping and handling_fees when i would have rather paid one and had them all shipped together in one envelope .
neutral	i picked_up my car in florence , the service left something to be desired , total disinterest and a long wait time , 00_minutes for the paper_work and 00_minutes for the car to actually arrive .
neutral	car was upgraded dont want to seem ungrateful but i actually wanted a small car .
neutral	us customers should be aware of new law in italy that requires snow chains on board between november and april if you go out of city center .
neutral	rental_agency does have notice , well hidden and in small_print , there is a fine for the driver for not having chains .
neutral	there are actually checks on motorway entrances , result you need to spend extra 00_euro for this pleasure , which is not refundable even if they are unused and the agency will not make you aware of this requirement , they told me that it was my responsability to know the law !
neutral	drop_off was equally unimpressive not easy because there is no garage at this agency and the street is very narrow with no parking space ,
neutral	staff were disinterested , bearing on rude .
neutral	however price when prepaid is very competitive , car was not cleaned before collection , should mention that i speak fluent italian so could probably make my point better_than the average tourist .
neutral	i have experienced long delivery times each time but now we are at 0 days to cross 0 states .
neutral	i would think there is a better way .
neutral	i use many forums with free_shipping and they are very quick .
neutral	i order the same dog_food every_month and every_month there is a different total .
neutral	my experience with opticfast was frustrating .
neutral	i bought from opticfast through another_vendor .
neutral	the vendor apparently gave_me an erroneous shipping date .
neutral	due to this my item did not arrived in time for my daughter '_s 00st_birthday .
neutral	i was very pleased with my product from opticfast when it did finally arrive .
neutral	would like the invoice to detail amount charged per day and not just total for full term .
neutral	useful when using part business part personal .
neutral	we were very frustrated by the time it took to get a bus .
neutral	we arrived at marble_arch and went to the publicity bus that stands there .
neutral	the member of staff took our printout and issues our tickets and then told us which stop to go to .
neutral	so_far so good but we stood there for over half an_hour and when a blue bus eventually came it was going the wrong way and the driver told us we were at the wrong stop !
neutral	marble_arch is not easy to negotiate as a pedestrian so we had to go all the way under the underpass to get to the other side by after another 00_minutes we finally got on the bus we needed .
neutral	this experience made us very sceptical_about the ease of " hopping on and off " so we didn_'_t - we stayed on for the full 0 and a half hours .
neutral	once on it was good - we had a spanish visitor with us and it was brilliant as a way of her seeing loads on her only day in london .
neutral	the recorded_commentary is however not that up to date - no mention whatsoever of the shard even when sitting right by it and westminster_abbey mentioned for the funeral of princess diana but no mention of will and kate '_s wedding - leading us to conclude that the commentary has not been updated for over 0 years .
neutral	the west " loop " that took about an_hour was not really worth it as you didn_'_t actually see much apart_from harrods .
neutral	couldn_'_t understand_why we didn_'_t actually drive past the museums .
neutral	didn_'_t have time to do the free boat_tour as it is only one way and would have left us with a long journey back across london .
neutral	in conclusion this was good value particularly if booked in advance online and was a good way of making the best of a short time in london - don_'_t have any other service providers to compare it to but overall would have felt_like a much more satisfying_experience if we had not wasted an_hour at the beginning due to poor advice from your own staff .
neutral	i thought i was buying an actual gift_card , but apparently you have to log on with your password to use it .
neutral	since i got it as a gift for my daughter , it wasn_'_t really what i wanted .
neutral	i am a loyal_customer of this company .
neutral	the deals are excellent - both in price and product .
neutral	the only_thing i wish they would improve upon is the delivery of shipments that are scheduled to arrive on a regular_basis .
neutral	they often come much later than they are supposed to - and , recently , had i not signed in to my account to find out why one shipment was taking so long to arrive , i would not have found out that the hold up was an apparent " back order " status of the order .
neutral	pausing my regular shipment schedule , i placed a new order for all of the items and received them in just a couple of days ( no special " rush order " for them or anything ).
neutral	it seems as though new , " one - time " orders ship much_faster and more reliably .
neutral	other than that issue , all other aspects of this company are laudable .
neutral	excellent pre delivery service .
neutral	kept me fully_informed all day .
neutral	bit disappointed with delivery drivers , i had thought they were going to unpack the fidge freezer for me and put it in place , but they wouldn_'_t .
neutral	as a short , fat , housewife i wouldn_'_t have managed to lift a 0 ' fridge on my own , but luckily had visitors at the time so they helped once the drivers had left - otherwise it would still be sitting in the middle of the kitchen now .
neutral	i had to book my trip 0x on line and it would not take so i called - first time i called the number posted online was wrong working number then i called and got a nice customer_service rep .
neutral	everything seemed to be very efficient and the tyres are great but no - one asked if we wanted tracking or balancing done at the same time , this wasn_'_t included in the price and we were told we ' d have to return the next_day for this .
neutral	why would you get new tyres without balancing and tracking done at the same time ?
neutral	i ordered the wrong_size seeing only a size 0 and not knowing that meant uk0 and not us0 , so the boots i received were 0 sizes too big .
neutral	the customer_service representative took a long time to get to me but was patient .
neutral	if you order the correct item in the correct size , you will get a legitimate product at a great price , but if not , return shipping will cost you .
neutral	$_00 return shipping on a pair of $_000 boots is a bit much ,
neutral	that '_s pretty_much it .
neutral	i arrived at town_fair for a 0pm scheduled appointment , checked in and assumed that service would begin shortly_thereafter .
neutral	by 0pm , not having any communication with any employee , i approached the front_desk and asked if there was some kind of problem .
neutral	only then , after 0 hour of wait time , i was told that the truck carrying my items had not yet arrived at the store .
neutral	i stated to the employee at the desk that i would have liked to have been made aware that there was going to be a delay - he stated that " it was not his fault , he knew nothing about it ."
neutral	i told him that , as a team , it probably wasn_'_t in the stores best interest to " throw someone_else under the bus ."
neutral	i was told that the bus was on it '_s way and would be at the store shortly .
neutral	i then expected a bit of a delay , went to another store to purchase a drink ad watched the delivery truck pull in awhile later .
neutral	i have now been waiting for service for 0 hours .
neutral	i returned to the waiting area and saw that my car was , indeed , in the service bay .
neutral	another hour went by again ( i was told when i made my appointment that the service would take 00_minutes ) with no contact from any employee .
neutral	i approached the desk a second time only to be told there was a problem removing a tire from my car .
neutral	i asked when anyone was going to tell me that and requested to see the store manager .
neutral	the store manger , nick , came out apologized for all that had happened and told me what was going on .
neutral	from this point on , the experience began a positive track .
neutral	the issue with my tire was a difficult one but it was dealt_with and the service was excellent .
neutral	nick has taken_care of the entire issue with professionalism and i intend to go back in the fall for a new set of tires for another car .
neutral	shipping is super slow and i don_'_t know about product because i still_haven_'_t got it .
neutral	but prices are cheap .
neutral	i ordered clothes from moddeals and they did not fit correctly so i tried returning 0 items .
neutral	only 0 were considered " returned " and i got them exchanged .
neutral	however , the 0th item was not considered " returned " and was no sent back to me and i did not get a refund in money for the clothing item .
neutral	all items were returned in the same package so not sure how they could " lose " the item .
neutral	not as user_friendly as seamless , but always gives out good deals and discounts !
neutral	delivery arrived on time , however , 0 of the chairs are damaged and i have email photos and am awaiting on how the issue will be progressed further .
neutral	when i started ordering from pureformules a couple of years_ago shipping was super_fast , now shipping takes several days longer .
neutral	also , i ordered some products on 0 - 00 - 00 and i was suppose to receive posted points for that order 0 days after the products ship but today is 0 - 00 - 00 and still have not received the points .
neutral	the only_reason this even matters is that i would like to use the points .
neutral	most brands ( douglas_labs , genestra , thorne research ) i have purchased from pureformules i have been very happy with the quality .
neutral	except for integrative therapeutics brand , low quality for the expensive prices .
neutral	i have tried their products on several_occasions and every time i get burned .
neutral	i ordered a 00_pound_bag of dry_dog_food and a smaller bag of dog_treats .
neutral	the dog_food and treats were delivered in too small of a carton , thus crushing the dry treats into crumbs .
neutral	this has happened once before but petflow replaced them without_question .
neutral	i don_'_t understand_why their products are not shipped in an appropriately sized carton !
neutral	we picked the car up at malpensa airport and dropped it off in mestre , opposite the train_station .
neutral	the office in mestre was supposed to open after lunch at 0 p . m .
neutral	the employee sauntered in about 0 : 00 .
neutral	there was one young_man waiting to return the car who needed to catch a train and he was almost frantic with concern .
neutral	the employee was brusque and surly and complained that we hadn_'_t parked the car in the " garage " -- even_though there was no information posted about this garage .
neutral	there was a printed notice about leaving the car after hours at the " garage " but it was not clear where this garage was or how to leave it .
neutral	while we were waiting for the employee to return from his lunch , i went to the parking facility next door ( which was a garage ) -- the person in the office there said " i '_m not avis " -- i replied i knew that but wondered where " avis " was .
neutral	i hadn_'_t ordered glasses online yet and was a bit_skeptical .
neutral	so i ordered 0 pupillary_distance rulers and a 0 pack of cleaning cloths .. 0 days_later i received 0 of the rulers and 00 days_later received the cloths ...
neutral	so i went to a different company , ordered my glasses and they were shipped 0 business days_later .... no biggie .. just glad i test ordered first to see how awfully long it could take .
neutral	your solicitor was not interested in my case !
neutral	service was good .
neutral	easy to extend the rental period .
neutral	car performed well & drop_off very easy .
neutral	price was competitive .
neutral	when i arrived to pick_up the car i was led to believe there weren_'_t any of teh compact size i have contracted for & i would need to upgrade to a larger model , at my expence .
neutral	it ended_up costing me quite a bit more than agreed_upon .
neutral	not happy about that .
neutral	0 of 0 items shipped july_0000 with expiration_date of july_0000 .
neutral	one huge disadvantage of online shopping .
neutral	this seems to be one of the better options for making cheap international_calls .
neutral	it is 0 cents less_than google_voice .
neutral	however the setup / registration part was more difficult than most other services .
neutral	they run regular promotions , but there always seems to be a problem when i attempt to use a voucher , it is not accepted .
neutral	i accidentally made a purchase and they have not refunded my money or responded .
neutral	i have made alot of purchases through wowcher i had some great deals , although some not so great and hasnt been worth the deal price let_alone anything higher .
neutral	now i am more careful with what i buy and think on before i click the buy now .
neutral	all in all the some good deals to be had .
neutral	brilliant service in terms of simplicity and ease of use , but i was disappointed that my things did not arrive in time even_though i paid for them to do so .
neutral	this is the first time i have ever booked a cruise .
neutral	very unhappy that the original cruise i had paid a deposit on was suddenly changed - not the cruise agent '_s fault - but this should never have happened .
neutral	felt very disappointed and let_down to then have to look at going on a different ship which isnt as grand .
neutral	this caused a lot of anxiety to myself and my other family_members ... not good .. so close to christmas .
neutral	i used bookit . com to book our hotel and rental_car .
neutral	at the end when it came to push the button to book it , it came up with , " oops , something went wrong , please call an agent ."
neutral	so , i called an agent and the trip was booked all over again .
neutral	however , prices kept changing on the hotel each time i looked but the next_morning when i printed the itinerary out , i noticed two different bookit numbers and realized the trip got booked twice !
neutral	the " oops an_error occurred , call an agent " resulted in the trip being booked and a lag in their computer system did not allow the agent i called to see that the trip , had in fact , been booked .
neutral	what a mess to get taken_care of .
neutral	frank was very helpful though and took his time to get this mess straightened_out .
neutral	all i care about is having a room and a car when we get there april 00rd !
neutral	i hope it all worked out .
neutral	i purchased a bowl to stop my dog from rating so fast .
neutral	he used it twice but now will not eat out of it .
neutral	i also purchased a roll of turkey dog_food .
neutral	he ate it twice and threw it back up for 0 days .
neutral	this is not unusual behaviour but i had high_hopes .
neutral	it will not keep me from purchasing again from pet_flow .
neutral	the original booking i made went perfectly .
neutral	but the first leg of my outgoing flight was cancelled due to weather ( nobody '_s fault , i know ).
neutral	when i called travelocity ( who didn_'_t call to let_me know , it was the airline that did that ) i was told their system was " updating " and i needed to call back in two hours .
neutral	this was at about 0pm est , so it wasn_'_t in the middle of the night or some other off - peak time , and since this was a major winter_storm i would have never gotten another flight if i ' d waited two hours to rebook .
neutral	i gave up on travelocity and called the airline , which was able to book me immediately and with no trouble .
neutral	this has made me feel_like travelocity is great as an initial fare finder , but if trouble crops up you might well be on your own .
neutral	i was happy to be able to order a gift_card for a dear_friend who is getting_married .
neutral	it was a group gift from her co - workers and we didn_'_t want to just give her cash .
neutral	i am not sure why there was such a large fee plus additional shipping_charges .
neutral	i ended_up paying the fees out of my pocket because i didn_'_t want to use the money we collected toward fees and shipping .
neutral	when you order a gift_card from a store there is no fee and sometimes there is even free_shipping .
neutral	additionally , i think the card should come in a gift box .
neutral	after all it is a gift .
neutral	order a list of items for christmas .
neutral	i received the package about 0 and a half weeks after ordering then upon_opening my box .
neutral	i found out a few items were missing .
neutral	went_ahead and contacted customer_service and a month later still_haven_'_t had anything resolved .
neutral	the price is right .
neutral	but the coffee doesn_'_t have as good flavor as nespresso .
neutral	i will drink it until my 000 pods are gone , but i will not serve it to guests .
neutral	compared to nespresso , this decaf has a sharper bite to the flavor .
neutral	it lacks the deep smoothness of nespresso .
neutral	pc_game supplies a great variety of game_cards .
neutral	quick and within the 00 minute mark , however , i think the worldwide option is still quite restricted to certain areas .
neutral	i have friends from other_countries that play american games and would like to be able to purchase cards to play .
neutral	i would use this website again .
neutral	i was able to rent a space fairly quickly .
neutral	only one big problem .
neutral	when i drove 00_minutes from home to see the space , the woman in the office told me there wasn_'_t one available and didn_'_t know why the website shown it available .
neutral	by luck , someone had just moved out the night before and a space supposedly opened up .
neutral	in the mean time , while i waited all day for a confirmation , i had to book another storage company .
neutral	when i received my package , the box was damaged .
neutral	it looked like someone took a knife , and stabbed at it .
neutral	the replacement car mirror i ordered was undamaged , though , which is the most_important .
neutral	it '_s just a little enraging to see the box for something fragile look like someone beat the crap out of it .
neutral	i '_m accustomed to quickly shipped orders through amazon and other_websites , so waiting soooo long for an order seems crazy now .
neutral	thus , my experience so_far has_been one of waiting for it to be delivered .
neutral	convenient ?
neutral	sure .
neutral	fast ?
neutral	no .
neutral	plan way in advance if you need pet_food or treats .
neutral	placed an order with amazon and got my order 0_weeks_later very slow shipping
neutral	i was pleased i had located the glasses cheaper elsewhere however i like them i am a little un - sure they are the real burberry '_s as i ordered them from what i believed was a aus company to learn they were coming in from hong_kong so still not sure i have paid over $_000 . 00 + for something that might not be the real mycoy !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i was about to hang up because i ' d been on hold so long and the music was really annoying me when tobias answered .
neutral	he was very helpful and informed about the storage company i was considering , and it was good that he also had info about a second company i had on my list .
neutral	i was able to book my reservation through tobias , so all seemed convenient .
neutral	but , there were several issues - the online reservation system doesn_'_t interface well with the in store system , so my rental process took more than an_hour .
neutral	even_though i arrived at 0 :_00pm and the facility closes at 0pm , i was barely able to get my belongings into my locker before closing time because of all the time it took to rent the locker .
neutral	the second issue for me is that there were hidden_charges like an administrative fee , a monthly mandatory insurance fee , and the requirement that i purchase a cylinder lock , so it cost me $_00 in fees to get my first month '_s rent " free ".
neutral	i feel that these fees should have been discussed with me at the time i reserved my locker , not when i was sitting at the storage company attempting to finalize the transaction .
neutral	i had actually asked if i should bring my own lock .
neutral	i was told i could , so i did , but even with my own padlock , i was still required to purchase a cylinder lock for $_00 +.
neutral	this doesn_'_t sit well with me , sorry .
neutral	the third issue was that i had reserved a locker for the next_day , but rented it the same day i reserved .
neutral	i got an_email the next_day reminding me to rent my locker or to cancel my reservation .
neutral	if i have a reservation and i '_ve already rented , you guys should be able to figure it out and not send an_email reminding me to rent .
neutral	my nearest best buy is quite a long trip from my home and workplace .
neutral	i like to pick items up rather_than wait around for deliveries though .
neutral	i regularly use the bestbuy website to arrange collect at store purchases and have never had a problem .
neutral	admittedly , sometimes they ' re more_expensive than mail order only places but the convenience and speed makes it worth using them for urgent purchases .
neutral	i can '_t comment on their returns_policy because i '_ve never had a problem with anything i '_ve bought .
neutral	i guess that '_s a plus !
neutral	well i ordered my part '_s no problem . recieved them on pretty good time but , when needed to send core back to get my money back they didn_'_t send aynthing to say where it '_s supposed to be sent to so i can get my money back . so had to go online and find phone_number wait 0 extra day '_s when they opened again , then wait to talk to somebody to find out where i send it . that is something that you ' d think they would automatically send the the new part if your suppose to send back the core . can '_t help to wonder_if they do that on purpose so it will hopefully take you longer_than the 00 day '_s so they can keep the core fee in their pocket and tell you oh well it '_s our '_s now .
neutral	i called before placing my order to see if i needed anything_else to mount my headlights and was informed they didn_'_t come with mounting brackets and i needed to order these ... $_00 dollars later they come in and i didn_'_t need them ... money wasted .. that i didn_'_t really have to waste .. now i have parts that are of no use to me ..
neutral	after going through the sample_pack that came with my espresso maker , i ordered these to save some money .
neutral	some were okay , while others seemed packed too tight and barely allowed water through .
neutral	i was kind of disappointed .
neutral	i might try to find other options at a similar price in the future .
neutral	y have a toll_free number if u not going to answer ???
neutral	i placed sn order on aug 00 , 0000 for a jw pet large dog toy ... and as of this date sep 00 , 0000 , not received it nor will yu all answer the phones ... but u can continue 0 charge my acct 0 my monthly gift box .
neutral	please refund my money or send the merchandise or i will no_longer order an post my displeasure on fb .
neutral	thank u ,
neutral	linda womack
neutral	i ordered some dog wormer for the first time from this company and when they came they was in the right packaging but i just happens to check before putting them away and inside i noticed that they had put cat wormer in the dog wormer packaging so i rang them and they sent out the correct wormer and i returned the cat wormer at no cost to me just a good job i checked lol .
neutral	would make me think about it before ordering again but they did rectify the ' re mistake
neutral	as i am dealing_with lymphedema , i '_ve been ordering compression hose / socks from foryourlegs .
neutral	i first selected free_shipping and it took a long time to receive merchandise .
neutral	then i had to return some things i " d ordered ( for i realize now that i neednthigh high , not knee high ) and that process worked okay but took about two months to get money refunded but it did happen without my having to contact them .
neutral	current issue is i now need panty hose r ( situation not controlled by thigh_high for my legs too long for thigh_high ) - and no where can i find out which brand has the longest leg .
neutral	they cost a lot of money and i hate to spend hundreds of dollars trying the various_options .
neutral	i would love it if there were an expert who i could talk to at foryourlegs who would give me some insight_into the various brands so i have better chance of getting right one .
neutral	the directions to the embassy_suites hotel by o ' hare airport were totally wrong so we missed the shuttle and could not wait for the next one or we would be late for our flight !
neutral	we ended_up paying $_00 for a cab to get there in time .
neutral	then while we were gone on our trip someone hit our yukon in the parking_lot and i am still dealing_with having that fixed !
neutral	but at_least it was reported and is being paid for to fix it .
neutral	not a great experience overall but the shuttle driver on the way back was great .
neutral	i cannot give you a review , except the product i ordered was shipped early than_expected .
neutral	i have called the 000 number on the bottle to ask some questions about the product , but i haven_'_t heard_anything from the company .
neutral	unfortunately for millbryhill they use a useless delivery couriers who only deliver in the mornings and depot for collection is miles_away .
neutral	otherwise i was delighted with their service .
neutral	very disappointed with having to pay for delivery then had to wait nearly a week for my purchase - would have been quicker to by it locally :-(
neutral	i live in colorado my order when to denver , co to be processed through the usps sort facility left denver went to jacksonville , florida to be processed through usps sort facility .
neutral	i am confused , why would my order go to jacksonville , florida to be processed again only to have to be shipped back to colorado delaying my order .
neutral	doesn_'_t seem logical to me .
neutral	actually not impressed , i paid for first_class delivery expensive as only a small item and it took 0 weekdays to arrive , i had to ring up company and ask where it was !
neutral	the address listed on the webiste for holiday_inn express in grapevine , tx was not the physical_address of the hotel .
neutral	i put the address in my gps and was driving in circles until i was able to get a hotel rep on the phone to give me the actual address .
neutral	this site has an excellent selection of frames !
neutral	i called customer_service with a question about how they measure the progressive line for my order , but was not satisfied with their answer , so i just ordered the frames without the prescription .
neutral	their email communication was good .
neutral	i did receive my order fairly quickly .
neutral	when i received my package the free cleaning_kit was not included & no information accompanied my order .
neutral	i received an_email to confirm receipt so i emailed customer_service to confirm receipt & see if i could get an answer to my question for future orders , but did not hear back from them .
neutral	dirty bird to go .
neutral	it '_s so good and i order from there all the time , but you guys don_'_t have it !
neutral	i would probably never use another food delivery site if i could order from this restaurant here .
neutral	also , i like the idea of the points_system but they don_'_t really have a lot of value ....
neutral	after i ordered a couple of stuff sometime ago i waited for a confirmation_email but i received nothing .
neutral	i didn_'_t know if it had shipped or not .
neutral	i was kinda worried_about my order .
neutral	it was until about 0_weeks before i received my package .
neutral	its very frustrating .
neutral	but after i received my package i was very relieved .
neutral	also , your shoe_sizes are not accurate .
neutral	the furniture i ordered is fine - it was delivered on time earlier_than i anticipated .
neutral	the oly problem i have is with the packaging .
neutral	it was very difficult to remove while maintaining the integrity of the packaging in case it had to be returned .
neutral	i ordered a tall bookcase and a small sideboard .
neutral	the bookcase was particularly difficult since the packaging could not be removed with the item standing upright - the packaging hit the ceiling .
neutral	with the item on its side the weight of the bookcase meant the packing was difficult to pull off .
neutral	this is definitely an_issue that i would consider again when buying furniture .
neutral	it was really easy to order online , but i haven_'_t received an_email_saying my gift_card has shipped , therefore , i haven_'_t received it yet .
neutral	i orderered two_pairs of running socks .
neutral	i did not realise that there were left and right foot socks on the market !
neutral	anyway i receieved three left socks and one right sock .
neutral	all packaged_nicely in pairs so guess this happened in the factory prior to arriving at barringtons ?
neutral	i have been ordering for years , and this year experienced my first real disappointment .
neutral	i purchased 0 complete arrangements at a considerable expense and anxiously awaited their arrival .
neutral	two plants arrived dead , and three more were in dire distress .
neutral	after planting , and almost_immediately 0 more plants died , then another .
neutral	i am anxiously watching over the others , to the point of paranoia , in the hopes that they make it .
neutral	i called , and will be sent replacements , but as i said after so many years and the anxiety of waiting to have all these dead or dying is very disappointing .
neutral	yesterday i bought tickets for tomorrowland in belgium .
neutral	i received the confirmation saying that the tickets will arrive 0 days before the concert but i live in mexico and i wont be in mexico 0 days before the festival , i will be travelling .
neutral	i tried to reach viagogo but it seems very dificult to reach them .
neutral	i saw that they answer in this forum so is there anyone from viagogo that could help me .
neutral	can i pick_up personally the tickets on the uk office ?
neutral	hope answers soon i spent a lot of money on those tickets .
neutral	thanks
neutral	auf_der seite von sportscheck . de ist_es mir bereits mehrfach passiert , dass von mir gewählte produkte doch nicht_mehr verfügbar waren .
neutral	das_ist_sehr ärgerlich und frustierend .
neutral	warum kann ein ausverkauftes produkt nicht einfach entfernt werden ?
neutral	postage to europe is way too much and items sell out too quickly , you should have more available , they are gone within minutes and i am somehow never quick enough :( otherwise items are good quality and worth the fiver .
neutral	shopped a lot recently but ordered a handbag and it came with the missing long strap , emailed them about it , but no reply still_waiting for them to send me the missing strap :(
neutral	some products broke the first time of use .
neutral	some products are very small , but not a problem .
neutral	love the coffee_mug !
neutral	!
neutral	i didn_'_t know i was signing_up for uncovered parking .
neutral	they don_'_t tell you that until you get your confirmation , or if they do , it is not apparent where you sign_up .
neutral	it should say uncovered airport_parking in big letters so that people know it '_s uncovered .
neutral	now i am only paying 0 dollars a day less_than a covered place i usually use , and my car is going to be uncovered for 00 days and probably completely filthy when i get back at midnight and have to drive home in the dark with dust - encrusted windows .
neutral	really annoying !
neutral	excellent service .
neutral	easy way to buy your contact_lens !
neutral	so_far i have received 0 orders ( 0 cases of innova small cans ) and both_times several of the cans are dented to the point that they cannot be used .
neutral	i will try the auto .
neutral	reorder service one more time but the packing dept .
neutral	needs to protect the product better on the sides of the cases to prevent_damage
neutral	the representative i spoke to to make my reservation made me feel as though i was bothering him worst of all he never advised me the hotel would be charging my credit_card for my stay - which is a month away - immediately .
neutral	we bought a couch and it took 0_weeks to hear when it was coming .
neutral	shipping was fast once they sent it .
neutral	the packaging was unconventional but product was intact .
neutral	if you are hoping for prompt delivery or to meet a dead line order well in advance .
neutral	price was right and that is why we went with them .
neutral	in the future we are not sure if we will purchase from them again .
neutral	the clothes always look better in pictures .
neutral	for the price , can '_t really complaint .
neutral	i recently placed two orders on the same day and i experienced some frictions .
neutral	when i received the first parcel one item was missing and when i contacted them over the phone they told me to wait_till i had received the second parcel to see whether the missing item was in there .
neutral	the day after i received the second parcel but the missing item was not in there either so i contacted them by ie - mail .
neutral	the following_day they replied and said that the missing item had been left out by mistake and that it was on its way .
neutral	the item arrived the day after .
neutral	i did not found the customer_service over the telephone particularly helpful but they were able to answer my query better by e_- mail .
neutral	another issue was that one of the item i received ( a single creamy eyeshadow by nars ) had two finger prints ( like shimmery powder ones ) on the eyeshadow case .
neutral	inside the case the eyeshadow was intact so i did not send it back even_though it was clear that this was an item that had been opened and then returned by a previous customer .
neutral	does customer_service not check their returned items ?
neutral	did not reflect color accurately ... frame is white and blue ... looked white and black .
neutral	not what we wanted
neutral	i received both parts i ordered in reasonable time_frame and both parts were correct despite reading they often send wrong parts in reviews on yelp .
neutral	main gripe that i have is that i was unable to get back the $_00 core deposit i was charged because when i tried to open a ticket as required on their website it kept telling_me the captcha i was entering was wrong .
neutral	i tried case sensitive and tried about 00 different times to no_avail .
neutral	to add_insult to injury it '_s impossible to get in contact with parts_geek over the phone .
neutral	it '_s almost as if they set you up .
neutral	my 00 days have passed and i cannot get the $ back .
neutral	i '_m not swearing them off but i know better_than to expect my core deposit back .
neutral	part was still fairly cheap .
neutral	in the end , i was really happy with the product for the price .
neutral	however , i '_m still confused by the billing process .
neutral	i had originally requested a pair of sunglasses with prism ; the price i was given was around $_00 .
neutral	i entered my credit_card information and was not charged .
neutral	then i got a bill for an_additional_$_00 or so for the prism , which pissed me off .
neutral	so i responded to take the prism out or cancel the order ( i just barely need a prism , and these are sunglasses , so it '_s not like i '_ll be wearing them all the time ).
neutral	eventually , i was only charged the $_00 ( it took so long to iron this out that my credit_card expired and i had to enter new information ), and got my sunglasses , which i really love .
neutral	so if i were to make a suggestion for improvement , it would be for transparency in terms of pricing .
neutral	as for product , it '_s a lot less_expensive than i could have gotten at an optician , and pretty good quality .
neutral	i ' d order again if i could avoid the craziness with the billing .
neutral	one of the things i dislike is that some of the shoes that read 0 0 / 0 are sometimes reduced because they don_'_t fit me .
neutral	i order a bunch of shoes and it seems like as time goes by , you guys go more and more_expensive ... and the times i have called customer_service , it takes me about 00_min before i can actually speak to someone
neutral	good prices , although please don_'_t put on your website that delivery will be 0st_class when it takes three_weeks .
neutral	also when you have a contact number on your website , please make_sure it works and somebody actually picks_up the phone rather_than an_automated_message_saying about how you are too busy at the moment .
neutral	highly unprofessional and completely rubbish customer_service .
neutral	it will be some time before i can try out , had to buy replacement becauce 0f the long free_shipping !!
neutral	!
neutral	i like allbeauty . com because i can find products that i cannot find in my country spain .
neutral	but there is one thing that i do not like : the postman leaves the parcel without obligation of signing and this can be dangerous because anyone could take it ( for example , a shameless neighbour ) .
neutral	the pre delivery experience was fantastic i was kept well updated on delivery arrangement and given an exact time_slot also a call before delivery to confirm details . however delivery_men could not get item into my room , they would not unpack it to get it in however they assured_me that if we unpacked it it would definitely go in the item was left in my hallway waiting for my husband to come home to unpack it which we did and it fitted through the door no problem we were then left with all the packaging to discard of . however after all this hassle with delivery we are very pleased with the product
neutral	never have i had so many reminders , both email and text to 0 phones .
neutral	yes i know my delivery is scheduled for .... once will do .
neutral	i love the prices , however , i do have issues at time with the sizes .
neutral	i wear a 0 . 0 , however , the ones i have ordered are always too big .
neutral	i never really know what size shoe to order .
neutral	when i order a 0 , many_times , they are too tight & the 0 . 0 are too big .
neutral	my recent order of shoes were all 0 . 0 .
neutral	they are all too big .
neutral	i never go thru the hassle of sending them back so i end up giving them away .
neutral	with this being my biggest_problem , i may have to refrain from ordering in the future .
neutral	i don_'_t want to because i love the site , but i keep buying shoes , i can '_t wear .
neutral	;-(
neutral	absoulutely hopeless to deal with , sort any_issues , or get someone to talk to who is honest , or you can understand their english ?
neutral	i am in dispair at the way i am being delt with !
neutral	but very strange how
neutral	they find no trouble at taking money d . d .
neutral	from my bank_account .
neutral	full of promises agreement '_s , but there is so much red tape , i feel
neutral	bt you are mentally abusing your customers .
neutral	i ordered a visa giftcard for a friend .
neutral	i like that i was able to customize the design .
neutral	the gift_card shipped quickly and looked great .
neutral	however , the website had some glitches .
neutral	i found some designs i liked among the pre_- designed cards and wrote_down the names exactly .
neutral	when i went back to the website to order , the search_function yielded no results .
neutral	i had to go back through the designs , page by page , to find the ones i wanted .
neutral	the designs were randomized so i couldn_'_t even go back to the specific page number i found it on .
neutral	other than that , the product was nice and made for a great gift .
neutral	i love the print on this case .
neutral	perfect for fall .
neutral	the case is really thin though and doesn_'_t offer much protection
neutral	i was happy to get the car i wanted but it was over priced by $ 0000 .
neutral	also during my inspection the person failed to check the lock on the hatch / trunk .
neutral	upon_arriving home i realize that it does not lock .
neutral	i called and did not get a response from the salesperson i left word with .
neutral	i then called back until days_later i was just told to call the warranty people .
neutral	i am frustrated that i have to spend my only day off for 0 days at a mechanic and the warranty people said they may not even cover it .
neutral	if that happens that car is getting returned .
neutral	also they added the extra features to my cost without advising me of doing so .
neutral	i ended_up keeping them , but i don_'_t think its fair to assume everyone wants the gps , warranty , etc .
neutral	i '_m pretty upset about unknowingly buying a car that doesn_'_t lock completely then spending my time getting it fixed .
neutral	i was disappointed to get some treats in that were made in china the web_site never said where they were made and i wasn_'_t concerned because i have ordered from pet_flow before .
neutral	when the treats came in and it showed they were from china i called in the customer_service guy told me they " should " be ok which did not make me any more at ease .
neutral	i gave them away to someone_who said they were not afraid to use them for their dogs .
neutral	maybe i am paranoid , but i never buy anything for my dog that is not made in the usa and i certainly would not have ordered anything that wasn_'_t .
neutral	great price but the lens cleaning fluid had leaked all through the box and everything was sticky and wet .
neutral	tour was good despite the constant rain but does not go to major points of interest .
neutral	did not get close to the pyramid at the louvre .
neutral	my experience in ordering , receiving and being kept up to date re my order was fine .
neutral	the only problem i have is that unfortunately the trousers ordered did not fit my husband so i was going to return them until i found out it was going to cost me $_00 to ship them back making it a $_00_dollar ( shipping ) outlay and having nothing to show for it .
neutral	at this point i am not returning them .
neutral	have ' nt decided what i will do with them at this point .
neutral	i needed a secondary option for a cover plate as the original one did not fit with how the tile was cut .
neutral	tried to find dimensions on web_site , not there .
neutral	called customer_service , they offered a second option but could not provide dimensions .
neutral	told me to send an_email to customer_service .
neutral	00_hours_later the response i received was let_me check .
neutral	they never got back to me .
neutral	long_story , longer , i risked it and purchased the option suggested and hoped .
neutral	it did arrive the next_day and worked .
neutral	not a great customer_service experience when it comes to issues or questions .
neutral	with product , love it !
neutral	your search_engine on your website is not good at all .
neutral	if i tried searching for wedge boots it would not give me all of them when i searched it , only very few .
neutral	also when i narrowed it to size 0 shoes only , not all shoes i clicked on had size 0 ... just a few errors in the website , other than that great service cheap shoes and great deals !
neutral	the only_thing i hate is when you guys have a sale you increase shipping ... doesn_'_t really make_sense and most of the time , going with free_shipping after $_00 is the best way to go .
neutral	good shipping nice clothes
neutral	i have ordered from multiple discount eye_glass dealers before .
neutral	this is the second time i have ordered from here .
neutral	the first time was great , fast shipping , and no_problems with the glasses at all .
neutral	this time around i ordered a pair of prescription_sunglasses .
neutral	when i wear them and look at the ground it appears as if the ground is raised and it makes me trip .
neutral	looking through them distorts everything .
neutral	i am not sure what happened with my prescription this time around , but it was definitely a waste of 00 . 00 because i can not use them now .
neutral	my order took over a week to get to my door .
neutral	i live in a city too .
neutral	received wrong order twice but have been informed it was an_error on the product line .
neutral	i have been refunded all costs and am happy with the outcome of my complaint .
neutral	i was charged a high price for amber £_000 . 00 on my return , so will travel p_& o or shop in france before travelling back .
neutral	bar prices were average .
neutral	would have liked to try the food in the dinning areas , maybe another time .
neutral	sometimes they send international books .
neutral	sometimes they don_'_t .
neutral	this time they didn_'_t .
neutral	(:
neutral	i used a bottle on my lab with hip problems .
neutral	he seemed to get better after the bottle was gone .
neutral	i thought it had helped , but when i give the med to him every day , he seems to be very lethargic .
neutral	has this been reported in the past or would he be lethargic any way ?
neutral	i bought 0 bottles and i may have to return 0 since i '_m not convinced it '_s helping .
neutral	while the motel was not close to the airport , they did send a bus for us when we called .
neutral	they also took us to the port to board our ship .
neutral	however they took us to the wrong ship and it was when i knew it was the wrong ship where we were " dumped " that i was able to collect our bags and get ourselves to the right place .
neutral	this motel does a big business with cruisers , so watch the drivers .
neutral	they could care less where they let you out .
neutral	thank_god i knew what i had to order because had i needed to speak with someone that would have been an epic fail !!
neutral	!
neutral	called 0 times waited 00_min each time and then call disconnected .
neutral	even the online process took_forever , kept freezing or got kicked off !
neutral	the only good thing was the price of the item i needed .
neutral	i was very disappointed that their sizing runs very small .
neutral	i wear a medium , so that is what i ordered .
neutral	but their medium is more like an extra small !
neutral	!
neutral	i '_ll start with the positives .
neutral	yelp is the only tool i use , other than word of mouth , for deciding where to dine .
neutral	i value the opinions of other yelp users , and appreciate seeing photos of the food and the establishment .
neutral	i enjoy reading_reviews that are concise and to the point , and those that are a bit more superfluous and detailed .
neutral	the negative aspect of yelp is the review hiding .
neutral	i '_ve had multiple very legitimate reviews of mine hidden , mostly negative_reviews .
neutral	this makes me think these businesses have paid to have my review suppressed .
neutral	this is a shady practice .
neutral	other businesses are forced to pay for their yelp accounts so they all of the positive_reviews showed_up .
neutral	i '_ve seen businesses with average to poor ratings with many positive , legitimate sounding reviews left out .
neutral	if yelp would stop being so shady , i would rate them better .
neutral	both businesses and consumers are affected by their practices , and unless you look at the hidden reviews , you might not be getting the full picture .
neutral	i use spotcrime . com to keep me aware of crimes in my area .
neutral	this is especially useful for finding out what areas tend to have more criminal activity .
neutral	i receive bi - weekly emails_updating me on things that have happened nearby .
neutral	this would be very useful for someone trying to decide on an area to live or open a business .
neutral	the negatives are that the site isn_'_t very user_friendly and could use some help layout - wise
neutral	service a 00
neutral	parts at a good price 00
neutral	your quality control not so good .
neutral	i ordered 0 fuel injectors and recieved 0 boxes but only 0 injectors .
neutral	i had to pay triple at parts store to finish job .
neutral	appointment time online was great but nowhere_near the offered date when rep phoned .
neutral	still_waiting for side strips to windscreen - cannot drive my car at speed until this has_been fixed .
neutral	windscreen not a landrover screen feel slightly cheated .
neutral	i ordered the scooter for £_00 two_weeks_ago , rode the scooter for literally 00_minutes , after following all the instructions provided in the product manual .
neutral	however after that the scooter wouldn_'_t charge any more and couldn_'_t reach top speed any - more .
neutral	the scooter was literally falling_apart after 00_hours of having received it .
neutral	i contacted wowcher immediately then , and have been sending them 0 emails a day with no reply .
neutral	however i did receive an_email earlier but it was in my junk mails , so their customer_service score is high because they replied on the given time , but nevertheless would appreciate it in the future if product quality was tested on specific products .
neutral	ordering my glasses was a breeze .
neutral	the virtual try - on was fun and helpful .
neutral	the site was easy to navigate .
neutral	i was a touch apprehensive_about ordering something like this over the internet , but decided to give it a shot .
neutral	00 days after my order , i called to check on them .
neutral	i had never recieved any shipping information in spite of the fact that the web_site promised that " most glasses are processed in 0 days ".
neutral	i was told that they were having equipment problems .
neutral	when i voice concern ( i needed these glasses for an_upcoming_trip ), the rep said she ' d put a rush on my glasses and they would be shipped shortly .
neutral	i received a shipping notice the next_day with tracking_info .
neutral	for 0 days , the tracking was " unavailable .".
neutral	i called again and they said that the usps system was having_trouble and my glasses were out for deliver that day .
neutral	i did receive them that day and they are wonderful .
neutral	but it was a stressful process .
neutral	had the company been pro - active with contacting me (" sorry about the delay , we had an equipment problem , your items are on the way ", or " we '_ve been notified by usps that their shipping website is down .
neutral	we ' d like to assure you that your product has_been shipped and will be arriving shortly ") instead of waiting for me to call twice , this would have been a much_better experience .
neutral	but i suppose that the bottom_line is that the glasses did arrive in time and are perfect , so both my concerns were addressed .
neutral	i just wish i hadn_'_t had to call them to check so much .
neutral	ordered some custom gift_cards and they turned_out great , really made an impact with our service awards .
neutral	however , when i had an_issue with one of them and called and filed a ticket , no one ever called back to follow_up and i had to chase them to find out what was going on .
neutral	then again , when one of the other cards was stolen , filed a help ticket , then no one ever called .
neutral	they ' re fine if you '_ve got someone on the phone , but don_'_t expect a call - back for anything .
neutral	give it a day and call again .
neutral	this was the second time i have ordered from this company .
neutral	i had a slight_problem with an order i placed last_year , and customer_service was very quick to rectify the problem !
neutral	therefore , i chose to order again from them this year .
neutral	i was not disappointed !
neutral	excellent quality , excellent service !
neutral	the rooms quite small , no lift to top floor and we were not offered help with bags , glad we only stayed 0 night .
neutral	breakfast seating area very cramped and not a lot of choice either on the hot or the cold buffet .
neutral	the staff on the other hand were very helpful .
neutral	i already said it .
neutral	phoned in order on monday_morning , april 00 for reorder on royal_canine so urinary cat_food .
neutral	the customer_service rep was polite and quite a salesman .
neutral	however , by wednesday , april 00 , i had not received an_email regarding order confirmation or shipping notice .
neutral	so , i phoned again to check on my order and glad i did .
neutral	the customer_service rep on monday did not send the order to the pharmacy department for verification , so my order had gone no where .
neutral	this has now happened the last two times i have ordered from petflow .
neutral	i don_'_t know if you have changed who you use to take your phone orders , but i had received great service until recently .
neutral	i '_m just not confident in your company '_s service now .
neutral	ordering cat_food should be easy and not my responsibility to make_sure your reps follow through with their job .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	maybe it '_s because there are more competitors now ( groupon , livingsocial , travelzoo entertainmetn deals , fillaseat ...) and when i originally signed_up for goldstar it had a corner on the market .
neutral	but i am not as enchanted anymore as i once was .
neutral	i used to tell all my friends to use goldstar ; now it '_s about the third or fourth in my list of suggestions .
neutral	i think the service charge per - ticket has gotten way too high .
neutral	what '_s with the comp tickets that have a $ 0 . 00 per - ticket charge ???
neutral	by the time i pay the fee , it '_s just not the bargain it used to be .
neutral	great idea - my cat is super old so i haven_'_t signed_up for the auto - renew .
neutral	however , last time i ordered they shipped my 0x the quantity and sent an_email after it was delivered saying " oops , we sent you two orders , you can either ship one back to us or we '_ll knock 00_%_off the order ..." well , the 0 bags of cat_litter and 0 cases of food were really heavy to try to wrangle to the post_office ( esp without a car ) and difficult to store in my small city apartment ... so that kinda sucked .
neutral	eventually ran_out - so i ordered more ... one of the bags of cat_litter was punctured and leaked all over the box ... ok not really their fault , still sucks .
neutral	i can '_t get this litter anywhere_else .
neutral	this most_recent order only the food arrived ... no acknowledgement of where litter is ... just saw this email and checked the tracking .
neutral	shows it was damaged on route and being returned to shipper - again , not necessarily their fault , but am wondering what '_s going to happen - any proactive reshipment or refund ... just a repeatedly unfortunate experience now ...
neutral	a friend and i used the site a couple days ago to book our ferry tickets from newhaven to dieppe , and we found it very confusing .
neutral	the first time we used it , we could see only the 00 am ferry_crossings .
neutral	a couple hours_later , we checked again , and we could find only the 0 . 00 am ferry_crossings !
neutral	it would have been helpful to have seen a list of all the ferry_crossings and times in one place .
neutral	we got confused , so i called someone there who explained how to find the 00 am crossings again , and we booked one of those .
neutral	i '_m generally pretty adept at using travel websites , but this one had me flummoxed !
neutral	it took me a long time to fill_out the information and then i had to pay a $ 0 . 00 service fee .
neutral	however , once it was over i got what i paid for .
neutral	i ordered some mothers_day flowers from this company , the first delivered mothers_day flowers my mum had ever had .
neutral	i wanted them to be special - which they certainly were .
neutral	mum received a box full of petals , half dead flowers and stalks .
neutral	on trying to contact this company i had a series of unanswered emails , phone_calls which cut you off after 00_minutes of holding . and utter frustration .
neutral	i genuinely thought this company was a complete fraudulent operation and was going to contact trading standard .
neutral	the eureka moment came when a lady on here got help by using the landline_number for this company in burnley and advised people to try this .
neutral	the next_day i tried the landline_number , first time getting cut_off after 00_minutes of holding on , the second time a very nice man answered .
neutral	i explained the problem with the delivery and the poor quality / absolute disgraceful product sent .
neutral	he immediately arranged delivery of a bouquet of flowers for my mum from a local_florist of twice the value i originally paid .
neutral	colours and flowers were decided by myself .
neutral	the next_day the bouquet arrived , mum was delighted , and from the photos i saw so was i .
neutral	the warnings are therefore avoid any bouquets on this site that say postal delivery and .
neutral	do not use any number to contact this company other than the burnley landline_number which can be found easily online
neutral	i would love to give this company more stars , the second bouquet was definitely 0_star , but the flowers were supposedly for mothers_day and arrived in the end 0 days_later .
neutral	the first delivery was awful ,
neutral	customer_service , when you were eventually able to contact them was fantastic , but original experiances were grim
neutral	would i use them again , yes but maybe phone the order through or make_sure the flowers were not posted but hand delivered by local_florists
neutral	i don_'_t know when it was delivered but i just got it because it sat around with no name and ny instead of ca .
neutral	it arrived in ca and not ny so that is not so problematic but i '_ve been waiting for days for this thing .
neutral	now i am just hoping it fits .
neutral	i ordered a variety of different products for my dogs and received an order confirmation stating that my order was processed & on the way to the warehouse for packing & shipping .
neutral	a week_later , i still had not received my order , nor had any kind of update from petflow about the status .
neutral	every time i went online to track the status of my order , it said the same thing ... " processing_".
neutral	so i finally called them and when i ( finally ) got a customer_service rep on the line he told me that one of the products in my order was on backorder ( despite_being listed as " in stock " online ) and that was what was holding up my order .
neutral	he could not tell me when the backordered product would be in stock , so we ended_up having to remove that product from my order .
neutral	once that was done , the order shipped & i received it within a few_days .
neutral	i mentioned to the customer_service rep that it would have been nice if i had been sent some_sort of notification about the backordered product prior to me having to call and chase down my order status .
neutral	he mumbled something about them " having just noticed that their computer system was not handling backorders correctly " and that they were fixing it .
neutral	not sure i believe that .
neutral	but once i finally did get my order , all of the items were there and my dogs love the various treats & toys .
neutral	the do have good prices and a good product selection .
neutral	they just need to work on customer_service & their order processing systems .
neutral	over all good , fast delivery . but the shipping price was a little high for such a little part ... but like i said fast delivery so it was way worth it thanks partsgeek . com
neutral	i ordered a dress for a hen do and returned it as faulty , then received an_email_confirming my refund but had not refunded the delivery costs so i had to email to request the refund .
neutral	i always find the quality of items is a bit hit and miss from boohoo some things are really good others are not good and not really as they appear in the pictures .
neutral	we received our alternator , installed it and it started making noises - brushes or bearings - not sure which yet .
neutral	this was a new alternator not rebuilt .
neutral	i am waiting to hear back from parts_geek to see what they will do about it .
neutral	i would be happy to do another review after they take_care of the issue .
neutral	i had two income and a great history of paying back on time and didn_'_t get the amount i needed .
neutral	wating at stop 00 for almost an_hour , had phone_number from confirmation_email , when i got through was told .
neutral	bus had been diverted and had to move to stop 00 .
neutral	not a good start as it was raining quite hard .
neutral	the fact that the 00hr ticket would have gone_through to lunch time the next_day was no consoltaion as we were only in london that day .
neutral	i recently ordered a ski bag 0 days before setting off on a ski trip having realised my old bag was damaged .
neutral	the price was good and , paying for postage i thought the bag would arrive with no_problems .
neutral	when i received my confirmation e_- mail it stated 0 to 0 days delivery .
neutral	i immediately rang and was assured the bag would arrive two_days_later on the friday .
neutral	on the friday i had still not received the bag nor a despatch e_- mail .
neutral	i rang again and was told the bag had to be delivered from a store and i should receive the bag the day before i travelled .
neutral	i received no confirmation of despatch e_- mail and became extremely concerned the bag would not arrive ; the bag did however arrive later that day .
neutral	i suggest you send confirmation of despatch emails as a matter of course to avoid unnecessary anguish .
neutral	i wish that i had a better reply from their customer_service email message .
neutral	i placed my order and i had my order shipped to the billing_address and not my work address , i caught it after the order was plalced , sent an e_mail .
neutral	no reply to see if it could be changed :(.
neutral	took 0 deliverys to my home address before i recieved it .
neutral	after a few issues with the web - page , i had little trouble_finding the skin i was looking for .
neutral	no_worries with signing_up and paying for the skin .
neutral	the only issue i really had was with the cut of the skin , as some of the text overlapped the cut - off area for the front of the phone , but it still looks pretty good so am relatively happy with it .
neutral	after expecting our mattress to be arriving next_day delivery between 0 . 00 - and 0pm we waited but after 0pm we phoned the customer_services to be told it had been lost but it might be here the next_day needless to say it wasn_'_t and after phoning again arrange for a replacement to be sent the following_day which i '_m glad to say arrived .
neutral	there was some_confusion with getting the prescription to frames_direct .
neutral	the frame of the glasses i received were much darker than the ones pictured .
neutral	in the picture , they were a light blue with some light brown mixed in .
neutral	the actual frames are so dark that they ' re almost black .
neutral	my ability to see out of them is fine , however .
neutral	i purchased several " sale " items at a walgreens in marietta , ga .
neutral	normally , i am very happy with the customer_service , prices and sales .
neutral	on this particular date , there were huge banners showing sales prices and savings .
neutral	but , when i went to check - out , several items were no_longer on sale and the cashier had no interest in making sure i got the items for the sales price .
neutral	i ended_up returning over 0 / 0 of the items i purchased , due to the lack of organization , knowledge and customer_service .
neutral	it goes to show you that customer_service can go a long way .
neutral	write as if you ' re_speaking to a friend .
neutral	my sister - in -_law rang to thank me for the flowers and said they were lovely except for two or three that had lost their heads and had bent stems .
neutral	the packaging was also crushed at the top , as if they had been thrown about in transit .
neutral	sorry serenata you will have to up your standards if you wish to keep me as a customer .
neutral	good product , expensive shipping cost !
neutral	you need usps and their lower rates .
neutral	keeps me from buying more from guys .
neutral	my big problem with paypal is their customer_service .
neutral	i use it a lot because i '_m a frequent_buyer on ebay but when things go wrong - i dread going through the customer_service .
neutral	if you ' re scammed - there is nothing they can do for you and that is laziness on their part .
neutral	i ordered a hard_drive about a week_ago but have not heard_anything ; no tracking no or confirmation of order from driversolutions ; just that the order has_been placed from paypal .
neutral	i could gave sworn i ordered a small ( i have had a few casts and i know my size ) and the oa didnt mention the size - so i was pissed when an xs arrived and i had to pay for the return postage .
neutral	nice idea .
neutral	a star named after me by my husband .
neutral	unfortunately , can '_t see a star when searching the universal star registry with google .
neutral	just a black screen with a white box and my name and registration_number on it .
neutral	nothing seems to be wrong , but maybe there is .
neutral	i left it for 00_minutes in case there was a download delay , but nothing .
neutral	a bit disappointed but , as i say , still a nice idea .
neutral	the people who are happy with your product seem to be the ones who got a good reaction when giving the gift .
neutral	i think it would be a different matter once the receiver tried to access and actually look at their star .
neutral	what i don_'_t like ... google my name or any of the team_members ( including my 00yo ) and links come up including pictures that were added in the giveforward listing .
neutral	i don_'_t like that anyone can find this readily_available .
neutral	i did this to help my best friend '_s daughter , i did not do this for people in my past to get a look into my life or that of my daughters .
neutral	i thought the info / pics i provided would be kept within the site , not spread to search_engines .
neutral	i gave amiclubwear 0_stars because they have fair customer_service .
neutral	they somtimes respond in a timely_matter .
neutral	they also have a great amount of cloths to choose from however the quality is very poor shoes in particular .
neutral	i have spent_thousands with this company ... my suggestions for improvement would be to bring back some of the cloths and styles they had before also train there staff better to handle problems and process orders in a more timely_matter it says 0 - 0 business days for regular items i would appreciate if they stuck to there policy also a major problem there having more frequently is not shipping certain items and not notifying that customer .. people if u dont check you wont know and they wont tell you .. that is a major issue for me ..
neutral	clothes are different and wearable .
neutral	website leaves a lot to be desired : i can '_t find
neutral	things on it because it only shows some of the items in each category .
neutral	also there is no
neutral	way of using just a reference_number to order with .
neutral	i don_'_t see how you guys are helping people with credit issues .
neutral	the payment i have to make is a hundred and four dollars more than my last vehicle .
neutral	and then have to make a payment over a hundred_dollars every two_weeks is unreal .
neutral	i am living paycheck to paycheck now and having a hard time making ends meet .
neutral	but i was assured by the sales_rep . that they were leaving me in a good financial_situation .
neutral	well i disagree , cause now i have to tell my son he can '_t eat this week because i have to make a 000 . 00 car payment that has_been split up to 000 . 00 every two_weeks .
neutral	i know this will be the last time i deal with you guys .
neutral	i purchased lipodrene with ephedra last_year and paid $_00 . 00 .
neutral	today the price was almost $_00 more .
neutral	don_'_t know if i '_ll be back :-(
neutral	i found a new web_site for swimwear , it sold a fantastic range of good quality swimwear and i really liked the jets range .
neutral	i find it difficult to get swimwear for a size 00 that is designer and good quality and to fit well whilst making the most of my shape .
neutral	the only_critisism would be when i called for advise on fitting i could not get any advise , and i would have liked to be kept up to date by email regarding the progress of my order and returns .
neutral	was okay , limited price though
neutral	the staff within the store were absolutely fantastic , and the furniture is well built .
neutral	sadly we paid_extra to have it delivered on a specific day , and all the furniture did not arrive on that day .
neutral	instead we had to wait in another day for the furniture to be delivered .
neutral	to be fair they did deliver it in the morning , but not happy at paying for a service for it to fail .
neutral	product :
neutral	the price is a little high for the quality and the items need to dispatch from vendors sooner .
neutral	however , the retention program is great .
neutral	i am also very impressed with this feedback collection method .
neutral	i also very much like the large product photos and precise measurements .
neutral	platform ux :
neutral	the massive content from vendor to vendor is not most browse friendly .
neutral	it is slightly difficult to navigate and very difficult to perform search .
neutral	the keyword search needs to be mapped to the relavant category , so the user can further narrow_down the search .
neutral	improvement :
neutral	there are many things that are not optimized on the site .
neutral	i would assume the abandoned cart rate is high ?
neutral	need to implement a drip marketing program to improve conversion .
neutral	i would suggest the site to track consumer browsing behavioral data and suggest product accordingly in addition to presenting the recently viewed .
neutral	would also suggest the site to adopt generated content ( product review ).
neutral	i would also want to see a " view all " option instead of having to go from page to page .
neutral	there are many more thing i would change but i usually charge for this .
neutral	: p
neutral	conclusion :
neutral	a great commerce site .
neutral	would need some work to take it to the next level , but the company would need to hire some talents for that to happen .
neutral	for now , a for the consumer goods .
neutral	b - for the platform .
neutral	in the short run i don_'_t see potential competitor threat .
neutral	i just hope it doesn_'_t fall behind in the world of ecommerce .
neutral	arrived at luton at booked time phoned ahead as required the stress_free driver arrived 00_mins later !, i was totally stressed by this time have used this group twice before and have found them to be very good
neutral	the driver who collected the car did not check it and did not seem to understand_english .
neutral	the one who brought the car back seemed fine
neutral	i love going to the actual macy '_s store , i always find good deals .
neutral	that being said , i think macy '_s has one of the worst websites out there .
neutral	they show products that are out of stock , the site is overpriced and the shipping_costs are ridiculous .
neutral	macy '_s will only get my b_& m business and will never receive my online business .
neutral	netflix is reasonably_priced , but i wish they had a better streaming only content available .
neutral	there have been many_times i have looked for a movie to watch and it is not available for streaming .
neutral	they do have an awesome kids selection for streaming which is why they keep my business .
neutral	shipping took along time and part was broken
neutral	the help i received from the garden_centre was very good , however , the carriers , tnt proved to be a nightmare .
neutral	having been told by the garden_centre that the couriers would notify me when they had the goods to arrange a delivery slot , i received an_email_advising me that my order had been despatched for next_day delivery .
neutral	having waited in all day my order did not arrive .
neutral	i phoned tnt , said i would be away for 0 days , not to deliver until i returned , which was confirmed by them .
neutral	on my return i was annoyed to learn that there had been 0 attempts to deliver , my neighbours were concerned , and when the goods finally arrived , 0 damaged box due to the consignment being on the lorry for 0 days , the driver told me that he hadn_'_t been given any instruction not to deliver .
neutral	very dissapointed as we ordered safe on the 00rd august . still not here . saving grace was linka ?
neutral	who answered my call . bery helpful . tracked missing order supposed to come next week now .
neutral	i have ordered several_times from bookbyte , this time it took weeks to receive my books .
neutral	it was easy to order the gift_card and i received a notice that my order was being_processed , but i never got an_email notice that the card was sent like i was told i would .
neutral	i entered the only invoice number i got and it wasn_'_t the right number so i had to send an_email to get my number .
neutral	the only way i know that the gift_card was received was because the people who got it from me told me .
neutral	it took nine days for them to receive it .
neutral	otherwise , i would recommend gift_cards to others .
neutral	ok but expensive
neutral	so i stumbled_across an_email about the whisky auction and thought we ' d have a look what was on offer .
neutral	we ' d never done this before though we use other auction sites .
neutral	we liked a set of 0 whiskies and set a budget of what we ' d like them for and bid .
neutral	i '_ve bought from whisky online before so i was happy with the shop themselves .
neutral	i would recommend however fully reading all the information .
neutral	it may be because i '_m not used to buying from auctions so pardon my naivety however we won the items for £_00 . 00 and my bill came to nearly_£_000 .
neutral	there are buyer fees plus delivery and insurance etc unless you can collect from blackpool .
neutral	i wrote initially as i couldn_'_t see how fast delivery would be although i know someone would need to be home .
neutral	they said the delivery charge had been worked out wrong and would be altered and that whisky would come friday .
neutral	so_far so good .
neutral	on friday we only received one bottle and so were told they had new people working there and they still had it and would send it out monday for tuesday delivery .
neutral	we had to alter the address so i could accept delivery but that was easily done and it arrived tuesday .
neutral	up till this point i was okay but the box received inside their protective package was a little bashed and when i emailed about this i was passed on to another member of staff who argued that given its age it didn_'_t need to be mentioned in the description .
neutral	we have agreed to disagree but i can '_t say it left me entirely_satisfied .
neutral	although as i say the products for the price are great .
neutral	unfortunately , when we arrived , we were told that there were no first floor rooms like we reserved .
neutral	when i asked why not , it was a confirmed request , the answer was that we used a third_party to make the reservation and they don_'_t honor those requests .
neutral	we booked on the fairfield site ( or so we thought ) and got a confirmation with our special request printed out on there .
neutral	that wasn_'_t right .
neutral	i was impressed with the no shipping_costs , and great prices on cat_food .
neutral	unfortunately it seems as if they are making up on the free_shipping by charging more for the cat_litter they sell .
neutral	i really don_'_t mind it being a little more ( for the convenience of having it sent to my home ) but almost 0 times the cost of my local_grocery_store is a bit much .
neutral	i purchased two dresses from the site .
neutral	all went_smoothly and i received my package in an efficient manner .
neutral	however , upon_opening i was disappointed that one of the dresses was stamped " out of stock ".
neutral	it would have been nice to have been informed prior to purchasing or an update with the delivery information .
neutral	maneuvering the site on line was confusing as it appeared to offer 00_%_off 0st delivery as if ' new customer ' but in fact you have to sign_up for auto deliv to get this discount and it is really only a max of $_00 ..
neutral	i found this deceptive .
neutral	most prices were competetive but i did pay $ 0 more for candidae dog_food .
neutral	i ordered what i wanted , but wasn_'_t told up front that it '_s on back order .
neutral	i would have chosen a different company .
neutral	in fact , i ordered this about a week_ago and it still_hasn_'_t shipped .
neutral	thanks for asking me to rate this company .
neutral	i '_m going to go cancel the order right now and find another company .
neutral	some time your web_site can be a little_bit_slow and i could not find some restaurant that i ' d like to order food from .
neutral	it feels too thick and short across inside of my hand .
neutral	i end up ripping it off half way through my wod .
neutral	sort of disappointed .
neutral	maybe using during a regular gym routine . but i wouldn_'_t recommend for cross fit .
neutral	errors made and refuind still not forthcoming
neutral	i liked renting from autoeurope ...
neutral	the only issue was when i was returning the car in barcelona ...
neutral	i was told that i had agreed ( in bilbao where we pixked the car up ) to an " upgrade ".
neutral	i never agreed to an upgrade -- and i prepaid this car months earlier .
neutral	i sid ask about a small charge on the bilbao contract ( as again i had prepaid ) and the woman said " that '_s only in case it '_s not full of gas upon your return ... it doesm '_t matter and you '_ve paid already ."
neutral	i was angered rightfully when i was later told i had agreed to an upgrade .
neutral	i did not agree to any upgrade and i feel i was taken_advantage of as a foreigner with a knowledge of only basic spanish .
neutral	i would tell anyone_who_asks me to be weary of what you ' re told at autoeurope .
neutral	your amazon uk prices of various sisley creams , are way too expensive , even more so than harrods .
neutral	this is contrary to the spirit of amazon .
neutral	i was really looking_forward to receiving my skins , but i have to say that they didn_'_t meet my expectations .
neutral	the skins are nice , even more so with the wallpapers , but they are really inaccurate .
neutral	the size doesn_'_t completely match the phone .
neutral	on the back , the skin is too short in the width and too long in the length , finishing somewhat over the slot for the charger .
neutral	on the front , it '_s too long and overlaps a little the only button there is .
neutral	i am talking of millimetres , but still ...
neutral	at the first time when i saw clothes on yesstyle . com , i was not sure whether i would get the one i wanted , because clothes here are sold at cheaper price .
neutral	but when i got those clothes , awesome .
neutral	i still like to wear those asian_style clothes .
neutral	just one thing you need to make_sure is that quality of clothes is various .
neutral	but overall , it is good .
neutral	you can be a good asian stylist with clothes from here !
neutral	:)
neutral	i think the iphone 0 cover i order fitted too snugly with the phone & it was very difficult to take it out .
neutral	the pull - out tab to pop the phone out didn_'_t work as well .
neutral	had to use a plier to pry the phone out of the snugg cover .
neutral	perhaps it shouldn_'_t be manufactured too tightly .
neutral	i ' d actually would like mine to be replaced for a new one .
neutral	was pretty excited to receive it though .
neutral	i bough a pair of glasses and also prescription sun_glasses .
neutral	i love my glasses , they look exactly like the picture online .
neutral	unfortunately the sunglasses didn_'_t !
neutral	i was a little disappointment with them .
neutral	it also took a long time for the order to arrive , with little communication to keep me updated .
neutral	i can not argue with the price though !
neutral	i have managed to get 0 pairs of glasses for less the the cost of one pair at specsavers !
neutral	thanks yvonne
neutral	second time this happened to me .
neutral	tried to contact a customer_service rep . by phone , but there is no phone # available .
neutral	tried the only available # for phone orders , but are forced to listen to suicidal music for ever .
neutral	any way it is quite similar to the old wrenchhead . com .
neutral	makes me wonder_if there is a connection ????????????
neutral	?
neutral	look ..................... this is my only_complaint .
neutral	good company , but must operate like a real retail company and have a customer_service hot line .
neutral	need the personal_touch .
neutral	burtis
neutral	ps i would recommend them , and still do .
neutral	the inside check in was great fast and wonderful .
neutral	better work on the drivers timing .
neutral	they were late arriving
neutral	i recently_purchased two skimmer plugs for my inground pool .
neutral	the size i ordered was supposed to be 0 0 / 00 " by 0 0 / 0 ".
neutral	when i received them and measured , they both were 0 00 / 00 " by 0 0 / 0 ".
neutral	i called customer_service and told the man that they were not 0 0 / 00 ".
neutral	he said he would get one from the warehouse and call me back .
neutral	he called back and said that it was 0 0 / 00 " and he would mail me two more at no cost .
neutral	i just received two more today and guess what -- they are 0 00 / 00 ".
neutral	what am i not getting here ?
neutral	do they have a different ruler than i do ????
neutral	anyone_else have this problem ???
neutral	?
neutral	i recommend drive time only because the benefits are good .
neutral	as far as staff i don_'_t recommend .
neutral	they were slow , changed the deal every time they came to the desk .
neutral	didn_'_t tell us about the programs .
neutral	we were there until 00 : 00 at night .
neutral	they don_'_t take trade in very well .
neutral	over all i wouldn_'_t go back to the lakeland store .
neutral	i ordered a pair of ugg boots from very over the internet and after filling out all of the information boxes a message at the end said that the transaction hadn_'_t been processed .
neutral	very annoying !!
neutral	i ordered the boots from another site then received an_email from very saying my transaction had processed .
neutral	as i had paid the full_amount with my debit_card this could have resulted in my getting a charge from the bank .
neutral	fortunately i had sufficient funds to cover it however this may not be the case for others .
neutral	i then tried to call several_times to cancel my order and couldn_'_t get through on the phone at all and an_email wasn_'_t replied to until the next_day while i was at work .
neutral	the upshot was that i had to reparcel the boots and take them to a collect_+ store which was a bit of an inconvenience , although my money was refunded very quickly .
neutral	typically i avoid best_western hotels because the standard and consistency of premier_inn is far_superior in this budget hotel category .
neutral	i have some problems with shipping , it was really late ( 00 days )
neutral	the prices were real good and everything was there but it took a long time for the parts to get here ..
neutral	i saved a little over a hundred and twenty_five dollars going thru parts_geek .
neutral	you would just have to weigh out the money to the time on how long they take to get here .
neutral	although the room was great and the rate was awesome , the hotel did not have my information when i arrived .
neutral	we had to wait for over 00_minutes to see if they were going to honor my receipt stating my reservation .
neutral	i had never had this issue when using hotels . com or any other site i have used .
neutral	nice t shirt , received with happy face .
neutral	bought for daughters boyfriend . with p_+ p was hefty in price .
neutral	faultless , prompt and speedy_delivery as always . would be five_stars for t shirt but only three because price made me cry . they have finished with each other now !
neutral	grrr
neutral	i have been a customer for 0 years .
neutral	last june i renewed my membership using a special you advertised receiving a nice discount ( bought and paid for ), even_though my membership did not end until october .
neutral	imagine my shock 0 days ago when i saw you charged my credit_card the the full price for a years renewal .
neutral	obviously no one borrowed to realize i already had the renewal .
neutral	upon seeing the receipt i immediately sent an_email to your company .
neutral	when i received no response , the next_day i called the number on the receipt yesterday morning , and was informed they automatically renewed my membership .
neutral	evidently i never noticed the check mark they entered on that option .
neutral	i told the man i had already renewed it on my own and wanted my charge account credited immediately .
neutral	the man said he would send my request to the sales department for a refund credit right_away .
neutral	i contacted my charge account company nad informed them this was a fraudulant charge , that they had no authorization and to please remove the charge from my account .
neutral	it is now 0 days_later , it is 00pm friday_night and the charge has not yet been removed .
neutral	needless to say i am not at all happy and next june i will have to give some serious thought to renewing with you .
neutral	i ordered 00 clothing items and they were all very pretty however i ordered 0 pairs of jeans .
neutral	each pair of jeans were size 0 but fit like a size 0 and i couldn_'_t get any of them past my upper thigh .
neutral	the sizes were misleading and not true to size .
neutral	i was very disappointed with that .
neutral	i '_m 0 ' 0 and 000_lbs so the size 0 jeans should have easily fit me .
neutral	the rest of the clothing was in decent condition except for one sleevless peach color see through shirt with black trim down the middle and on the collar .
neutral	the shirt had heart_shaped buttons and when i button the brand_new shirt for the very first time two of the buttons fell right off !
neutral	i was very upset with this because i paid a total of $_000 . 00 for the clothing .
neutral	i really like the quality of my cover , but it doesn_'_t stay on the chair when you get up .
neutral	it it moves and has to be tucked in before you sit on it again .
neutral	other then that i really like it .
neutral	priceline did find us a nice hotel , but after we checked in we realized that if we had just went to the hotels personal website we could have saved money !
neutral	i thought that was supposed to be pricelines job , guess they fell short this time .
neutral	what seemed to be a good service and advertised as easy on the tv has proved slow and tiresome .
neutral	contact emails go unansered and it takes at_least 0_weeks to see any money
neutral	not ideal - would have been better selling on ebay !
neutral	couch was delivered at almost 00pm on a friday .
neutral	the gentleman_who installed the legs stripped the hole out , so if i want to move it just slightly someone_else has to hold leg in place .
neutral	also is a 0 inch rip on corner of ottoman .
neutral	not prime tourist season so fewer buses
neutral	i '_ve used rev . com for two different projects now , and while overall i am happy with them , especially with speed of turnaround and friendly customer_service , my latest batch of transcripts received poor marks from the researchers who had to use them .
neutral	poor transcription , lots of errors and misspelled words , etc .
neutral	forced the researchers to have to listen to the original videos again .
neutral	this made for a costly analysis phase because we found we couldn_'_t rely_on the quality of the transcripts .
neutral	i personally think that animoto needs more space for cations and more themes for choosing .
neutral	they should all people use whatever theme they want to .
neutral	the dented_cans of cat and dog_food are driving me crazy .
neutral	it was five cans this time .
neutral	i have to have someone help me open them with a manual can opener cause i almost broke my automatic can opener .
neutral	i have to be vigilant since companies do change their formulas and since my dog has chronic pancreatitis , she is allowed a certain percentage of protein and fat .
neutral	exactly as i said in my sentance above .
neutral	i had to phone my bank to check you hadn_'_t taken my money three_times .
neutral	very annoying .
neutral	badly translated , tiny written_instructions , needed magnifying glass to read them .
neutral	phone_call enquiry not returned .
neutral	i was satisfied with the tour overall .
neutral	the only_complaint is that because i ordered my ticket online , but was unable to print out the ticket , when i got to the stop near charing cross , i was told to go to the office near victoria_station , or to an internet caffe to print out the ticket .
neutral	i received a different answer calling the information centre , which told me to ask the staff at the stop to place a call and they can handle the document .
neutral	in the end , i went to the office and the whole journey took up nearly 0 hours , far too long for my liking .
neutral	the young_man i talked with seemed pleasant a d patient with a sincere desire to help .
neutral	he had to make several_attempts to book me a room because the room would indicate the book already booked and unavailable .
neutral	i was using my debit_card , so i checked my account on line that night .
neutral	i discovered that there were two charges pending on my checking_account .
neutral	i called the reservation_counter back immediately and was told that if the charges went through , i would deal with my bank .
neutral	also , the confirmation came in on my e_- mail for both charges .
neutral	the greater charge was for the room that was not available .
neutral	the charge for the room we secured was about $ 0 . 00 more than quoted to me .
neutral	today when i checked my bank_account , both charges had been deducted from my account .
neutral	i have called my bank and filed a claim .
neutral	i do not understand how i can be charged for a room that was not available , and makes me leery_about going through this route in the future .
neutral	the reservation was under the name of my niece , stacy pettyjohn , as it was for and her mother , and i was not staying there .
neutral	i understand that airlines have the right to change their flight schedules at anytime but i feel as though i didn_'_t get what i paid for .
neutral	i purchased my return flight ( that departed a little later ) at a higher price than a flight that was going to leave earlier .
neutral	i did this for 0 reasons_: so the people dropping us at the airport would not have to wake_up so early and to avoid a 0 hour layover .
neutral	however , the airline changed the flight and put me and my family on the earlier flight which i had spent extra money trying to avoid .
neutral	also , changing the flight to an earlier time didn_'_t get me home any sooner , i actually arrived later .
neutral	the extra money i spent was a complete_waste .
neutral	i received my goods in 0 days but unfortunately they were damaged .
neutral	i have returned the goods and hopefully will receive a full_refund soon .
neutral	this will not prevent me from oreding from festive_lights in the future
neutral	the service received from boilerjuice was excellent , with a good follow_up service .
neutral	unfortunately they have been let_down badly by the supplier , butler_fuels who have a variable approach to customer_service .
neutral	they telephoned the day before delivery , which was good .
neutral	having waited around all day for the oil to be delivered , it did not turn up so i telephoned them at 0 . 00pm and was told that there were roadworks which_meant the oil couldn_'_t be delivered .
neutral	nobody thought it necessary to telephone me with this information .
neutral	no apology was forthcoming and i was advised it would be delivered the following_day .
neutral	the tanker_driver couldn_'_t have been more helpful , however , and was polite and efficient , even in the pouring_rain .
neutral	why doesn_'_t anyone ever apologise for bad service ?
neutral	i was very pleased with the product choices available .
neutral	it was the first time i was ordering incontinence products and it was a great help to compare the various product choices .
neutral	i also like being_able to order a case and the packaging was very discrete .
neutral	my overall rating was lower_than a 0_star because my coupon_code was not accepted .
neutral	i like the idea of ordering pet products online with quick home delivery .
neutral	unfortunately the web_site for petflow . com is pretty bad .
neutral	it is hard to search .
neutral	forget trying to browse .
neutral	key words do not necessarily bring up all the available items .
neutral	you pretty_much need to know exactly_what item you need .
neutral	if you want to look around for new products be prepared to spend some time .
neutral	i had already purchased a groupon deal so i had to buy off the site .
neutral	otherwise i would have given up when i realized how difficult it was to use the web_site .
neutral	i managed to find what i needed and place my order .
neutral	shipping and delivery was pretty quick .
neutral	it was well - packaged , the product was fresh , and the order was complete .
neutral	but i probably will not order from seller again because of the poorly designed site .
neutral	ten days since order was placed and i still_haven_'_t received my order .
neutral	i have shopped lots from online nygard and have always got good products .
neutral	for some_reason the shipping has_been very bad this time .
neutral	love your products , love your selection , love your sales and your speed of light shipping , but your web_site makes me crazy !
neutral	on the left , there are all the options i must choose such as type of pet , then i have to click on dry or canned_food , then i have to choose age , conditions , lifestyle and brand .
neutral	i have absolutely no problem with these category lists , but what drives me nuts is that your web_page refreshes after each_individual click .
neutral	it takes soooooo much more time to wait on your site to refresh after each option .
neutral	i shop online a lot and the way your site refreshes takes_longer_than other_sites and the page also jumps so i have to scroll back down to continue choosing the dog_food category i need .
neutral	it would rock my world if your site was capable of letting a customer select all the categories before the page refreshes .
neutral	a few_weeks_ago you ran a sale and your site page was jumping out of control .
neutral	after about 00_minutes of getting nowhere , i called and complained .
neutral	i was told by your customer_service rep that pet_flow is loosing sales over this .
neutral	she said she listens to complaints about your web_site all the time .
neutral	:-(
neutral	we made our reservations in december for our february trip to jamaica .
neutral	we reserved a king_bed but when we checked in they told us they did not have any available and check back the next_day .
neutral	we asked for a room with a safe .
neutral	we didn_'_t get it until the next_day when they " found " us a room with king_bed .
neutral	only problem was a band that played at night outside our window !
neutral	most of the hotel people were rude or just didn_'_t care .
neutral	maybe it is their custom not to be friendly .
neutral	could not make reservations for dining on the same day but the card the hotel provided said you could make reservations from 0 a . m . until 0 p . m . air_conditioner in 0st room would not adjust ... we froze .
neutral	probably will not return to this hotel .
neutral	the photo printing quality was good but i '_m not happy about the delivery charges .
neutral	if they still had a shop near it would have cost me about 0 quid less .
neutral	really annoyed about having to pay 0 delivery charges too for 0 order !
neutral	also would have liked matt prints not gloss but couldn_'_t see the option ( if it exists ).
neutral	i was approved .
neutral	they had many cars to choose from .
neutral	it was a good experience .
neutral	this was the first time i ordered from mr . chewy , i was excited , loved the prices , loved the online_chat and the ease of ordering ... then it happened , i drove up and there was only 0 box , i thought right_away that i '_m missing something .
neutral	sure enough , 0 case of wellness for senior canned_dog_food did not get shipped .
neutral	i had only bought enough food for the week and planned on having my order when i got home .
neutral	i called customer_service , very pleasant person answered the phone and confirmed that warehouse had made a mistake .
neutral	i had to go to my local_petsmart store and buy more after all .
neutral	it was an inconvenience to say the least .
neutral	i thought maybe i should just buy from my local_store ?
neutral	i hope this is helpful !
neutral	leanne scanlon
neutral	i receive notifications of gift_card availability .
neutral	when i go on the site , there is a list of available cards .
neutral	i pick which ones i want , enter my mailing_address ( why it '_s not stored , can '_t say ), then confirm my billing information .
neutral	when i get to the last step to pay , the cards are no_longer available !
neutral	the site returns me to the list which still has the same cards listed - very frustrating because then i don_'_t trust what is really available .
neutral	it took 0 tries before i finally purchased 0 gift_cards that were still available .
neutral	i cannot understand_why they cannot remove the card or put " pending purchase " so you don_'_t choose the same one someone_else is purchasing .
neutral	everything was o . k .. but just o . k ..
neutral	the guide was very boring and unenthusiastic .
neutral	he seemed to be counting the minutes til he was finished .
neutral	i would use you first , i used to but you have such a long list of what you don_'_t carry that it stops me using you regularly as a lot of the stuff i sell is prohibited and its hard enough booking on - line without_worrying if it is a prohibited item .
neutral	great product and applicator bought , however i paid for next_day delivery and twice they failed to deliver saying address could not be found but no contact by phone etc by delivery driver until the second attempt
neutral	flowers nice ( but not brilliant for the money ) - however , main complaint is that i specifically_asked for the delivery to be left with a neighbour if the individual was not available .
neutral	this instruction was ignored , and flowers were just left abandoned on the door_step in full view of passers by .
neutral	not good !
neutral	!
neutral	my first experience was better , everything was fitting well ... this time , i love the frames but the left eye have a problem .
neutral	something is wrong with it and of course , no way to know what it is so impossible to wear .
neutral	the deals on wowcher are great , and i '_ve had some cracking purchases .
neutral	however , for some of the experiences it can be difficult to get a convenient appointment .
neutral	in fact , for one experience there were no convenient dates at all before the expiry_date .
neutral	i tried to change the experience for something_else but wowcher customer_services were not very helpful .
neutral	they kept referring me back to the vendor , who kept referring me back to wowcher .
neutral	when wowcher finally begrudgingly credited my wowcher_wallet i was made to feel_like a nuisance customer .
neutral	i keep my purchases simple now .
neutral	:-\
neutral	i placed the order a month back and was told to wait 00 working days for delivery to singapore .
neutral	have emailed twice since then regarding my order which i still havent received .
neutral	i always get an_automated_response that i will be contacted soon .
neutral	its been over a month since the items were shipped and i have no_idea how long it will take before they reach me or if they even reach me .
neutral	it was quick and the management was friendly , first month was $ 0 but failed to mention other fees so i ended going somewhere_else where they have me exact price before i drove over there .
neutral	i have a iphone 0 that was locked to at & t .
neutral	i had to wait almost three_weeks for my phone to unlocked with my imei unlock .
neutral	in the meantime , there was almost no customer_service response despite numerous_emails to then asking for an_approximate far for when my phone would be unlocked .
neutral	works but take a a while .
neutral	sent several messages and never reecieve a response or created and also a won card which i was saving to swap its been several weeks
neutral	site items ship fast , always in stock , the sex toys are from known_brands .
neutral	customer_service via_email or phone .
neutral	they got the job_done , but initially on my ticket , i received an_email that said there was a $_000 change fee , and the change fee was $_000 , plus the cost of the change in ticket price .
neutral	oh , well .
neutral	they did answer the phone promptly , etc_., although when the representative said there were rules associated with my change of flight , etc_., she could not tell me what the rules were ...
neutral	this time the person made an_error and ordered me 0 bottles of adreset when
neutral	i only ordered one .
neutral	this one is expensive and now i have about an extra
neutral	two hundred_dollars on my credit_card .
neutral	that is a problem as i have to be
neutral	careful with my spending and always pay off my bill every_month .
neutral	now where
neutral	do i come up with and extra two hundred_dollars to pay my bill .
neutral	the service from the personnel at the cotswold_company was terrific .
neutral	problems began when the delivery company cancelled the delivery on the day itself ., my daughter contacted the company and was told that there had been a computer error , which frankly was not believable unless they run two_separate data systems which do not ' talk ' to each other .
neutral	the delivery had been confirmed by email .
neutral	this inconvenienced me a lot as i had arranged for the council to take away the old sideboard and moved furniture to allow for the delivery of the new one , not easy for someone of 00 with a bad hip .
neutral	on the day of the new delivery my daughter had to ring the company again to remind them that a time before 00pm had been guaranteed .
neutral	they then duly_arrived with the sideboard before 00pm but interrupted filming by the bbc of me and my home .
neutral	not very convenient to say the least and one that could have been avoided if they had stuck to their original delivery date .
neutral	my daughter recommended me to top cash_back .
neutral	i have been happy with it on the whole but have had a number of occasions when the site does not recognise my purchases and i have had to raise a claim which is very long and drawn out process .
neutral	resolutions rarely come to fruition .
neutral	meeting was fine , greeting took 00_minutes from call to car - too long
neutral	had a little trouble with 0st order as received partial wrong order .
neutral	had to insist that they send out proper order immediately as i have 0 big dogs between 0 0 / 0 and 00 and in need of food immediately .
neutral	explain to csr and he was the smart one .
neutral	got the food the following_monday and donated puppy_food to foreclosed upon puppies at petsmart .
neutral	dropping my car off the service was perfect , someone there to meet me and all done and dusted in 0mins .
neutral	pick_up however was not good , i called the number at_0am , when i had got my bag and was told my car would be at the pickup point 00 - 00mins later .
neutral	i arrived at the pick_up point and waited , and waited .
neutral	after 00mins i called the number again to be told that the driver was ' having to go around again ' and would be with me in 00_mins , although this clearly wasn_'_t true .
neutral	i waited a further 00_mins and the driver finally showed_up with my car .
neutral	i asked what had taken so long and he said my car had been blocked in by a car with a flat battery .
neutral	these things happen but if i had been told this in the first place i could have waited in the terminal rather in the freezing_cold rain .
neutral	not an experience i would want to repeat .
neutral	please answer your phone if you can return my call
neutral	i '_ve used the service before and had an_issue that customer_service resolved very well .
neutral	however , now that i am looking in oslo , norway , i see that none of the hotels are indicating whether the rooms are smokers rooms or non_- smokers rooms .
neutral	this is a standard where i am from originally , the u . s ., and is very important to me .
neutral	it must be that booking . com is not providing a field for the hotels to complete to provide this info / choice .
neutral	major flaw since - as a result , i am forced to call the hotel i make a reservation with , and possibly go back to the drawing board if it turns_out the hotel i reserved with does not offer the non_- smoker option .
neutral	if i do have to do the work all over again , i '_ll find a hotel agreggator website that can provide this option for me up front .
neutral	if i have to call the hotels directly , then it isn_'_t worth booking first through booking . com
neutral	i still have not received an item from my first order and have not yet been issued a credit .
neutral	i did try to call and was put on hold for an extended length of time and was not able to speak to anyone .
neutral	one pair of boots i ordered had what looked like melted plastic on theml
neutral	i purchased a pair of ray_ban sunglasses .
neutral	i was very happy with your website , payment_options and fast shipping .. however , your courier service completely lets you down , to the extent that i would avoid purchasing again from your website due to the hassle
neutral	a postage slip was left at the door and when we called to organise a redelivery , the package was forgotten several_times and i needed to call every day to find out why the package had not been delivered .
neutral	i was told there was not enough information on the package however when i asked what more was needed other than a name , address and phone_number , the toll customer_service rep was stumped ... i finally received my sunglasses two_weeks after they were initially dispatched ... with at_least 0 phone_calls needed to make_sure they reached me .. i paid $_00 postage for these glasses and did not receive the service i paid for ... i would suggest finding a more reliable company to compliment your online service .
neutral	it such a shame you will loose business because they are disorganised
neutral	as usual glasses on arrival are a perfect fit and good quality .
neutral	however the process has_been difficult with this order - 0 pairs ordered were out of stock and information not sent until some time after order had been reviewed .
neutral	will look around other on line suppliers for next order .
neutral	i ordered my sons skates , and was pleased with the price the delivery price was great , however .............
neutral	when it came to receiving the skates i was out so went online to get them delivered to the local depot .
neutral	my local deport is purley way and it wouldn_'_t let_me book it here , i had to go to se0 .
neutral	where i had to wait an_hour becuase they couldn_'_t find my parcel and there were lots of complaints too .
neutral	rawk is good but would be better to use a different delivery company .
neutral	when they finally did find my parcel i was told it was outside of where it should have been , which signals to me that someone had placed it there to steal later on .
neutral	this is terrible and unacceptable .
neutral	if a card is left then when you arrive to collect your parcel it cannot be found shows that things are dodgy .
neutral	my son got his skates and is very happy .
neutral	clothes were great , but i had to return a dress that was too short and it took a month to receive a credit back .
neutral	i emailed them to check if it takes that long normally and they instantly credited it , so i don_'_t know if something went wrong with mine or if it always takes that long .
neutral	delighted with the bargain i thought i got until i seen same thing in asda for £ 0 each .
neutral	still meant i got a bit of a deal at 0 for £_00 but not as good as what i initially was lead to believe as they retail at £_00 . 00 each on site .
neutral	nice lights but wish i hadnt rushed into buying another 0 sets for family_members who could have taken more time and got gradually from asda
neutral	very helpful but too costly for hotel and airfare !
neutral	do not like added fee to use phone help !!
neutral	!
neutral	the prices cannot be beat here , and it is super easy to make it cheaper if a competitor has a better price .
neutral	the big downside is that the shipping_costs are higher_than most .
neutral	product arrived in excellent condition - but took several days longer_than anticipoated - this review request arrived three_days before the product was delivered which made it seem that the product delivery time was longer_than intended
neutral	having used other meet and greet services , i must_admit i was disappointed with " diamond meet and greet ".
neutral	when i booked online i said i would be at the airport north_terminal at 0 . 00am and they called at 0 . 00am saying that i had booked a collection at the south terminal ( i hadn_'_t and my booking confirmation confirmed that ).
neutral	they called again when we were on our way chasing where we were even_though we were well ahead of our 0 . 00am arrival time .
neutral	on our return they asked us to call once we had landed ( i did ) and then again once we had claimed our_luggage ( i did ).
neutral	they said they would meet us at the same drop_off point .
neutral	i had to call them again to find out where they were as we waited outside in the rain , at 00 . 00am , with a 0 year_old some 00_minutes since claiming our baggage .
neutral	very disappointed ,
neutral	ordered an indesit tuble dryer with all the bells and whistles ( lots of anti crease options , iron options and approx 00 different settings ).
neutral	the exact_same model was available from argos and for a similar price ( approx_£ 0 difference ) we ordered from 000 as we hadn_'_t had a problem with them in the past .
neutral	when we ordered , we were advised delivery was approx 00 days .... we selected our desired delivery date and waited .
neutral	the evening ( yes , evening ) before it was due to be delivered we received a call saying it wasn_'_t going to happen and may be the day after .
neutral	luckily neither or us had booked a day off work to be home to take delivery ( it would have been too late to cancel and we would have wasted a day '_s holiday ) luckily we asked for delivery to our work place .
neutral	the next_day came and went with no phone_call ..... then the following week came and we had to keep phoning to ask where it was .
neutral	by this point , i had enough and phoned up explaining that we have a baby in the house and ( at that point the weather was bad ) needed the tumble_dryer as we both work and dont have time to keep the house looking like a laundrette ..... the guy couldn_'_t have cared less and told me i could always cancel my order - by this point it was 0_weeks since ordering ... there was no understanding , compassion or any acknowledgment of loyalty ( we have ordered approx 0 big items from them over the last 0 years ) or i could change my order to an inferior model with far less programme modes etc and they would graciously refund me the difference in price !
neutral	or i could have a more_expensive model (£ 00 ish ) and pay the difference ..... tumble_dryer eventually turned_up this week , one month after ordering ( found out it was due to be delivered after chasing them for an update ).
neutral	the tumble_dryer itself is great , but thats more to do with indesit than 000 .
neutral	to be honest , they have lost a loyal_customer and would not reccommend them to anyone .....
neutral	try to con you into paying every year when you only want to buy for one .
neutral	you have to figure_out how to switch the roll over off after you pay .
neutral	you can '_t simply opt_out before you purchase .
neutral	it seems a bit underhanded to me , but that '_s what you get for buying cheap travel_insurance i guess .
neutral	really a good web_site to order from , and very cheap prices
neutral	but they need a better suport team , to talk to when you need them
neutral	die_blumen zur beerdigung meiner oma kamen puenklich an . ich hatte ein weisses trauergesteck bestellt_und_es kam leider ein grosser weiss / rosa farbener blumenstrau $ an , der bildlich total abweichend war als online dargestellt !
neutral	=(
neutral	i found it difficult to order online
neutral	the food was delivered in 0 days which was acceptable .
neutral	the box that the ( 0 ) 00_lb , and ( 0 ) 0 lb_bags were pkged in had broken open ......... luckily it was a sunny day .... not raining ..
neutral	i don_'_t feel the pkg was strong_enough to withstand shipment , either the cardboard or the packing_tape .
neutral	then when i checked the exp .
neutral	date on the blue_buffalo cat_food , it was well within the time , but the lot was actually 0 months older than what i got at my tractor_supply_store , at $ 0 . 00 more per bag of blue_buffalo #.
neutral	so i may order from you in a pinch , but wasn_'_t overly impressed .
neutral	check - out cart deleted first - time discount ; wrote to customer_service and had to correspond twice to get it resolved .
neutral	it took over a week to receive a bag of dog_food .
neutral	for the price , it is a decent strand of pearls but i was disappointed because roughly half of the pearls are oval shape .
neutral	the description on the website stated the shape was round however this is not the case
neutral	.
neutral	i carried on with booking a flight without trying other_websites because i had already missed out on a flight that was advertised as being available and i don_'_t think that is good enough .
neutral	if steph hadn_'_t needed to catch a flight to london later that day i would have tried searching again .
neutral	so , would i use this website again , probably not , as it was not wholly reliable in info given .
neutral	this website did a good job of providing information ; however , i wish you could enter an address rather_than a zip_code .
neutral	i finally received my product , but i ordered my coffeetable in april and received it in september .
neutral	we had a lot of correspondence about it and everytime there was another reason_why the coffeetable wasn_'_t going to be delivered yet .
neutral	at the end i received the table , and the table is ok .
neutral	i was disappointed that there was an unpleasant ( to me ) smell to the millet husks .
neutral	i already had a buckwheat_pillow , purchased elsewhere from another source several_years_ago .
neutral	i have used it as a pillow , but thought the millet might be more pleasant .
neutral	i am not returning the millet husk pillow , as i have gone back to sleeping on my buckwheat_pillow , as before .
neutral	i am going to use the millet husk pillow for meditation , as i can '_t smell it .
neutral	i thought i read quite a bit on the website , but either i missed something about the smell issue , or it wasn_'_t clearly indicated .
neutral	i liked the feel of the millet .
neutral	and the absence of sound .
neutral	order was delivered really quickly , although it was lucky my husband happened to be at home as he had to get it off the lorry himself .
neutral	fitting was mostly straight_forward , although the flush mechanism needed adapting as it does not fit in the unit with a water pipe attached , and we still need to buy the bolts to fix the toilet to the floorcascwe didntvrealisevthey weren_'_t included as they always have been with other purchases elsewhere .
neutral	overall quality seems good and service was good , just the points above which spoilt it a bit .
neutral	i was pleased the ink_cartridges ( color & black ) arrived within a very short time_frame .
neutral	although the color ink prints ok , some of the colors look faded and difficult to read .
neutral	when ordering my appliances i was unable to complete the transaction on line so i phoned my order through , the lady was very help full i completed my orders , cooker , hood and a fridge with £_00 of iceland vouchers i was very pleased with the help and support i was given by the lady , we arranged a date for delivery , the delivery service was excellent through out the day every thing went well they kept me up to date on the time of delivery , first_class service from them , so thankyou .
neutral	i phoned the office to get my number so i could give my feed back , i asked them about my vouchers , but they told me i was to late , i was shocked to here that i was to late as i didnt_realise there was a time_slot , this was not explained to me on the phone , i feel this was very misleading and i am not happy about this , this has changed my opinion from an excellent service to a misleading one . not sure now if i would recommend this service to anyone_else , or use it again myself .
neutral	i have found boikler juice very reliab le but do wish they would only send me emails twice a year not every week
neutral	before buying any deal i would recomend that you do a quick search of the product on the internet as i reckon 0 times out of 00 you can get the exact_same product cheaper with the " deal "!
neutral	!
neutral	fox rental_car in san_diego has a very small lot , and on the day i rented , it took me less_than 0 minutes at the counter , but 00_minutes to get out of the traffic_jam .
neutral	the car was a chevy aveo , and it is a turd .
neutral	it has this weird auto starter crank when you turn the key on , and the tire_pressure light stayed on the whole time .
neutral	fox is great value for the money , but i will ask for a different model of car the next time .
neutral	too many days ( 0 ) to be completed the production of my purchase .
neutral	and seven_days more to receive it abroad .
neutral	the whole buying process , from ease of using the website , to ordering , to receiving the item within timescale was excellent .
neutral	the prices on the website are great , no_doubt about it .
neutral	however , i was disappointed when i received the ring as the gold band was way thinner_than in the represented pictures on the website , as was the gold arounf the ' setting ' or the diamond .
neutral	compared to rings available on the high_street , the band is quite inferior .
neutral	it is absolutely a case of you get what you pay for .
neutral	am i happy with what i got for what i paid ?
neutral	yes , of course .
neutral	but in hindsight , i may have been better spending a couple of hundred quid more to have a better quality item ...
neutral	most of my parts came with in a couple of days , some took a week all parts fit except for the brakes were wrong .
neutral	i don_'_t like the fact that you cant call their company to make_sure the parts your ordering are right , and you have to put out the money to find out what they sent is wrong part ... customer_service takes_forever to get back to you when you want to return parts , then they tell you that it may be i ordered wrong part and then they don_'_t get back to you quickly after you tell then they sent a wrong part or their parts are wrong .. very frustrating
neutral	i started_using figleaves many years_ago because my bra size doesn_'_t exist here in the states .
neutral	there used to be free_shipping for orders over $_00 and free returns .
neutral	it also felt_like there were more sales at that time .
neutral	i can appreciate that perhaps this wasn_'_t cost_effective for the company .
neutral	it would be nice if there could be more deals offered to loyal_customers .
neutral	was abit let_down as some of the photos wasn_'_t very clear .
neutral	shame as layout and service was great but just the couple that are blurry ruined it abit x
neutral	the hostel was easy to find , it was very clean it had a nice small kitchen but there was no real common area so you couldn_'_t really meet new people and that is just way i go to hostels .
neutral	i ordered a pair of sunglasses with prescription lenses .
neutral	i need to have very dark lenses due to a eye condition and i specifically ordered polycarbonate lenses with a vlt rating of 00_%, meaning that only 00_% of light can pass through them .
neutral	when they arrived the lenses were so light i could clearly see my eyes in the mirror , and was still squinting when i went outside in daylight .
neutral	when i called about the issue they apologized , but didn_'_t offer an explanation for why they post a vlt of 00_% if that '_s not what they deliver .
neutral	they offered to replace the lenses with plastic lenses that could be tinted darker .
neutral	plastic is not as durable as polycarbonate , and is cheaper material but they did not refund me any of my payment .
neutral	when i finally got my replacement lenses they were a bit darker than the originals , but nowhere_near my raybans which have a 00_% vlt , much less 00_%.
neutral	i am disappointed that they would advertise lenses that are rated a certain tint and then not provide that product .
neutral	floraqueen was selected from the internet as seeming to be value for money but having seen a picture of the flowers delivered to my granddaughter in florida , i was more than a little disappointed .
neutral	i felt they were rather expensive for what was delivered .
neutral	will not use floraqueen again .
neutral	i ordered a flower deliver on friday 00th_oct to be delivered to the recipient in utah usa on monday - selecting ' before 0pm ' option given .
neutral	i received the order confirmation .
neutral	i have never received advice that the delivery was made , and contacted customer_services on tuesday 00th_oct - they replied to say they would get in touch with their local supplier and get back to me shortly .
neutral	nothing received and again i messaged customer_services for any update .
neutral	thankfully the recipient got in touch on wednesday 00th_oct to say thank_you the delivery had been received .
neutral	but to date still nothing received from floraqueen - so no_explanation or recompense for my order not being delivered when specified .
neutral	i will not be ordering from floraqueen again and cannot say strongly enough that keeping the person_who has placed the order up to date is paramount .
neutral	hotel was nice ... some what overcrowded and hotel cleaning staff was a bit too loud but overall experience was good
neutral	great size and quality throw but colours re very muted , bought it to match curtains and it is considerably lighter in colour , very pretty but .
neutral	great shame .
neutral	wouldn_'_t have been happy if had paid full price for it
neutral	the app says we charge no fees but the amount taken out of my account does have extra_fees from the price quoted .
neutral	i do like the easy use of the app and speed .
neutral	i will use this website , but i will avoid to buying from the abc gift_card .
neutral	finding the checkout on the web_page is not very clear .
neutral	i love order from fashion queen but there is always missing things when i got my order .
neutral	and getting answers about mine questions from email is not everytime quickly .
neutral	waiting time for orders to getting home is always take long time
neutral	i tracked my package and it sat in one place for over 0 days and over a week to get !
neutral	there was no option for over nighting the part , which i needed very much .
neutral	the part came in such a huge box and the part itself was small so that big box was unnecessary .
neutral	overall im glad i got the part and i didn_'_t have to pay an_arm and leg for it .
neutral	i ordered 0 - 0 ft leland cypress .
neutral	i had looked at this same size tree at a local_nursery and it was just what i wanted .
neutral	i ordered the tree from brighter booms at 00_%_off and free_shipping .
neutral	doesn_'_t get much_better_than that !
neutral	no_worries_about how i was going to get the tree home , it would be delivered right to my door !
neutral	the tree arrived within a couple days .
neutral	i was so pleased , until i opened the box .
neutral	it looks very healthy and is indeed 0 - 0 ft tall but it is the scrawniness tree i '_ve ever_seen .
neutral	reminds_me of a charlie brown christmas_tree !
neutral	i planted the tree and am hoping that it grows very quickly as it looks a bit silly standing all by itself in my front yard .
neutral	we are really pleased with our finished photo_albums ... everyone who sees them thinks they are just superb and great value for money ..
neutral	... what a nausiating job though - put onto the user to get a decent layout .... you chose your photos from the folder ... dead easy ... then use the creation wizard ... sounds straight_forward - however the daft thing seems to literally just " plonk " things incredibly randomly with all_sorts of weird shapes and sizes ... then theres the nesting of images ,,,---... well great photos of handbags etc , but no faces visible .. wrongly sized in aperture and in wrong position ..... so to rectify this 0 . 0hours of deleting images , selecting layouts then dragging and dropping the images ....
neutral	i '_ve only ordered one pair of shoes from this company and it was an online purchase , therefore this may not be an across the board experience .
neutral	however , i thought i was ordering a deep red / wine colored shoe when in fact they were rather purple .
neutral	proper lighting and position of the shoe was to blame .
neutral	i understand how the mistake could have happened as when i looked at the shoe in a slightly_lower light it looked exactly as it did in the picture .
neutral	what was misleading is the label of red shoe on the product .
neutral	i feel that most people when viewing the shoe in person would label it as purple .
neutral	i felt mislead and it all came down to poor labeling and a bad picture .
neutral	i called to see what my flight options were for a trip i was trying to book online .
neutral	the guy found a flight i liked and after waiting some time for him to book it , he told me there ' d been an_error and it booked the wrong flight .
neutral	he put me on hold over and over and finally sent me to customer_service who put me on hold over and over .
neutral	long_story , that flight was not even available anymore by the time they were ready to book .
neutral	so i settled for another one .
neutral	total almost 0 hours on the phone trying to book my vacation .
neutral	:(
neutral	order went well , text to say when it would be dlivered on a friday_evening .
neutral	never arrived .
neutral	could not contact company until monday , who dealt_with it imediately but didnt get bed until tuesday_morning .
neutral	all would have been good but it was a present for daughters_birthday on the saturday .
neutral	she was disappointed .
neutral	but its here now and she is happy .
neutral	good product and delivery time but not sure whether accurate colour description
neutral	got the part at the correct time , no_issues with the part .
neutral	however the box was a mess .
neutral	not sure who handled it inappropriately i '_m just glad the mirror was still intact
neutral	your ordering process is professional , speedy and the food comes well - packaged .
neutral	what i don_'_t like is the continual push during the ordering process to sign - up for regular delivery .
neutral	i was certain i had said no at each opportunity , yet was surprised to find a package of food delivered i did not believe i ordered .
neutral	i went_onto the web_site and found numerous future dates entered at which time i would be delivered dog_food .
neutral	i cancelled the dates on the website and then called your customer_service who confirmed that i had no deliveries scheduled in the future .
neutral	if this happens again ( delivery of a package i didn_'_t order ), i will cancel the service entirely .
neutral	amount of rentals are great .
neutral	availability of books not so great .
neutral	i have a wide foot so getting shoes to fit is a problem .
neutral	even_though i ordered the wide width they were a little snug at first , but they have stretched enough that they are now quite comfortable .
neutral	and they look great .
neutral	very prompt delivery ( ordered late wednesday , received friday_morning ) but unfortunately the wellies came up a little small .
neutral	garden_xl doesn_'_t seem to make men '_s size 00 boots , either , so we ' re a bit stuck now !
neutral	we ' d recommend buying a size_bigger_than usual to make plenty of room for toes and wellie_socks .
neutral	when i ordered my glasses , they were not available for the try on feature on the website .
neutral	i used the cd method and the assistance of the customer_service person_who was very nice .
neutral	since i '_ve owned the glasses , i have problems with them not fitting properly and was told by one rep to go to walmart and try nose_pads , and i did .
neutral	they are still ill fitting .
neutral	so i called back and was told , this time by allen , that it was too early for an optician to be in , but that someone would definitely call me back .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting and that was last wee !.
neutral	the worst part is i feel_like that was a well used line to get people off of the phone without a hassle !
neutral	i feel_duped !
neutral	although it took a while , it did arrive when they said it would .
neutral	i provided the names of all involved in the meeting , many_times we refer to each by name , but the transcriber identified everyone as " male and female " makes it difficult to track .
neutral	the service was mainly good , had a few problems with the website whilst trying to complete the transaction so had to use a different device .
neutral	the two dresses that i ordered were fine but the wet look leggings had a huge hole down the seam where the item had not been well made .
neutral	overall the service was average because the bad quality of the leggings let it down but i was happy with the delivery time and costs and the majority of items were fine :)
neutral	parcel was open when it arrived , not so good regarding that there were 0 toners in it .
neutral	fast delivery though
neutral	however very disappointed that i was unable to get refund ( only exchange or credit note ) for returns to shops - very unlikely to use service again for this reason .
neutral	the light_bulbs we ordered were great but the postage was disgusting they were well_wrapped but £ 0 was exorbitant on a £ 0 order
neutral	website was easy to use and able to order flowers just a day before delivery .
neutral	first thing in the morning , i was advised they were en_route - delivery was to a primary school .
neutral	by the close of school they had not arrived and i could not contact serenata_flowers by email , online_chat or telephone without either asking for a refund or to re deliver another day .... neither what i wanted .
neutral	flowers arrived approx 0 . 00 and fortunately a member of staff was still on site .
neutral	i have recently ordered a lemon trree .
neutral	i was so thrilled wih the quality of the plant , the packaging and shipping that i decided to use this company again .
neutral	i ordered an olive tree and fig tree .
neutral	the olive tree arrived beautifully .... and is doing great !
neutral	i was concerned_about the fig tree immediately .
neutral	the tag said fig but planting_instructions were for a kiwi .
neutral	the tree showed no sign of life or growth on delivery .
neutral	i have been really caring for it and monitoring it since planting and nothing has happened ,.
neutral	it appears to be dead .
neutral	i wrote to customer_service a few_weeks back and have had no reply .
neutral	sadly , this was disappointing as i had wanted to order mother '_s day gifts and a tree for my sister .
neutral	i am reluctant to do that since i have not had a return customer_service reply .
neutral	i booked my flight , hotel and car through_travelocity because it seemed an efficient way to get things done .
neutral	turns_out my flight confirmation only showed a seat_assignment on the return flight and when i called travelocity , i was told i ' d have to make arrangements at the gate for my outbound flight .
neutral	i wasn_'_t too pleased with that , so hung_up , called the airline_directly and got a seat_assignment .
neutral	then , when it turned_out my daughter would be accompanying me on my trip , i called travelocity to change my hotel reservation from a non_- smoking king to a non_- smoking double - no change in rate was involved .
neutral	the travelocity customer_service rep asked if he could put me on hold while he phoned the hotel ... no problem .
neutral	there were two more holds since he said the line was busy , and when he finally got back to me , he said i ' d have to make arrangements for the " upgrade " when i got to the hotel .
neutral	i said it wasn_'_t an upgrade , but he said no , he could not make the change .
neutral	i would have to do it when i got to the hotel .
neutral	small things , but somewhat irritating .
neutral	i purchased a livingsocial deal for $_00 worth of merchandise for $_00 and i thought it was a great way to try petflow out .
neutral	i ordered a 0 pound_bag of royal_canin dog_food and a nyla bone .
neutral	i received the 0 pound_bag of dog_food in one box and another box with 0 pounds of cat_food in another box ( same day ).
neutral	i called and got it straightened_out relatively easily .
neutral	the next_day i got the nyla bone - thought that was it .
neutral	the next_day got another nyla bone .
neutral	had to call and get it straightened_out again .
neutral	my one order turned into 0 orders and i had to be credited all of these charges back to my credit_card .
neutral	one simple order resulted in phone_calls , a trip to the fedex store and a lot of confusion on my credit_card statement .
neutral	tighten it up , petflow , and you '_ll be very successful .
neutral	delivery a day late as rang at 0 . 00 and couldn_'_t find address and had gone back to warehouse .
neutral	box had been bashed about and hence the plastic clip to hold hood on was snapped in four pieces .
neutral	managed to superglue it .
neutral	pleased with the buggy - city_link need more care and commitment to your firm .
neutral	love the sofa but i ordered gray and was sent brown .
neutral	i called and let them know and still_haven_'_t heard back .
neutral	i live in florida and have been looking all over for something that would fit in my small space so i changed the color of my room rather_than having to send it back to brooklyn and have to wait for the one i ordered .
neutral	easy to book .. good images of hotel .
neutral	best price
neutral	i came to this website through ( logo ). com looking to purchase christmas / holiday gift_cards for some of the many picky tweens , pre_- teens , teens and college kids in my life .
neutral	once upon a time i would get them through my bank but as of recently they no_longer offer ( logo ) gift_cards .
neutral	thats too bad because i purchase many throughout the year averaging a hundred_dollars each .
neutral	i do wish that i could have purchased some more to give to my friends & family overseas .
neutral	i went with the pre_- designs .
neutral	the cards look great for the most part .
neutral	there are a few that the images are grainy .
neutral	i did not like that i had to reenter my message for each card all because i wanted to somewhat personalize something impersonal and not give everyone the exact_same card image .
neutral	it was time_consuming and errors ( on my part ) did happen .
neutral	oh well .
neutral	giftcards . com delivered them within the promised 0 - 00 business days , 0 to be exact .
neutral	so , with all that said and even with the little hiccups that resulted in the 0 - star_rating i would purchase gift_cards again through giftcards . com
neutral	my experience here wasn_'_t too bad .
neutral	place promises climate free , bug & pest free , and space wise was good .
neutral	my bill i paid late , 0 hours after i paid , i came there expecting to move stuff out , i couldn_'_t because there was a blue lock on there that should '_ve been removed by the staff upon payment .
neutral	came back the next_day , only to make my move out even harder with no available carts .
neutral	during the past 0 months time at ths farmingdale location , the bathroom was always atrocious .
neutral	no toilet paper , toilet_seat always soiled and clogged , and bathroom itself has trash all over it .
neutral	staff should routinely make more routine inspections maybe every hour .
neutral	parking should be swept by private company every night , which it never seems that it is . staff should remove blue locks upon payment .
neutral	i have used this location in the past , everytime i see the same issues that just doesnt .
neutral	get addressed .
neutral	cool concept , need to work on inventory management .
neutral	they ran_out of an item we tried to purchase and we found out after it shipped .
neutral	the prices are great on the site , order was processed quickly but shipping takes 0_weeks .
neutral	:(
neutral	i found this site in a search and the ordering process easy .
neutral	other_companies came up with my item but the price was the best and no shipping .
neutral	i don_'_t like the fact that there wasn_'_t any returns on my product but it is a name_brand case and shouldn_'_t be any_problems .
neutral	it was a special order item .
neutral	the order was simple enough to place .
neutral	the package arrived quickly .
neutral	the product itself was not stellar , and i immediately wrote them to complain and exchange it for something_else , but haven_'_t heard_anything back yet .
neutral	hellooooooooooo !
neutral	anybody out there ???????
neutral	?
neutral	my order did not contain any shipping slip / packing_slip and it was missing an item .
neutral	i was in desperate search of a side_view_mirror for my husbands truck when i finally found one afforable on partgeek .
neutral	i opened as soon as i got it and noticed it has the heat emblem on the glass .
neutral	my husband installed it with no time for a return due to state inspection being due .
neutral	it attached however he could not hook up the power because of the heating mechanism on the back where it mounts .
neutral	it '_s not a big deal to my husband since it '_s on the driver_side he can manually adjust it but i did pay extra for the power !
neutral	bummer
neutral	i have had a problem with ordering .
neutral	i have called your call_centre 0 times in one week .
neutral	by the time someone actually calls back the deal is over .
neutral	i lost two deals this way .
neutral	i was advised by one of your customer_services that even_though i was trying to pay by in putting two different credit_cards it may work better if i went through pay_pal .
neutral	i have since done that .
neutral	if i did not have a pay_pal account i would have stopped dealing_with you all together .
neutral	it provides a good background and insight_into photography but sometimes the on - line experience is limited and could do with a bit more interaction aside from the optional assignments , maybe something more like the last modules which have videos .
neutral	as many videos on you tube are readily_available , something like this in a teaching format would be more ideal as_opposed to searching for videos that contradict each other or give their own input .
neutral	also not everyone will have photoshop , so maybe discoutns off products and a separate course material into editing would be ideal .
neutral	a more interactive experience would bring a better appeal as at present it would attract those who would like to get into photography .
neutral	from my own personal experience , i had played around with manual settings and went to family functions and outdoor experiences which gave a more grounded perspective .
neutral	i could not complete this due to part of the shipment being broken and returned and awaiting refund
neutral	first problem -- i was not able to order online and pay for the book using my credit_card information and have the book shipped to my grandson at a different address .
neutral	second problem -- there was no bookbyte phone_number and i was unable to get the shipping problem_solved online .
neutral	i finally had the book sent to my home address .
neutral	third problem -- the problem was that the spanish book i ordered for my grandson needed and access_code and there was no mention of this on the bookbyte site .
neutral	i only found that out after he went to class with the book .
neutral	i ended_up having to buy two access codes from the publisher of the book at a cost $_00 and $_00 each .
neutral	this increased the cost of the book rental considerably .
neutral	00dollarmall . com is great for providing clothes at an affordable price .
neutral	i '_ve had a couple instances_where it took my product a very long time to be processed and shipped .
neutral	other than that my experiences are positive .
neutral	i do wish they offered more variety of plus size styles and shoes .
neutral	they need more shoes in size 00 or 00 .
neutral	i ordered one pair but they ran way too small and couldn_'_t get my foot into it .
neutral	also , i wish they offered more jackets and dresses with sleeves .
neutral	i would also like to see some pajama sets and jackets .
neutral	paid for saturday delivery at around 0pm on a friday , waiting in all day as you do when you pay for something to arrive that day especially .
neutral	by 0pm i contacted boohoo to see what time latest delivery was , got told 0pm ... which was fine with me as wasn_'_t going out till 0ish .
neutral	was also told my item was out for delivery .
neutral	didnt arrive , then was told my item would not arrive till the following saturday as it was ' saturday delivery '.
neutral	looked at the online tracking on the monday only to find out that the delivery company didnt actually receive the parcel till the sunday !
neutral	boohoo basically took no responsibility for this , i got my delivery money back ... but only credited to my online account !
neutral	very unhappy with the service , paid for a service which i didn_'_t receive !
neutral	i feel that the pages are wasteful .
neutral	i never use labels , so i have to discard so much of the sheet .
neutral	years_ago i would get 00 stamps on a sheet .
neutral	what ever happened to that ?
neutral	i love the chicken nuggets , but at times the food is too greasy .
neutral	i usually have an ok experience , but last_year i got food poisoning from the sausage breakfast sandwich , i still can '_t eat breakfast sausage because i got so sick .
neutral	i love starbucks , but it is too expensive .
neutral	they recently added a new line of juices .
neutral	they are really good , but cost over 0 $ per bottle , it is ridiculous !
neutral	if you want to order online , add online , one time order , repeat ... easy and fast .
neutral	heaven help you if you want to cancel a repeat shipment .
neutral	you cannot do it online , you have to call .
neutral	so if you aren_'_t home and just have internet ... good luck with that .
neutral	absolutely so ruined it for me i will never do auto - ship again with this company .
neutral	if you can spend money without calling , for them to pretend not spending is for your benefit instead of make it hard to cancel .. that insults my intelligence .
neutral	i wish they had a better selection of plus size clothing
neutral	i can not say anything yet until we at the hotel
neutral	i ordered a oil cap for a 0000_dodge jourey and it will not work they sent me the wrong one ..
neutral	on slow hours they dont do so bad , but during meal times , especially during dinner , they ' re super slow and encounter a lot of problems placing our orders at the restaurant
neutral	i recently placed an order from petswag and received a tracking_number a few_days_later for one of my items .
neutral	that one item arrived as_promised but i received no word about the remaining items in my order .
neutral	i logged_into my account and saw that my order was marked as ' complete ' yet i was still missing two items .
neutral	i called petswag and left messages twice and was put off that i couldn_'_t get someone on the phone and i never received a call back .
neutral	a few_days_later , i received my remaining items , which had been shipped to me directly from the manufacturer .
neutral	in the end , my order was completed and i '_m happy with my purchase but i would have appreciated an_email or phone_call from petswag to simply tell me that my items were coming .
neutral	the customer_service at petswag ( or lack thereof ) does seem a bit unprofessional , which will cause me to hesitate before placing another order or recommending this website .
neutral	i found amazing glasses .
neutral	so many to chose from .
neutral	but my order placed on 00 / 0 / 0000 has_been repeatedly put on back order .
neutral	i am so disappointed .
neutral	i am giving 0_stars because 0 of the four bridesmaids_dresses were here with no_issues and all 0 were beautiful .
neutral	however the last dress was ordered late , probably mid june so we paid the 00 extra to have it rush_cut .
neutral	the email said it would be here by july 00 .
neutral	when it wasn_'_t here the second week of august i called and was informed that that '_s not a solid date and the designer can be up to 0_weeks_later then that date ( it was over 0_weeks late ) so of course i would have to just eat it on the 00 extra dollars .
neutral	i will say that the women i spoke to was really nice , and i didn_'_t push the issue .
neutral	she said it would be about one more week with shipping .
neutral	the dress didn_'_t show up till friday the 00 th of august , my wedding was sept , 0 .
neutral	she was the only one who couldn_'_t get alterations and all the other girls had theirs shortened from tea length to right above the knee .
neutral	still , she looked great and i thought all the dresses we pretty ( i kinda wish i had got one ) so in the end i guess as long as you order way in advance things should be great , but the rush_cut was a rip_off , if you don_'_t have at_least 00 weeks i would go another route .
neutral	there is no way to save your cart .
neutral	sometimes i take days to make final purchase decisions but then have to search all over again .
neutral	also , twice_now i '_ve placed an order and several days_later i found out that the item has_been cancelled due to being out of stock .
neutral	big_bus_tours are well run and friendly and informative .......
neutral	in peak_times it would be good to run more buses and they should run school trip only buses .
neutral	we never got to sit on the open top_deck as it was filled by school groups , the majority of the students weren_'_t actually interested in the comentary or views so this spolit it for many tourists who would have loved to have seen the unique view the open top upper_deck offers .
neutral	we heard the same from a lot of visitors both uk & abroad .
neutral	in the end we didn_'_t use the bus as much as we could have due to the crowding and lack of seats upstairs .
neutral	the river_trip was great and once the school trips decamped at the tower of london much_nicer , again spolit by school trips who were disinterested in the commentary and views but wanted the best seats .
neutral	special mention for the riverboat commentary which was provided free by watermen who only asked for a voluntary donation - it was the best commentary of the day !
neutral	ordered item on nov_00th after being let_down by another company .
neutral	item only arrived today dec_00th .
neutral	i didn_'_t realise when ordering that it was coming from denmark !
neutral	anyway panic now over .
neutral	hope it '_s ok when my grandaughter opens it .
neutral	i ordered two books and they were both showing that they were available .
neutral	they shipped_separately , one coming more than a week after the first one .
neutral	there was a huge coffee - like stain on the back couple of pages on the book that arrived last , not sure why - they weren_'_t used books , i an happy to have them both as my class_starts soon .
neutral	they price was cheaper_than a few other_sites , so i ma happy with that .
neutral	i was very pleased with the price of the replacement_mirror for my 0000_toyota_camry , but the option to buy only gave_me 0000 - 0000 passenger_side_mirror as a description and when the mirror arrived , it was not identical to the one attached to my car .
neutral	i did not need the whole casing of the passenger_side_mirror , just the mirrow itself was broken .
neutral	i pulled the mirror , that i ordered from you , out of the casing and it was not identical to the original mirror .
neutral	the backside would not snap into place because one mirror had a square center attachment and one had a round center attachment .
neutral	what i hoped would be a simple fix , is turning into a problem .
neutral	now i will have to hire someone to replace the whole mirror with casing and maybe even have it painted to match my original .
neutral	selecting items on the website was easy , prices are great but i have not recieved my shipped items yet and when i look up the tracking_number it says they are still in california from over a week_ago .
neutral	i booked a room online and paid for it .
neutral	i got to the hotel in osage beach , mo , and they didn_'_t have any paper_work on us booking a room through_travelocity !!
neutral	and they said that they could have given us some more discounts then travelocity did .
neutral	when it came to check out , they said that we owed for the bill and charged me a different amount .
neutral	so i got billed_twice for the same room .
neutral	i will never trust travelocity again !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i paid for 0 day delivery & it took 0 not counting the holiday in there .
neutral	didn_'_t make me happy .
neutral	we like the way the hotels are presented , and it is easy to find what you are looking for , but .... we booked a hotel for $_00 . 00 & tax - only to find when we arrived that there was another $_00 . 00 to pay for resort_fees , which are non_- negotiable .
neutral	if there are charges that are not negotiable , then they should be shown in the booking price , not a surprise upon_arrival .
neutral	we may have chosen another hotel based on those additional_charges .
neutral	got this email before i even recieved the parts !!!
neutral	will let ya know after i know they were right eh .....
neutral	i enjoy receiving our spoiled_rotten_box every_month and the humans are more excited about it then our pets .
neutral	i just wish it had a little_bit more for big dogs in it or that you would have the option to ask for a small / medium / large_breed dog size box .
neutral	i didn_'_t care for there shipping one bag of dog bones the bottom of the bag was split_open and dog bones broke everything was covered in dog_bone pieces .
neutral	wow , this was a wonderful experience up until the last moment .
neutral	i received the part in less_than 00_hours .
neutral	unbelievably fast .
neutral	the part received was correct and functioned flawlessly .
neutral	imagine my disappointment when i found out that i would have to pay return shipping on the core .
neutral	to get my $_00 back , it cost $_00 to ship it .
neutral	this is not acceptable !
neutral	this should just be hidden in the cost of the purchase .
neutral	do something because now i am dissatisfied and will look elsewhere for future parts .
neutral	at_least it should be made clear that the return is on me so that this could be considered with the purchase .
neutral	my husband and i recently toured london , stockholm , estonia , copenhagen and belgium .
neutral	we took the bigbus tours because our friends recommend them highly .
neutral	stockholm was the best with a great tour_guide , modern buses and wi_-_fi !
neutral	!
neutral	others not as new but good trips except for copenhagen .
neutral	worst_experience ever .
neutral	old buses , head sets didn_'_t work , buses dirty and the driver stayed in several spots for over 0 / 0 hour to fill the bus .
neutral	good thing this was our last stop or we would not have used bigbus again .
neutral	waste of $_00 american dollars .
neutral	what a same you don_'_t deliver to jersey channel_islands
neutral	frames were in good condition and perfectly lovely .
neutral	lenses were don e incorrectly and am waiting for a monetary adjustment .
neutral	i had a very quick delivery and i thought the price was brilliant but the bikini was a completely different fit than what i was expecting from the photos and the colour were very different too .
neutral	it '_s not good customer_service when you lock in at a certain price and a few_months later your monthly expense increases by $_00 .
neutral	if i wanted to get a unit at a cheaper price , i would then have to move all my stuff .
neutral	i live in the boon docks in central tx , so i order things online all the time .
neutral	i have no_idea what i bought from this vendor , and the email_asking me to review it didn_'_t bother to refresh my memory .
neutral	the route was very interesting but the commentary was very weak with minimal information .
neutral	long gaps filled with music which became irritating .
neutral	i really found the site helpful but the person i had to deal with over the when i called to ask specific questions fast talking qnd pushy !
neutral	they take long to answer emails through the support email and the products are okthe last two orders i made had a damage product each , and if i send it i have to pay the shipping !!
neutral	!
neutral	items are reasonably_priced and are good fashion but each time i have order something i have had to return them due to them either being too small then next time i learnt to order size_bigger_than normal but they still fit poorly .
neutral	shame as there are some nice styles .
neutral	however very easy to order , quick delivery , free returns and quick refund .
neutral	i also received an_email to say that i had been refunded .
neutral	in the past goldstar has done an awesome job in getting terrific seats .
neutral	this last time you could_barely make out the batter .
neutral	ughhh may not consider buying tickets again
neutral	the delivery didn_'_t come in until a few_days after promised date & when i got it , product was damaged .
neutral	guess price was just too good to be true .
neutral	i was lead to believe that the furniture would be delivered as it was seen in the showroom which was not the case .
neutral	i did not realise that you would have to put the handles on the right side of the drawers and take bits of wood off feet and screw on the foot protectors .
neutral	although it was not flat pack i think the advertising in store was misleading .
neutral	travelocity has_been my go - to travel site but recently they removed the check 0 days before and after feature when researching travel dates .
neutral	shame that some of the erange i need at work ( pe teacher ) is no_longer available -
neutral	the book arrived on time , with the internet code apparently intact .
neutral	i have not tried it yet .
neutral	the book was excessively highlighted in several colors .
neutral	either the student '_s 0 year_old sibling got ahold of it , or the student was unable to grasp a salient point and so underlined everything , in blue , pink and yellow .
neutral	my eyes bounce when i read it .
neutral	books that are in a state this bad should have a warning attached .
neutral	it would only take a minute to give a better description of the book '_s condition .
neutral	i would have paid more if i could have received a book with no highlighting marks .
neutral	i have no problem with your site or the prices of your products etc .
neutral	however , i have a big problem with your delivery methods and the fact that the customer_service reps i have talked to did not even pretend to care about my problem when i brought it to their attention .
neutral	probably 00_% of the people who use your site probably will not have the same problem but 00_% would if something does not change .
neutral	i live in a rural_area and do not get us postal mail delivered there so i use a po_box ... fed_ex and ups regularly delivers to my physical home address .
neutral	your site says it uses fed_ex which i * thought * meant that i would get them delivered to my physical home address .
neutral	that didn_'_t happen , because apparently fed_ex delivers to the us postal service which does not deliver to my home address .
neutral	now the shipment has_been returned to bookbyte , and it has_been a week since i heard_anything from them about when the order will be reshipped .
neutral	the class that i need the book for has started and i do not have my book yet !!
neutral	suggestion_: your site needs to be clearer about the fact that even_though fed_ex is used , fed_ex delivers to the us postal service and that the us postal service is actually the ones who deliver the package to the customer .
neutral	if i had known this up front , this problem would have been avoided and i would not be receiving a grade of 0 due to the fact that i don_'_t have my book even_though i ordered it with plenty of time to spare .
neutral	hello ,
neutral	i placed an order last_week , my second order on this web_site .
neutral	your web_site indicated free_shipping for orders over ( certain_amount ) and my order greatly exceeded that amount .
neutral	i ordered 0 items , demarin for large dogs and a flea application for large dogs .
neutral	i was charged 0 . 00 shipping with no_explanation as to why these items did not qualify for free_shipping ; and i still do not have the order .
neutral	i ordered these items before from another online pet_supply web_site and received free_shipping and had the order within 0 days .
neutral	i will have to consider all costs before i decide to order from this web_site again .
neutral	the hotel was a hidden gem .
neutral	looked like a fifties drive up , but clean rooms , great view , friendly and accommodating owner .
neutral	spirit_airlines ...... no_frills flying .... got motion sick on the descent and heaven forbid i get any help without paying money .
neutral	plus the flight was nearly two hours delayed .
neutral	three_days_later , i '_m still recovering .
neutral	usually us another service but always get same carrier company my hermes to pick_up .
neutral	had to wait 0 days for booked pick_up .
neutral	too long so will go back to other company .
neutral	sorry .
neutral	hot and cold
neutral	your prices are good , decent shipping prices , can use discount_codes but your web_site is difficult to use , very slow , did not receive a confirmation
neutral	email and also my order did not show up on your website under my orders .
neutral	i was not sure if i had an order or not but then it showed_up at my door .
neutral	its no different then going to a store except u can '_t try them on before purchase .
neutral	the prices are affordable and the addtional %_off they offer very regularly allow you to buy an_additional pair .
neutral	i bought 0pair shoes , 0 for my sister & 0 for me .
neutral	i knew sizes was questionable , their questionable when i walk in the store .
neutral	i dont see why people get bent outta shape about that when ordering online .
neutral	it should be expected , especially if you dont_know who the ' maker ' is , like when you order from amiclubwear .
neutral	my sister shoes fit , 0 of mine just fit size 0 . 0 and the other was too little size0 .
neutral	i wear anywhere from 0 - 0 . 0 .
neutral	but the last couple pair off brand shoes were too big at size 0 . 0 , even some 0s .
neutral	delivery is awfully slow , even for ground .
neutral	i can get something thru postal service quicker .
neutral	my only real compliant is i had to search for return info because nothing was with the packaging .
neutral	by time locate , it had been 0wks .. may as well keep them .
neutral	i have another sister who feet are smaller then mine .
neutral	her bday next month !
neutral	have used site many_times however i have never been issued with a password so have to enter all details each time i book .
neutral	otherwise simple and easy process .
neutral	jetpark 0 is simple , quick and stress_free .
neutral	i got an online deal for a discounted order from petflow .
neutral	they did have the prescription cat_food that i needed , but it was kind of hard to place the order .
neutral	the site kept messing up and the search wouldn_'_t find my vet .
neutral	it took several tries to get it ordered .
neutral	then the email they sent me couldn_'_t be viewed through gmail , but i was able to finally see it on my phone ( and i swear i am a pretty technical person ).
neutral	after about 0 days i still didn_'_t see the order even_though it says fast shipping from fed_ex .
neutral	i talked to a customer_service guy_who was very helpful and said that it was being shipped usps from somewhere closer to my house and that i would get an_email when it shipped .
neutral	when i got home it was there , but i never got the email .
neutral	so all in all i would order from them again , but i felt it was a little disorganized .
neutral	and they send an_email almost every day for a sale , which is a bit_annoying .
neutral	i required some supplies for a training session so looked online to find the company with the quickest delivery timeframe .
neutral	this is how i came about optomo .
neutral	after_placing my order and entering my credit_card details , an ' error ' occured ...
neutral	i contacted the company immediately .
neutral	the gentleman was very friendly and helpful - explained they were having difficulties with online payments and so i gave him my details over the phone ( i do not like to do this usually ...).
neutral	he said that the package should arrive by monday or tuesday - they arrived on the friday .
neutral	i like that i can make calls to other_countries it '_s convenient .
neutral	the only issue i have is there is a constant ekco and delay .
neutral	i hear myself and the other party ekcoing .
neutral	i ordered 00 boas the shipping on it was almost $_00 !
neutral	about 0 / 0 of my total ordering price .
neutral	i recived them , opened them and they are not what i expected .
neutral	the description seems to be inaccurate , and the photo misleading .
neutral	the boas were very cheaply_made , made a mess everywhere .
neutral	my delivery was despatched one day late , although i was refunded the delivery charge .
neutral	but then my delivery arrived broken ( probably more due to yodel )
neutral	quick customer_service response , i was refunded in full , and they were very apologetic .
neutral	i like the lower price and service was good .
neutral	i got my order promptly .
neutral	however i don_'_t like the taste of the coffee as much as the original nespresso_pods .
neutral	also the decaf is not water processed but treated with solvents .
neutral	their offer wasn_'_t as attractive as what they offered on their website to new customers .
neutral	if you ' re going to advertise a discount and ask new customers to and donate to shelters in an area hit with a tragedy , you really need to make the deal better_than what '_s on your website .
neutral	it looked a little shady to me .
neutral	it '_s funny you should ask for this information as it is now 00 days_later and still no alternator .
neutral	i tracked it and it has_been sitting in denver since the 00th , would sure like them to decide to ship it !
neutral	!
neutral	ordered 0 pieces , one of which was so badly finished that it gave_me splinters , it should have never left the factory .
neutral	i was initially fobbed_off that photos didnt show the issues very well and that they couldn_'_t guarentee the replacement would be better !
neutral	i looked into the cost of refinishing it and sent them the quote .
neutral	a quality checked replacement was delivered promptly and the reject collected at the same time by very courteous delivery people .
neutral	pure_formulas has a great product selection and good prices but i had a problem with one of the items in my delivery and sent them an_email about it and they never even got back with me .
neutral	so one of my items was basically unusable and that part is very disappointing .
neutral	i prefer nutro canned_dog_food for my senior toy_poodle .
neutral	you don_'_t offer a full inventory as compared to my store .
neutral	i also received a substiture in one order .
neutral	however , i like the convenience of ordering online and having the products delivered to my door .
neutral	i also don_'_t think you should charge tax as most online sites do not charge it .
neutral	i am moving all my belongings in storage and this is a stressful time .
neutral	even_though i explained this move involves all my personal_belongings , the assistant failed to ask me if i needed climate_controlled .
neutral	luckily , i read the confirmation and realized the unit was not climate_controlled .
neutral	it would be nice if the assistant could ask just to be sure about whether climate_controlled is needed .
neutral	i had to call back and inquire once i received the email_confirmation .
neutral	love amazon
neutral	although do not sell on market place im still_waiting on funds !!!
neutral	!
neutral	a lovely bed for my daughter , however when we unpacked the box we found 0 damaged sections with also some parts if the bed not having the holes pre drilled in to fix the bed / storage draw together ( very frustrating )
neutral	when we called homebase the bed is currently out of stock so they could not replace the bed
neutral	but could offer us £_00 off to keep the bed how it was which was not expectable .
neutral	0weeks later and still_waiting to hear back from homebase ...
neutral	i would have scored higher but i paid_extra for a vase for the flowers to be delivered in .
neutral	the flowers did not arrive in the vase .
neutral	my mother could not use the vase because the stems of the amaryllis were too thin to fit into the neck of the vase .
neutral	i was shocked to see that all the windows in the bus had screens in them , which prevented me from seeing clearly or from taking pictures out the windows .
neutral	with a different company in washington_dc , i was able to get great pictures out the bus windows , but here it was difficult even to see well .
neutral	the guides and driver were awesome people , though , i really_enjoyed their tour .
neutral	my package arrived 0 days late .
neutral	and it was barely sealed .
neutral	it had nearly been completely been opened .
neutral	i was amazed all my product was still in the box
neutral	i can understand that you need to add the publicity but it is difficult what you have booked as it is tiny in a corner or in the middle of the advertisement .
neutral	it would be easier to follow if you increase the size of the font for the booking .
neutral	it would be easier to follow and at the same time you can keep the advertisement that would not feel too invading .
neutral	i have not gotten my book yet because i had it shipped to my office not knowing it would take 00 days to receive .
neutral	ordered 0 / 00 and delivered 0 / 00 .
neutral	i have never seen a fedex shipment that traveled that long
neutral	i bought a black_cartridge and a color one .
neutral	the color one did not work .
neutral	the black did .
neutral	good choices of quality pet_foods , but prices not so favorable without the discount , and i simply do not want to get into ongoing deliveries .
neutral	i ordered the dress , which was great value and when it did turn up really beautiful and worth it . however it was delievered 0 days late which isn_'_t too bad but considering you pay £ 0 . 00 for delievery . boohoo don_'_t have a phone_number only an_email address and they don_'_t respond to emails quickly so if your package didn_'_t turn up their would be a big problem . overall i love the dress but am not sure if i would order from them again .
neutral	i ordered my costume with click & collect , which was said to arrive at my ' collection_point ' in 0 days - which it did , faultlessly .
neutral	however , the instructions of where to collect my costume from were something to do with debenhams .
neutral	so i went to debenhams , queued for their click & collect , only to be told that giving my full name wasn_'_t enough and that i needed my order number .
neutral	i went away to wifi on my phone , so i could access the confirmation_email .
neutral	when i returned after queuing again they told me they didn_'_t have my order , and suggested i went to the shopping centre '_s info desk .
neutral	i did , and a woman finally directed me to an obscure place , where the locker was .
neutral	finally i received my costume !
neutral	love the jumpers , but bought a new one in response to deal for a 00_%_discount , the voucher_code would not work and i was charged full price .
neutral	i sent an immediate email and received no refund and no reply at all
neutral	when i received my order , it was for the european version of the item that i wanted .
neutral	i am in the us .
neutral	the customer_service rep that i made the order with did not return my phone_calls or email regarding the mix up on the delivery .
neutral	i called and was able to get in touch with another rep and he took_care of everything .
neutral	thank_you for all of your help ron johnson !
neutral	i work with lots of vendors with beautiful clothing and by_far ami_club have the longest processing and shipping ever ..
neutral	great deals which i love and buy all the time but after having some problems will my phone it bought 0 of the same thing .
neutral	i have emailed the returns department at_least 0 times over the past 0_weeks and heard_nothing !
neutral	!
neutral	ordered a side_mirror for my saturn ion 0000 .
neutral	side_mirror came intact but you would have not thought so when laying eyes on the box .
neutral	it was so broken and mangled i thought the mirror was broke for sure .
neutral	gladly it wasnt , other than crappy shipping people it was a good deal .
neutral	i purchased some black and colour printer_cartridges for my hp b000a .
neutral	the delivery time was excellent , as i received the products the very next_day .
neutral	however , i am not entirely_satisfied with the ink quality , especially the coloured cartridges .
neutral	the black seems to work fine , but even_though the ink levels are saying ' full ', often the pink and blue colours are priniting very light and faded , almost like it is out of ink .
neutral	i have cleaned my print head by the prompt on my machine , but when i am printing a document this is still happening .
neutral	easy to use , clear_descriptions , somewhat fast results
neutral	i bought a crochet dress which was supposed to be 000_% cotton .
neutral	it arrived quickly , however , only the top smock bit of the dress seemed to be cotton , the main lower part felt and looked more synthetic and the lining was definitely synthetic .
neutral	it is true that boohoo have a good returns_policy , so i could have sent the dress back .
neutral	the measurements were for the outer edges of the bag ( barely ) not the inside dimensions of the bag .
neutral	also so thin a seam there was no width at all .
neutral	buy a bigger_size then what you think you need .
neutral	the bags were color accurate and did arrive quickly .
neutral	the backpack i ordered was a lovely product which my daughter enjoyed using for the first 0 months , until it started to fall_apart .
neutral	she used it for heavy schoolbooks and does not think the backpack i ordered was strong_enough to support the heavy weight but , was still disappointed to find that her new favourite backpack would not last her the whole year .
neutral	the frame could be a little moe sturdy .
neutral	envirophone were good but the reminders that kept sending me about sending the phone even_though it had been sent were irritating !
neutral	everything was delayed because of christmas .
neutral	i got a trip on trip_advisor to see my daughter out in phoenix and it was very expensive !
neutral	well i ordered a product , did not show out of stock on the website , to my dismay i was not contacted to let_me know it was out of stock .
neutral	so i was so excited to get my package and then be let_down because then and only then was i aware it was out of stock ... but i got an eyeliner .. wow !!?!?
neutral	!.. i '_m being scarcastic !
neutral	!
neutral	still_waiting in the refund to be credited_back on my account ; it '_s been almost a month !
neutral	very happy with the price and the car_rental , great car and very convenient , but there was some_confusion with the booking as it hadn_'_t come through complete with the price we had booked at when we got to the car_rental desk .
neutral	i was in a meeting when the call came through so i phoned back later , and spoke with a lady , who was extremely nice .
neutral	she was very helpful , although there was a certain_amount of confusion over payments that i actually made , and what was not necessary .
neutral	i can understand the need for all of the questions from my perspective , after all it is my loan , however to try and give my guarantor financial advice was unacceptable .
neutral	my guarantor was most aggreived by the level of intrusion into his financial_situation and as was correctly stated , the obligation falls to me to pay .
neutral	if i fail that is the only time that a financial burden will be placed upon my guarantor , if that ever occured then a review of my guarantor '_s situation should be taken , not prior .
neutral	just open this parcel .
neutral	very clear for me that price is always is determination of quality . no exception . box itself is in bad condition shape . i would be not surprise if i bought it from private party , but if company provides such poor quality product - ....
neutral	one filter has seal strap partionally detached from the body .
neutral	if its nor fitted well ( i plan to replace it coming weekend ) will return with seller '_s expense .
neutral	however , the bunch of flowers were far too small for the price charged .
neutral	after one week our sectional has a huge hole with the stuffing falling out .
neutral	we had paid for the warranty so we called them and they said it is only a one time fix on something that we did to the couch and not something that they can take_care of .
neutral	freight had me email pics and tell them what side the defect is on and it has_been a week so i '_m not sure what is going on right now .
neutral	i plan to call today .
neutral	when service fee is more than a couple of dollars , that '_s too much .
neutral	placed my order quickly and easily online .
neutral	i set_up scheduled_shipments of dog_food .
neutral	it was shipped immediately and got here sooner_than_expected , which was great !!
neutral	however , the bag had an 0 inch tear down the side that had been taped up to some extent .
neutral	it '_s a really long gash and i wonder_how much spilled out before it was taped up !
neutral	i was given the web address to get $_00 . 00 off my first order .
neutral	i connected and placed my order by was denyed the $_00 . 00 because i would not go auromatic delivery .
neutral	whether my 0 dogs like , love or otherwise isn_'_t even part of it .
neutral	the company should have given me the the discount without restrictions .
neutral	excellent service , record of past orders and delivery very efficient .
neutral	the first time i called for rates and availability i was told there were only 0 rooms left at that price of $_000 . 00 and no other rooms available at other prices .
neutral	i told the young_lady i would check with my sister and call back within 00_minutes or so .
neutral	i called back spoke to a gentlemen and was told there were only 0 rooms left after i reserved mine .
neutral	since other family_members were planning on booking suites as well i called them immediately .
neutral	they did not book until the following_day without a problem however they booked 0 suites .
neutral	i don_'_t understand_why they felt they had to tell me that to book it by saying there were only 0 left and then 0 .
neutral	i would have booked anyway .
neutral	if that '_s a way to get people to book with the marriot residence inn i feel that '_s unfair and not real happy with it .
neutral	i hope my experience will be better when i actually get their .
neutral	if not i will certainly let you know .
neutral	my nephew and niece have stayed their many_times in the past so we do give you business .
neutral	sincerely ,
neutral	barbara rich
neutral	i have experienced some merchants not honouring vouchers or changing deal when you arrive or simply not being available to receive your booking
neutral	i ordered my books on the 00th and didn_'_t receive them till the 00th .
neutral	plus they ended_up having to cancel one of the books i wanted because it was no_longer available that should have been determined before they took the money out of my account so i didn_'_t have to wait for a refund .
neutral	had to wait for the money to be refunded before i could get my book from a different site and i received that book from the other site before i received my bookbyte books
neutral	i think your clothing is stylist and affordable !
neutral	your sales manager at cloverdale mall is very unpleasant !
neutral	would go more often if she would use some people skills !
neutral	other people think the same . the same .
neutral	my plants came alive but had been tumbled from shipping .
neutral	dirt was everywhere and it was not fun cleaning up the mess !!!
neutral	i hope my plants will survive .
neutral	:( :( :(
neutral	i paid you $_00 . 00 for a toilet riser with handles and it did not fit any toilet i tried to install it on .
neutral	there was very little information on this product .
neutral	implied it fit all toilets .
neutral	this was the most_important item i ordered due to the fact that my mother is almost unable to have much mobility and has a very time rising from the toilet .
neutral	very disappointed in this product .
neutral	will not use your service again .
neutral	the items sent were not from the same manufacturer nor did the packaging match what was pictured on the website .
neutral	am hopeful that it will work on the application for which it was bought .
neutral	making a reservation thru_travelocity was very easy .
neutral	problem was that i planned to make cash payment at the hotel .
neutral	once i checked in an informed the hotel that i planned to pay cash , i was informed that i couldn_'_t because the charge to my credit_card has already been processed and there was not way for them to change it .
neutral	have ordered several items from this shop online due to their excellent discount offers , however even my first purchase arrived missing items , it was an extreme smock by montane but had no crotch strap supplied as it should .... it had taken a week to arrive even_though royal_mail calls this service express00 , laughable at best , my other purchases have been slow as well and often sit around in the royal_mail hub for quite some time ..... seems a pity that a shop offering such good deals should have such a lousy delivery service ...... gave 0_stars for the deals offerd , would give no stars for the missing item and the delivery system .
neutral	if you are not local to milton_keynes and want something in a hurry i would hesitate to order from them is my advice ....
neutral	takes a really long time to confirm cashback and some payments simply don_'_t get tracked .
neutral	..
neutral	i wouldn_'_t create myself the hassle of chasing it so it '_s wasted .
neutral	really you need to improve .
neutral	products are good quality , however i received unpleasant customer_service each time !
neutral	very polite over the phone promising they '_ll get back to you but it has never happened .
neutral	my account stopped_working since they '_ve changed to maxishop from maximuscle ; i had £_00 worth of points that vanished , nobody got back to me as_promised so decided to forget about , created a new account instead .
neutral	i gave them 0 *** because i '_m happy with the products , however the protein_shakes taste awful , but most of proteins powders are not very nice anyway .
neutral	i prefer to buy their products most of the time from amazon , better service xx
neutral	my order of 000_litres was not delivered as there was insufficient oil on the tanker !
neutral	all i got was 000_litres .
neutral	i was angry as the supplier said there was nothing they could do and refused to take_responsibility for it .
neutral	it would have been a different story if i had failed to pay the full_amount to the supplier !
neutral	i complained to boilerjuice who refunded the difference but i had to actually ask for some compensation before they gave_me £ 0 off my next order .
neutral	i believe their prices are fair and good shipping and i '_m happy with them for the most part .
neutral	however i know this is most_likely my fault but they could enhance their account system because i had a double order because i had two accounts under my name .
neutral	i was not happy on paying for two orders right_away because it was not in my budget and other areas of my budget had to suffer .
neutral	i work long hours , and do lots of shopping online on the weekends .
neutral	i am used to shopping on many websites .
neutral	i think vetrxdirect site , while cute to look at , is very touchy and difficult to use , especially while ordering multiple items for multiple dogs .
neutral	i have also found things i normally order out of stock , while lots of stock exists at the competitors .
neutral	i think the pricing is better_than the others , but it doesn_'_t help me if there is no stock .
neutral	also , most other comapnies will honor the competitor '_s price if they can verify it .
neutral	the folks who work there are very nice , and have helped_me when i have struggled to work with their website .
neutral	nutshell : prices are good , and people are nice .
neutral	website is difficult , and stock conditions are sporadic .
neutral	i ordered a iphone 0 orange unlock in early june , expecting the available unlock max 00 days_later ...
neutral	after a very long waiting ( a big month ) still no news , so i decided to send a pay back email .
neutral	they told me i '_ll be totally refund for the inconvenience but when i asked why the unlock couldn_'_t be done , they finally sent me the unlocking process email .
neutral	it works_perfectly so i '_m very happy but it is a pity they couldn_'_t get it any faster .
neutral	i really love my ring but this is the second time in less_than two years that a diamond has fallen out of the setting .
neutral	it is a pain to send it back each time for it to be fixed so now i end up paying out of pocket to have it fixed near my home .
neutral	it makes me wish i had purchased my stone and setting at a store near me .
neutral	frames were reasonable but did find deeper discount on frames at another site after i had placed the order .
neutral	having_trouble adjusting to this pair of progressives , the mid distance is difficult if not impossible to find and the distance vision is a little off too .
neutral	using them primarily now for near vision at work only .
neutral	left lens also a little squeaky and hoping it won_'_t fall out contacted customer_service about this but they never got back to me .
neutral	not sure i would order progressive rx lenses from them again but maybe frames and lined bifocals .
neutral	i ordered a littmann_stethoscope that was supposed to be purple but it looks like a dark blue .
neutral	i am not thrilled and especially_since i paid $_00 for it .
neutral	i expected it to be the right color .
neutral	it took_ages .
neutral	every time i tried to do it , ít seemed to go in circles and send me back to the start , and say submit a review , epecially difficult on a phone .
neutral	wouldn_'_t have bothered but i wanted to support the place i stayed
neutral	i was really happy with everything about my shopping_experience with fabriah . com apart_from one thing .
neutral	when my product arrived , the plastic pump part of my shampoo was broken into little sharp pieces .
neutral	although it had been wrapped in bubble_wrap , it obviously hadn_'_t been protected sufficiently .
neutral	maybe the fault of the courier used / royal_mail but this is obviously disappointing as a consumer .
neutral	in terms of everything else when shopping with fabriah . com - very happy .
neutral	quality of products and prices - great .
neutral	website - easy to use .
neutral	communication about delivery - fab .
neutral	if they address this issue i would definitely buy products from them again and recommend them to family and friends .
neutral	i ordered this for a birthday_gift for one of my daughters and it was unable to be delivered to her address for some_reason .... it did arrive at my home which is great ..... i now need to send it to her again ..... her_birthday will_continue on .....
neutral	bed is comfortable , easy to erect , easy to pack away single handed , it '_s wide and lightweight , but the carry bag was very disappointing ., and therefore brought the rating down .
neutral	bag not only is paper thin providing little protection but there is no handle or shoulder_strap .
neutral	how is it portable ?
neutral	and how can you call it a carry bag ?
neutral	so , the book i received in the mail was in worse condition than i wanted it to be in .
neutral	the problem was with the packaging .
neutral	the person_who delivered a book ( which was placed in a large usps_priority_mail envelope ) shoved it into a mailbox cubby .
neutral	i spent 00_minutes trying to pull it out of the cubby .
neutral	literally , the person_who delivered it rolled up a large paperback book and shoved it into a small cubby .
neutral	so naturally the packaging and the book was a bit more damaged when i received it .
neutral	we ordered the lion squeaky toy for our dog and once again it took him less_than two minutes to rip out two of the squeakers .
neutral	so frustrating .
neutral	we live in the country and as petflow only uses fedex to deliver and they won_'_t deliver to us .
neutral	they go so_far and mail it the rest of the way .
neutral	because of this i probably will not order from petflow again .
neutral	pub storage took over another storage_space where the people had been much_nicer and accomodating .
neutral	the ankle_brace that i bought is flimsy on bottom , the ankle_support seems great .
neutral	not sure my son will wear it .
neutral	i thought it would be more snug , but the bottom just flaps .
neutral	delivery was very quick at no charge , so very happy with that .
neutral	we still have not received our corrected profile that we were suppose to receive when we purchased the anuity several_months_ago .
neutral	it was supposed to have been sent w_/ our contract .
neutral	we were suppose to get it back in january .
neutral	please send it .
neutral	also , could you send me a link where i can tract the current performance of our anuity .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	p . s .
neutral	< private_data_removed_> was very helpfull getting the profile corrected , but she said another dept .
neutral	had to send it to us .
neutral	we booked our stay for cancun around new years and had an amazing customer_service experience !
neutral	we originally_booked for the bahamas , but changed our mind less_than a day later and chose to visit cancun for our_honeymoon .
neutral	however , when i recently booked a hotel in las_vegas for my bachelorette , we forgot to apply coupon mgm00 at checkout .
neutral	we called less_than a minute after confirmation and were connected to a customer_service agent .
neutral	he was mediocre - at best .
neutral	he wasn_'_t understanding at all , and when i asked if he could honor the coupon , he told me it was already a great deal , inferring that the $_00 and an_additional_$_00 food credit was minor .
neutral	i was frustrated , and he told me there '_s nothing he could do .
neutral	he kept restating the same thing , so i just gave up and cancelled my reservation online , then rebooked it with the coupon .
neutral	i was out the $_00 . 00 for cancelling my hotel , but at_least i was still able to save $_00 and get a food credit ( which , no_matter_how good of a deal it already was , i still thought made a huge_difference in value ).
neutral	anyway , out of the two experiences , my experience with booking cancun was awesome , so i won_'_t forget the great customer_service i received !
neutral	however , the second service agent could use some additional training , or he shouldn_'_t be in customer_service .
neutral	you need to be a little more understanding if " helping " people is your job .
neutral	i loved the prices on the items .
neutral	even_though i paid equal amount on shipping , the price was still great !
neutral	i wore one pair of my boots yesterday and they looked awesome .
neutral	however , today i pulled out the other pair and they were severely damaged .
neutral	now , i have to through the return process .
neutral	i will shop them again in spite of the defective boot - unless it '_s a common occurrence .
neutral	i used silver_shuttle for my ride to heathrow_airport .
neutral	the service overall wasn_'_t bad .
neutral	i used the shared service , which_meant i shared a ride with another customer going to the same location .
neutral	i booked it for 0am and received a message from them stating that my driver would be there at 0 . 00am .
neutral	i think that they ask customers to be flexible with the booking , so i was kinda expecting a different time .
neutral	but then the driver turned_up at 0 . 00 am instead and i wasn_'_t quite ready .
neutral	early is usually a good thing , but not on this occasion .
neutral	it was so annoying .
neutral	then we went to pick_up the other customer and the driver looked like he didn_'_t know where she lived .
neutral	then the customer also said to the driver that she wasn_'_t expecting him so early .
neutral	i give them a thumbs_up for at_least getting me to the airport and also sending a clean , spacious car but the above experience let it down a little .
neutral	overall , i would still use the service , but i ' d probably have to talk things through with the management before booking .
neutral	or i may just used another cab service that i recently found which only charges £ 0 extra for a private cab .
neutral	the product was great but we are still_waiting for a pass - code for the windows 0 application we paid for as a part of the deal .
neutral	we keep being told it is on the disc case - but it definitely isn_'_t and now the trial_period has run_out - so we don_'_t have windows 0 .
neutral	not very happy :-(
neutral	i almost booked this a few_times but stopped when i read all the small small_print on the ' more info ' page that went on about bringing cash in an envelope with your registration_number written on it .
neutral	this left me feeling
neutral	a ) ripped_off .. extra costs hidden in small_print and
neutral	b ) like it '_s such a lot of hassle - when you book this kind of service to be hassle_free .
neutral	it '_s a petty amount of money - just include it and advertise it as including all hidden parking charges and it will be appealing to people for that reason .
neutral	i revisited it because you sent me the 0 %_off offer - but to be honest there are a number of these services available ( i '_ve used them all ) and the prices all vary from day to day and i could just as easily have booked one of those if the prices worked out - so the 0 % deal was in no way enough to bring me back .
neutral	it doesn_'_t even cover one of the 0 hidden car_park charges .
neutral	i still have no_intention of locating an envelope and writing my registration on it etc .
neutral	[ updated after reply entered on 00 / 00 / 0000_]
neutral	you advertise a service - the customer doesn_'_t ( and shouldn_'_t have to ) care whether you ' re an agency or not - that '_s your issue .
neutral	any valet service at stansted will now incur this cost and you can absolutely advertise it as such .
neutral	you should charge the extra money and the drivers should take_care of the payment .
neutral	if you refuse to get involved in that then the minimum you should do is put " plus car_park access charges and booking fee " in the prices advertised .
neutral	otherwise it is false_advertising .
neutral	trying to obtain telephone verification was stressful .
neutral	it took several_attempts to accomplish this part .
neutral	you offered two choices landline or mobile but you only responded to the mobile by sending at text_message .
neutral	i suggest that you inform customers that they should give their mobile number so that you can send a text .
neutral	though you said you could call , no call came for either landline or mobile , otherwise everything else was satisfactory .
neutral	i think the bargains are remarkable , but having to buy a certain_amount in dollars is not clear until checkout .
neutral	also , i placed a order two_weeks_ago or more , and when i checked on it recently , i was told that it hadn_'_t even been picked_up for shipment .
neutral	the order had to be placed again , and i still don_'_t have it .
neutral	when i requested that some small items be added , i was told it couldn_'_t be done .
neutral	i also offered to pay the shipping on a small order , and that was also denied .
neutral	all the phone reps have been congenial and accommodating , however .
neutral	as a technical recruiter , i have been using ziprecruiter for about a year now ... i find the ability to post a position within their site and their cross posting is wonderful and the social networking linking is also good .
neutral	there is room for improvement !
neutral	job_postings ... would like to see the formatting when cutting and pasting from a word or rtf document to remain in proper format .
neutral	when linking your job_postings to your social_networks especially linkedin . com , i would like to see it pull your groups into a drop down selection ... it is very hard to remember all the groups your are a member of when linking .
neutral	when posting a job , would like to see a way for a candidate is disqualified from applying due to non_- citizenship or requires sponsorship to be blocked ... it is a waste of time if you do not sponsor h0b visas .
neutral	daily 0 - 00 candidates require sponsorship .
neutral	search resumes well , this could use a great amount of improvement .
neutral	text resume the format is often unreadable due to distortion of the formatting ... it is just to many steps to review a candidates resume .. why not just pull up the formatted resume instead of going thru so many steps ... it is time_consuming .
neutral	would like to see some advance search capabilities to narrow your search efforts especially if interested in relocating and citizenship .
neutral	i am passionate_about recruiting and i am all about the ease of functionality and productivity .
neutral	i think ziprecruiter could be a fabulous product and i am hoping it gets there !
neutral	my order arrived_promptly but someone got the order wrong in some respects .
neutral	okay , that happens .
neutral	then i called to correct it , offering to send back the unordered treats .
neutral	i was very kindly told to keep them and the right stuff would be sent .
neutral	nope .
neutral	still not right .
neutral	but too much_trouble to continue .
neutral	the dogs love the treats and will enjoy them just fine .
neutral	the niceness of those i spoke with obviously went a long way .
neutral	can you get your suppliers to be sure to indicate where the product come from ?
neutral	my order was made in the usa ( which i wanted to be sure about ) but it didn_'_t say that on the label .
neutral	i have no_issues with the product , but we received no positive effects from using it .
neutral	sorry .
neutral	location to far from my house , but rates were cheaper for size unit .
neutral	so no big deal
neutral	i think the clothes are fair - good they could improve by catering for larger_sizes a lot more , not just the 00 '_s - 00 '_s but the 00 00 00 00 and 00 sizes too as most shops do now .
neutral	i think the shoes are great and for the money you can expect very good quality , however there is one thing that stops me from ordering on a daily_basis and that is the postage .
neutral	it is crazy to pay £ 0 for a small key_ring but then £ 0 . 00 postage , same as a scarf that costs just 00p to send !
neutral	i think you could improve this by doing what most companies do and that is to charge a set amount for how ever many items you purchase , for example £ 0 . 00 for any amount of items be it one scarf or 00 pairs of shoes , that would be a fair price as that is what very , asos , next , etc all charge and smaller companies too that sell items in ebay , one price no_matter_how much you order .
neutral	anyway overall a great site with a reasonable amount of choice and nice quality .
neutral	i understand that mistakes are made sometimes , but when i call customer_service or send in a request regarding a mistake that the company made i expect to speak with someone within a few hours if not right_away .
neutral	it has_been almost 00_hours since i have addressed the wrong part being sent to me and i still have yet to speak with anyone .
neutral	i tried to call the phone_number for customer_service and they no_longer offer customer_service via phone ... how convenient .
neutral	the prices on the website are great , but customer_service surely needs to get it together .
neutral	order was ok , but dealing_with cust service putting in a ticket for your issue takes days to resolve .
neutral	and the resolve was pointed back to it being my fault - not .
neutral	wrong answer .
neutral	also when ordering alot of personalized cards its a timely process .
neutral	the computer kept requiring input of personal information too often .
neutral	process was streamlined and not complicated .
neutral	we received an e_- mail about a recent fare sale , and tried to book two round_trip tickets at the same time ; we were only able to finalize one ticket at the advertised price , then had to book the second ticket at a higher price .
neutral	i loved the food that i liked .
neutral	i '_m very picky and can '_t eat some foods .
neutral	about a third of the menu was still really great .
neutral	with the ability to customize , i should have been very happy every week .
neutral	the problem was the constant replacement .
neutral	i would plan out my whole week , but then some of it would be replaced .
neutral	my last_week out of 00 meals - 00 were replacements that i did not want .
neutral	that '_s over 00_% of my meals for the week !
neutral	customer_service is very nice but not very helpful .
neutral	i asked about replacements , refunds , something - and got no help - 0 different weeks .
neutral	i was told that they couldn_'_t promise what they would have on hand every week .
neutral	then why is it on the my menu for the week ?
neutral	the actual menu for the week wasn_'_t released until after the order was shipped - after which they will not help .
neutral	i wasn_'_t allowed to send it back , refuse it , or get a refund .
neutral	if only my menu was actually my menu , i would still be a customer .
neutral	i loved the site - easy to use , and found my product quickly .
neutral	cheap , and got my package way sooner_than i anticipated .
neutral	but , when i got the tape i purchased all three rolls were stained .
neutral	it looked like someone spilled pink juice all over the white tape i ' d purchased .
neutral	it works ok ... but i can tell it '_s not as sticky as i ' d like .
neutral	so , the product was meh , but service was good .
neutral	may or may not buy again ... as i '_m almost out of the tape since i ' d had to throw_away a nice portion of the stained stuff .
neutral	good products and competitive_prices but despatch dates can be little slower_than shown at point of sale .
neutral	unless u pay for the delivery it can be slow often taking a week to receive goods .
neutral	lucky they use royal_mail so i can pick_up from sorting_office if not home for delivery !
neutral	i got this service thinking that it was a good deal with the dsl internet and the phone combined .
neutral	the whole setup process over the phone was kind of extensive and i '_m sure we discussed that i used internet for gaming and streaming videos , email , etc .
neutral	however , after i get the service and set it up , it runs somewhat slowly and on technical_support call with at & t after my modem just stops working for my computer , i am told that the service i have is not at all recommended for use with video streaming , which i have been using it for with netflix .
neutral	i am disappointed with the service that i got and the fact that it can '_t be upgraded because of the area that i am located in .
neutral	i wish that it would have been clearly_stated that my service would be somewhat slow and not beneficial for what i needed it for .
neutral	the phone service is fine so_far , with the telemarketing calls that start after beginning new phone service .
neutral	i sincerely hope that i '_m not locked into a 0 - year contract so that after my lease ends next year , i still won_'_t be stuck with this sub - par internet service and speed .
neutral	the online booking process is very easy to use , but good luck if you need to make any changes to an existing reservation .
neutral	the system usually tells you that you can '_t make_changes on the site and you have to call customer_service .
neutral	then customer_service wants to charge you for having a rep help you and you have to prove to them that the system didn_'_t allow you to make_changes by sending them a screen_shot of the error_message you received .
neutral	they won_'_t just take your word for it , they want you to prove it , which is unacceptable .
neutral	they also use call centers in regions that don_'_t necessarily speak_english as a first language , which can make communication difficult .
neutral	overall , the problems get resolved eventually , but too much time is spent when you can '_t make the changes yourself online .
neutral	took the shipping that cost more to ensure the cards would be here on time .
neutral	said they would arrive between 00 / 00 / 0000 through 00 / 00 / 0000 .
neutral	today is the 00rd and still no cards .
neutral	did find website very user_friendly .
neutral	already bought electric gold 00 lights loved them , but these battery lights were more yellow than the warm gold and really not enough lights on there .
neutral	i wish this product worked in my nespresso pixie for several reasons_: the price , the quickness of delivery , and the amazing customer_service when i had a problem .
neutral	unfortunately , the product needs to be tweaked because it didn_'_t work in my nespresso_machine at all :( my machine wouldn_'_t or couldn_'_t punch through the top of the capsules and made my machine stop dead .
neutral	please fix this so i can use your product !!
neutral	!
neutral	the product was exactly_what i was looking for but it took about 0_weeks to get .
neutral	i don_'_t know if it was due to the weather or not it just took to long for me to get what i ordered .
neutral	i love the prices but most of the items are in small or small and medium .
neutral	it '_s frustrating when you see something you like and go to the page and see that it only comes in small ... or certain shoe_sizes
neutral	the sizing is a bit off to hoodies ive baught else where at 00 / 00 ... first one ive had to get a 00 in before and could prob stand a size_bigger for the baggy look .
neutral	not the most flattering fit but that is most_likely the colour .
neutral	web team were great when asking about changing it in a shop .
neutral	trafford centre team not so great , got the criminal feeling as it was given the full once over .
neutral	courier service excellent .
neutral	however not so good when i requested the name of the recipient for my parcel as they said it had not been received .
neutral	i emailed customers services on 0 . 0 . 00 asking for the name of the recipient .
neutral	i was emailed a document from the courier with the signature which was totally unrecognisable .
neutral	i then said i really wanted the name of the person_who received the parcel .
neutral	i was told that interparcel would get back on to the courier and get the name .
neutral	i am still_waiting for a reply .
neutral	as it happened i took the matter up direct with the company i sent the parcel to and resolved the matter .
neutral	however i am disappointed that i paid for a signature which was unreadable .
neutral	i suggest that the couriers in the future also write down the name of the recipient .
neutral	i found website easy to use and to understand .
neutral	however , when i came to pay it was credit_card with charges or paypal .
neutral	i elected for paypal which i have used before and it would not accept it .
neutral	i checked everything on paypal to the extent of setting it up again !
neutral	i decided to see what would happen if i used my credit_card and as soon as the number was in - before i pressed another key - it was accepted and so i paid with excess charges .
neutral	why could i not have used a debit_card ?
neutral	everything else perfect .
neutral	would use again if this niggle is sorted_out .
neutral	it was easy to order from your website .
neutral	i have still not received the item i bought on 0rd jan .
neutral	i love getting gift_cards here but sometimes there is a time_consuming delay during checkout .
neutral	the verification process of gift_cards states it can take up to 0 minutes and the wheel will just keep spinning , even past 0 minutes .
neutral	i can refresh the page several_times with the same results !
neutral	there should be a ukash voucher for more than 00 dollars .
neutral	some items i would like to purchase are almost 000_dollars , and since you can only get 0 voucher at a time , i have to wait almost a week to purchase something more than 00 dollars .
neutral	the activation_fee for ukash is way to high .
neutral	i limit the amount of times i use this because of that .
neutral	i ordered extension tubing for a hollister leg drainage bag .
neutral	in the picture , the tubing was round .
neutral	this is exactly_what i was looking for , as my supply company sends me tubing that is flat - shaped and it often kinks .
neutral	well , that is the tubing i ended_up receiving from express med .
neutral	if that is the only tubing that is available now , then the picture needs to be updated .
neutral	first time i have used this website and was ok unfortunately the hotel was not .
neutral	they said they had problems with their rooms and they were booking me into another hotel a 00_min drive away .
neutral	got there and they said they knew nothing about me or the other couple who were also being moved .
neutral	awesome driver sorted it out for us .
neutral	not happy i had a room accessed by a lot of stairs in a basement with no window even_though i had special requested a room avoiding stairs because of my bad knee making stairs difficult .
neutral	protested to the person taking my case for me but he said i could ask to be moved and carried on taking my case downstairs .
neutral	having already lost an_hour of my evening and already being 0 flights of stairs down to the basement i could not face the aggrevation of re - climbing the stairs .
neutral	room was nice and clean but got those stairs to climb in the morning :(
neutral	product was fine but i was never sent an_email_confirming delivery .
neutral	also , the gentleman that answered the phone seemed lost and had no information on if my order shipped or not .
neutral	selection is better_than a store , but the try - on feature is limited , so not being_able to see the frames ahead of time makes ordering a gamble , especially with the return_policy .
neutral	also , the order took a loooong time to process , more than a month .
neutral	the product seems fine , nothing i couldn_'_t have gotten at costco , frankly , despite fancy name - brand frames .
neutral	also , filing with insurance was an extra step that took more time to figure_out , do , and get the check .
neutral	i like the selection , but i don_'_t think my next pair of glasses will come from this site .
neutral	it '_s good , although i think they rip you off with some games .
neutral	once you '_ve sent your games it takes ages to actually get them approved and the money eventually sent to you .
neutral	i got a decent rate and it was easy to book , however , when i received my email_confirmation , all it said was my marriott hotel was booked .
neutral	i '_m not even certain i '_ve reserved my nights at the right hotel , although the photo looks like it .
neutral	how difficult would it be to put the specific hotel name and contact information on the reservation ?
neutral	good place to order the only_thing i found with the shoes they run smaller then the original size .
neutral	that should be mentioned in their shoe dept regarding the flip_flops ,
neutral	i had a tough start you guys as it took a lot longer to set_up than i had expected .
neutral	my first payment went missing and i tried emailing and calling but no one could / would help so i am now down $_000 but besides for that everything has_been alright .
neutral	i would recommend to others that need to pay their student_loan
neutral	my first ordering experience with petflow was okay , but not great .
neutral	i emailed the cs department a question about a coupon , but they never responded .
neutral	the order arrived in a timely_fashion , but the box of kitty_litter had broken open and was all over the bottom of the shipping box .
neutral	what a mess !
neutral	petflow offers convenience and decent prices , but their service could be improved .
neutral	i don_'_t like the way you show your orders and no tracking #'_s to check out whats going on .
neutral	but the prices are good .
neutral	recently while strolling through town i saw an ad on a bus " multitrip_insurance " for as little as 00 . 00 yo yos .
neutral	hmmmmmmmmmmm
neutral	that sounds like its too good to be true i thought .
neutral	and so it was ...... logged on and guess what ? i ended_up paying over 00 yo yos for something advertised as 00 . 00 .
neutral	bit disappointing .
neutral	the ordering and payment went fine .
neutral	unfortunately , when the company sent me my plaques they did not include my name on the package address .
neutral	my post_office does not accept packages without names so they sent it back .
neutral	because of this mess - up i did not have the plaques for the event where i needed them which was extremely frustrating .
neutral	so_far , i am noticing that i am not able to access notices that you have sent me regarding activity on my account .
neutral	what '_s the purpose of having something like this if it won_'_t show what '_s going on .
neutral	it just stuck with a blank page and i finally gave up .
neutral	will probably call when i get a chance .
neutral	items were as_pictured on the website but in person , the quality was pretty poor .
neutral	polyester dresses aren_'_t really that nice to wear , even if they look very pretty .
neutral	i rented a 00 x 00 which turned_out to be 0 0 x 0 '_s with the center wall taken out but by doing that it gave_me a 00 x 00 with two doors that needed locks instead of one roll up door .
neutral	i had to pay 00 . 00 for one lock and 00 . 00 for the other lock .
neutral	i should have only had to pay for one lock .
neutral	nit picky but it showed little consideration for the person renting .
neutral	for the cost of the item not worth the price .
neutral	i found it very difficult to navigate placing the order .
neutral	at no point did i find a site that allowed you to view the whole order , plus details when the flowers will be delivered , etc .
neutral	this is my first experience ordering myself on the pc .
neutral	normally i go through my local_florist .
neutral	i just hope , fingers_crossed , that the right order will be delivered at the right time to the right address .
neutral	when we showed_up at the airport , they did not have our reserved vehicle available , however for a $_00 a day upcharge , they could find another vehicle .
neutral	we felt trapped so we agreed .
neutral	when we got to our vehicle , there was ' our original vehicle ' parked right next to our upgraded one .
neutral	after flying 00_hours we decided just to take it and go about our vacation .
neutral	very disappointed with the ' bait & switch '.
neutral	i usually use wag . com because they offer free overnight shipping , but recently i had to switch my dogs food and wag doesn_'_t offer the new brand so i went looking for a new delivery service .
neutral	i stumbled_upon pet_flow and was happy to find that they offer the brand i was looking for .
neutral	i ordered the food on aug 00 and they said it ' d ship on the 00st .
neutral	i was happy .
neutral	but it didn_'_t ship until a week_later taking two_weeks for the first half of the order and another couple days for the second half .
neutral	maybe i '_m spoiled by wag . com but i wasn_'_t super happy with how long it took to get the food .
neutral	plus , the site isn_'_t super user_friendly so i think i '_m going to go looking again .
neutral	service great but felt_like i was giving my books away .
neutral	not sure it was worth the money .
neutral	site very good - however my only bug bear this was my first order and as my husband and i work all day i wanted the goods delivered to my work address , but because this is my first order it had to delivered to my home address .
neutral	which as anyone_who works knows who works all day this presents it own problems .
neutral	but apart_from that i still ordered as it was way cheaper_than anyone_else .
neutral	i guess is not entirely wowcher '_s fault , but i think they should make_sure vendors are really reliable .
neutral	i always check reviews online now before buying anything , and i '_m used to see that for quite a few of them there don_'_t get many good reviews .
neutral	i '_m having_trouble with an item at the moment and i '_ve been trying to sort this out for a month .. frustrating :/
neutral	ordered slippers but can not get on the web_site to redeem will have to phone for help this was later resolved
neutral	i '_ve been calling your phone_number for two_weeks on hold entirely too long
neutral	i would have rated my purchase 0_stars , only not had it fitted yet .
neutral	my plumber is not available until september .
neutral	i only bought as i felt_pressured by better_bathrooms to buy during there 00 year sale , as prices would go up .
neutral	so i did .
neutral	only to find that nothing has changed , prices still the same , just called 00_%_off sale .
neutral	i know have a full bathroom_suite stored all over the house awaiting my plumber .
neutral	one criticism is , they will not delay the delivery to accomodate you .
neutral	once you have ordered , then they will deliver .
neutral	if i was in a rush , this would of been excelllent .
neutral	unfortunately this and the fact the 00 year sale was no more than pressure to get us to part with our money there and then has left me somewhat miffed .
neutral	i ordered my dog_food on a friday expecting to receive it by tues or wednesday .
neutral	when the dog_food did not arrive i looked up my order and tracking_number and found out that the food was due to arrive on friday .
neutral	well , i was leaving for vacation on friday and had to find a local_store that carried my dog '_s food and ask them to special order it for me for thurday . i also had to ask a friend to stop at my house and lug 00_lbs of dog_food inside for me .
neutral	when i emailed customer_service they apologized and told me that they were sorry but they didn_'_t have the dog_food in the closer warehouse and had to mail it from one further away .
neutral	if i had been notified of this i would have cancelled the order .
neutral	they also offered me a 00_% rebate on the food .
neutral	this is why i rated them a 0_star instead of a 0_star .
neutral	for the second time using this website , it was all good until i tried to pay , after_submitting about five times i finally got confirmation .
neutral	this happened on both_occasions and is worrying because you don_'_t know if you ' re being charged once or five times !
neutral	frustrating !
neutral	the collars were not very bright , i was kind of disappointed with that and 0 out of the 0 lights i purchased for on the collar didn_'_t work , but the one that did was nice and bright .
neutral	the charm i ordered is very lovely but i was disappointed that the padded_envelope and the inner box were both torn and broken - especially as i paid for special delivery .
neutral	as it was a gift i was not able to give it in the box which diminished the appearance .
neutral	if you want more customer , please make it more cheaper to call to countries like ethiopia .
neutral	i ordered one bag but somehow got two and it made no sense to me .
neutral	as a result i was charged for shipping even_though i paid for two large_bags .
neutral	not real happy about that .
neutral	recently i ordered love softball , item # a0000f .
neutral	it would not press onto the shirt for nothing !
neutral	that design was $ 0 . 00 plus the cost of my shirt .
neutral	another design was sassy talkin girl item # a0000f .
neutral	some of that design pilled off .
neutral	item # a0000c sun and fun youth was the same way .
neutral	i have made several other ones that have turned_out perfect and i love , but something was wrong with these few .
neutral	i don_'_t know if maybe they were old or what .
neutral	i was very disappointed .
neutral	ordered the brushes as they were cheaper_than going to oral_b .
neutral	they do a similar job but the brush is missing its brisstles in the middle of the brush which oral_b has .
neutral	so with molarclean the middle of the brush is empty .
neutral	the bristles feel slightly softer than oral_b .
neutral	good on the pocket but in the long run will be ordering from oral_b .
neutral	the website was great and very helpful !!!
neutral	unfortunately never got to purchase the item , because it was out of stock .
neutral	seeing that i should have been informed about the product being out of stock , before i push the purchase button .
neutral	( keep that in mind ).
neutral	but my credit_card was refunded swiftly ... so i did appreciate that , maybe in the near_future i can do_business , at this time it is still questionable ......???
neutral	?
neutral	i bought a disneystore discounted_gift_card , however , when i received it , it was a disneystore merchandise credit_card , total_waste of my money .
neutral	i had several problems with wimdu ; firstly they posted my details without my authorisation , then the guy dealing_with it had left so you get someone different answering you queries each time .
neutral	although i wasn_'_t particularly happy i stuck with it and had a decent response .
neutral	the people i have had to stay have all been lovely but wimdu penalise you if you refuse a booking which i think is ridiculous .
neutral	i have every right to choose who stays in my home and if someone puts in a last_minute request , it '_s not always possible .
neutral	if i have one more bad_experience i '_ll be leaving , sadly .
neutral	but could have done with unpacking my desk & taking cardboard with them
neutral	the ‘ free ’ boat_trip was superb .
neutral	the live_commentary was detailed , lively and very entertaining .
neutral	i found the buses confusing as the route each bus was on was not obvious and heavy_traffic made progress very slow .
neutral	we did not ever manage to get on one with a live_guide - i wonder what the ratio of taped to live is ?
neutral	the taped commentary on the bus was minimal with too much ‘ stirring ’ music filling the gaps .
neutral	i like the design and colors alot , but was disappointed to realize they were made of plastic and therefore have melted and the letters get distorted .
neutral	while the part was delivered when you said , it was the wrong part .
neutral	i ended_up going advanced_auto_parts and got the part cheaper ( less shipping !).
neutral	what do i need to do to send it back and get my money back ?
neutral	booking very quick and easy , even when the wrong tyres were booked i was contacted and the error was sorted .
neutral	at the garage every one was booked in at the same time , not a great experience seemed that they were too busy and as i did not know exactly_what my wheel nut was no real help and a fellow customer had to help me .
neutral	ok i should have thought through it but other fitters find it for me .
neutral	priceline bidding is great for getting good deals on hotels .
neutral	however , 0 - star that are dirty , rundown , and have scary clientele are within priceline guidelines .
neutral	you won_'_t get a refund from the hotel unless you stick around long enough to make a formal_complaint , and without that priceline won_'_t do a thing for you except a $_00 off a 0 - star .
neutral	key in my usual area is 0 - star .
neutral	you get a decent clean room with microwave usually and often fridge or kitchenette .
neutral	start bidding with 0 - stars just in case any are biting ;-).
neutral	had trouble loging in as it wouldn_'_t accept my e_- mail address which was and is valid despite what it kept saying .
neutral	i nearly gave up but persevered as i needed the magnets .
neutral	however once i ' d managed to login it was all very straight_forward .
neutral	magnets arrived_promptly and well_packaged .
neutral	i had high_hopes for the spoiled_rotten_box when i ordered it .
neutral	i had to call the company to complete my order because the site wouldn_'_t complete it .
neutral	i have three dogs , 0lbs , 00lbs and 000lbs .
neutral	being dachshunds and a german_shepherd dog , they are all ' power ' chewers !
neutral	i was truly disappointed that there wasn_'_t even one toy in the box .
neutral	there was 0 can of food , 0 roll of food , 0 box of calming treats , 0 pack of beef & cheddar treats , 0 pack of tiny ' brushless toothpaste ' treats , 0 spearmint star shaped chew , a key_chain and a silicone teddy_bear that you can bake or freeze treats in .
neutral	if i gave that to any of my dogs it would be destroyed in minutes !
neutral	all in all , $_00 for a selection of treats is really expensive .
neutral	i would have really liked at_least one toy .
neutral	it '_s helpful to seek out options , but i never find any actual bargains .
neutral	hi !
neutral	i really love this website but i had bad_experience and wasn_'_t one time , that '_s the worst part ...
neutral	long time ago ( more than a year ) i returned a pair of boots they told me that i had a credit store , after a wile i was trying to buy something and my credit store wasn_'_t there i sent an_email and they apologize and told that they will return the money to my bank acc i wrote back and told them that i don_'_t have that bank acc anymore but instead i want a credit store i want to buy stuffs , well they never respond to my emails and i sent many !
neutral	after that i keep buying because i like everything !!
neutral	well i need return 0 item ( was to big ) but they told me that i need a number or code , something like that but they never send me any code ( i was checking my email and my account in the webpage ) the time already_passed ( waiting ) and was only 00 days to returned the merchandise so i couldn_'_t do anything , after that i stop buying , they are very unprofessional !
neutral	!
neutral	shipping is a little_bit of a shock at first but if you watch what you order its not bad at all .
neutral	i ordered a 00_lb of blue_buffalo freedom and a little pack of dog_treats .
neutral	i received the dog_food in good shape , but the dog_treats were smashed by the heavy_bag of dog_food , so they were in crumbles .
neutral	i would suggest putting the dog_treats in a separate package inside the big box for the dog_food to protect the treat bag from getting crushed by the big bag of dog_food .
neutral	i tried multiple_times over multiple days to book online .
neutral	everytime i clicked ' bookit now ' it went back to the beginning and started me all over .
neutral	i ended_up having to call the toll_free number and although the gentleman was very nice and helpful , it took over an_hour to process my request .
neutral	then after it '_s all said and done , i get an_email 0 days_later saying the show i booked is not available on the day i booked it .
neutral	i '_m sure there will be more of that coming before my trip takes place .
neutral	not a happy customer .
neutral	very nervous as to what ' type ' of room i get at the pallazzo ….
neutral	i just worry it '_s going to be not what i ordered and paid for … i read a lot of comments where that '_s happened and the hotel blames it on bookit and won_'_t do anything for you .
neutral	nervous .
neutral	the shipping_costs way too much so only by from them if they are the last option .
neutral	it is often difficult to change an auto - order .
neutral	i have to then make a phone_call , so the convenience is gone .
neutral	to cancel an auto - order , you are directed to make a phone_call .
neutral	again , inconvenient .
neutral	the website encourages auto - orders , so i signed_up for them initially because of the promise of locked - in prices .
neutral	this was a false claim .
neutral	i booked on - line .
neutral	not until after indicating what i wanted size - wise and had moved at_least half - way through the process did i learn that the $ 0 move - in did not apply .
neutral	spoke to several other renters near me who had the same experience .
neutral	i was very pleased to find you could ship the iams premium protection dry_cat_food to me as i was not able to find these two varieties in pet_stores .
neutral	the order process was great ; the delivery was great ... but one of the items shipped was the wrong item .
neutral	i have called customer_support and they should be shipping the correct item .
neutral	as requested , i am sending back the upc code for credit from the incorrect item shipped .
neutral	i '_m hoping the replacement will arrive soon .
neutral	if it does , then i will be happy to report a very good experience with petflow .
neutral	the reservations transaction was fine , however , i am very upset that it wasn_'_t explained to me that i was dealing_with a third_party .
neutral	i was under the impression i was talking with hampton_inn reservations .
neutral	when i questioned my hilton points , your rep told me to discuss that with the hotel when i checked in .
positive	my machine was delivered timely with clear_instructions and lots of samples !
positive	i have been getting steady orders and the machine has not failed me !
positive	thanks !
positive	full service that i really appreciate .
positive	great job !
positive	but you have a really good service , thank_you .
positive	came fast and the goods were not damaged .
positive	when i ordered kitty_litter from petco , the boxes were ripped apart and litter got everywhere .
positive	mychewy has such better packing , everything came in perfect_condition .
positive	plus , the prices are great !
positive	roam_right - does it right !
positive	coverages - done with care
positive	customer_service - outstanding ; friendly ; experienced and factual !
positive	roam_right receives a triple aaa with me !
positive	we will definetly used them on all our future_trips !
positive	i purchased thuja occidentalis to try with my toy_poodle who has some warts .
positive	i have not had it long enough to tell whether it is going to work with her .
positive	i have given her only one dose so_far , and i have read that it works for some dogs and not for others .
positive	order response and shipping was excellent .
positive	very good sight and very quick in shipping
positive	ordered on a sunday and had my dog_food in 0 days .
positive	will_definitely order from them again .
positive	town_fair tire in wet hartford is truly amazing .
positive	my tire caps got welded on and the tire system needed to be replaced .

positive	all of their staff are considerate , caring , non_- judgmental and professional .
positive	highly_recommended
positive	a * service - thanks
positive	each year we make my hubby '_s amazing barbeque sauce for holiday gifts .
positive	i enjoy the the choices that i have with my own_labels in customizing our bottles .
positive	there are so many great styles to chose from .

positive	i especially like the fact that i don_'_t have to reinvent my label each time because the information is saved for me !
positive	makes it quick and easy to order .
positive	shipping is quick and efficient .
positive	i would highly_reccommend this company !
positive	thanks to sparefoot , a dreaded move was problem free .

positive	tyres were fitted whilst i was at work so caused me no_hassle what so ever .
positive	would definitely recommend .
positive	i discovered petflow on facebook .
positive	recently , i realized that i was out of pet_food far too often .
positive	driving to the grocery or petco is a hassle .
positive	i decided to order a giant supply of cat_food and dog_food from petflow .
positive	now the pantry is fully_stocked in case of disaster and for regular feedings .
positive	petflow delivered quickly .
positive	thanks petflow !
positive	very happy with their services .
positive	we would highly_recommend this site for travel .
positive	booking was easy .
positive	we called airlines to confirm our booking , and we were in the system in thessaoniki greece computers at the airlines .
positive	we look_forward to using this site again for travel .
positive	in friendly and helpful service and in product , pricing and delivery .
positive	i can highly_recommend flashbay without reservation .
positive	molly smith , norman , ok
positive	lenstore is far one of the best online website for contact_lenses .
positive	i have always received my lenses promptly and my order has always been accurate .
positive	i would defiantly recommend lenstore as it is good value for money .
positive	booking , contact and delivery were all first rate , including very good service from driver .
positive	i couldn_'_t have asked for an easier way to sell my old phone !
positive	it was so easy , and all i needed was sent to me the next_day !
positive	i also received my cheque within_00hours of sending my phone - brilliant service and would definitely use again .
positive	i wanted labels for canning_jars .
positive	i found a design i loved quickly and was able to personalize them easily .
positive	it couldn_'_t have been simpler !
positive	loved how fast i got my order in the mail .
positive	always please with my purchases .
positive	they are always like the website .
positive	thank_you for making it easy !
positive	i was able to use these labels and get my products done and out !
positive	had a very pleasurable_experience getting the product i purchased the way it is executed you feel as though the security is paramount well_worth buying
positive	people stop me on the street wanting to know where i got the scarf .
positive	the first time i wore it i was on a tour bus trip with about fifty other ladies and i thought they were going to take it away from me .
positive	i ordered more and gave them for christmas_gifts to all of my famly and friends .
positive	your scarves are really an " eye catcher ."
positive	very quick delivery !
positive	i absolutely_loved my experience with paul_puglisi and the team at autolenders in lakewood .
positive	they made my car buying experience an easy one !
positive	there are no gitchy sales people = only auto business development professionals .
positive	no one tried a hard_sell .
positive	i was in and out of the facility in 00_minutes as_promised .
positive	paul followed_up with me throughout the day - and when it came time to leave the lot he was very thorough in explaining how the vehicle functioned .
positive	we were recommended by friends several weeks_ago - i am so glad we made the choice to call auto_lenders .

positive	i bought a locked phone on ebay uk locked to vodafone , was under the misapprehension it would work for vodafone spain , so i had it unlocked by these_guys and i '_m absolutely_delighted .
positive	just what we needed arrived in good time .
positive	would use again .
positive	exceptional , responsive and trusted service .
positive	well_worth the extra money to get my passport done when i forgot to renew it in time .

positive	the representative that i worked with directly was always responsive to my questions and concerns .
positive	the price was very reasonable and the resulting sign looks great in our office .

positive	i have been having a hard time finding the pet_food my pets love locally .
positive	i will be using them again too .
positive	they also have this program for pets you can enroll in called spoiled_rotten boxes ..
positive	i didn_'_t try it but it looks pretty great .
positive	i like to read ingredients on things my pets get ...
positive	i ordered a pair of converse on the site .
positive	although the order had gone_through fine , my payment messed_up ( through the fault of paypal not blackleaf ) so had to ring to sort out .

positive	! would definatly recommend !!
positive	!
positive	town_fair tire is friendly and very helpful

positive	i mean $ 0 for $ 0 treats .
positive	of course there is a maximum at that price but still cannot_beat their pricing and service .

positive	. however , when i placed my order i had just bought a large_bag of dog_food and didn_'_t need it delivered so quickly .
positive	i can '_t_believe i am complaining_about the fast service , but there was a question that asked me if i wanted the delivery delayed and i said yes .
positive	but the order was still delivered immediately .
positive	i have the food in my basement as i don_'_t want it to get moldy from all the humid weather we '_ve had recently .

positive	as a parent , i was a little_skeptical_about letting my sons play " airsoft wars " but airsoft megastore '_s support_team has always been quick to help me find the appropriate guns .
positive	we '_ll continue shopping here as they are the only online airsoft store with such a good reputation and friendly service .
positive	i '_ve never not been able to find something i need on your site as far as photo_equipment goes .
positive	we live in the country and the special food we need is not available in the nearest large town .
positive	petflow makes getting our dry_food and cat_litter so convienent .
positive	if anything is not right about the order all we have to do is let petflow know by email and things are corrected to our satisfaction very rapidly .

positive	i '_ve been looking for a place to pick_up affordable s . korean and japanese styles and am so happy to have stumbled_upon this site .
positive	i '_ve just placed my first order - - so fingers_crossed !
positive	london and paris in mid - december !
positive	- we booked the bargain ticket for london that gave_us 0 days of sightseeing plus a free river_boat_cruise .
positive	there were also free walking_tours to key places including buckingham_palace to watch the changing of the guards .
positive	because we couldn_'_t do miles of walking , the hop on & off tours were an economical solution to our needs .
positive	the service was beyond our expectations because there was a bbt person to give us help , advice and directions wherever went .
positive	the commentary was very good with some real characters talking to us about the major points of interest plus stories , legends and tales about related people and events .
positive	doing this in december was really , really cold on top so sat downstairs most of the time .
positive	luckily , london stayed dry and we had some great sunny weather .
positive	unluckily , paris was very wet on the day we chose to take the bus so we did get very wet and cold as the best views were from upstairs .
positive	the free rain_ponchos are a nice_gesture but a rain canopy upstairs would have been preferred .
positive	also in paris , bbt had arranged for one of the other bus companies to take their customers but we weren_'_t advised of the arrangement so we spent some time trailing around in the rain trying to find the bus_stop before we found out .
positive	however , it was still a good way for us to see and hear about the important landmarks of paris and it would have been totally brilliant on a better day .
positive	i place my order with them on a monday and it was shipped by friday for free got to love them .
positive	could not wish for a better service than this from this company . the merchandise are also very good and are reasonably_priced .
positive	this was the easiest_way ever to buy cat_litter .
positive	the price was much_better_than i could find locally .
positive	buying several bags at once , and having them delivered to my front_door , made it super convenient .
positive	i appreciate having a service like this .
positive	thanks !
positive	the products offered though petflow are massive and the prices and sales they offer can '_t be beat !
positive	everything i ordered was top rate and came so fast .
positive	my dogs loved each and every treat and the small food bags i got them to sample .
positive	i will certainly be a life long customer .
positive	i googled " personalized_wine_labels " and found this site .
positive	i '_m glad i did .
positive	lots of events to choose from and options for personalization .
positive	great service , too !
positive	my labels were perfect !
positive	this is the go to company for fun buttons !
positive	my order was handled_efficiently and professionally .
positive	the quality is great !

positive	i was very happy with the time for the food to arrive as we were almost out of food here .

positive	he is a very picky kitten so i was wondering but he took to both the dry and canned_food well .
positive	i did not have to contact your customer_service but if it is anything like your shipping area , you will have my eternal business .
positive	so_far as i have seen chewy . com is a really good place to order from .

positive	the free_shipping was definitely a plus too .

positive	i really like your service and it was so amazing how fast you had it done and send it to me !!

positive	thank_you !
positive	upon discussions with other photographers , it appears your pricing fluctuates on a daily_basis and i appear to have paid more than others for the same product and that is a little_disappointing .
positive	otherwise the customer_service had been amazing , they arrived_promptly and look amazing and very professional .
positive	just stayed in lovely central_london hotel arranged through hotel direct .
positive	i thoroughly_recommend them .
positive	i am happy to recommend lightbulbs_direct .
positive	they have a good well priced range and a fast efficient delivery service

positive	my years of stubborn spots diminished from frequent to rarely .

positive	like many i discovered baublebar via the beauty community on youtube .
positive	baublebar is now my go - to for statement pieces .
positive	they have a variety from classic to colorful .
positive	i find their use of different materials very creative , but what takes the cake is the following customer_service experience .
positive	i received an_email letting_me know that the ship - date for my order was delayed because so many people had ordered the bauble i did .
positive	the email apologized for the delay and mentioned there would be a surprise included for our patience .
positive	at that point i was already impressed .
positive	the email illustrated the integrity of the company to contact customers affected by the delay .
positive	as for the extra , i imagined it might be something small , but i certainly did not expect an extra bauble and handwritten_note .
positive	i have never been so well treated by a retail company in my life .
positive	i was so surprised that a company would send out additional product , that otherwise has retail value to them , to compensate for a shipment delay .
positive	i also really appreciated the brief note ; it felt_like a very special gesture .
positive	i will return to baublebar again and again whenever i feel the need for some new sparkle .
positive	the website was very informative and the guidance provided helped_me to choose the right products .
positive	if you ' re trying for a baby you should definitely have a look !

positive	easy to use website , helpful sales operators when i called with a query and great delivery team .
positive	my only_downside is that i ordered through a cash_back website and my cashback claim has_been declined .
positive	was informed of the order being_processed and shipping details .
positive	parts arrived quickly .
positive	great service at all times .
positive	not only did i find the site easy to navigate and quick to use , the flowers , i am told , were absolutely_beautiful and delivered on time .
positive	i ' d recommend anyone to use this company and will certainly carry on using them myself .
positive	so many lovely , resonably_priced clothes , wish i had a pay rise so i could buy more .
positive	website '_s easy to use and they ' re really hot on customer_service .

positive	really brilliant !
positive	always get my hp_cartridges from them now as the price is so competitive and get them in a couple of days , sometimes quicker .
positive	the ink arrived at my home two_days after ordering .
positive	the cartridge came with a warning that the printer might still say low on ink , but that never happened and everything worked .
positive	there should be a note added , though to explain about peeling_off the blue film that is over the nozzle .
positive	i didn_'_t catch that at the beginning .
positive	i will buy again from this company - great prices !
positive	had problems with paypal , but lady on the phone was extremely_helpful , if the end product is as good as the booking i will be delighted !

positive	i booked the driveway service : the service person turned_up on the date booked with the correct tyres , fitted them efficiently - and took the trouble to make_sure i knew how to check my rear tyres to stay safe and legal .

positive	we have just returned from pollensa , we stayed in an apartment overlooking the sea and marina .
positive	central for everything , on a busy street at the front but the bedrooms at the back are silent , so excellent nights_sleep .
positive	plenty to see from the balcony , in fact if we went out we all could not wait to come_back in and sit there with a glass of wine watching the world go by .
positive	well_equipped apartment with every appliance , though a few basic essentials would have been an added touch , like bin bags , washing up liquid etc , this was no problem as the shops were only a few_minutes away .
positive	if i went again i would pack dishwasher tablets etc .
positive	lovely big balcony , comfy sofas , comfy beds and amazing storage_space for clothes etc .
positive	two large bathrooms one with a sunken bath which was lovely after a day on the beach .
positive	plenty of hot_water for our needs even after filling the enormous bath .
positive	teenagers could wander out at night and we felt that they were safe .
positive	bus_stop outside , boat trips from the marina , plenty of walks to neighbouring towns or just stroll across the road to the beach !
positive	the cleaner came mid week and changed the towels and cleaned through the apartment .
positive	the only_thing we didn_'_t have was the transfers through jv as the cost was £_000 for 0 of us - nearly all the taxis seat 0 so the cost was high for a five seater .
positive	when we arrived at palma airport we jumped on the local bus into palma town centre ( these run every 00_minutes ) and cost 0 euros each , we then transferred on to the pollensa bus which cost 0 euros each , making the transfer very cheap with very little effort .
positive	the bus stopped virtually outside the apartment and even_though we arrived before the allotted_time to arrive the apartment was ready for us .
positive	we would defiantly use again .
positive	my daughter and i wanted a nice overview of the city on our first day in london and we got just that with the big_bus_tour .
positive	we had a wonderful time being driven all over the city and the commentary was excellent .
positive	we also loved the complementary cruise on the thames as well .
positive	it was definitely money well - spent !
positive	from the order confirmation to the tracking update , this was a terrific transaction .
positive	i will absolutely be buying from petflow again !
positive	!
positive	i '_ve my glasses for over two years , but i love them more than the newer pair i got made up recently .
positive	because they are half frames , the bottom of the lenses had gotten chipped and the lenses were scratched .
positive	not a chic look .
positive	when i heard on money saving_expert that reglazemyglasses were offering a £_00 discount to overhaul my beloved specs i sent them off right_away .
positive	got a call - back within days offering various_options and i chose a basic lens with scratch - resist coating .
positive	there was absolutely no annoying up - selling pressure ( unlike my original provider ).
positive	they told me to expect the glasses back within 00 - 00 days and i received them well before the outside date .
positive	i '_m really pleased - i have an - almost - brand_new pair of specs with the frame that i really like , for less_than £_00 .
positive	thanks to all the staff at reglazemyglasses .
positive	amazingly great service , very quick ( and free ) delivery !
positive	well_done .

positive	they are friendly and most_importantly extremely prompt and efficient .
positive	when we were close to my terminal i realized i had left my gps in my car which i really needed to bring it to my destination .
positive	i asked the shuttle driver if i could stay on the shuttle and return with him to long_term_parking in order to retrieve my gps from my car .
positive	he told me to simply stand outside of my terminal and he ' d have the next shuttle drop_off my gps .
positive	in just 0 minutes another shuttle came by and the driver handed me my gps .
positive	now i call that customer_service !
positive	on my trip home i simply texted long_term_parking that i had arrived .
positive	unfortunately not being familiar with newark a / p i was waiting for the shuttle on the wrong level .
positive	a few_minutes later i received a phone_call that my driver had been waiting for me at the correct level .
positive	it took me a while to get there and when i did i apologized to the driver ( leo ).
positive	he was smiling , friendly and gracious and apologized to me for having_trouble_finding the shuttle .
positive	fyi .. i didn_'_t read the instructions on my ticket so it was totally my fault .
positive	when we arrived at ltp my car was running , window open to cool off the interior , trunk_open .

positive	not knowing what food my picky_eaters would like i decided t get the " trial " size , which is no " trial " by any means , they are 0lb bags offered at a very discounted_rate , ie $ 0 . 00 instead of $_00 . 00 for the ones that i got , plus there were several to choose from , so i got them all .
positive	now i know which food to get so i set_up the reoccurring delivery service , every 0_weeks for me , and never have to worry_about going all the way across_town again .
positive	my order came in 0 days of ordering , and i qualified for free_shipping .

positive	when i had a problem last_year with a purchase they sorted it out in double quick time including refunding the postage when i had to return the pen for some tlc !
positive	cult_pens is the only place to go when buying pens of any sort ( and now i '_ve seen they do rather lovely writing paper as well ....!)

positive	i ordered a piece of equipment for a canon camera on line , which i received within 00_hours on a standard postage charge .
positive	very impressive .
positive	you might think these are a bit_pricey for t towel , but these are in another league with weight , design and quality .

positive	placed an order last_week as i ' d received information about an offer ' curry00 ' ordered 0 curries , 0 rice , 0 dahl and it was only £_00 and came with 0 complimentary celia beers !
positive	order delivered promptly by courier , well_packed .
positive	thought i might treat it like a ' takeaway ' meal one evening as us coeliacs lose out on most takeaway food as the majority isn_'_t suitable .
positive	one evening we were both tired and didn_'_t feel_like cooking from scratch , so used the cardamom chicken and one rice pouch between 0 of us , though my husband ( non coeliac ) also had a jacket potato , but there was plenty in the chicken pouch and the flavours were delicious .
positive	haven_'_t eaten the other bits yet , but confident they will be just as good .
positive	haven_'_t drunk the beer as i '_ve been off drink for 0 years and can '_t decide yet whether to break my drink fast to try it .
positive	but my husband or son can drink it if not .
positive	very impressed with the packaging as ingredients so easy to read in list format - what a brilliant idea .
positive	i would say the pouch ' for 0 ' is extremely generous , but could always make it last 0 days or share with someone like i did .
positive	a great concept and i shall_certainly order again .
positive	we have ordered many_times from strings direct and always had very good service .
positive	this time was no different .
positive	the strings are for my son '_s guitars ( he has 0 of them !)

positive	ordered the strings and they arrived 0 days_later .
positive	an added_bonus was the little winder gadget which came with the strings .
positive	excellent strings , excellent service .

positive	if there is a fifth project , i '_ll go back again .
positive	the logo company is not only reasonably_priced , they provide great work and do it quickly .

positive	i was delighted with the process , and with the goods , selected from the detailed_description and video on the site .

positive	my husband and i have been traveling around the world for 0 year and we have been booking most of our hostels on hostelbookers . com .
positive	they have the best website , the best prices for hostels , and you can trust that the places you will be staying are good based on previous travelers ' reviews .
positive	i like that you can book online at any time of the day and get an instant reservation .
positive	there is no stress or waiting to hear back from the hostel to know if your reservation went through .
positive	when you are traveling for an extended period of time , you want things to go quickly and easily so you can enjoy your time traveling , not be checking your email 00 times a day to see if the hostels got back to you on reservations .
positive	the website has descriptions of facilities and photos of the hostels as well , so you know what to expect .
positive	i also like that hostelbookers does not charge a fee , as other_websites do .
positive	sometimes plans change .
positive	you can get sick or you miss a bus , or maybe even your bus doesn_'_t show up !
positive	i don_'_t want to lose out on a lot of money if these problems arise .
positive	most travelers who are staying in hostels are on a budget and can '_t aford to pay all these extra_fees .
positive	it '_s good to know that hostelbookers understands the needs of travelers .
positive	this went smooth .
positive	i '_ll let you know more after my check in .

positive	hi .
positive	they corrected the problem i ' d like my review to reflect that in all fairness .
positive	how do i do that ?
positive	paid me full price for my iphone 0 00gb when they were out of stock and couldn_'_t send me a replacement .
positive	we use this company all the time for battery '_s , they are so quick from ordering to delivery .
positive	all i can say is '' brilliant service ''.
positive	ordered on friday_afternoon and my chocolates arrived on tuesday_morning would of been the monday but it was a bank_holiday .
positive	i will_definitely be using this company again .
positive	exellent company , i buy a lot of miniature whisky '_s for my dad from here , and also unusual whisky '_s for my friends for christmas and also birthday '_s , delivery is really fast .
positive	if you want a present for someone that '_s different this is the place to buy from .
positive	i am always so pleased with the quick service and the great products !
positive	i was impressed by the quality of the knives and baking trays .
positive	i wanted decent knives that were heavy and could be kept sharp .
positive	i then ordered a lot of other items to replace worn out equipment including baking trays that food superglues itself to , chopping boards that are more cuts than board and utensils where the coating has long gone .
positive	i did buy more than i anticipated as they had a 0 for 0 on a huge_range of stuff .
positive	i now have a really useful mango cutter that i did not even know_existed !
positive	i have ordered loads of clothes from boohoo now .
positive	the website has no_glitches so is easy to use .
positive	there are many ranges of clothing that i can peruse individually .
positive	i like the geo range so i tend to look at that .
positive	however before i went to spain , i needed shorts , which i could easily search for across the ranges .
positive	my orders have been delivered quickly to my work address , as i not usually at home during the day .
positive	i have found that i have had to sent things back , as i have just chosen the things that suit me really well .
positive	sending things back is easy and free .
positive	they send you prepaid labels that you just stick on the parcel and take to any post_office .
positive	i have had lots of people at work commenting on how much they like my boohoo clothes , because they are unusual and flattering .
positive	what is amazing is that as the clothes are so good value , it means i can_afford to order regularly .
positive	prices for the meds i bought were have as much as my vet was charging me and i received the meds in the mail a lot quicker_than if i ordered them thru my vet .
positive	i was amazed_at how prompt my order arrived .
positive	i am very pleased and will reorder when the time comes
positive	great value , very help customer help
positive	i believe that it is unnecessary to write a review when i have given the company 0_stars .
positive	these reviews make me want to go to another company .
positive	i '_ve been doing a lot of client interviews at work - recording them and transcribing them myself to try to pull out any interesting quotes we can use in our marketing activities .
positive	it is such a painful process - pause , rewind , restart ... takes me hours for each 00 - 00 minute call .
positive	so i started looking online to see if there was anyway i could make that easier .
positive	rev is perfect .
positive	$ 0 / min is totally reasonable and compared to the time it was taking me , is actually more cost_effective .
positive	the service is easy to use in terms of being_able to upload audio / download files and track jobs .
positive	and their turnaround time is great - they say 00_hours but they '_ll deliver your job in batches if it makes_sense , so i was getting the transcriptions back much_faster .
positive	in the future i probably_won_'_t ask for " verbatim " again - seeing the number of " ums " and " you knows " in my sections was too painful ;) but i will be using these_guys regularly to handle this work for me !
positive	i ordered my kitchen_tap and it arrived in less_than a week .
positive	the first one was faulty , however after discussing it with a telephone helpline ( which was free - phone - great ) i got clear_directions on who to email and the information required .
positive	the email was dealt_with the next working day and a replacement was sent on next_day delivery .
positive	would highly_recommend .
positive	ordering my appliance was easy , the reviews of the products useful and website easy to use .
positive	i liked the fact that i could choose from multiple days my delivery and that you could choose further paid for options such as timed deliveries , recycling of old appliances and installation if required .
positive	the delivery team we ' re great , calling me that day to narrow_down the estimated delivery time .
positive	they we ' re very careful when bringing in the appliance and removing the old one and explained specific details relating to the item .
positive	all in all pretty_much all you need when making an important appliance purchase .
positive	everything i have ordered has_been exactly_what was pictured .
positive	the quality of the products are great !
positive	i had no problem returning an item that wasn_'_t quite right .
positive	i would tell anyone to shop_here !
positive	very impresses with the delivery of 0 dozen yellow_roses , beautiful with babys breath and the price was amazing .
positive	thank_you !
positive	i will be back :)
positive	when i reserved the storage the woman was very polite .
positive	after i reserved it she met me immediately after to unload my uhaul .
positive	when we met she was friendly again and very helpful .
positive	the unit was very clean and i loved that there were security cameras on site .
positive	i really like using goldstar for various event tickets .
positive	the only_complaint i have is that i '_m a member of the red_carpet and that is supposed to give me better seat choices .
positive	when i order tickets , there is no evidence that i have received " special attention " because i am a red_carpet member .
positive	i have a free year '_s subscription , but i can '_t even find notification of this on the website .
positive	so_far , i have had good seats and good experiences with goldstar , i just wish i knew what this " red_carpet " was all about !
positive	excellent service and resonable prices
positive	i ordered on the sunday and received my parcel on the wednesday .
positive	very pleased .
positive	we used envision to create a montage for our
positive	son '_s party .
positive	they went the extra_mile to make the montage truly perfect .

positive	trusted any company other than envision to create it .
positive	we highly_recommend them to our friends and family and plan on using them in the years to come !
positive	:)

positive	the delivery of goods was extremely quick .
positive	could not fault it and would recommend to other friends .

positive	last_year my primary care physician suggested that i try to find comfrey cream in hopes of healing a broken bone .
positive	i '_ve always been open to natural treatments as_opposed to an otc quick fix .
positive	i don_'_t know how , but i came_across pureformulas website .
positive	the first thing that attracted me was the free_shipping for any order .
positive	then i noticed that the price_ranges are suitable to even the most limited_budget .
positive	i as impressed to see that i didn_'_t have to do additional research because of the information provided for each item .
positive	a few_weeks_later i had another health issue and elected to continue on the natural path .

positive	i was so impressed with floraqueen .
positive	being in south_africa and wanting flowers delivered to a small_village in spain , i had no_idea who to approach as i knew it would be a difficult order to deliver .
positive	i found floraqueen on the internet and place my order on - line .
positive	floraqueen very quickly responded with confirmation that it would require a special delivery and therefore they would not be able to deliver within 00_hours .
positive	they offered a full_refund or an option to deliver the flowers a day later by special courier .
positive	i went for the latter and my friend was absolutely_thrilled with her flowers .

positive	hobbylinc is always my go to site for model rocket and engines .
positive	they have super_fast shipping and wonderful customer_service .
positive	they have a great selection and some of the best prices we can find !
positive	we have never had an_issue with them and never hesitate to place an order or to recommend them to people .
positive	this was an easy way to compare several storage_units in my area and locate one that fit my needs the best .
positive	i am very happy with the service and with the storage_facility it directed me to .
positive	well , i bought 0 maxi posters of bands like green day and the red hot chilli peppers and a photographic print of bellatrix lestrange and lucius malfoy from harry_potter and the deathly hallows part 0 .
positive	i chacked the site thoroughly to ensure it was legit and checked the security features as i am always hesitant about using credit_cards on new sites , but everything seemed genuine , so i used the 00_% dicsount code which i thought was fantastic as i '_m always looking for a bargain .
positive	shortly_after_placing my order i recived a confirmation e_- mail with the list of my orders and the prices etc .
positive	i placed my order on thursday ( i think ), and the first item arrived on the monday - the harry_potter print .
positive	it came in an envelope with big red letters saying do not bend , which i thought was cool as even_though it '_s not their responsibility they still took_care of my product .
positive	inside the envelope was the print in a plastic wrap to protect it and a piece of paper with another list of my order .
positive	but this was the only product to arrive - so i started to panic .
positive	since it had the list of my order i thought that everything would be arriving at once and as it hadn_'_t i thought they had been lost in the post or the order had been misplaced .
positive	so i slept on it and the next_day the other 0 arrived .
positive	they were rolled up together in one tube and were suprisingly heavy - exceptionally good quality .
positive	i hung them all up and they ' re perfect , my typical teenager '_s bedroom is complete .
positive	my only dissapointment with the site is the delivery charges .
positive	i want to get 0 more harry_potter photgraphic prints which are quite expensive at £ 0 . 00 each for their size , and finding out i have to pay delivery for each one seems a bit of a joke .
positive	why can '_t they be put in one envelope ?
positive	they ' re small enough .
positive	this aside i wouldn_'_t hesitate to use gbposters . com again .
positive	one mroe thing .
positive	on the paper i recieved with the photographic print there was a code for another 00_%_discount , which can be used with any offers on the site - fantastic !
positive	a bit hard to find with the gps , but very convenient , especially the drop_off of the car after you arrived , so no shuttle back to parking_lot needed !
positive	!
positive	easy to order , with fast efficient service , my order was delivered the next_day .
positive	terrific experience with ease in ordering , excellent customer_service on phone and really strong packaging for safe shipping to protect bottles .
positive	also received shipment days earlier_than promised .

positive	the pen was dispatched the same day and arrived with plenty of time to spare .
positive	i live in de and ordered my flowers from kalas because it
positive	seemed to be the best florist i could locate on the internet
positive	from annapolis .
