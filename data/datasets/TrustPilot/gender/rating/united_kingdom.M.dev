negative	the protein and customer service both left a sour_taste in my mouth .
negative	slow delivery , poor quality products , rude customer service .
negative	would rather eat wasps than use this company again .
negative	i ordered some flowers for a funeral , not only did they not arrive , eflorist decided to let_me know in the afternoon of the day they were meant to .
negative	very upset .
negative	i have purchased a product , via amazon , and the supplier uses_yodel to deliver to their customers .
negative	i received notification , and tracked same , yesterday 00 / 00 / 00 that it would be delivered on same day .
negative	it did not happen .
negative	tracking it today and the data has_been removed from the tracking yodel data_base so i have no idea when to expect it .
negative	i have used the amazon contact procedure , the suppliers contact procedure and obviously yodel also .
negative	no response received from any one although after a number of years of use i have never had this problem before with amazon .
negative	i had never_heard of yodel before yesterday and i am not surprised .
negative	no company i do_business with would consider_using them .
negative	rip_off !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	even with an amazon local voucher which gave_me a a £_00 discount , lenson turned_out to be far more_expensive than any other online_retailer
negative	the normal_retail price was twice as much as at contactlenses . co . uk , the online shop i normally go to and will keep going to , lenson , never again .
negative	be really careful when something go '_s wrong as avenue 00 ,
negative	i was sent a very rude email refusing to refund shoes purchased from there store .
negative	it would seem i am not the only customer complaining of returned shoes .
negative	the incorrect pair of shoes was sent to myself and when i questioned my refund i was advised the item was not received at the warehouse .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	i then questioned the return tracking_number , the shoes were suddenly found !
negative	however moments_later i then received a very rude email refusing to refund the shoes .
negative	avenue 00 state they are 000_% confident the shoes were not sent from there warehouse even_though the box had an avenue 00 sticker on the front of the box , avenue 00 then refused to send an image of the box , question is why ?
negative	it '_s a very poor show from a high end store , every email / telephone_call is contradiction and i am unsure at this moment of how i will recover the £_000 spent at this store .
negative	internet is shait keeps going off it takes them 0 f_** king weeks to send an engineer over avoid this rubbish company also the phone does work bad work no one should use this company
negative	there seems to be no other way of registering a complaint about this company so i '_ll put it here on this site .
negative	a delivery card pops through the door ; my wife picks it up , it says that nobody is home , despite both of us being home .
negative	it says our package has_been delivered to our neighbour below ( we ' re in flats ).
negative	my wife goes out to ask what is going on and the guy , without stopping as he leaves the building , calls out to her , ' read the card , love '.
negative	wtf ?
negative	this is the rudest , most ridiculous service i '_ve ever had .
negative	i '_m glad it wasn_'_t me that went out to ask the guy ...
negative	anyway , if you can avoid these muppets , avoid them .
negative	it was not until i emailed you that i was aware of parcelforce '_s cack - up , a cack - up still not rectified .
negative	you kindly gave_me the tracking_number of the package ; i checked on parcelforce '_s site ; it said they tried to deliver seven_days previously and ' advised ' us to pick_up at a depot .
negative	my wife was at home that whole day : there was no attempt to deliver , and there was no delivery card posted .
negative	and they haven_'_t responded to three queries from me .
negative	i '_m pretty pissed_off .
negative	why should i have to chase this ?
negative	why can '_t i have been informed ?
negative	by somebody ?
negative	this is supposed to be my son '_s christmas_present .
negative	the refund policy is ridiculous and borders on criminal they probably make more money from a cancellation than they do through car_hire .
negative	perfect example of a company that will do as little as possible and then hide_behind there terms and conditions .
negative	make_sure you check every part of your booking and all of the small_print especially there refund policies ( or lack_thereof ).
negative	i would never use virgin again .
negative	when i finished with them due to rising prices i was sent a final_bill which i paid , then i was sent a second one .
negative	i sent them a cheque .
negative	after a week or so i had another request for a final payment .
negative	as i had sent a cheque i ignored it .
negative	my cheque had been cashed .
negative	i then received nasty threatening_letters .
negative	i sent another letter stating i had paid .
negative	after over 0 letters from them i was threatened with the bailiff , then received very nasty threatening_letters from a debt collecting service .
negative	i wished now i had taken the matter to court .
negative	.
negative	i rang them , told them they had cashed my cheques and gave them the cheque number .
negative	they then asked for my bank_statement as they couldnt find my payment even_though my bank confirmed they had cashed my cheque shortly_after i paid them .
negative	this company caused me and my wife much stress and threatened us on numerous_occasions due to their poor customer_services .
negative	i would never go back to virgin and advise others to be very wary of this poorly run company .
negative	as my goods have not turned_up not very happy i '_m afraid !
negative	i am totally appalled that i phoned twice today and was hung_up on twice after i was told that i had signed to return a package which was not possible - when the customer_support person also accepted that dpd had a record of redlivery details on the system and online but simply did not follow it - no appology i was accused of signing to return the item .
negative	i was also shocked when questioned about the signature .
negative	i work from before 0 untill late every night and to be accused of having signed for something when no - one was at my home and i have evidence of this was shocking , bad service and rude customer_care - i have told 0 that unless they change courier i will not order with them again .
negative	my ref was 00000000 - return tracking was 0000000000 .
negative	this is probably the worst experience i have ever had when trying to book a holiday .
negative	first of all their website doesn_'_t work properly .
negative	when trying to book online , i went to submit the payment and it was just loading and loading but not going through .
negative	i tried on several different computers and got the same issue .
negative	i tried to ring customer service but the line was dead .
negative	i emailed them but they never got back to me .
negative	then just as i was about to pay for a holiday with another airline , a confirmation_email came through followed_by several emails saying my item is still in the basket !!
negative	!
negative	i have since flown and come_back only to see that i '_ve been charged an additional £_00 .
negative	but rather_than try to help me , they have given me a list of possible reasons_why this may be ( purchase extras and exchange_rate differences ) and asked me to refer to terms and conditions .
negative	so now i have to explain to them that any extras i purchased were debited outside of this and the exchange_rate has barely moved .
negative	sometimes i think it would just be easier to bang my head against the wall !
negative	bought wrist straps and in less then a month the stitching on the velcro is coming_undone .
negative	i reckon i will get another months use before they are for the bin .
negative	when you purchase the grand_total excludes any postage_charges .
negative	i feel that the grand_total should include postage as do the vast_majority of other_sites .
negative	i have used this site twice , and both_times i had to chase up my order .
negative	i was notified 00 days ago that my 0 x boxes of tablets , ( that can be posted through the letter_box ) had been despatched yet i am still_waiting for them to arrive .
negative	they will be passed there use by date at this rate .
negative	won_'_t be using this site again .
negative	neil .
negative	still_waiting for my goods after 0_weeks .
negative	i have left messages on their answerphone and emailed them but no replies received .
negative	when i eventually_managed to talk to someone on the phone they were very pleasant and plausible - " goods not in stock in the warehouse but you will get them within a few_days !!"
negative	then a week_later " parcel was sent by first_class post so you should have received it we will investigate and call you back " - they didn_'_t .
negative	when i called them they said they had issued another invoice and the goods would be with me within a few_days .
negative	taht was almost a week_ago and i still_haven_'_t received them .
negative	this was my first shopping_experience with this company and will be tha last .
negative	i buy a lot of goods over the internet and i can say that this is by far the worst experience i have ever had .
negative	had nice flowers for mothers_day but the ones i bought for girlfriend where poor quality , a few dead leaves and a rose had fell_off when i opened the box
negative	hermes lost an expensive item being delivered to me in transit .
negative	failed to collect an item i was sending .
negative	item was subsequently collected after i complained three_days_later than advised .
negative	it makes you wonder_whether they are the type of company featured on the recent tv documentary .
negative	it '_s very true that you get what you pay for .
negative	will use parcelforce in future .
negative	did not receive order ,,,,
negative	after doing all the usual shenanigans to understand their web - site and after their system taking money from my credit_card , they phone up to say " sorry the tyre are out of stock " - meanwhile , i have arranged to have time off to drive to their nominated fitter .
negative	why can they not check that they have the goods before they sell them ?
negative	and if that is not possible , they should not take the money until they have checked !!
negative	!
negative	placed an order on trekkinn , which was displayed as in stock .
negative	few_days after the had charged the money on my credit_card .
negative	i expected the order to arrive , but i did ' nt hear_anything .
negative	i contacted trekkinn only to find out that they couldn_'_t get my order form there supplier and didn_'_t know when to get it ...
negative	what ???
negative	but they charged my credit_card 00 days before .
negative	to my knowledge this is not legal in eu .
negative	it seems as it '_s very easy to have an internet shop these days .
negative	just apply a lot of stuff on your shop , and hope that your supplier can deliver it .
negative	the right way to do it , is to write if the items isn_'_t in stock , and tell when or if you can get it .. and newer charge the money before the items has_been sent !!
negative	!
negative	having ordered this item tuesday for a fancy_dress party saturday the item never turned_up .
negative	i then had to go out and buy another costume .
negative	when or if the costume does turn_up i will not be needing it now .
negative	i did email asking would this item be here for saturday before ordering it and was told it would be .
negative	i would not buy anything again or recommend people to buy anything due to this poor service .
negative	the weather cannot be blamed as the post has still been delivered these last few_days .
negative	i am appalled that when i made a compliant it is not acted_upon , self righteous staff
negative	ordered a speaker turned_up broke , sent another that was broke , they have kept the speaker and will not refund accusing me of swapping out with broken speaker , very unprofessional and abusive avoid at all costs .
negative	paid in full for valentines flowers and on the day they decide to change the delivery date !!!!!
negative	they are ignoring calls and emails ( 0 days now ) but have put a very small apology on the website .... ha !
negative	its too late valentines has_been and gone so the flowers are useless and the day has_been ruined !
negative	if you cant handle the orders dont take peoples money !
negative	p . s .
negative	hurry up and give me my money back !
negative	if i lived_closer id be down there collecting it in person !
negative	stay_away !
negative	used parentpay a few_times , slow processing was one thing but having a letter arrive home in your 0 year_old '_s bag that had your log - in details on is another .
negative	comforting to know that the school office and any of the kids they use as runners can now access my account .
negative	my advice - not with a barge_pole !
negative	ordered a climbing_frame , was supposed to be delivered 00 / 00 , saw it was out for delivery between 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 , teaching strikes were on so kids at home and all excited_about helping to build it .
negative	waited_until 00 : 00 no delivery so i phoned the nottingham branch that it was due to come from , to be told , as it was 000kg they could not fit it on the vehicle and they are struggling for drivers , are they trying to fit it on a van ??
negative	...
negative	unacceptable , today is my kids birthday and i have tried to phone the depot again to see if it '_s on their vehicle , but at 00 : 00 i get the response " our opening_hours are from 00 : 00 "
negative	consignment_number zfbrfu000000
negative	my story , i ordered a new ( ex_display ) sony_tv for over £_0k back at the beginning of may for delivery on the friday .
negative	due to just moving_house there was a issue with the card , which i quickly sorted .
negative	after completing the payment everything_went down_hill , i first received a emessage ( their msging system ) saying we are sorry , but due to unforeseen_circumstances your goods have not been despatched for delivery .
negative	please continue to monitor your emails for tracking_details .
negative	on the friday i asked when it was being delivered and was given a company to ring and consignment_number , the company that i was given was closed for the weekend at this time , so i had to wait_until monday to ring , which i did , the company had no record or knowledge of this consignment , i had also checked on the friday and was told it was being picked_up that day , so why was there no record ??
negative	due to it being so late , i cancelled the order , knowing full well it hadn_'_t even been dispatched , this took another week to get a reply , i was told it was with the technical engineers and that they would phone me the next_day , my reply to this was of wonder ," why is it there ?
negative	i have cancelled it before its been dispatched !"
negative	funnily_enough no reply until today , where they have now sent me and email with the refund details on it , stating 0 - 0 days to receive these into my account , and taking off nearly_£_000 less_than the original purchase price , i have already replied with the fact that this is illegal and have now left in the hands of my credit_card company to get the full_amount back .
negative	i have kept all documentation and copied all the emessages that have been sent to me , for legal use at a later date if need be .
negative	my advice is if your making a large purchase , don_'_t do it from here .
negative	i wouldn_'_t trust anything these_guys say , i also doubt some of the other comments on here that are just being used to boost the scores up .
negative	sales order 00000000
negative	returns associated with invoice #_00000000 rma_number :_00000000 accepted
negative	the item was delivered on time and in good order , the price was right and i was very pleased .
negative	years_ago i recomended myprotein to a lot of friends and people in the gym .
negative	prices were more than reasonable , products were good quality and despatch / delivery was quick .
negative	after a little break of dealing_with myprotein i decided to give them another shot .
negative	all address details were given but once despatch email came through important details of the address were missed off .
negative	as i expected no goods turned_up .
negative	tried to speak to myyodel which i will never deal with again .
negative	i was told that they were signed for by someone i ' d never_heard of .
negative	then after a while they told me they wouldn_'_t help me any more and that i need to contact myprotein .
negative	it took 0 messages to get a response from myprotein .
negative	even after this response it was just to tell me the same information of problems that i had reported .
negative	even a second response days_later sounds_like the customer service could not be_bothered to read the problem details correctly !
negative	feels_like the company has got too big and forgotten the basics .
negative	really not happy with the service i '_ve received .
negative	the only part that '_s gone_smoothly so_far is taking the money from me !
negative	will never deal with the company again .
negative	unfortunately can '_t even see the matter being solved any time soon .
negative	takes too long to get the money
negative	what looks_like a simple way to get a divorce quickly becomes very expensive with divorce - online .
negative	the basic price only covers the company filling in the divorce petition form for you .
negative	it '_s then up to you to submit it to the court with the appropriate fee .
negative	if you want divorce - online to handle the whole divorce for you , it gets very expensive .
negative	having forked out for the petition to be filled in , i ran_out of money and was unable to pay divorce - online to manage the rest of the process .
negative	the forms that i ' d paid for were useless as they showed divorce - online as my legal representative .
negative	result ?
negative	£_000 flushed down the toilet .
negative	divorce - online wanted over £_000 plus the £_000 court fee just to get me to the decree nisi stage .
negative	in the end i submitted my own divorce petition to the court , using online help notes and a bit of " trial and error " training .
negative	i have attempted on seven occasions to trade books with this company .
negative	as i have typed in isbn numbers they offer 00p as a rule .
negative	if they offer more try to check price with amazon or e_bay on one occasion a book they offered £_000 for was worth £_000 .
negative	i sold it on e_bay for £_00 .
negative	for six of the seven trades they said they would arrange transport from my home due to the tare level .
negative	they did not turn_up .
negative	i contacted and they rearranged .
negative	they did not turn_up .
negative	my plead to you is !!!
negative	it is not i repeat not worth the effort of putting the books on for trade and be let_down .
negative	type in your isbn by all means .
negative	if they offer 00p give the book to charity shops .
negative	any more ?
negative	put on amazon or e_bay after that they will let you down .
negative	especially as when you send the books or other items they will devalue them and you will not get a full value for your trade .
negative	my ' next_day delivery ' order still has not arrived ( 0 week_later ).
negative	there is no tracking_system available to use which makes this even worse .
negative	seriously inconvenient .
negative	ordered an extra large kennel on the sunday .
negative	kennel delivered on the tuesday .
negative	all good until the moment of delivery .
negative	box states extra large , but the sizes are not as_described on website , a difference of 0 inches in height is something that cannot be ignored .
negative	our french mastiff could not fit in it .
negative	i called the ( extremely loosely termed ) business to express my dis_- satisfaction and annoyance of the inconvenience of this wrongly advertised product .
negative	aparantly , ( cough_cough ), i am the first customer to of noticed this issue , they assure me it '_s an error on the part of their supplier and it will be sorted .
negative	to date the website has not been changed so i am awaiting a call back from trading_standards on that matter , purely due to the way i have been treated by this farce of a company .
negative	anyway , back to the madness ,.... 00 days_later and 0 phone_calls too , i am still looking at this box , waiting for it to be collected .
negative	my phone_calls now being ignored , all of them , even when messages have been left on their answer phone , i have never received a call back .
negative	i then used a different phone and the call was answered .
negative	pitiful worthless excuses were given in abundance and the goal post of blame being shifted to someone_else '_s pitch .
negative	on day 00 i left a message threatening_legal_action from my payment company who are beginning proceedings to claim my refund , that to date i am still_waiting for .
negative	on day 00 the kennel was finally collected .
negative	i was assured initially that once the kennel was collected i would be reimbursed .
negative	that too hasn_'_t happened .
negative	the kennel was collected 00 days ago and i still have not received my refund .
negative	i am soooooooo angry and frustrated with this entire situation and that it is still not resolved .
negative	i tried myself this morning to ring this place twice this morning , funnily_enough no answer .
negative	i then asked my husband to call them as i can no_longer trust myself verbally as i feel they have taken enough liberties with me .
negative	well ,.... my husband has just called from his mobile and strangely_enough the call has_been answered !!!!!!!!
negative	this is the response ,.....
negative	i '_ve been off all week , my husband then advised her the call was being taped , apparently the boss does the refunds , he is not there .
negative	won_'_t be back until late .
negative	here '_s hoping the refund gets done tomorrow but certainly won_'_t be holding my breath .
negative	disgusting behaviour .
negative	with the current_climate every_penny is important , especially when it '_s over £_000 . 00 .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	i am writing this review and at the same time i am talking to orange customer service .
negative	i have never ever been let_down so badly .
negative	on thursday i thought i will give orange a try .
negative	gone to argos got myself a payg_sim done a £_00 . 00 top up and called orange to transfer my number .
negative	0gb free data seemed like a good thing .
negative	so i called and registered my new number and done everything they asked to do .
negative	was promised that my number will be ported over on friday before midnight .
negative	i was told to keep turning my phone on and off during the day and eventually the number will be transferred .
negative	come today morning nothing happened .
negative	still no porting .
negative	so i called orange ( 00p_each call to customer service !
negative	) and asked what is going on .
negative	long_story_short the person i spoke to told me i was given a bulk pac_code ( no such a thing !!!
negative	) and it will be done on tuesday .
negative	i did complaint and said it is not good enough and why has this not been done .
negative	the person i was speaking to started being rude and was talking over me , i asked her not to do it and asked to be put to a supervisor .
negative	the reply was “ i can talk over you and customer is not always right ”!
negative	i demanded to speak to her supervisor and she than told me that there is no supervisors working today !!! impossible !
negative	she than cut me off .
negative	what a s !!!!
negative	service , i called back and after trying to explain everything again another customer service person has cut me off .
negative	0rd call now and i am speaking to a supervisor .
negative	actually he has just put me on hold and i have been holding for 00_minutes .
negative	i told_him that i want to make an official_complaint about him and his service and that i am not happy , i want to stop the porting .
negative	he has put me on hold and i know he is just waiting for me to disconnect the call .
negative	well i am on my way to orange shop now and let ’_s get this sorted there .
negative	never use orange never !
negative	i will tell all my friend not to trust them even if the give you free calls for life .
negative	what a disappointment .
negative	even the supervisors don_’_t care .
negative	!!!
negative	! oh well they just cut me of !!!
negative	!
negative	i have sent them my blackberry phones , i had them refurbished recently and they look like new .
negative	i wanted to try these_guys as the price was the highest .
negative	i paid for special delivery to send these phones to them as wasnt too sure on them and wanted to make_sure them get them quickly .
negative	they tried to stich me up by reducing the price for each phone to nearly 0rd of the value .
negative	after trying to get them to offer the original price and sending loads of emails i in the end askled for the phones to be sent back .
negative	0_weeks_later i finally got them back and the protective screen covers i had on them have been removed by this company .
negative	dont use them if you can help it .
negative	bye
negative	i don_’_t believe delivery should have to paid for on items ordered online , so i was really please when i find that preciouslittleones provide free delivery on order over £_00 .
negative	my order was over £_00 , but when i phoned them the following_day explaining i had under order they wanted me to pay a delivery charge .
negative	really very disappoint , won_’_t be using them again , bit of a shame , i have twin boys aged 0 months and need loads of baby items .
negative	lucky kiddecare and twins - store are more helpful to first time customers .
negative	poor show preciouslittleones
negative	ordered an ssd on 00th_feb . and despite the website offering a 0 day delivery i was given a 0 - 0 day delivery with no reason .
negative	my credit_card was debited on placing the order , not on despatch as some better companies do .
negative	well the 0 day delivery came and went with no goods received .
negative	my order online had changed to " stocking issues "... whatever that means .
negative	no emails or any updates sent to me .
negative	finally on 0th mar i called to find out status , to be told that item was now in stock , but it was over £_00 more_expensive than the price i had ordered at !
negative	!
negative	order was immediately cancelled , but then i was told it would take up to 00 days for my credit_card to be refunded .
negative	what a sorry_saga of total_incompetence .
negative	i will never use wae_+ again and will be happy to pay a couple of pounds extra to get my goods from someone reliable and customer_orientated like amazon .
negative	having had a bad_experience with another online company pretending to be a uk organisation , i re - ordered a camera through valuebasket . com , again not realising they are based overseas and pretend to be a uk company with phone numbers etc .
negative	they claim their phone system is not working , their customer ' service ' agents do not read emails properly and i cannot seem to get a refund .
negative	now the status of my order has_been changed to order held and i have had to send yet another email via their website simply asking for my money back .
negative	it appears they are very poor at refunding your money , although they seem to be able to extract it from your account quickly enough .
negative	foreign companies pretending to be british based are ruining the internet_shopping_experience .
negative	valuebasket , com have my money , will not agree to a refund and have put my order on hold , so i am apparently not going to get my camera or my money back .
negative	i will have to go sheepishly to my bank to get a refund of the money , twice , and surprisingly taken by the same payment organisation company skrill limited each time .
negative	what a coincidence ..
negative	i hold out little hope of receiving my money back from these_people , they are too evasive and slippery .
negative	all i can say is avoid them like the plague if you value your hard_earned_cash .
negative	i will happily update this review if i get a refund within a week , but i think hell is more likely to freeze over first .
negative	00th_october .... despite the promise below , no change in my account balance and no - one bothered to get in touch with me .
negative	so it is starting to appear that they are even worse than i thought .
negative	i tried to buy a camera for my wife .
negative	the website appeared to be a uk company and the price was good , so i ordered the camera .
negative	it turns_out they are based in hong_kong , masquerading as a uk company .
negative	my wife '_s birthday came and went , but the camera never arrived .
negative	after several phone_calls where they tried to claim that my camera somehow got damaged , and they couldn_'_t say when it would be delivered , i asked for my money back .
negative	they told me this would take 00 - 00 working_days .
negative	this has come and gone , and when i spoke to the agent on the phone , they said they were having trouble processing refunds , and couldn_'_t say when it would be , although it was now ' expedited ' which is meaningless .
negative	they process the payment through a company called skrill ltd , which are also used by valuebasket . com ( yes , when i cancelled my order i ordered another camera ) who are as difficult to deal with , saying they have a backlog and won_'_t give a delivery date either , although claim to have 00 camera '_s in stock .
negative	they are not acknowledging my request for a cancellation at all .
negative	i think the two companies are related , or one and the same .
negative	they definitely appear on your credit_card statement as the same payment company , and both masquerade as a uk company with uk phone numbers .
negative	i now need to explain this whole sorry story to my credit_card company totry and get the money refunded by them , but my advice to any potential_clients of either company is totally avoid like the plague .
negative	they are either internet fraudsters or just totally inept .
negative	either way , simply_electronics ltd have made my blood boil , and still have my money .,
negative	00rd_october update .
negative	following the comment below , simply_electronics have now refunded my money , thank_you .
negative	mothers_day flowers .
negative	a sad affair .
negative	the flowers my mother recieved was a disgrace for the money i paid .... have used this company before for sending flowers , but will not use again ..... was proper mugged this time .. never again ...
negative	the mark - up on the face value of the ticket is ridiculous and the booking_fee is beyond a joke
negative	didn_'_t greet me as he was on his phone .
negative	no please , thank_you or even here you go , sorry i '_m busy .
negative	needs staff training asap !
negative	disappointed .
negative	this site has never ever answered a question correctly and i really do wonder what it '_s purpose is .
negative	i got a month web i should be able to stream and download , on the first day i couldnt even watch youtube or dowload , second day i rang up they said they will refresh my account didnt work , they did this the next_day also , now on the fourth day i got a text saying my fair use policy has_been excided after not even streaming or down loading .... worst network out there , absoulate bull s ***.
negative	this isnt the first time its happend
negative	this is a terrible company ordered patio base never got it they never once emailed or phoned .
negative	only communication i got was from paypal telling there was a refund no explanation nothing will not buy from these again .
negative	i ordered a 00 stem bunch of tulips to be delivered on mothers_day ( sunday 0rd_april ) - however the flowers arrived a day early and were something completely_different to what i ordered .
negative	not good enough .............
negative	as for response , aberdeenshire is not , and never has_been , in the highlands ( trust me i live in the highlands and know the difference )
negative	i am a very regular_visitor of cash_converters in salford but today i feel_cheated .
negative	i have spent of £ 0000 in the store as they are pretty_much my fist stop for games electronics ect always offering great prices .
negative	i have always found the staff friendly but today was a new experience i saw a macbook_pro on their website which i was interested in and not living local drove 00 miles to take a look .
negative	when i got there the man on the back desk was extremely unhelpful and disinterested i asked to take a look at the laptop he got it out and then processed a buy back leaving me stood there for around 00_minutes .
negative	the laptop was on sale for £_000 . 00 i checked the price on the web and found it on sale brand_new for 000 . 00 on amazon .
negative	i asked if he could match the price or beat it as in previous visit the staff have been happy to give me a little discount considering the amount i spend .
negative	i was told in no uncertain_terms this is the price and made to feel very unwelcome .
negative	i left the store somewhat_disappointed .
negative	when i arrived home i checked the internet still after a macbook and found the price of the same laptop in the same store had been lowered 0 hours after my visit by £_000 !
negative	to £_000 . 00 .
negative	i was absolutely fuming and feel_cheated .
negative	i will not be spending another penny in this cash_converters store they have no concept of customer loyalty .
negative	this is another review about the poor service at the pekham store
negative	on the 00 / 00 / 00 i purchased a htc one phone from the peckham_store .
negative	the phone arrived as_described and was working fine for about a month before it came up showing no network .
negative	i took it to a phone shop who said it had been blocked by the network we tested it with several sim_cards to confirm this .
negative	on the 00th of jan_0000 i emailed the store to tell the of the fault but got no reply .
negative	i emailed another 0 times on the 00 / 00 / 00 00 / 0 / 00 and the 00 / 0 / 00 all went_unanswered .
negative	i rang the store twice and on my second_attempt managed to get hold of the manager who arranged a return on the 00th_feb via uk mail .
negative	the phone was collected but i have yet to receive any refund or replacement .
negative	i have emailed the store a further 0 times on the 0th_march where i was told they would find a replacement non came and no further contact and again today .
negative	i am at my whits end trying to get a refund and if i don_'_t get one in the next 00_hours will be using the small_claims court to recover the money .
negative	i do not feel i have been unreasonable and allowing 0_weeks for a refund after trying to return the phone for 0 months is far to long .
negative	the service i have received is non_existant and bordering on illegal in relation to the sales of goods_act .
negative	have emailed their head_office and hope they get back to me .
negative	do not use this company .
negative	we are virgin_media customers that are looking to move home in 0 months time .
negative	when advising virgin_media of this they told us that they could only provide slow broadband and telephone line to the area and not television services .
negative	the only thing that i could do was to pay the £_00 a month fee for poor broadband and get tv through a 0rd_party provider that cannot provide the full virgin_media tv service .
negative	i was given 0 options , pay a £_000 early disconnection charge or pay £_00 a month for a poor service .
negative	as mentioned , i was happy to stick to virgin_media for the duration , but they could not provide the same service .
negative	they have it written up in their ridiculous contracts that you do not have a choice so beware what you are signing into .
negative	i took the £_000 disconnection charge as quite_frankly , the service is not that good .
negative	we had issues with our phone line that took several weeks to sort and we were also advised by a virgin_media member of staff to purchase a new telephone as it was our problem .
negative	it turned_out there was a problem with the phone line that the experts at virgin_media did not pick_up .
negative	with regards to the tv , the pause , rewind and fast forward facility is no way nearly as good as what sky_+ offers , it '_s slow and the screen often blurs .
negative	we have used sky and virgin and from my experiences with both , i would highly_recommend sky over virgin_media any day of the week .
negative	the only reason that we did not use sky this time around was that we are in an apartment that we were not allowed by the building owners to put a dish on it .
negative	i requested next_day delivery .
negative	and it did not come .
negative	so i gave it an extra day before contacting them .
negative	when i did they said they for some reason did not contact me as it was out of stock !!
negative	i was asked if i wanted an_alternative which i chose .
negative	but it was now friday .
negative	and as it was there mess up i asked if it could be delivered on the saturday ( next_day ) which i previously had chosen on the tuesday !!
negative	they said no as they would lose to much money !!
negative	so i asked for a refund instead which i am still_waiting to receive .
negative	but i will not be using them again in the future !
negative	sofa should be delivered 00 july , phone_call from very rude staff_member on the 00 july to say container with my sofa on never arrived and they don_'_t know when it will be arriving , this also applied to many other dissatisfied_customers .
negative	booking the day off work and i am sure if you thought your sofa was being delivered the following_day you most certainly would not have your old one meaning people are left to sit on the floor .
negative	i am certain that sofa works would have been informed well before the day before delivery that it was not arriving on time .
negative	containers take days to arrive so surely they would have known well in advance but failed to inform their customers .
negative	i have heard from neighbours and a family_members the same situation happened with them with sofa works and they have had to wait several weeks after arranged delivery date for their sofa to arrive .
negative	i will be asking them to review their experience on this site so more people can be made aware before purchasing from this company .
negative	i have always purchased from dfs never had an issue and customer service excellent unlike this company .
negative	i hope now that the ceo jason . tyldesley @ csl - furniture . co . uk does the decent thing and returns my deposit as requested and have a word with your suppliers they are giving you a bad_reputation !!!
negative	more details of the response from jason to follow .
negative	i have been trying to warn_people on review centre about a company called north_west design and build ltd lowton .
negative	i don_'_t want people falling prey to these cowboy builders but review centre won_'_t add my negative_review they have set_up the company name on their site when i tried to review it as i was the first so i can only_assume they are waiting for the positive_reviews and not interested in the negative_reviews .
negative	surely is to do with money and they are waiting to advertise good reviews for this company , even_though this company was named a different name months previous on review centre with terrible reviews .
negative	this won_'_t prevent genuine customers being_ripped_off by cowboy builders .
negative	shame on you review centre !!!

negative	i entered an incorrect gas_meter_reading ( my fault ) upon submitting my first readings .
negative	this came to light when i got a £_000 bill for gas in for one month .
negative	after four telephone_calls , the ( first of which i was extremely apologetic for my error ) and two emails when i have repeatedly given the corrected readings , instead of sorting this problem they have written to me saying they are going to quadruple my monthly direct_debit to ' bring my account back on track ' as my dd is not covering my usage .
negative	this was one day after they had replied to an email_saying they were going to sort it once and for all .
negative	i was going to let them take this ludicrous dd , just so i could issue a winding up petition against them for the satisfaction of repaying them for the stress they have caused me plus interest .
negative	however , i talked myself out of it and just cancelled the direct_debit and made my normal payment by card .
negative	two_days_later they wrote to me stating they know i '_ve cancelled my direct_debit and stating i now have to pay the full_amount of the £_000 +.
negative	i am now going to clear my desk of all my other cases and give these_clowns the full force of my legal expertise .
negative	clearly they '_ve grown too quickly too soon and can '_t handle the growth , i know they can '_t be this bad on purpose .
negative	however , i am not going to stop now until i have ground this company into the ashphalt .
negative	switch to someone_else while you can folks , because there won_'_t be a first_utility left by the time i '_ve finished with them .
negative	needless to say this matter is also now with the ombudsman .
negative	obviously think i have time on my hands to run around after them
negative	this is a pathetic_excuse for a deliver company !
negative	the most_recent ' attempt ' states that the driver could not gain primary access to my property .
negative	that being the front_door to my flat that you can walk up to from the street with no gates security barriers or anything .
negative	yodel have allegedly tried to deliver two different things to my house .
negative	each time they have not left a card and i have only found out that the parcel is at their depot through chasing the sender .
negative	truly pathetic .
negative	as they only deliver 0 - 0 monday to friday , when i am at work , i now have to go to enfield to the depot and collect it .
negative	i could have gone to the sender and collected it instead of using these jokers and it would have cost me less_than using this lot .
negative	incorrect billing from october still not resolved , because it '_s impossible to get through to the call_centre !..
negative	emails just seem to go into a black_hole and get ignored ..
negative	they ' re only interested in sending final demands , whether correct or not !
negative	the call_centre must be woefully under - manned , and i don_'_t think this is a temporary blip , but here to stay .
negative	the poorest customer service i '_ve had in 00 years as customer of goods & services !
negative	couldn_'_t fault the time it took to receive the flowers , 00_minutes .
negative	however , considering the display cost £_00 . 00 ( plus 0 . 00 delivery ) i was most disappointed with it .
negative	i estimate that there was approximately_£ 0 . 00 worth of flowers !
negative	i told my wife the cost and she said immediately that i should complain , and added , its the thought that counts ........
negative	need i say any more ?
negative	i will say that i '_ll not be ordering any other flowers this was again and i certainly wouldn_'_t recommend it to anyone .

negative	this company are in partnership with vodafone , as vodafone buy back .
negative	i sent them an iphone_0s on a thursday via special delivery , which was signed for on the friday_morning .
negative	on sunday i receive an email_saying they had not received my phone and the offer had expired .
negative	i contacted them by phone and was told that this was an error and not to worry .
negative	later that day i received an email_saying that they would only pay £_00 a fraction of the £_000 quote .
negative	when i enquired as to why , i was told it was locked to icloud .
negative	i then explained this was not the case and their operative immediately offered me £_00 as there was excessive_wear and tear .
negative	i requested the phone was returned .
negative	i then sent the phone to mazuma , who paid the full quote of £_000 straight into my bank_account within a few hours of receiving the phone - it was in mint_condition and not locked to icloud .
negative	i would urge_anyone to avoid this company !
negative	read the other reviews and be warned !!!!
negative	!
negative	worst customer service and signal ever !
negative	dealing_with company has_been extremely frustrating .
negative	staff are polite , but once the order is in , they make almost no effort to get the items to you in a way that suits you .
negative	bizarrely long_waits for the courier ( who have no phone number , web_site or contact address ) to bother to call you to inform you when , in the next few_months , they might do their job to try to deliver the goods .
negative	if you are away or on holiday , then expect a few more weeks wait .
negative	if you try to cancel out of sheer frustration , they ( illegally ) try to keep deposit to cover delivery that has not even occurred .
negative	avoid
negative	ordered mule rucksack on christmas day .
negative	paid next_day delivery 0 . 00 .
negative	the camel mule actually arrived on thurs 0nd_january .
negative	the company should not advertise something they cannot offer .
negative	i understand that it was christmas however not satisfactory
negative	n
negative	should have come here first , yet another person to suffer the alledged water_damage , amazing eh_?
negative	phones never been near water and has spent its life sitting in a double skin case with headphone plug .
negative	think this company needs a visit from watchdog !
negative	phones now on its way back to me but it '_ll take 00 working_days !
negative	lol , better be in the same condition i sent it to them in , thank_god i took photos of it before i sent it , phew !
negative	00 / 00 / 00 update - sent my iphone_0s off to mazuma and they had no problem with it at all .
negative	posted it to them via special delivery ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) and just had two emails , one to say they '_ve received it today ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) and the other a couple of hours_later to say that everything is ok and they '_ll be paying me today , straight into my bank .
negative	no mention of water_damage !!
negative	!
negative	amazing eh_?
negative	all this warm_weather must of dried out the " water_damage " lol
negative	please don_'_t waste your time with envirofone , they might offer a few_quid more but you '_ll lucky to get it .
negative	i am on a business contract , our company has_been on vodafone for many_years , my iphone had some issues within 0year and 0 month of having the phone , and of course it is not covered by warranty .
negative	however , vodafone offer no other way of warranty such as other_companies do , e . g .
negative	john_lewis offer 0 year_warranty on ipads .
negative	bearing in mind the contract is 00 months .
negative	while trying to sort this out , or seeing if they can offer me some kind of replacement or cheaper repair rather_than the £_000 to fix it .
negative	( the phone is barely even worth that new now ).
negative	their service was dreadful on the phone .
negative	when i was told someone would call me back in a specific timeframe , no one did , i kept having to chase them up .
negative	this happened multiple time , and their manager defended them .
negative	i said if you arrange a callback it is polite to make that arrangement or at_least get someone to say that they may need to arrange another time .
negative	service is dreadful and now the account_manager is now a team and not just one person .
negative	we had a good relationship with our previous manager and the team are useless and only open minimal hours .
negative	they need to do proper stock checks - idiots , staff unhelpful and lack knowledge !
negative	wait ages for assistance !
negative	partmaster website is rubbish , next_day delivery doesn_'_t mention no sat delivery , you pay through the roof for a lousy controller !
negative	avoid this chain at all costs
negative	. 0 tickets for leonard coen as a suprise christmas_present for my sister long time l . c fan i dug deep and explained to my good lady wife that it was both a christmas and birthday_present and hid the reciept face value of tickets £_00 actual cost of tickets £_000 does the phase ," ever feel like you have been ripped_off " mean anything to anyone anymore nothing more than legalised stealing and the fact that they are associated with the nme is also shameful they are not helping the fan they are exploiting them .
negative	avoid this site is not very good either so_far on my 0th review but it keeps_crashing anyway
negative	i have just spent £_000 with tyre_shopper on four premium avon_tyres
negative	one of the more_expensive larger rear_tyres has failed within seven_days and tyre_shopper have said there is no warranty with the tyre and have refused to replace it
negative	the customer service agent ( or his manager , who he said he referred to ) was absolutely_useless .
negative	i '_m not blaming the customer service agent for his company '_s " non warranty " policy , but he offered me a small discount on an even more_expensive bridgestone tyre .
negative	surely he must have realised that i '_ve just had a new avon on the same axle and that as it '_s also the drive axle , it '_s even more important that it shouldn_'_t have two different tyre manufacturers on it !
negative	!
negative	i '_m totally perplexed on how tyre_shopper can have a link to tyresafe '_s website on it '_s homepage if they are advising customers into having two different brands on a drive axle
negative	the customer service agent also had no idea about avon '_s tyre warranty
negative	i have logged a complaint with tyre_shopper and will be seeking_advice from trading_standards
negative	my advice , do not buy from this company .
negative	as they are not face to face , they will hide
negative	having unsuccessfully tried to purchase some items their non - appearance several weeks_later is really frustrating .
negative	then contacting them to be told go away we '_ll get back to you one day sticks in the gullett .
negative	i am about to issue a summons to the small_claims court .
negative	the customer service is non - existent and the contempt is par_excellence .
negative	i would never ever go to this company and i would actively dissuade anyone from using it - unless they want a protracted dispute , appalling ryan_air style customer service , and a trip to the small_claims court .
negative	to date no goods received no refund and no further communication .
negative	inept incompetent and edging on highway robbery .
negative	on arrival in lanzarote , we were told to wait outside the airport and wait_until our names were called , that took about 00_mins then we were directed to a coach which was a long way away , not good if you have mobility issues , like us .
negative	coach took_ages waiting for other passengers , fortunately we arrived quite early , but it would have been a nightmare if we had arrived on a late flight .
negative	we couldn_'_t be_bothered with the hassle on the return leg and took a taxi .
negative	if you have mobility problems avoid them .
negative	it '_s just not worth the couple of euros you '_ll save
negative	absolutely_useless .
negative	items never delivered within timescales , when large items are finally received they are damaged .
negative	takes 00 working_days to hear back from customer service when chasing items and then another 00 working_days to book in a collection of an item .
negative	looking over the reviews on the internet it is surprising this company is still trading .
negative	would recommend that everyone stays away from they are a complete disappointment .
negative	please don_'_t be_fooled_by the positive_reviews listed below i can only_assume they are left by the owners of the company or there are a few lucky people .
negative	took an_absolute age to deliver ( about 0 months ).
negative	i ordered the gloss_white tv_unit , came in 0 boxes and weighs over 000kg .
negative	all boxes perfectly intact on delivery however almost every piece is damaged and scuffed .
negative	you cannot email or call the customer service department as there is no phone number !?!
negative	i was never offered a refund or a replacement even with their guarantees .
negative	you will be lucky to get through on their only number , however when they do answer they will be more than happy to take your money but if you have a problem you have to call the same number which they always promise a callback from this socalled customer service team .
negative	after about 00 promises and emails to the sales_team no callbacks happen .
negative	if you get scammed please call your card company for a refund .
negative	i called my bank and they claimed a chargeback using visa .
negative	we did have problems as ideally you need to return the item , however 0 boxes weighing over 000kg and no return address makes things very difficult .
negative	took about 0 months however have now received a full_refund and will now take a trip down the scrapyard to dispose of scrap that was left at my house .
negative	please stay_away from this dodgy company and use a company that has all positive feedbacks as you will be very sorry when you get caught out .
negative	i would never ever shop_here again , paid for a next_day delivery and it took 0 days with no explanation after phoning on 0 occasions .
negative	i ' d love to tell everyone just how marvelous the christmas_tree i bought looks .
negative	unfortunately though i can '_t , since dobbies made me hang on for a full week after i ' d placed the order before eventually letting_me down by saying that they don_'_t actually have any in stock .
negative	in the meantime all the other shops have now run out of stock , so i can '_t even buy a replacement elsewhere .
negative	merry_christmas to you too dobs !
negative	os_produtos são bons , os portes para entrega terríveis !
negative	i was initially very pleased with the option that very provides for an interest free for 0month period - take 0 - however since my purchase it has sadly been downhill and for this reason i will not purchase from yourselves again !
negative	too many competitors for you to do what you have done .
negative	i was told in no uncertain_terms my product would be with me on a certain day , therefore i took a day off work to receive it .
negative	not only did it not arrive when i contacted yourselves i was told it could take up to 00 days to arrive !
negative	totally_unacceptable the item was a present and not cheap !
negative	it did arrive the following_day thankfully but i certainly do not wish to take the chance that an item could take up to 00days to deliver and that '_s all the help i receive !!
negative	one final note is the sheer_amount of emails i receive from yourselves around 0 a day minimum , the fact u bombard people with emails will probably make them not want to purchase things off you .
negative	bear in mind i have worked in retail for 00 years and i am more than qualified to comment on this service .
negative	i hope you read and take serious and maybe act_upon my comments !
negative	i wont go into the full details but it was a joke .
negative	i ordered in november but the order never arrived .
negative	when i did get through to someone they said it ' was all ok but it '_s not in stock '.
negative	i was like umm and thats ok ?
negative	after waiting for a few more weeks i got a refund .
negative	the parcel ordered on august 0th has not arrived
negative	tracking tells_me that it was at borehamwood service station on august 00th
negative	no one has rung me .
negative	there is always someone at the delivery address to receive parcels 00 / 0
negative	i bought a kingston ssd and chose the free delivery , when i bought it there was 00 + in stock , 0 days_later , the status still says " goods allocated ", so it hasn_'_t been dispatched yet .
negative	to make things worst , they took the money straight_away , with no emails about any updates about my order .
negative	and the estimated delivery was 0_weeks , which is strange considering when i checked again there was 000 + in stock apparently .
negative	i then phoned them up asking if i could just add the extra cash to upgrade it to the next_day delivery , they said no , so i asked for a refund .
negative	after the refund was issued , i bought the same ssd again , but chose to pay the extra £ 0 . 00 for next_day shipping .
negative	guess_what ?...................
negative	0 days_later , it still says " goods allocated " as the status , and now it says 000 + in stock , and of course no email about any update with regards to my order .
negative	what a joke !
negative	terrible !
negative	reasons as displayed below ..
negative	ordered orchestra seats in center , given balcony seats with warning of obstructed view .
negative	called overseas to resolve .
negative	then , given balcony seats center for date requested .
negative	picked_up tickets at box office , fortunately three hours ahead of show .
negative	golden had posted tickets with theater for following night .
negative	box office agent sorted_out the problem and gave_us better seats for that night .
negative	should have dealt directly with box office ( sr . discount savings ).
negative	or , could have gone to half price sales in london .
negative	in either case , plenty of available tickets .
negative	cut out the middle_man !
negative	admittedly , the products seem to be good value for money ' on paper ' but considering i paid for my shed 00 / 00 / 00 and had 0 deliveries of various parts that still do not equate to an entire shed , then all i can say is avoid !
negative	i disposed of my old shed the day before the delivery date and had to store everything out of it , either in my home or in neighbour '_s sheds and they are still there now almost a month later !
negative	numerous lengthy and unhelpful calls to the ' helpline ' ( i use the term very loosely ) and broken_promises of return calls from a manager later and i am done with these amateurs .
negative	yes , there are plenty of good reviews but the after sales service leaves a lot to be desired ...
negative	the product i ordered was what was in the picture but when it came was i pot plant nothing like what the picture was nothing stated in description about what you get or nothing when contacted was told can only put one picture on so beware do not trade with this ebayer
negative	not delivered on time - nobody_answers emails or phone .
negative	use amazon every time from now on .
negative	useless .
negative	i purchased a sweatshirt from the bank fashion website as it was on sale cheaper_than anywhere_else .
negative	it took about a week to be delivered , which is not really up to standard , and i found out they had sent me the wrong item .
negative	while it '_s understandable that mistakes_happen , i noticed the sweatshirt had been re - labelled as the item i wanted , almost as if they were trying to give me another design hoping i wouldn_'_t notice .
negative	i sent it back using collect_+ as they do not use royal_mail for returns , which is a nuisance as my nearest location is a 00 minute_walk ; i know that isn_'_t too bad but as this shouldn_'_t have happened in the first place it was frustrating .
negative	i wrote explicitly on the returns_form that i had been sent the wrong item and wanted the correct item sent to me .
negative	so i waited another week for the correct item to arrive , only to find they sent me the exact_same item , the wrong item , again relabelled as the one i ordered .
negative	i called up customer service and told them about this issue , assuming this was happening to other people as well .
negative	the woman i spoke to said she would call me after finding out what was going on , but i didn_'_t receive any call back .
negative	i have been instore many_times so i know it '_s a reputable_company , however i can only_assume the online business has_been pushed to the side because the service is atrocious .
negative	it has now been three_weeks since i placed my order and i have still not got the correct item .
negative	i will be returning for a refund and taking my business elsewhere in future .
negative	use with extreme caution .
negative	chances are you will have a terrible service
negative	this company provides a very poor service and lacks proper control of customer service
negative	joined british_gas homecare and had a problem with my boiler in my flat .
negative	had 0 appointments to my flat for a various bs engineers to fix a problem .
negative	either the engineer didn_'_t turn_up for the numerous appointments or the engineer arrived at the wrong time , but didn_'_t have the part and had to arrange another visit !
negative	or he broke something else on his visit .
negative	my wife and i had to take days off work for this ' service '.
negative	we took so many days off from work sitting in the flat , waiting for an engineer to not turn_up , that we weren_'_t able to go on a holiday .
negative	very unhappy - eventually i came to the end of my tether and cancelled the homecare .
negative	we never were able to get any refund on the service that we had experienced .
negative	after the nasty experience we got a local engineer to come around and fix the problem the next_day - should have done this in the first place .
negative	a very expensive and unpleasant_experience .
negative	don_'_t believe the slick adverts and marketing .
negative	british_gas have the worst customer service in a company i have very come_across .
negative	i will never use british_gas for anything again .
negative	very poor service from plumbworld - i waited in for a day , it didn_'_t arrive and no contact was made .
negative	i tried to phone the delivery company ( yodel ) but their phone lines didn_'_t work .
negative	yodel eventually phoned me to say they would deliver 0 days_later .
negative	i waited at home again ( took time off work ) and again no delivery .
negative	couldn_'_t phone them and they failed to contact me .
negative	after this frustrating experience i tried with little success in emailing plumbworld several_times ( they have no phone number ).
negative	they did little to help for a full week - all this time my builder was waiting for the bathroom pieces to install .
negative	yodel were no help either and lied to me that they would get someone to phone me back on my twice failed delivery .
negative	i was getting more and more frustrated ...
negative	eventually plumbworld sent out a second delivery with my stuff via a different delivery partner , seems that the first set had got lost by yodel .
negative	this did arrive !
negative	although a part of my order was missing and i '_ve got to wait 00 days for delivery since the date i arranged for it to be delivered .
negative	i am very disappointed in plumbworld and their delivery partner yodel - if it works , then great .
negative	but if you have any_problems you are in a world of pain .
negative	next time i will purchase items from a different supplier .
negative	they did refund me my delivery charge , but that is the least they could do under the circumstances .
negative	just when i thought i had seen every scam , sharp_practice and rip_off that holiday autoes could throw at me , you come up with an_absolute beauty .
negative	you should be really proud of yourself because this must have made you millions of pounds whilst distressing thousands of your customers , not just me .
negative	before i continue , i ask that in any response to me you don_’_t insult me by saving it is nothing to do with you and it ’_s your suppliers .
negative	or tell me it ’_s on the terms and conditions .
negative	i run my own business and when a client deals with our company we are responsible for all parts of the supply_chain .
negative	i would not expect to complain to a supermarket to be told to go and speak to the farmer .
negative	i know that you are aware , understand and agree to all charges , conditions and operating practices of the car_hire_companies .
negative	when i book a car through holiday autoes that is exactly_what i do .
negative	if you ( like at my company ) did not agree with the terms of a supplier then you can either get them to change the way they operate or you could drop them as a supplier , from this i conclude that you have sat down with them at formal meetings and agreed all charges and ways of working , you have therefore agreed to these scams .
negative	if not , your set_up is amateurish .
negative	the scam that has really got me angry this time is arriving to pick_up my car , after paying for everything i wanted on line to be hit with additional_costs of 000_euros ( in case you think this is a typo , you are right one hundred and ninety six euros .)
negative	we travelled on one of the busiest fridays of the season friday 00th_july , to one of the busiest airports alicante , at the busiest of times , after work on friday .
negative	when i picked_up my car , the airport was packed with families picking_up cars and after waiting for an_hour was charged an additional 00uros ( thirty five euros ) it appeared on the bill as “ others ” when i challenged this i was told it was because it was late .
negative	now let_me remind you of something , it was “ peak time ”, peak_season and the airport was packed so why did you charge me 00_euros extra ?
negative	i could understand if it was 0am at an airport that was closed but this was the main pick_up period .
negative	this scam is a disgrace and you should be_ashamed of yourself .
negative	is it your policy to try and ruin hard working customers holidays before they have even begun ?
negative	and before you try , in your usual way , of distancing yourself from all your responsibilities , i would also like to mention that friends on the same flight as us who booked their car through another company , not holiday_autos , were not charged this 00_euros .
negative	i want this 00_euros refunding to me .
negative	the second part of your scam was the additional driver cover on the policy .
negative	you can ’_t go on a family holiday and not have additional_insurance_cover .
negative	if the main driver was not able to drive ( sprained_ankle for example ) then you have to make_sure you can legally drive .
negative	we were charged 00_euros for this .
negative	now to put this into context , only one person can drive the car at a time and my wife driving is no more likely to have an accident than me so why were we charged a rate equivalent to 0 , 000_euros a year .
negative	this is over 0 times my fully comprehensible insurance cost at home to drive .
negative	and this is an extra don_’_t forget on top of the car_hire cost which was inclusive of insurance .
negative	you can ’_t say it is an admin_charge at this rate .
negative	also , my wife put herself down as second driver on our friends car , the family who did not book through holiday autoes and they were charged 00_euros , so explain_why the same person is charged_twice as much through holiday autoes
negative	i want 00_euros refunded to me for this overcharge compared to other_companies
negative	the third part of your scam is the fuel charge .
negative	we were charged 000_euros for fuel we did not want or need .
negative	as well as the rip_off factor , i would also like to question your corporate responsibility .
negative	according to my research , the fuel_tank size of the berlingo is 00 litres .
negative	the cost of fuel at the time of the trip was 0 . 00 per_litre which equates to 00_euros .
negative	you charged me 000_euros , a difference of 00_euros .
negative	what a rip_off .
negative	i want this 00_euros refunding to me .
negative	no one can dive a car and return it empty , this is impossible for obvious_reasons , at the best there would be 0 litres left in the tank .
negative	how dare you charge for the full 00 litres when nobody can or would risk driving to empty ?
negative	i want 0 euros refunding to me to cover the fuel that is always left in a tank
negative	a full_tank covers 0000_km , how many people do you know who drive this distance on a beach family holiday .
negative	we have been charged this amount before by holiday autoes for a 0 day holiday .
negative	this would equate to an annual mileage of 00 , 000_km .
negative	we did not want this fuel yet we were charged for it .
negative	in the past you have said that some customers prefer to do it this way , well firstly i have never spoken to anybody who has said that , and secondly , if that is true you should allow customers to choose .
negative	it would be a 0 minute job to add to the website the fuel_policy choice to enable people to return the car full or empty , the fact that you don_’_t provide this choice proves to me you are part of this fuel rip_off and profiting from it .
negative	my company creates websites so i know this to be a very simple job .
negative	i want 00_euros refunding for the ¼ tank of fuel i was unable to use .
negative	what infuriates almost as much as your contempt for your customers and your clear determination to rip each and every one off as much as possible , is your contempt for the planet we live on .
negative	it is now proven the link between carbon emissions and global warming yet your fuel policies actively encourage people to use more fuel than they need , you will frequently hear the phrase “ we might as well drive as we have paid for the fuel ” how can you sleep at night knowing you are contributing to the death of the planet just so you can dishonestly make a few extra pounds , do you not have any corporate responsibility at all .
negative	do you not care about the next generation who will inherit the planet from the rest of us ?
negative	i wonder_if you have a mission statement to “ ruin family holidays and destroy the planet ”
negative	please contact me to arrange the refund of the 000_euros i have been unjustly charged and to explain what changes you are planning to make to the way you operate .
negative	i woyuld not recommend this company it does not carry out deliveries on time .
negative	the tracking_system is faulty .
negative	they don_'_t attend to customer complaints
negative	hopefully you read this review this review , and those below , prior to engaging with this company .
negative	i sent my samsung_galaxy_s0 on monday april 0nd via first_class delivery after being quoted £_000 .
negative	delivery was confirmed by royal_mail the following_day .
negative	no email was received to confirm this from bowozi however as they advise they will .
negative	in fact i received an emailing another 00_hours_later stating that my handset had been recieved followed_by another email only a few minutes later downgrading my original quote by over £_000 !
negative	i accept my handset was not brand_new hence_why i received a " used " quote .
negative	it is imperative that anyone who is considering using this company reads the small_print in detail , you will for example have further_reductions on your original quote by £_00 if your phone is network locked and in theory your " used " phone should be in a brand_new condition in order to recieve the quoted payment .
negative	in addidition to this if you decline the offer and wish to have your handset returned this will cost you £_00 - incurring yet more cost .
negative	of course this is if you are able to reach anybody in customer service .
negative	i have spent in excess of £ 0 attempting to contact this firm on numerous_occasions .
negative	( the 0000 number provided is charged at a premium_rate regardless of wether or not some body answers .
negative	often the line will ring for 00 seconds before being disconnected ).
negative	in addition emails between myself and bozowi customer_services have generally been generic and have taken 00_hours to recieve a response .
negative	i accepted payment as i was already massively out of pocket and at this point i was willing to accept defeat and write off my entire experience with this dreadful company and even this took 0 days before funds where received in my account .
negative	i will never use this company again and would advice others to avoid like the plague !
negative	if the management and customer service team where efficient at dealing_with their customers as the individual or team who responds to poor reviews on this site then the company would no doubt be far more successful .
negative	** regardless of wether the 0000 number is national or premium_rate you fail to acknowledge the fact that i have incurred further charges as a result of your customer service department leaving my calls unanswered .
negative	not even an_apology mr bozowi ?!
negative	i can '_t say i '_m surprised .
negative	as i '_ve states previously my handset was indeed in a used condition and not pristine , hence_why i did not request a " brand_new " quote .
negative	you continue to hide_behind your unclear and hidden terms and conditions !
negative	however , your reviews and rating on trust_pilot are clearly a reflection on your company and business style .
negative	i recommend you have a look at the pages on this site for mazuma_mobile for example who have an excellent reputation and reviews .
negative	i doubt you will remain in business for much longer if you continue to operate your business in such a poor manner .
negative	i wanted to switch because talk_talk '_s provided wireless_router is poor quality and they do not offer support on privately provided routers .
negative	they failed to follow my request to terminate my line and it took about four months from original request for them to finally disconnect their line , whilst i had switched within two_weeks of request to my new provider .
negative	talk_talk tried to charge me for the four months beyond my last usage of their service and in the end i have paid two of the four months having had threats of sending debt_collectors to my home .
negative	i will never use them again
negative	i was very !
negative	disappointed with the flowers i ordered , i normally order from interflower , and the flowers are much more substantial there , usually for a cheaper price , but i decided to use yourselves instead , there was 00 roses as ordered , but they were very small , there wasn_'_t much attention to detail either .
negative	i ordered 00 x 0 item , 0 were dispatched ( notified of 00 ) and payment taken for only 0 in a timely_manner , 0 arrived tow days after order , marvellous .
negative	goes down_hill from here , i was then invoiced for the next 0 the following_day , i haven_'_t been notified of dispatch , and my email sent 00hrs ago is as yet unanswered - interesting time to get an email requesting a review .
negative	fyi - i '_ve checked my " junk " incase the email answered got automatically moved ,
negative	told 0thing by 0 and another thing buy another not good !
negative	i purchased a coat for my wife for christmas .
negative	it needed to be returned and this was done with confirmation of receipt over 00 days ago .
negative	like others here , i can not get my refund out of them .
negative	i am now just passing this to my credits card '_s insurance department .
negative	its a shame because my wife has purchased desigual products through the house of frazer for some years .
negative	cant_believe they are allowed to trade like this .
negative	been ordering from ocuk for years , but recently found that when things go_wrong with deliveries - the customer service goes down with it .
negative	recently ordered some ram with next_day delivery .
negative	not only did it not show up ( after paying for next_day delivery ) - the order tracker shows the order as complete , but the dpd delivery company never collected the shipment .
negative	just about to run it through my banks fraud_department because overclockers will not re - imburse my account .
negative	as far as postage and packing goes there where no_problems , well_packaged and arrived before expected , the problem was that the item ( a synthesizer module ) was described on the website as obviously second_hand but there was no mention of any_problems with it , basically used but in full working order , turns_out the the headphone output was only working on one channel , volume knob was not original ( not that bad i admit ) main data selector knob was missing with just the shaft exposed , fare enough it could still work with a new cap fitted but this selector knob its self required for all essential functions was completely_useless as it didn_'_t actually work meaning the device was un usable , luckily i fix things like this if they are not to hard to sort so decided to do so , having the correct knowledge and tools i managed to get most of ot working apart_from the headphone_socket , one resistor broken in half , anyway after a few hours of work that i didn_'_t expect i had it up and running and sent an email back to cash_generator in manchester complaining that they had sold a completely faulty item as a fully working item and predictably they just ignored the email of complaint , i suppose i should have gone_through the hassle of sending it all back for a refund but i wanted it to work so i could use it but beware buying from this place as they obviously don_'_t give a crap about what they sell and don_'_t even check the functionality of the things they sell and just sel as fully working , and also ignore any correspondence , beware !

negative	bought a £ 0000 samsung led_tv online form comet at the end of september_0000 .
negative	within days of getting it , i would get some spurious streaking and image retention on start - up .
negative	this would clear within a few_seconds .
negative	by mid - november this had gotten worse to the point where at times the screen would just be full of vertical streaks .
negative	would happen for a few minutes at start - up , then clear then started to happen once warmed_up .
negative	would happen maybe one day in four .
negative	i called the customer_support line and after explaining the issue was told it was a firmware problem and to update the firmware .
negative	they sent me a usb_memory_stick to do this .
negative	that didn_'_t work as the firmware on the tv was actually later than the one on the stick .
negative	over xmas and new year period it got to the point where the screen was constantly full of vertical lines ( sound was fine though ).
negative	i had had enough by this time and asked customer_support to send an engineer .
negative	i had to wait for a couple of weeks for this to happen and he took the tv apart and could easily replicate the fault by lightly touching the " t - con " board .
negative	a replacement board may fix it or it could be the panel was the diagnosis .
negative	the part was ordered and was told it would be tuesday 00th of january_0000 for the part to be fitted .
negative	monday 00th a phone_call to say that the part wasn_'_t in yet and they would let us know .
negative	00th_january and still hadn_'_t heard_anything .
negative	another phone_call to be told the part still hadn_'_t come in .
negative	we suggested that we had been reasonable up tot his point but we were now getting worried if the tv would ever be fixed .
negative	we were told by linda that if it got to the 00st_january then they would simply replace the tv .
negative	so today is the 00st_january .
negative	linda called to say that they had the part delivered but they had " lost it or someone has taken it for another job ".
negative	and we said , " fine , just replace the tv then ".
negative	lind informed us she couldn_'_t do that as they hadn_'_t yet tried replacing the part .
negative	sorry , we said , if you cannot manage your own parts system properly , then we should not be made to suffer because of it .
negative	at this point we couldn_'_t agree so we asked for linda '_s manager to call us .
negative	here name is tilly and she still_hasn_'_t called .
negative	i '_m quite reasonable , but i will not be treated as a fool .
negative	the has had problems since we bought it and comet should repair it or replace it .
negative	we have given them a month to try and repair it and they have failed .
negative	therefore , in the first instance i '_ll be pushing them for an immediate replacement .
negative	failing that , i '_ll be getting my credit_card company involved and let them resolve this one .
negative	whatever_happens , i will never buy anything from comet ever again .
negative	their after care is poor to say the least .
negative	i was picked_up 0 0 / 0hrs before my flight for a 0 0 / 0hr journey the airport .
negative	after being collected from my hotel the coach driver went on to make 0 stops in the neighbouring resort only to then turn back on himself and go past my hotel .
negative	i had been on the coach for 00mins by this point .
negative	i had paid for a transfer with a maximum of 0 stops however the coach stopped several_times more than this .
negative	when i arrived at the airport because the collection time was so early the check in desk had not even opened .
negative	i had to sit in miserable airport when i could have been in my hotel enjoying the final couple of hours of my break .
negative	i have contacted the customer service team at resorthoppa four times by email without a reply .
negative	told customers that they would not be able to deliver on time due the storm .
negative	however , they told us last second after they had decided to send orders by parcel_force .
negative	they then told us it is too late to cancel .
negative	i tried to call them 0 times and was put to an answer machine , i emailed them via their facebook_page twice and they ignored it , i then emailed their support directly and was ignored .
negative	i asked westin_gourmet to cancel the order as i would be out of town on the day they decided to send .
negative	they refused and said it is too late - even_though i had booked it for a different day - they changed .
negative	this meant having to delay my departure to ensure that this delivery arrived .
negative	appalling service , no follow_up at all .
negative	i '_m a professional studio owner who bought an extra fender american jazz_bass for use by clients .
negative	the brand_new item arrived with a fault .
negative	i was treated as though i was trying to scam them by requesting a return ( on the very same day it arrived ).
negative	i don_'_t know what kind of customers reidys usually deal with , but i expect the benefit of the doubt at_least until they '_ve examined it !
negative	it also took a long time for refund once they did finally admit it wasn_'_t working as it should .
negative	this was my first purchase with reidys and i spend a lot of money annually on equipment .
negative	i will be avoiding in future .
negative	i had placed an order online for my partner '_s birthday as she only likes this one type of flower .
negative	when the order was received the company has sent me a completely diffrent order which is much_cheaper_than that i had ordered .
negative	not acceptable .
negative	i ordered product that took over a monthy to arrive , had it said out of stock in the first place i wouldn_'_t have ordered it .
negative	i got lucky .
negative	i was at the checkout stage when i got suspicious - no mention of vat .
negative	as the payment page was loading i googled them and discovered their true_colours .
negative	needless to say , i didn_'_t go_ahead with the purchase !
negative	forced to give them a star by trustpilot .
negative	not happy about that !!!!!
negative	!
negative	several booked flights were cancelled due to bad_weather .
negative	with no warning , even in the small_print , i found my £_000 voucher was rejected .
negative	after several e_mails and phone_calls , many were ignored , i gathered that i had spent too long in trying to rebook , though the possibility of such a time limit was not apparent in the literature .
negative	after much arguement i was offered a new flight for around half price .
negative	my wife who bought the original flight " hit the roof " and very politely told them that full details would be given to the press if they did not honour the original contract .
negative	they promptly yielded and gave_me a three month extension to my voucher .
negative	( note this was an " extension " to a voucher which initially had no obvious time limit .)
negative	subsequent weather induced flight cancellations were immediately followed_by a further extension on the time limit .
negative	the flight was very good once i managed to get on it .
negative	overall this was a company with no clue about customer service staffed by agressive employees who might be described as rude and patronising .
negative	i have never before felt the need to threaten the press to get the service for which i , or my wife , had paid handsomly .
negative	having placed an order in plenty of time for a christmas delivery i opted to use the collect_plus service and have it delivered to a local shop .
negative	this would appear to have been a mistake - having received an email to tell me the item was ready to collect went to get it to be told by shop not there , then bounced between very and the delivery company as to to who would solve the issue .
negative	now 0_weeks after the non delivery still have no item , no resolution and item still appears on my account .
negative	promised emails and calls never come_back .
negative	would not recommend collect_plus and very customer service not great at all
negative	the flowers are almost dead , and there was no happy birthday bloon ...
negative	i couldn_'_t believe my eyes when i came home to see that the flowers were on there way out ... and for 00 pound which is the grand i would exspect double the amount , so i wouldn_'_t like to see what a standard is like ... the wife was very disappointed ....
negative	same as just about everybody_else .
negative	ordered replacement saute pan lid at beginning of october .
negative	they took the money immediately but failed to supply the item .
negative	telephone line permanently busy but by continually redialling eventually got an answer and was advised that item would be delivered week_commencing 00 / 00 .
negative	failed to arrive , unable to get through on phone in_spite of redialling and no response to online requests to contact me .
negative	cancelled order online at beginning of november and expected automatic refund .
negative	didn_'_t happen of course .
negative	still couldn_'_t get through on phone and no response to email or written letter .
negative	on advice from consumer direct will now send refund request by recorded delivery using all the right words .
negative	don_'_t expect an immediate_response but will not give up on this without a fight .
negative	i do not like being_ripped_off !
negative	we '_ve_used xln telecom for a number of years , and were always skeptical_about the very bad_reviews we read about them .
negative	however on cancelling one of our contracts with them , we '_ve be hit with what i can only describe as a scandalous hidden charge of £_000 . 00 .
negative	apparently even if you give the proper notice to switch line provider , and after they have given you a mac_code , if the new provider takes over the service even 0 day early , they hit you with this charge .
negative	i called xln today to complain , and all they did was fob me off with small_print .
negative	these_guys have a very bad attitude_towards customers and thoroughly deserve all the bad_press that they get
negative	paid £_000 up front to get our neff_dishwasher fixed , their local engineer a j p dom app ser of 0 the courtyard , saxon lane
negative	bn00 0ql seaford , east_sussex tel 00000_000000 called to take a look .
negative	didnt even bring out his tool box .
negative	came back to carry out the repair over a week_later , and although having assured us the dishwasher was now working , left us with the original fault and a broken dishwasher .
negative	we immediately complained to repaircair who promised that they would arrange for the engineer to return .
negative	however having waited in for 0 days no engineer has_been and we are left with no repair and just broken_promises .
negative	what a scam !
negative	i closed my account with talk_talk and yet they still kept billing me - despite_numerous complaints .
negative	ended_up having to cancel my direct_debit with the bank
negative	they still owe me money - but its not worth the hassle trying to get it back
negative	not a very big and that was medium_size and the colours wasnt very bright :( not worth the money at all
negative	delivery failed for a freinds birthday .
negative	00_hours_later still no joy and a further 00_hours until i '_m due to get a response - never again .
negative	winter_wheels for golf trolleys from jlgolf ltd
negative	although their initial service in supplying the wheels was good their subsequent service is extremely poor in that they do not honour any sort of guarantee .
negative	the winter_wheels in question were used on 00 occasions over the winter doing total of 00 complete rounds of golf by which time the rubber was coming away around the studs .
negative	the supplier states that the wheels ” have been well used ” and that i should purchase a replacement set of wheels .
negative	do not purchase these inferior winter_wheels for your golf_trolley .

negative	i purchased this product after_seeing amazing things this product can do ..
negative	after watching 00mins shopping video .
negative	i bought this product from argos , read the do , s and do nots , followed the instructions to the letter .
negative	and what did this product do .
negative	steamed the laminate off my white kitchen_doors , please dont tell me i should not have used it on my kitchen_cupboards as it states clearly that you can .
negative	i used the lift away , and that only used the dust setting .
negative	so i am told by manufactuers , oh_yes and told to do a test area , but the fault did not start until the following_day after drying out .
negative	argos refuse to help me , i only want to replace my kitchen_doors .
negative	does anyone have any help they can give me , what to do next .
negative	thank_you

negative	very dissapointed by poor service .
negative	everyones story is the same with this company , they offer a big amount then cut it down to pennies , then they try to charge you £ 0 . 00 to return the handset - but on mensioning trading_standards or bbc_watchdog they say they '_ll re - look at the handset and give original offer ....
negative	bunch of crooks will never use again - best mobile_phone_recycler has to be either mazuma or top_dollar mobile ( professional companies ) - also when trying to call cash0phones with - hold your number or if they have your details they dont answer !
negative	we had previously had appliance cover with british_gas but when they increased our premiums by about 00_% despite us not having made any claims we shopped_around and settled for the silver package from the warranty shop .
negative	as luck would have it the heating_element in our dishwasher decided to breakdown so we looked to make a claim on our policy .
negative	the t &_cs are such that you can '_t claim within 00 days of starting the policy .
negative	although we weren_'_t happy about it we understood the reasons_why they have that clause .
negative	so on day 00 of holding the policy we contacted the warranty shop to start a claim and that '_s when the fun started .
negative	we went through a series of questions and at the end were told that because or claim was such a short time after the end of the claim period we would be contacted within " 0 - 0 working_days " by an assessor to go through more detail .
negative	given that we had already waited 00 days we couldn_'_t understand_why this was necessary but reluctantly had to go along with it .
negative	a couple of days_later i got a call from the assessor to arrange a " convenient " time to have an " interview " about our claim .
negative	by this time i was starting to feel like a criminal .
negative	the " convenient " time could only be scheduled between 0 :_00am - 0pm monday - friday and would last 00 - 00_minutes - hardly convenient when you work full time in the sort of job that has set times ( ie lunch_break !).
negative	eventually i arranged a time which was by now a week after the original claim was registered .
negative	the " interview " consisted of going through exactly the same details as i ' d already given the warranty shop .
negative	fortunately it only lasted 00_minutes .
negative	i was told they would submit a report and we ' d hear the outcome within " 0 - 0 working_days ".
negative	0 days_later i received a call from an outfit called dvs .
negative	at last i thought , our claim has_been accepted and this is to arrange for the repairs to be made .
negative	wrong !!
negative	this was a call to go through the same questions i ' d already been through directly with the warranty shop and the assessor .
negative	by this time i was getting completely exasperated with the whole_process .
negative	the sting in the tail with this call was that you now have to pay your excess of £_00 and that i would be contacted within " 0 - 0 working_days " for an engineer to call and assess our dishwasher .
negative	i enquired as to whether we would get our excess back if the warranty shop wouldn_'_t honour our claim .
negative	the person on the phone couldn_'_t answer and just kept referring me back to the warranty shop .
negative	so once again i called the warranty shop .
negative	i was told that if the engineer has_been to assess our dishwasher and it is decided that they will not honour our claim then we wouldn_'_t get our excess back as costs had been started .
negative	the only way we could get our excess back was to cancel the engineer '_s visit .
negative	i asked on what grounds our claim wouldn_'_t be honoured and one of them was " wear and tear ", so with cynical head on now , i said that i expected that this would be the conclusion of the engineer , especially as the dishwasher is nearly 0 years old .
negative	by now completely fed_up with the whole_process , being made to feel as though i was making a fraudulent claim and still no nearer having our dishwasher repaired , we decided to withdraw our claim and cancel our policy with immediate effect .
negative	since then i '_ve contacted a local domestic_appliance repair man who came round to assess the dishwasher on a saturday and will be able to do the repair on a tuesday_evening when he '_s received the part .
negative	it '_s costing us £_000 but worth it to have a working dishwasher repaired at a convenient time for us .
negative	we ' re also going to put the warranty shop premiums we ' re saving in a bank_account to cover any future repairs we need doing ( once in the last 0 years is not a bad strike rate !)
negative	so the moral is if you want a cheap multi - appliance policy then the warranty shop will tick your box .
negative	however , if you also want a hassle and stress_free claims process ( not an unreasonable request in my opinion ), then i would avoid the warranty shop at all costs
negative	we changed provider from scottish_power to npower in november_0000 .
negative	we paid scottish_power by direct_debit and built a credit balance of £_000 by the time we changed .
negative	after 00_minutes on their " customer_services " 0000 number (=£ 0 . 00 ) they assured me a cheque ( not a direct transfer ) would be sent within 0 - 00 days .
negative	it '_s now 00 days and nothing has appeared - and i '_m typing this while on hold .
negative	00_minutes so_far ....
negative	i only hope npower is better !
negative	i don_'_t live in the middle of nowhere .
negative	00_mins drive from oxford .
negative	00_mins from swindon .
negative	00_mins from newbury .
negative	i have two lines one residential one business .
negative	but for three years i have been fighting bt over poor and declining telephone and broadband service .
negative	the cable from my village to the exchange ( 0 miles ) is decaying .
negative	constant occurrences of noise , crossed lines and broadband_speeds dropping down to a few kilobits .
negative	they come and fix symptoms but refuse to replace the cable .
negative	it must cost more to keep patching than to replace it .
negative	furthermore there are no plans to ever upgrade my local exchange , let_alone me , to fibre .
negative	people who use phrases like " upgrade everyone to fibre " really are gullible , or work for bt .
negative	masai villages in africa have better broadband connections than semi - rural locations in southern england .
negative	bt are a disgraceful hopelessly dysfunctional organisation .
negative	i came_across this company as a reputable source of unlocking an i phone , i made a commitment to a friend i would unlock there phone for them , i quite happily paid the money and from then i had the most appalling service , i got an email_saying it would be done within 00_hours , made a complaint and was told it would be done soon , in the meantime 00_hours_later my friend to my embarrassment went and unlocked it on the high_street .
negative	they now have my money and are not responding to emails , they are based in malta , if your looking for a good reliable service this isn_'_t the one .
negative	stay clear of these_guys you may as well walk down to the drain open it up and chuck £_00 down it as your get more satisfaction the working with the poor_excuse for a business
negative	i have read all the reviews regarding this company of morons and idiots .
negative	it '_s the same old story , i ordered things on the 00 / 0 / 00 on their 00 hour delivery .
negative	needless to say the items never arrived .
negative	i visited their site to check the order status and low and behold it said order " pending "!!
negative	i phoned them up , and you guessed it thy only had an answering_machine service .
negative	so i decided to contact them via their online email form .
negative	oh i never recived any confirmation_email as others have written in their reviews .
negative	i recived an email eventually from some girl called karleen same as others ... seems like they only have one customer service rep .
negative	anyhow , i cancelled the order as i saw some better vibrators on another site called love honey .
negative	karleen said that i would get a refund within 0 days .
negative	you guessed it i '_m still_waiting after 0_weeks .
negative	i am now in the process of taking them to small_claims court to get my money back plus costs .
negative	i would strongly_advise anybody not to purchase from these_people as you can hardly call them a company !!
negative	they are a total load of bullshiters and shysters !!
negative	!
negative	i have never_heard of this ' hermes ' delivery service before .
negative	i ordered a poster from allposters . com who used this service .
negative	i checked on their website and was supposed to arrive today .
negative	judging_by the reviews i can expect to receive a terrible service .
negative	i hear this company is owned by the germans .. i mean what do you expect .
negative	they should stick to making volkswagens .. lol
negative	this service is absolutely_terrible , i would not recommend anyone buying from this site .
negative	allposters . co . uk is not a uk site , which had me fooled !
negative	they are based in america but use the co . uk tag presumably to fool people in the uk .
negative	i ordered two prints and a poster .
negative	firstly they didn_'_t confirm the order by email which is usually customary with good companies .
negative	then they got my address details wrong !
negative	then when the order came it was incomplete !
negative	then when they sent out the missing order they used an unknown delivery company called ' hermes ' who failed to deliver the item !
negative	i mean what more can i say ... steer_well clear is my advice .
negative	please dont buy stuff from them they are running a scam .
negative	i bought a samsung phone 00 june in £_000 . 00 .
negative	after ordering i found that they are running scam i send them an email very next_day .
negative	got and automatic generated answer from them which was totally_irrelevant answer .
negative	next_morning called and have to wait for 0 hour and 0 min .
negative	and he asked me reason_why i want to cancel i said i already gave you reason in email he said yeh but we need your reason again .
negative	i sent him another email same auto_generated email .
negative	then next moring again i called and she said that she have not got received any email and there is no record that i rang and spoke to anyone .
negative	she said your order has_been dispatched and i asked here tracking no she said courier will give us in next 0 to 0 days so then she will give me .
negative	then i called to moneybookers who are registered here in uk who charged my account on the behalf of them i told them they are running scam and you are the part of this scam and i will take legal_action_against you then they contacted to simply electronic and they refund my money .
negative	thanks to allah ( god ) got my money back .
negative	stay_away from them .
negative	its a scam
negative	offered something they did not have - very disappointing
negative	i booked the mot_test on wednesday only to be told that the mot_tester his daughter had been taken to hospital so the test would be delayed until friday the car failed the mot .
negative	i had it checked by my own garage were it is regularly serviced and was told that except for the headlight there was no reason to fail .
negative	i had the work carried_out by my garage and booked it in for a retest on the following wednesday only to be told that mot tests were not carried_out on wednesdays rebooked for the thursday at 00 . 00am when i turned_up i was told no appointment was booked i had to come_back at 00 . 00pm i think your service stinks and your company leaves a lot to be desired
negative	i will never use your company again and will tell everybody i know what a lousy outfit you are
negative	everytine my friends and i have brought vinyl it always arrives in melbourne damaged .
negative	i don_'_t understand_why you don_'_t bubble_wrap it or take additional measures to protect and take_responsibility rather_than fobbing it off and blaming it on couriers or postal companies .
negative	i refuse to use chemical anymore and use red eye , juno , bleep or local people as their vinyl isn_'_t damaged
negative	what '_s the point of being a delivery company if you can '_t deliver an item correctly .
negative	made worse by the fact it '_s high value and should be signed for but they actual tried to leave with a neighbour ( who refused )
negative	if i could zero_stars but as i cannot they get one just for answering the phone ( even then badly )
negative	any one or any company that uses_yodel needs there head looking at ....
negative	they are the worst delivery company that i have ever had to deal with
negative	a while ago we used them , and a scream boxed set ( amongst other rejected items ) which were in very good condition were rejected on the grounds on " damaged artwork ."
negative	they refused to return them , as they had been " recycled responsibly ".....
negative	i have since heard that they recycle under the name " zoverstock " on amazon ... daylight_robbery in my opinion .
negative	this cover was requested for before_christmas since it was a gift .
negative	i expected 0_weeks sufficient .
negative	a week before_christmas i contacted specialised_covers and never got a reply by mail or telephone_call .
negative	after christmas my opinions were expressed , we were advised the cover would be delivered asap , the next story was it went to the wrong_address , verbal apologies mean nothing in business , as far as i '_m concerned .
negative	cut the cost or remove the deliver cost and one might consider returning .
negative	i certainly wont return and would advise others against this company .
negative	i paid iflorist for flowers from their " same day " range , the flowers finally arrived 0 days_later ( after i had cancelled them for not arriving ).
negative	my mother explained to the florist that they had been cancelled so the florist said they would be free as it was their mistake .
negative	other than an offer to look into the issue when i cancelled the flowers for going awol and an assurance someone would contact me within_00hrs ( a week_ago ) iflorist have ignored my communications during the last 00 days .
negative	i wont let it drop but please everyone avoid this company , anyone can make a mistake and fail to deliver , i know they reply on florists .
negative	however then to ignore their own customers complaint is unforgivable .
negative	fortunately my mother has forgiven me for seemingly missing her_birthday .
negative	main item in my order , and about 00_% of the value was clearly_marked as " in stock " on website .
negative	chemist_direct proceeded to send out only the small extras added with a delivery fee added on , increasing the cost by 00 %.
negative	common_sense says call a customer if something is not in stock and see what they want to do about it , chemist_direct instead dispatch what they can and then tell you the rest is now out of stock !
negative	shocking service and very dissapointed with the whole_experience .
negative	paid a deposit of £_00 for a new carrera tdf road_bike instore at slough for it to be delivered on 00 / 0 / 00 so thought it was a good deal rrp £_000 down to £_000 saving of £_000 .
negative	was horrified to see on the website rrp £_000 down to £_000 saving of £_00 .
negative	queried this with halfords who really couldn_'_t be_bothered .
negative	promise of a phone_call back from the store manager who blatantly ignored the request so it goes to show that whatever you see in store is all a clever marketing_ploy to show the customer a great saving and to get them to part with their cash .
negative	unfortunately for halfords i '_ll be keep my money in my pocket and will only be using stows for all my bikes and equipment .
negative	can '_t wait to go back to the store tonight to get my deposit back
negative	the flowers you delivers were not only tatty but some were actually missing !
negative	!
negative	i ordered a dozen_red_roses to be delivered not thrown at the house !
negative	!
negative	the card that was with the flowers was for someone completely_different !
negative	!
negative	i understand this is a very busy time of the year for you but you are meant to be specialists .
negative	i won_'_t be using you again nor will any of my friends
negative	i used interparcel to book a collection with city_link , who didnt pick the parcel up .
negative	i called interparcel to let them know and rebook delivery i was told they will attempt recollection the next_day , they didnt !
negative	i asked interparcel why and they said that a recollection was never booked , i had taken 0 days of work in total to get one parcel .
negative	the site advertises that their prices could not be_beaten .
negative	i booked through this site because the airline ( vueling ) site was down .
negative	ebookers charged the same number of pounds_sterling as vueling charged in euros , ie ebookers was around 00_% more_expensive than if i had booked direct with the airline
negative	the fact that ebookers operate in sterling is not relevant to them charging 00_% more than the airline
negative	the first order i places was fine , but the next one was awful .
negative	there was a problem with delivery , then the items were out of stock , and i didn_'_t hear_anything for a week .
negative	then they said that it would be sent the next_day , but it was delayed more .
negative	i asked them why they never_let_me know about the stock issue and delays , but they just ignored the question and said it ' d be sent as soon as possible .
negative	the advert says free next - day delivery , but when you do the order , it isn_'_t free .
negative	i '_ve reported them to trading_standards , as they are obviously a bunch of cowboys .
negative	not recommended .
negative	with them for just 0 months and would never ever use them again and would certainly never ever ever ever recommend them to anyone !
negative	started with them may 0000
negative	finished with them november_0000
negative	** slightly_lower prices than other energy_suppliers but unprofessional calls and strange and aggressive voicemails left when a bill was paid one day late for example **
negative	they input our final meter_reading incorrectly ( by swapping numbers round ) and sent us a final_bill for more than five times the correct amount (£_000 +)
negative	queried immediately by telephone ( always a huge wait on hold ) and via online message system yet they kept sending ' final_bill reminder ' threatening_letters saying this would go to court etc_etc
negative	called more times and spoke to agents who recognised the mistake each time and apparently ' rectified it in their system so we would be sent a correct final_bill ' - however this " would not be until january ."
negative	this never happened though , emails were never replied to and another letter is sent threatening more action .
negative	eventually spoke to someone_who seemed more competent who_apologised for the mess that had been made by someone '_s simple mistake - and he reiterated we would receive a final_bill in january , we should ignore the letters and of course our details would under no circumstances be passed to any debt_collectors as it was clearly a mistake made that they had made lots of notes on and would acknowledge every painstaking call for at_least 00 - 00_minutes a time trying to sort_out .
negative	we just wanted to pay the bill ( as were ready to do back in november when we closed our account with them ) and be rid of them , but of course were still_awaiting this final_bill with the correct amount on it .
negative	nearly_half - way through january : no calls , no replies to emails still - and strangely no more threatening_letters - yet still no final_bill .
negative	then a missed call on my girlfriends phone ... guess_what ???
negative	its the debt_collectors !!??!?!?!
negative	calling to take payment for £_000 + that we owed ....
negative	this was an_absolute_joke and the last_straw .
negative	one long ( over 0 + hr ) stressful call - funnily_enough to the same ( seemingly competent ) person we were categorically promised that this would be sorted straight_away .
negative	he calculated our correct bill as just over £_00 - and he would discount this in half to apologise for all of our time spent calling and for the extremely messy drawn - out situation that has occurred .
negative	having been on the phone for over an_hour , he kindly_offered to say that rather_than keeping us on the phone he would guarantee someone from credit control would call us within 00_hours to take final payment of £_00 and ensure any defaults / footsteps on our credit_rating would be instantly removed .
negative	did we receive this call ?
negative	of course not .
negative	00_hours_later - one more call .
negative	last call we would do to chase this ridiculous catalogue of errors and unprofessional incompetence .
negative	call again over 0 hour - asked to speak to same guy - he wouldn_'_t take call .
negative	explained entire situation again to a new agent who again sympathised , again recognised their mistake , again apologised and said he would pass us to credit control now to sort once and for all .
negative	credit control answer : an agent answers in an unprofessional , casual manner asking : are you calling to make payment for £_000 +?!
negative	are you serious ???!!
negative	is this a joke ??!
negative	he had no notes whatsoever of the situation and was completely_clueless to anything that had been happening at all .
negative	he still had the incorrect amount on his system and the call eventually ended in an argument and we had to hang up because he said we could not speak to a manager as one was not available in credit control - and that we would have to speak to one in customer service .
negative	called one last time to speak to with a manager in customer service - after holding for another 00 + minutes , spoke to someone_who couldn_'_t help as " no manager was available ."
negative	do not have any energy or time left to keep chasing this company so we can pay our final_bill that they messed_up .
negative	companies should not have the right to pass peoples details to debt_collectors due to their mistake - especially when you spend sooo_much of your time contacting them to get it rectified .
negative	why is the onus on the customer ?
negative	does this company not communicate with each other ?
negative	read constant notes that people supposedly write and send to various_departments ?
negative	i have suffered bad customer service in the past , however not on this scale when literally being with a company for 0 months .
negative	we have still not received a call or letter from them .
negative	the emails were replied to over a month later with all saying the same thing that each agent says - along the lines of : acknowledging the mistake and advising the situation is resolved and the final_bill is on its way !
negative	received a third call from the debt_collectors this morning 00nd_january_0000 - when we moved out november 0rd 0000 .
negative	we have advised them now that we are not answering their calls , and we are not contacting first_utility ever again .
negative	after all this , they should be paying us as compensation for all the time wasted and stress caused due to one person on november 0rd 0000 inputting our meter_reading wrong .
negative	they can take us to court now if they wish and they will have to explain this utter lack of competency , continuous ignorance and complete_lack of attention , care and responsibility as a uk energy_supplier to the judge .
negative	what .
negative	a .
negative	joke .
negative	i took my macbook_pro in to the leeds store with a faulty battery .
negative	it came back with a non - working airport card which they claimed , laughably , no_longer existed , the screen peeling away from the hinges and the hard - drive no_longer working and needing replacing .
negative	absolutely_disgusting and embarrassing service and the fact that the people in the shop are all so nice makes it even more sickening that they have ruined my incredibly expensive laptop .
negative	pathetic .
negative	i order some flowers at 0 : 00 in the afternoon ready for " next_day delivery " to an address in warwickshire , the following_day i called the cust ' service number at 0pm to enquire what the eta was on delivery , the guy checked the tracking_number and the flowers were currently in cambridgeshire !
negative	the following_day ( already x0 day late ) i checked the tracking_number again and the flowers were in edinburgh which is almost x000 miles_away !!
negative	!
negative	i called the cust ' service number again and the guy was very apologetic and came back saying that he didn_'_t know what had happened and that i could have a full_refund or an flower upgrade and next_day delivery .
negative	this was no good as they were a birthday surprise .
negative	rating = 0 / 0_stars and that '_s only because the cust ' service guy was helpful .
negative	a branch of primark recently opened near to where i live , i bought a 0 pack of underpants " jersey slip " but was unable to actually see them properly because of the packaging they were much skimpier than the picture on packaging showed and subsequently a very poor and uncomfortable fit .
negative	another single pair ( most expensive i '_ve ever purchased ) bought at the same time were ok when bought , but a few washes later ( hand washed - never in very hot_water ) had lost all elasticity .
negative	i had lost my receipt and one of 0 pack had been worn so i was unable to do much about it - although a trip to trading_standards has_been contemplated .
negative	i would suggest anyone purchasing anything from primark keeps their receipt very safe , although i personally won_'_t be shopping there again .
negative	i gave this a one star_rating because the staff were pleasant and there was no way not to give any stars at all .
negative	so many things wrong - if using subtitles sometimes the subtitles start again mid programme so you ' re trying to read current subtitles and subtitles from before the break .
negative	same sometimes happens with sound too .
negative	tonight unable to watch corrie even_though i declare i '_m over 00 .
negative	in all itv_player is a waste of time they could_learn a lot from bbc_iplayer .
negative	yet another thing today monday 00th_jan the thumbnails are showing pictures of last weeks episodes .
negative	( although the date says 00th_jan )
negative	usually very good indeed , but my recent_purchase of a pair of gloves - to replace another pair of morlands gloves stupidly lost have been a real disappointment : much less substantial than the other [ two year_old ] pair , and already the stitching is coming_undone and already the leather is torn - through no unusual wear .
negative	if you want to be robbed & spend a lifetime on hold talktalk is for you .
negative	the worst customer service i have ever_experienced .
negative	please don_'_t make the same mistake as i did & put your trust in this company of con_artists .
negative	avoid this retailer at all costs - despite attractive prices , their customer service is not only difficult to reach , but it also gives no attention to your issues .
negative	i ordered a hockey bag which ended_up not meeting my needs .
negative	i returned it in due time in september and i am still_waiting for a refund .
negative	their customer service is most unhelpful : they are difficult to reach , they always promise to deal with the issue switfly , they cannot connect you with any manager or reponsible for the refund , they promise to call you back and never do .
negative	do they expect me to give up ?
negative	please_note that they seem to be a subsidiary of cricket direct in st_albans , which has very similar reviews to mine .
negative	don_'_t expect any support if anything_goes_wrong .
negative	i ordered a telephone ( 00pds plus ) which was faulty on delivery - i returned it but have not been paid a refund ( over 00 months now ) despite many requests and reminders - they also trade as sales @ ezstyle . co . uk
negative	i would advise anyone not to buy from them
negative	do not do_business with this company - they supplied faulty goods and when returned did nothing to replace or refund - they dont answer their customer service telephone line nor do they respond to email enquiries .
negative	got tv broad band could not get any extra channels rang up had rude manger i put phone down and she kept ring back next_day i rang talk_talk and asked them if i could cancel my package i got put thorgh to a contact center abroad he was nasty rude he told me he had my bank deatailes and could any thing he wants and i cant stop him had to close my account what twats they are

negative	?
negative	i have recently_upgraded with upgrade experts also i have taken out a new contract .
negative	- still to recieve this one in white hopefully
negative	i have received the wrong phone colour and no gift as was told would get an accessory_pack and also £_00 a month_contract however contract say £_00 not impressed so going to cancel and go else where .
negative	the worst customer service i have ever known and very misleading on prices .
negative	it '_s all been detailed on this forum already , so no need to reiterate what '_s already been said .
negative	what has not been mentioned as far as i know , is that for some strange reason when i changed to talk_talk , i was suddenly receiving calls from indian_call_centres trying to sell me things , when i managed to wriggle_out of their misleading contract and changed supplier they stopped .
negative	seemed to be very disorganised
negative	the flowers were not in very good condition upon_arrival and were much smaller than represented .
negative	wont be buying flowers online again .
negative	after losing more than 000 . 000_pounds over the last 0 years ( including my home ) with william_hill , which ruined my whole life , i had my account closed under the responsible gambling act , william_hill assuring me they would do there upmost to prevent me gambling with them again ( 0 months_ago ) .
negative	however i opened a new account with william_hill last_week , using my same correct name , same d . o . b , passport as my identity , same bank_account , ( obviously they new i shouldn_'_t be opening another account ) i deposited over 0000 pounds in the last 0 days , when most of my bets ( all the big bets ) had lost on sat evening , my account was closed on the sunday !!!!
negative	, i was told it was void , i even had 0 open bets !
negative	, which have now been void .
negative	no money was returned to me ....... how come wh can void my account and void my open bets - but still have taken my money !
negative	, surely if this account is void then my deposits this week should be declared void and returned ??????
negative	.... not according to wh , whom say my the bets stand , but my account is closed , my open bets are still running ?
negative	with no account ???
negative	- so much for william_hill protecting vulnerable people !!!
negative	.
negative	they have accepted money from a person_who made a self inclusion , then closed the account for being void ....
negative	this is only the beginning i will make it my business to tell the world about william_hill / i have had many other discrepancies over the years which i will be letting everyone knowing on these sites
negative	i advise people if you are to gamble use a diffrent site other than william_hill - they are the worst bookmaker when you have issues , complaints , or assisting the customer
negative	mark - newcastle
negative	ordered a golf_bag on 00 - 00 - 0000 ( and paid for it i may add ) , received an email after 0 - 0 days to say there was a slight_delay to which i thought ok as the bag was not required for 0_weeks .
negative	after 0_weeks i thought i would call them , i was assured there was a little delay and my bag would arrive in stock on tuesday 00 - 00 - 0000 and would be with me on 00 - 00 - 0000 to which i heard_nothing .
negative	my wife contacted them again yesterday and today and after 00hrs she was told that the bag is still not in stock and it will be 0 - 0 days again ( but who_knows if this is true ).
negative	to top this off their website still says the bags are in stock and you can order .
negative	i don_’_t mind delays as long as you are kept up to date and are reasonable to not have stock for 0_weeks and not contact the customer is unacceptable .
negative	i have had to instigate every communication and to add further the guys who answered the phone ( when he answers ) don_’_t even seem to care about the timescales .
negative	will never use again and i urge all to beware !
negative	avoid !
negative	!
negative	no customer service & only a partial delivery of valentines order .
negative	would not recomend & definatly wont be using again .
negative	phone numbers just cut_off & only an_automated email reply .
negative	looking at the website i genuinely was impressed but the quality of the garment and the tailored fit was poor , as was the material which had stiching flaws .
negative	not that important but the promotion was james_bond and the new dvd skyfall and that wasn_'_t even in the package .
negative	really dissapointed and feel misled as to the quality of the product , will be returning the item asap .
negative	i used to use 00 for years , i got out this year and moved to another carrier .
negative	their online and customer service was horrible .
negative	brainwashed staff had stock answers which tuned out to be lies .
negative	always promised to get back , but never did .
negative	my wife still uses 00 .
negative	she won_'_t for much longer as she was silly enough to take their lower level wallet card so she could top up on the run .
negative	now they are closing .
negative	for the second time in two years .
negative	both card were called 00 money and supposedly are a debit_card .
negative	you put in cash and get it back when you want to top up .
negative	suddenly they are closing .
negative	problem is my wife has money on it and can '_t even top up .
negative	they say at the end of next month they finish .
negative	ok they failed again .
negative	it happens .
negative	however when she tries to use the money she put on it comes back saying rejected .
negative	does anyone know what they are doing ?
negative	is this a ploy .
negative	phone staff seem to have different_stories and appear to lie or just are kept in the dark .
negative	rumours they are going broke , well is there any truth in that ?
negative	it seems their parent_company telephonica was a fortune in debt .
negative	phone staff either say technical problems or we will send you a cheque in april for balance .
negative	my wife doesn_'_t believe that , besides she wants to top up her phone which is why she got the card .
negative	she can '_t .
negative	all reviews i read say ' don_'_t walk_away from 00 but run .'
negative	i did , i wish my wife had .
negative	ordered on 00th_october , now 0rd november ..
negative	despite emailing them twice , still no update about my order .
negative	awful customer service , i will never use this company again and will be seeking a chargeback to my card on monday via my bank
negative	i would never use this site again , i have told all my work_colleagues to stay_away from this booking agent .
negative	they took my payment from my credit_card and when i received my email i was informed that the booking was provisional ( no mention of this on website ).
negative	eventually i received another email_telling_me the ferry i wanted was not available ( other sailings offered were not to my requirements ).
negative	i phoned to cancel and was informed that i would be charged £_00 . 00 .
negative	i am now in contact with credit_card company , as i feel i have been miss sold a product .
negative	ordered items .
negative	received confirmation of order .
negative	received email_advising items had been fully shipped / dispatched , then received a further email over 00_hours_later saying one item was out of stock and not being sent !
negative	obviously our order can '_t have been shipped when it said it was ... mis_- communication .
negative	queried with boohoo how come we had been told our order had been fully shipped , but then were told an item wasn_'_t in stock and wasn_'_t being shipped ...
negative	it took 0 or 0 emails to boohoo '_s customer service before getting acceptable answer .
negative	their website will tell you items are in stock , then tell you they '_ve been sent , then tell you they ' re out of stock and not being sent ... rubbish !
negative	poor control and integrity of ordering on website can '_t be trusted ... avoid !
negative	purchased a recliner_chair on dec . 0th 0000 , payment by paypal , upon delivery on dec00th , item was found to be damaged .
negative	reported to groupon online where i was told to parcel the item and take it to the post_office !
negative	the chair and footstool weighed an estimated 00 kilos in a box almost one metre square , so not really a viable solution .
negative	subsequently had to telephone customer service , a 00 minute wait for response , and , after further phone_calls , one approaching 00_minutes , collection arranged for dec . 00th .
negative	told at this stage that refund would take up to 00days , why ?
negative	at 00 days , despite several emails there was no sign of refund , so , i threatened court_action in 0 days .
negative	refund was paid on jan 00nd , email_informing_me of this was promptly followed_by another email_stating that groupon had not received the item yet and had i decided to keep it !
negative	in total from first reporting this problem , i have received 00 emails from groupon , most of them absolutely_useless .
negative	needless to say that both my wife and i have now unsubscribed from all groupon offers .
negative	john marrison .
negative	i bought a sumvision multi card_reader it has developed a fault , i , posted my issue yesterday , i am awaiting a response from the technical_department , they cant be that busy surely .
negative	even bt are quicker and that '_s saying some think , so i am not impressed at all , the response is very slow .
negative	i am not pleased with my purchase as its faulty as a first time buyer from this website i don_'_t expect the goods to be faulty .........
negative	i had a representative come round to my house saying the government are offering you a low monthly plan of £_00 . 00 a month at a fixed rate till 0000 and i asked will this go up he said no its fixed till 0000 so i thought this was a good offer as i was already paying £_00 . 00 for gas and £_00 . 00 electric a week , so i took this offer up in november_0000 , come june_0000 i had a letter from eon saying my monthly direct_debit was going up to £_000 . 00 a month from £_00 . 00 i was discuseted , as this was supposed to be a fixed rate till 0000 , im a single mother on benefits with a low income , thats_why i took the offer up in the first place , ive already contacted watchdog at the bbc and going to the citezens advice please be aware do not be scammed by eons offers change providers i will never go back to eon again !
negative	woeful company .
negative	ordered stuff from next and they use these jokers .
negative	so_far , they have delivered the wrong item , delivered me something that was damaged ( as it had obviously been droppped ), not turned_up for a further 0 deliveries , and not collected from my house on 0 seperate_occasions also .
negative	absoulte nightmare of a company .
negative	never ordering anything from next again until they change couriers !
negative	!
negative	ordered an oven_element on 00nd_april , finally delivered on 0rd may .
negative	if i had been told they hold back free delivery items for a week i would have paid for delivery .
negative	if i could give them lower_than 0_star , believe me i would !
negative	well i have always been a fan of asos , good clothing , good choice , unfortunately in order to get this stuff you have to go through them , and if you love wasting your time and money , then you will love this company !
negative	firstly i ordered over £_000 worth of clothes to be delivered to a collect_+ store near where i work , so i ordered next_day delivery ( not realising you have to order before 0pm for next_day , slightly my fault but they should have an alert when ordering ) so it was meant to arrive on the saturday .
negative	i ordered my clothes just before the fire , and it got dispatched too before the fire had even happened .
negative	so the website went down , no emails , no calls to let people know .
negative	when i finally got through to somebody , she hung_up on me when saying my order number , as it was the saturday and no signs of it .
negative	so i decided to make a journey to chancery lane , wasting my time and money to find there was no delivery , and again no keeping customers in the loop .
negative	very poor if you ask me !
negative	i then had to wait to the monday to bombard them with emails to finally get a response as i was getting very annoyed !
negative	having finally getting to speak to somebody on the phone , my order had been ' lost ' and the only way was to deliver to my house , otherwise cancel the order and replace again ....
negative	i '_m_sure most people have another spare £_000 on a second order , don_'_t they ?
negative	jeez !
negative	however i said because i work during the day , this is why i did the collect_+ store , and can they not reimburse me with next_day evening delivery .
negative	no the woman on the phone said .
negative	after finally getting a text through about my order from the collect_+ store , the order that got ' lost ' i swore i would never shop with these again , which is such a shame as i loved asos .
negative	in regards to the second order , there never was no keeping_me informed , as that was sent on next_day delivery that failed to show .
negative	i would rather spend my hard working money on a company that values it '_s customers all the way through , not to get an order and then not give a toss .
negative	avoid_avoid !!!!
negative	not worth the hassle
negative	having promised to deliver , and having paid for a next_day service , to be told that " it was one of those things " when i wasted a day staying in for the non - appearance of the lights was somewhat galling .
negative	a hint of an_apology would have helped the suituation .
negative	0 . very dissapointing indeed .
negative	three_days late with the delivery , luckily i had allowed the extra time otherwise would not have received order in time for party .
negative	0 .
negative	the gas helium canister ran_out after only nine balloons , again very disappointing and inconvenient .
negative	0 .
negative	a day late with the pick_up of parcel again inconvenient .
negative	0 .
negative	most disappointing of all no apology from company , did have refund , but quite righly so .
negative	an e_- mail with an_apology would have made all the difference and ex - gratia payment would have been a nice_gesture following the incredibly disappointing service and all the inconvienence that it caused .
negative	ordered verifocals and received single_vision which are unwearable .
negative	when i called for return instructions was told correct replacement would cost an additional £_00 . 00 , and also essentially told i was an_idiot .
negative	will not order again or recommend anybody to order from this company .
negative	at the point of sending my comments to which .
negative	as a first_utility customer for several_years i had looked at the negative_reviews with scepticism as the online switch and monthly reading part of the transaction was actually pretty easy .
negative	i had been disappointed that the promised savings did not materialise but i blamed myself for not seeing the information about standing charges etc .
negative	its only since last december when i moved home that i have experienced the sheer_incompetence of this mob .
negative	i submitted accurate final readings via their portal for november but still got charged an estimated bill in december .
negative	i then got another bill in december for 0 days standing charge and another estimated useage bill even_though i had moved out and they had the final reading .
negative	by this point they owed me money but i am still getting daily texts and weekly letters demanding a sum of £_00 i dont owe and never have .
negative	its mostly impossible to get through on the phone in less_than an_hour and when i have raised a query its ignored .
negative	writing an email either gets ignored or a reply on a completely_different subject .
negative	i now have a letter_threatening to cut me off at an address i dont live at even_though i have told them 0 times where i actually live but they still insist on posting letters to the old address .
negative	they are now threating me with bailiffs altough as they dont seem to have a clue where i live ill worry_about that later .
negative	i have paid every_penny of every bill totalling thousands on time for years but the inability to grasp why i might not be paying the £_00 seems beyond the morons in charge here .
negative	i am frankly at the end of both my wits and my tolerance with them and am today sending them a letter advising they have 00 days to sort this or i will be putting all correspondance in the hands of my solicitor .
negative	shambles .
negative	for over a month , i have a horribly slow sometimes disconnecting internet_connection .
negative	i '_ve called customer service three_times and every time they promise me they are working on it .
negative	i had to buy bt wifi access for 0 quid a day for the last 0_weeks , because they can '_t even tell me when the fix will be available !
negative	in the meantime i continue paying my monthly_bill .
negative	for what ??
negative	how can a fix take a month ??
negative	as soon as my contract_ends , i leave three to never come_back and tell this to all my friends !
negative	havent got anything , will be getting a refund asap
negative	the bypass relay supplied with the order was faulty , this was emailed and a replacement requested .
negative	still after a week and a half , the email has not been answered and i still don_'_t have a functioning towbar .
negative	not happy with being ignored .
negative	will be seeking a refund now .
negative	i am sure you already know that you are the worst courier company in the uk ( amazingly beating yodel ) but i '_ve had two deliveries from you now and both were damaged .
negative	anyone reading the reviews on this site will see this as a regular concurrence .
negative	i suppose you are cheap and you get what you pay for , the trouble is shoppers do not know what courier company their coveted purchase will be shipped by and the unlucky ones get xdp ( xtra damaged parcels )
negative	i suspect the ' nice ' reviews on here are ' sponsored ' by the vendor ...
negative	i '_ve_used cpc on a number of occasions and have always been happy with items arriving quickly and as ordered .
negative	however , they do say you can only judge a company when there is a problem and this time there has_been which hasn_'_t been resolved and i '_m not sure how it will be as they don_'_t respond or do what they say .
negative	placed an order for christmas_lights on 0th_december .
negative	arrived next_day with one set of lights missing .
negative	i called on the 00th_december , emailed a copy of the delivery note and was told a replacement would be sent that day .
negative	this still hadn_'_t been received on the 00th_december so called again and was told it would be despatched same day and the hold up was due to it being sent from a different warehouse .
negative	again i called on the 00 / 00 and was told the replacement had been shipped on the 00 / 00 ?
negative	when i asked to check again as the replacement hadn_'_t been received i was told that in fact the item hadn_'_t been shipped , will not be shipped as it '_s out of stock and i will be receiving a refund for this item .
negative	no apology was offered with the agent basically saying it wasn_'_t your fault as it was coming from a different warehouse ?
negative	by january 0nd no refund had been received so sent a complaint email outlining the above and now , 0 days_later and over a month from my original order i '_ve not had a response or a refund .
negative	bad , unacceptable service all_round .
negative	item was out of stock once i had paid for it .
negative	failed to turn_up before_christmas
negative	been told to wait as they can '_t do anything !!!
negative	!
negative	well i must_say the title no how is about right for the service dept as they have no idea of how to deal with a customer or tell the truth about a repair .
negative	i took my computer in last saturday as i had a problem paid my £_00 and also paid £_00 for anti_virus under there recomedation and was told computer would be ready that afternoon .
negative	i then receieved a call to say it would be sunday morning to collect from store and what documents would i like saved .
negative	somebody was telling porky pies as my wife goes and picks_up the tower unit and i plug it in guess_what nothing had been done .
negative	take it back to store yes we will look at it and get back to you monday come afternoon nothing so i have to ring and guess_what the hard_drive is gone .
negative	what a joke nobody can tell you the truth .
negative	the service is disgusting as i was told i would receive a call this morning guess_what nothing .
negative	all i can say is buy you pc etc from somebody_else as i will be doing in the future and also i will be recommending this to other people and buisness .
negative	trevor dodds
negative	sent phone .
negative	come_back all good saying payment will be issued .
negative	over 0_weeks still no money .
negative	received email on the 00nd saying payment sent yet still no cheque and now the 00th .
negative	i would have thought the whole_process would have been quicker .
negative	i had a terrible experience with a company and posted it online on lots of websites .
negative	trust_pilot was the only company to remove my review .
negative	stating lack of proof of purchase .
negative	its a tactic edreams are using to remove bad_reviews .
negative	i have provided proof of purchase but my review hasn_'_t being re - posted .
negative	i have been shopping at dabs maybe for 00 years or more .
negative	they have always been great until my last purchase .
negative	i bought a refurbed asus_laptop from them , grade a stock it said .
negative	the first time of using it the screen crashed , lines went across it , and from then on the computer was completely dead , wouldnt even boot .
negative	it is faulty and i would imagine this is why it was returned sometime in the past by the first owner .
negative	it has not been tested well enough for dabs to realise it is faulty .
negative	i contacted them to arrange a return , they suggested i may have to wait 0 - 0_weeks for it to be repaired !
negative	this is faulty from new .
negative	we agreed i would like a refund , and amanda arranged a courier to collect it .
negative	i specifically gave her my home address and told her i would wait at home all day on the thursday .
negative	i emailed thursday half expecting them to make some kind of mess up , and yes ' they ' had arranged the collection from my work .
negative	a day off work , completely wasted due to their mistake .
negative	the next_day my wife misses the courier ( we do have better things to do dabs that wait in all day for you to collect your untested junk ).
negative	i am told by amanda that , next time she will have to charge me for the courier .
negative	this is to collect their faulty product .
negative	the blooming cheek of these_people .
negative	i replied that the only reason it hadn_'_t been collected on thursday was because of her mistake , and i should charge dabs for a day off work .
negative	frustrated i read their reviews , which are rather saddening .
negative	it seems across the board their service has got to pot .
negative	if you read the economics paper ' a market for lemons ' you will see that this is occurring right across the internet , but massively so on ebay .
negative	ebay is a market for lemons .
negative	i have been on ebay for 00 years_now with over 0000 feedbacks .
negative	the last 00 purchases i have made have all had problems .
negative	not as_described , incorrect , damaged , general poor seller standards and products .
negative	even the ebay company is suffering from the effect as they cut prices and wages back .
negative	their offshore customer_support who struggle with basic english will often add to your problems , despite pre written pleasantries about how ebay cares .
negative	this is because ebay best match ranks the items that are selling - the lowest_price items .
negative	often now lowest_price means general lower standards .
negative	the moody stock , and the sellers who will work for 00p a day .
negative	ebay has_been destroyed by us all i guess as we buy from the cheapest seller , but for sure it at the moment is the place to buy tatty , damaged , not as_described , slowly posted junk , combined with zero or pathetic customer_support .
negative	enjoy .
negative	i cannot_believe interparcel have emailed me to ask for a review .
negative	their customer service is the worst i have ever_experienced .
negative	i purchased products on next_day delivery - paying a premium to be delivered to a business address .
negative	the first " attempted delivery " according to yodels tracking was 0pm ?!?
negative	the following_day .
negative	this is stupid enough but it claims a card was left .
negative	no card was left .
negative	i checked the cctv , there was no attempted delivery .
negative	first lie from the driver .
negative	yodel confirmed that the driver had not been in the area .
negative	the next_day , i ring up express my displeasure .
negative	i was to receive a call from manchester depot that morning .
negative	no call .
negative	second lie .
negative	i call back to find out what is going on .
negative	i am told , that they will message the driver , the parcel is on a van and i will have it before 0 : 00 that day .
negative	third lie .
negative	there was no attempted delivery that die .
negative	day 0 - i ring up .
negative	staff tell me that are in contact with driver , he is aware that its to be with me that day asap to hit 0pm_deadline ( for a secret_santa ).
negative	delivery was attempted at 0pm that night !!!!
negative	what do they not understand !.
negative	a card was supposedly left - it wasn_'_t .
negative	i will check cctv , i am 00_% confident that no delivery was attempted .
negative	yodel are a joke .
negative	don_'_t listen to the hype .
negative	just tested my download_speed its it is a whopping 0 . 00mbps .
negative	ha this problem for weeks and now they want me to wait another week to migrate to another ( better ?)
negative	platform and then wait another week to sort_out any potential wifi problems as they just dot know whether there will be any improvement in the service after migration .
negative	better to cancel and get another_provider who can actually help you ' d think but that will cost me 000 hard_earned pounds apparently .
negative	phone support expensive and ineffective and guess_what the manager is not there or the department is closed .
negative	luckily the sales_team are available , oh but they can '_t help me .
negative	twice booked a hotel in oxford and got a booking_reference e_- mailed .
negative	twice , a few hours_later , the booking was cancelled by alpharooms .
negative	no explanation .
negative	you can '_t do_business like this .
negative	also the rooms went up in price the second time of trying to book .
negative	waited in all day .
negative	then saw note .
negative	they couldn_'_t be_bothered to call .
negative	quicker to leave a note at residential addresses so drivers can get their round done in time .
negative	0000 numbers won_'_t let you speak to a human .
negative	had to call a collection number and tap in a false account number ( obviously not recognised ) so system would transfer me to a human .
negative	couldn_'_t deliver parcel that day .
negative	they could deliver the next_day and leave in a safe_place .
negative	i said front_doorstep will be fine ( secluded house ) they said they couldn_'_t do that .
negative	i would have collectd in my town ( northampton ) but to save cash they are located in rushden so nowhere_near the main population of the county .
negative	bought a graphics_card from them , about £_000 at the time .
negative	had no issues with purchase and delivery and was pleased with the company at the time but when the card developed a fault after about a year ( 0 year_warranty ) so i had to post back , at my expense with no offer or refund there , and the replacement time was 0_weeks with zero word from them during .
negative	i find zero communications really bad for such a long repair / replacement time .
negative	when i phoned up 0_weeks in i was told a replacement was sent out same day so waited a week only to learn i was lied to .
negative	disgusting for a company to lie to it '_s customers !
negative	the replacement card was faulty , failed under load which seemed to be a known fault from looking on random forums ( amd 0000 ).
negative	fair_enough , this sort of thing happens but i '_ve been told that i should expect it to be 00 days due to time of year .
negative	not ' up to ' 00 days but the full 00 days .
negative	i am so appalled about this companies after service i will not purchase from them again and i recommend the members in my gaming clan to do the same .
negative	i have ordered regularly from serenata and the service is usually good however on this occasion despite me putting instructions on the order that if no one home to be delivered to a neighbour .
negative	also the recipient was in the house but the deliverer did not ring the bell .
negative	they also did not follow the instructions of the householder clearly_displayed on her front_door to deliver to the neighbour in the event of no answer .
negative	the flowers were just left on the path and could have been removed by anyone passing .
negative	i then received a text saying they had been left securely at the front of the house another lie .
negative	not acceptable .
negative	i ordered a battery_charger which was showing in stock .
negative	soon after_placing the order and paying i was told it was not in stock and would be ten days .
negative	after ten days i contacted them and was told it would be another 00 days .
negative	after 00 days they told me it was in stock but were waiting for my confirmation to ship .
negative	after confirming to them 0 times they finally shipped .
negative	now saying it will be with me in 00 - 00 days !!
negative	!
negative	unless you order for christmas in march then suggest you leave tmart well alone
negative	this companies determination to build a monster store in place of the present perfectly_adequate supermarket has created huge local resentment - they should listen to their customers many of whom have ,
negative	like myself , become ' ex customers ' their plans are totally out of proportion and the more people who vote by spending their cash elsewhere , the better !
negative	milngavie - scotland
negative	the flowers where damaged and the teddy was stuffed in the bottom of the box and the note was crumpled up .
negative	very poor service i will be making a complaint to the company .
negative	booked on friday to collect monday . nobody turned_up then recieved email_saying nobody here when they arrived , which was nonsense as i was here all day . re - booked for tuesday , same thing , re - booked wednesday , online_chat guy said they couldn_'_t find my address , i said they have my phone number , so please call me !!
negative	he said the couriers don_'_t have ' works phones ' and are under no obligation to use their own .. i just couldn_'_t believe it !!
negative	the guy on the chat - window said he ' d leave a message for the depot manager , but this took two attempts without_success . i finally phoned customer_support and they eventually collected the parcel on friday , one week_later .
negative	i ' d been sending apologetic e_- mails to my customers all week , keeping them informed of events , and fortunately they were ok about it .
negative	it would have only taken one phone_call to me and this would '_ve been sorted within minutes , but with such appalling communication it dragged on all week .
negative	i find it unbelievable that a business can operate in this manner , let_alone be successful !
negative	ordered a new lawnmower & got an email from the company stating that it would be delivered on the 00th , so being self enployed took the day off , city_link never showed up , rang the supplier the next_day the 00th another day off work asked why parcel wasnt delivered to be told there van was overloaded , should be with you sometime today , well its now 0pm still no sign i cant go out to get supplies for my next job so this has cost me a lot of money in wasted bussiness , i was told city_link has my number would it kill someone to ring .
negative	avoid this company at all costs , although like me you probably dont have a choice .
negative	if the managing_director of this comany is reading this you suck , total_lack of communication , you deserve to go_bust , if i treated my customers like this , they would tell me where to go & i would quite deservingly have no bussiness left .
negative	you do realise ther is a recession on you a hole , you might not care if you go_bust , but i cant_afford to piss my customers off .
negative	p . s i rang my customer as soon as i realised there would be a problem today so they could get on with their lives .
negative	mark stillman
negative	it is rare i leave a review and this is the first time i have ever left a bad one but i felt_compelled to do so .
negative	i ordered flowers to arrive at my partners work on friday i stupidly didn_'_t check delivery times although at no point in making the order online does the website clearly show delivery times .
negative	it is only when i was chasing up deliver on the friday_afternoon that i saw this on the help pages .
negative	i called and emailed the call_centre and was told there was nothing they could do to help me .
negative	my partner finishes work at 0pm on fridays and the flowers turned_up just before 0pm .
negative	so she didn_'_t get them until she turned_up for work on monday by which times the flowers had wilted and were dead .
negative	i will never use this company again , i am not sure why they think anyone would still be at work at 0pm on a friday .
negative	i cannot review at this moment as i have received my goods
negative	i book a hostel with them , went to the property , paid cash , and everything_went well .
negative	then i found out that the property , who i never gave my credit_card_details had charged it again .
negative	since i never gave them my card_details , only hostelbookers could have done it -- even_though they supposedly make the booking by paying the 00_% and not the credit_card .
negative	i contact their customer_care to find out , and they totally_ignored me .
negative	they didn_'_t even bother to reply my messages .
negative	so did the hostel .
negative	in the end i could only get my money back through my bank in a long and painful process , since hostelbookers failed to provide any of the documents the visa company requested :-(.
negative	i never had a worse experience with a booking system !
negative	i booked an apartment in paris and made the deposit payment by creditcard only to find out days_later that the apartment was actually not available .
negative	any alternative give at that time was minimum 000_euro more_expensive .. a malfunction in the website was the excuse but no help was given to find a place to stay within the budget .
negative	my experience with this and other_websites where you rent a place from a private person is terrible , especially in paris .
negative	they cancel on you long after you booked it and you ' re left with no place to stay without paying a much higher price .
negative	booked a hotel now ..
negative	second_hand shoes
negative	i used to buy regularly from brooks taverner , quality , choice and sizing was excellent .
negative	sadly they have gone_downhill in the last few_months - the choice is poor and what choice there is , is made badly .
negative	clothes which sizes fit accurately now are far too small / short .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	i recently_bought a laptop from ld and immediately experienced compatibility_issues between windows 0 and office 000 .
negative	basically outlook kept_crashing the system making the laptop essentially unusable for a small business owner - previous to the call i had spent 0 full days on calls with microsoft tech_support who said it was the machine .
negative	i called and explained the issue only to be told to complete a form , no_probs there .
negative	detailed the issue only to get an email response saying ' there is no compatibility_issues between w0 & 000 ' - very patronising and clearly they hadn_'_t read my detailed briefing sheet or taken an interest in my case .
negative	i simply got an_automated email back saying that they have refused my request to send back .
negative	they didn_'_t even consider my troubles and now i have been left with a dud machine that cost £_000 !!!
negative	cheers .
negative	the very least they could do is actually call me rather_than use a totally_unprofessional email system that has no customer focus .
negative	i certainly won_'_t be coming_back and will be taking my £ 0 , 000 for a new mac elsewhere - so short_sighted .
negative	if you are going to purchase from these loonies then i suggest you do it as a person and not a business as you have 0 days to return without_quibble .
negative	personally i '_m not wasting another moment with them !
negative	the vent i ordered was promptly delivered but with 0 of the 0 components badly broken and parts missing .
negative	that was not plumbingforless ltd fault , perhaps ( though the packing was minimal ).
negative	the failure to respond to my emails asking what will happen to replace it is very disappointing .
negative	took months to get a reply back after having a pair of gazelle og trainers fail after 0 hours of use .
negative	support_team where unhelpful and not interested in listening to the problems i encountered .
negative	i won_'_t buy anything adidas again after this , they don_'_t seem to be_bothered about losing long_term loyal_customers !
negative	customer service is non - existent !
negative	had a pair of adidas gazelle trainers that tore on the inside of the heel after a few hours use , after returning them i was told it was not a manufacturing_fault and they would not replace them .
negative	going to contact trading_standards and see what can be done about it .
negative	i would advise nobody to use scotts or jd_sports .
negative	it took two months to finally get a refund emailing them everyday !!!

negative	had a few letters go missing in the post this year , they offer no compensation for missing items apart_from some stamps !
negative	so my stuff can go missing in the post again huh_?
negative	i flew ryan_air earlier this year and my experience was horrible .
negative	ok , so the flight was cheap which is pretty_much all this company has going for it .
negative	i had a travel case with all my stuff in it , i weighed it home being aware of the 00kg max allowance for hand_luggage and it weighed in at just under 00kg , i think it was 0 . 0 , so 000grams off .
negative	anyway , i got to the gate were a pretty blunt guy said let_me weigh your bag , having already weighed it i was happy to give it to him ... 00kg and 00grams , he looked at me and said its over weight by 00grams !!!
negative	and proceeded to charge me a ridiculous £_00 for it , thing was as well , i couldn_'_t take anything out of it !
negative	he then explained it would have to go in the luggage hold and gave_me a tag and explained one of the groundsmen will take it from me ... they didn_'_t , it came in the cabin with me and in the luggage holds above my head .
negative	on my return_journey back from ireland i was prepared to pay the £_00 as i knew it would be over weight because i was coming_back with more paperwork then when i went out and i could actually feel the difference but in the queue a women came round with a rack and asked to see if i could get my case in ... i could and that was that , no charge no weighing nothing !
negative	when i got home i weighed it ... 00 . 0kg .
negative	why did i get charged for grams and not 0 . 0kg !
negative	i called when i got home and explained to which to women on the phone said nothing , i asked are you still there and she said yes and i said well ?
negative	i cant_comment !
negative	the flight was unbelievably uncomfortable , i actually had a bad back from the lump , solid seemingly dark age seats they have on their planes - i know i know , its low_cost but should that really = bad quality ?
negative	i don_'_t think so , i have flown many low_cost airlines as i travel an awful_lot for work but ryan_air have been the worst but here '_s the thing they are not just the worst but the worst by a long long way !
negative	congrats .
negative	any way , fly at your own_peril and deal with rude staff .
negative	or pay a tad extra and fly easy jet , for a low_cost airline i cant recommend them enough .
negative	i have discovered today via a competitor that balance_optics are no_longer trading but their website is still up and they are taking orders and people '_s money , but have no_intention of for filling any orders therefore do not buy from this company
negative	i am_currently using paypal to get a refund and i '_m hopefully paypal will also block them from using their service going forward
negative	" ordered a google_nexus one phone on 00 / 00 / 00 , still no delivery !?
negative	contacted a call_centre on the 0000 no .
negative	who said they could not help as the phone was out for delivery .
negative	managed to get a delivery ref for citylink , citylink informed me that the package was missing and simply_electronics knew this and should send another phone and claim on insurance .
negative	simply_electronics will not do this and keep asking me to wait and see if the phone turns_up !!!
negative	they have taken my money and will not deal with the issue .
negative	do not use them as they are dishonest , are not based in the uk as they claim and provide very poor customer service ."
negative	they are like all the other payday_loans . say yove been accepted but when you apply its no . ive only got 0 default payment as well which may i add im paying off
negative	tried to resolve but said they wouldn_'_t help
negative	having placed an order for food and cystease , i realised that 0 days had past and that i had recieved nothing .
negative	i emailed my complaint , chasing devilery only to be advised that as they had no stock of cystease they had not sent anything out , awaiting new supplies .
negative	at this point , we were out of both items and desperately required replenishment , therefore i cancelled the order , requested my paypal credit and that all my personal_data was removed from their system to prevent any unwanted correspondance , with a confirmation_email when complete .
negative	a further 0 days_later , after ordering and recieving goods from a competant supplier , no email , no credit .
negative	contacted them again and again requested the above .
negative	suggestion , your more professional opposition have systems which advise if there is no stock when ordering or at_least will email you the next_day .
negative	i have received my goods quicker with free delivery before you have even bothered to rectify your errors .
negative	suggest any pet_owners use " vet uk "
negative	visited last night , a disgusting experiance , stinking , sticky , smelly carpets , uncomfortable seats ( superiour seats !!)
negative	game machines dumped inside next to door , very poorly managed .
negative	did my wife take me in ?
negative	what a horrible experiance .
negative	rubbish on the shelves , with misserable desperate people doing their weekly_shop , for anything cheap .
negative	not for me .
negative	i uppose that there is room for all in the market , but i prefer to pay for quality and good taste , ok yes , i am a snob .
negative	only thing i can agree on , is the rather stupid people on the tv programme , who dont understand_why they have missed their flight when the plane is still there .... berks !
negative	thats just what i thought the last time i had to go .... only because it was still open .
negative	they dont stock many brands , or they are " out " of everything you need .
negative	it is a good place however to meet strange smelly locals if your that way inclind .
negative	sorry , had real bad problems with their service and when you try to sort , you speak to someone going through the questions on the card , like an eastern robot ...... moved to o0 .
negative	i grew up believing that the bbc was the best service on the telly , although at the time there were only thre stations !
negative	now , raher than being the best , with actual news rather_than dramatised gossip , they have decided to try to compete with the other channels for worst programmes transmitted , oh and then repeated ..............
negative	i have never shopped at primark and never ( hopefully ) will .
negative	dont people think about where this stuff comes from ?
negative	have you thought how long it takes to make the fabric , make the shirt / jeans then theres the shipping cost from which ever poor country it comes from oh and transport in th uk to the shop and all for £ 0 or £ 0 ??
negative	?
negative	what are the children making them getting paid ???
negative	one or two bowls of rice ?
negative	come on people , get some ethics and principles or look the words up to know what they mean .....
negative	appauling service from both the shop and tellysales staff .
negative	mobile replaced eventually , with another one that didnt work .
negative	never had a problem with o0 or vodafone .
negative	i have canceled my order after_placing it at gagetshow live at the beginning of april , i have given up waiting for a delivery date . no responce to emails and phone_calls are a waste of time " you need to talk to some one whos never there ".
negative	i just want my money back !.
negative	i bought an item labelled as " new " when received it was dirty and had holes in !
negative	i emailled mega_fancy_dress who asked me to phone them ...
negative	phoned customers services at 00 : 00 and was told someone would call back straight_away .
negative	i never received the call after waiting by the phone all day and sending a chaser email /
negative	looks_like i will have to open an ebay dispute to fix the problem ,
negative	i would highly_recommend spending your money elsewhere ,
negative	i placed an order and was told it would take 00days to be delivered .
negative	it is now late so i went on live_chat to find out were it was as the dhl_tracking site has not been updated since it was ordered .
negative	the women i spoke to ' cat woman chloe ' was as unprofessional as her name .
negative	she basically argued with me that it is not late at all because it has arrived at customs in my country which is what the delivery day estimation is about .
negative	so according to her it takes 00 days to get it to customs then once its there they don_'_t care what happens to your product if it gets to you or not .
negative	i assume happy people on this site are from america because uk orders .... pointless .
negative	after a few_years of getting my protein from this company i was very happy until i had a missing product .
negative	i had an attachment to my order saying it would be shipped when in stock .
negative	after a while i tried to contact the company to see when my product would come .
negative	after 0 emails to customer_services and 0 months on i am still_waiting on my product i paid for .
negative	thankfully it wasn_'_t of high value but i will be sure to no_longer use this company encase something else is not in stock as you seem to get charged for the items but never receive them .
negative	shocking .
negative	they have only actually been in touch since this review ?
negative	y does it take a review like this to get a response from the company ?
negative	get in contact is all they have done also as they informed me they were resolving the issue by sending me my products , however after waiting 0_weeks for an order which should as informed by them take no_longer_than 0 - 0 days i realise it was a lie to shut me up .
negative	i have again contacted them but as usual there is no response !
negative	!
negative	i ordered a camera battery via a company on amazon_marketplace .
negative	allegedly city_link attempted to deliver the package on 0 different dates , then city_link where also given my mobile number to aid delivery , i stayed in all day , no delivery , they then claimed to have attempted delivery at 0 : 00 , mmm i was outside washing my car between 0 : 00 - 00 :_00am , no city_link van and no delivery .
negative	in future i will avoid any supplier that uses city_link and cannot offer an_alternative .
negative	i purchased a acer_laptop with a £_000 cash_back offer , this i duely filled in a posted ( registered ) to them in the timeframe as per there terms and conditions .
negative	having heard_nothing for 0_weeks i contacted them and the denied recieving my claim , even_though i checked the royal_mail website 0 days after_posting which confirmed delivery the day after_posting .
negative	i now need to find the reciept from the post_office with the tracking_number 0_weeks_later to prove they recieved it .
negative	received a pc case with damaged panels and had no reply to emails sent on 00 / 00 , 00 / 00 and 00 / 00 .
negative	i have now also waited a week for a reply on their websites ticket system .
negative	i would have just arranged a rma though the retailer for the whole case if i had know it would take months to receive the courtesy of a reply , let_alone replacements for the damaged part of the case !
negative	tenable quality control and even worse customer service .
negative	ordered something , a week_later they say they havent got it and will refund the money , the money has not been refunded after two_weeks , which means i now have to waste time chasing up , terrible service , if u advertise something for sale u should have the item in question or arrange to get it , this company treats a binding contract of purchase like nothing , get else where and avoid the headache
negative	parcel delivered by a surly , scruffy driver from a rusty , dirty van .
negative	the only clue that he represented yodel was a shabby high visibility waistcoat with yodel on the back .
negative	on leaving he spun the van wheels in the gravel , leaving deep ruts , crashed over a large rock placed to keep vehicles off of the grass , and drove across part of the lawn , leaving wheel marks .
negative	i will never use this company for anything i '_m shipping if that '_s the quality of their staff !
negative	i have complained to yodel .
negative	why not to buy from cpw
negative	i am interested in learning more about the 00 days refund / return_policy with cpw and what the implications are of a forced repair service .
negative	also interested in how / why cpw complaints staff put themselves forward as legal professionals offering biased legal_advice and opinions on behalf of cpw .
negative	as far as i know the supply of goods_act ensures a manufacturer '_s warranty and the sales of goods_act gives use time to accept goods of satisfactory quality .
negative	when purchasing a brand_new phone , things such as durability cannot possibly be tested and if a touch_screen becomes unresponsive in under 0 months of initial purchase it is up to cpw to prove it was not faulty from point of sale .
negative	does any act or law give cpw the legal right to change what i thought was six_years ( reasonable time ) to 00 days ?
negative	does cpw have the legal right to prove faults on a phone did not exist from point of sales because the customer did not ring every day to report the problem with in the first 00 days ?
negative	do cpw have the right to unbox , activate and flick_through menus ( demonstration ) at point of purchase with no consent from buyer ( may want to leave it boxed )?
negative	situation is being sold a phone in just over four months_ago that did have a laggy screen but not wanting to be a " naggy " customer - put up with it and eventually saw the screen deteriorate over time and become unresponsive .
negative	when going to the store i was told i have to accept a loan phone ( shared by most of uk ) which was not even a smart device ( no email / apps ) - both unhygienic and inconvenient for me .
negative	this was insisted upon but i refused .
negative	i expected to be offered a replacement instead but this did not happen .
negative	i would have been happy with a 000_% clean smartphone loan phone but this was refused .
negative	when calling complaints , the advisor i spoke to told me he was the head trainer for consumer_law in the department .
negative	he spent 00_mins telling_me how he could offer refund / replacement if he wanted but did not want to .
negative	instead he advised me to check a ' which website ' to revise my consumer_rights .
negative	advised i have no legal right to " not accept " or " reject " the goods based on the fault as the warranty superseded my statuary rights .
negative	after giving up on trying to communicate the inconvenience to cpw i unfortunately decided to write up a letter of rejection ( after about 0 phone_calls & 0 store visits ) asking for a full_refund ( as_opposed to a better loan phone or replacement ) which will be with cpw soon .
negative	quite a horrible experience but now waiting to hear back from them .
negative	if you have struggled to get a replacement / refund in the first six_months of purchase , it would be interesting to know how cpw dealt_with the fault .
negative	it seems like cpw profit from insisting on using manufacturer warranties as_opposed to using the contract entered ( soga ) then forcing customers into repairs , not having to replace or refund the item or even offering it as an option past the first 00 days .
negative	other_retailers have not ever done this and surely buying a phone off cpw must be a negative / counter - productive task .
negative	i would love to recommend simplygames as their prices are extremely good and they appear to run a very tight_ship but this simply isn_'_t the case .
negative	after receiving my product code to be activated on origin i was surprised to find it didn_'_t work , so i thought i ' d just send them an email asking if they could maybe sort this out for me .
negative	that was over a week_ago , they haven_'_t got back to me , what they did email to me however was this chance to submit a review about them .
negative	so yeah , thanks for stealing my £_00 simplygames .
negative	requested update twice on delivery .
negative	no approximate_time of delivery given despite_being told by salesman over the phone it would be delivered within 00_hours .
negative	requested an invoice in my company name still_waiting .
negative	very dissointed
negative	my delivery of tiles arrived on the date promised but no trim was delivered even_though it was on the delivery note .
negative	i rang walls and floors on friday 00 / 0 / 00 who informed me that it was wrongly sent to birmingham but i would get it on monday 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	the trim did not arrive until tues . 00 / 0 / 00 and was damaged .
negative	the carrier informed me that the parcel was damaged and asked me to open it to check if the trim was ok .
negative	it was twisted and bent and the carrier noted this on his docket .
negative	i informed walls and floors within 00_mins .
negative	and was told i would have to take photographs and send them to walls and floors even_though the carrier had acknowledged they were damaged in transit .
negative	i refused and asked for these to be collected and replaced .
negative	they promised to collect them the next_day but 0 days_later have still not done so .
negative	absolute_rubbish customer service and i would not use them again .
negative	awful service !
negative	initially after booking my holiday i seemed rather please that i had bagged myself a great deal to the island of st_lucia .
negative	after two_days of making my booking i still hadn_'_t received my email confirmation so i called to find that they had entered the wrong email address .
negative	after correcting this i received my confirmation to then discover my last name had been spelt wrong !
negative	after phoning them again to put this right i was told i would have to pay a extra fee of 00 pound to change the name !
negative	( they managed to spell my surname correctly on my payment details and take my 0000 pound absolutely fine though ).
negative	i refused to pay for a mistake that they made and was told by a very rude member of there team that there would be an investigation and i would be contacted within 0 - 00 days !!...
negative	i was not contacted by them and had to ring them back to find out there was no investigation taking place and i would yet again have to wait another 0 - 00 days .
negative	and i have since discovered that they have over charged me over 000_pound !!
negative	this issue remains unresolved !
negative	and i will be taking my complaint much further .
negative	overall ..... missleading !
negative	no customer service !
negative	rude !
negative	and unhelpful !
negative	first and last time i use expedia !
negative	!
negative	just to update on my circumstances ...
negative	i was contacted by a mr stewart newman who seemed helpful and directed me to an immediate escalation_team who where as slow as a snail in a trance ( also based in las_vegas , costing a fortune in phone bills ).
negative	eventually after a heated email i was contacted by them and my name was corrected !
negative	i had prior to this attempted to contact mr stewart newman again to discover i was unable to reach him because he was on holiday !!
negative	because clearly his holiday is more important than anyone_else '_s !
negative	!
negative	as an_apology for all the inconvenience i have been credited £_00 to my expedia account for future travels ... :/ but i can ensure you i will never be giving this company any of my money again !
negative	!
negative	expedia is a joke !
negative	realy bad site you will not get any help abroad from anyone , my hotel was cancelled the day i got there and the lady said you can stay but you have to pay again shouting at us kept walking of here english was not good nor my prague ..... very scary so i wish this site nothing but loose and misary like we experenced
negative	the florist was not prepared to call the recipient to confirm address and was not prepared to contact the postal service - who had delivered to that address on two occasions .
negative	the whole refusal meant that i had to contact the recipient and rendered the whole surprise worthless - not a surprise anymore - unacceptable and one star .
negative	even with the address sorted they failed to deliver that day and not until the day after the birthday ... so the recipient got her_birthday flowers a week_later as she had relocated when they eventually arrived .
negative	another florist had delivered to the correct address previously and i will be using them in future .
negative	on monday i ordered a ' spring burst ' bouquet for my wife .
negative	the bunch of flowers was advertised as being made up of 00 daffodils and 00 tulips .
negative	perfect , i thought , as she is half welsh and it was recently st david '_s day !
negative	the flowers turned_up today as expected but minus 0 key element , the 00 daffodils !
negative	although there do appear to be a couple of extra , tired looking tulips .....
negative	customer_services were apologetic and have asked me to send a photo of the bunch that arrived which i have done , at the same time requesting a full_refund ...... we will see !
negative	having checked the website it doesn_'_t even look like its possible to order what my wife actually received !!!
negative	!
negative	a long_story , cut short bought items jan_0000 parts missing , would not talk on phone , opened a ticket , took me until 00 / 00 /_0000 to get my cash_back , told blatent lies , tried every trick in the book not to refund me , agreed to pick goods up never did till 0 promised date , sent proof of refund lies never got it , had to email hundreds of times to get a reply , had to take a day off work to let them pick_up , now wont compensate me for my lost wages , will be putting up a website with all details of the problems with telephone and fax numbers plus phone numbers for all unhappy people who want to support me by telephoning and emailing them , will post here for all to see
negative	here is the email where the said they has passed the refund lies

negative	my wife traded her ipad in and was in excellence condition with no marks !
negative	once they reviewed our order they said there was a scratch on the screen and because her name had been etched on the back , which was done by apple when she bought it , they reduced the price that they had originally_quoted !
negative	there was no mark when we sent it !
negative	if you do send anything make_sure you take a picture of it !
negative	we will never use them again !
negative	we have ordered our halloween_costume twice_now but still have nothing to show for it apart_from being out of pocket .
negative	our original order went through ok but my wife '_s option ( sizes are a real_pain here ) she is a size 00 and has to order a large .
negative	the outfit that arrived would have fitted a size 00 + lady so it really was hopeless .
negative	( last years large outfit was great and fitted fine ).
negative	so we had another look at the outfits and decided to speak to someone and place the order !!
negative	the system was down so the order could not be taken .
negative	when we tried again the order was taken and we sat back thinking all was well then a few_days_later an email_saying the item is now out of stock !
negative	!
negative	thanks escapade but i think we will have to find another supplier in future we have lost so much time with ordering , returning , re - ordering its been a real_pain .
negative	rubbish company my flowers come dead .... couldn_'_t find a contact number for them email them saying i wasn_'_t happy with the service and want a refund didn_'_t hear_anything back from them so stay_away scammers
negative	they offer what look like affordable deals only to rip_off what must be thousands of people .
negative	all very well giving a call limit but they let you go over without notification .
negative	its only when they have charged £_00 ( 00 per_minute ) extra they cut_off the phone .
negative	the bottom_line is that they know this is going to happen but the regulator must be letting them get away with this scam .
negative	they know most people do not check their allowance and by not notifying them will put their already massive profits up .
negative	by the way their staff have been indoctrinated into_believing its ok to do this .
negative	they are heartless .
negative	basically shocking practice .
negative	my boy has_gone to college in usa and has tried to notify talkmobile that he wished to cancel monthly_contract on numerous_occasions through their internal web email .
negative	they have totally_ignored his requests and now have sent a court proceeding warning letter , they have now told me they only accept cancellations on the phone .
negative	they wont listen to me and just keep charging him .
negative	lucky he is back on sunday so he can call them .
negative	beware
negative	we ordered a drum_kit that arrived with no cymbals .
negative	when we went back to drumstop they advised us to wait_until their next stock check was completed and they would confirm if they were ' overstocked ' on the missing cymbals .
negative	we heard_nothing for weeks and had to call them back .
negative	unsurprisingly they claim their stock_levels showed no discrepancy therefore , in their opinion , the cymbals had been sent and there was nothing else they could do .
negative	so we ' re making it up then ?
negative	the cymbals weren_'_t sent and ok someone signed for the delivery and never actually opened up the packages to check the contents ( our fault for not being pedantic enough , i guess ) but we are a registered charity organisation , so why would we lie ?
negative	drum_stop claims to provide :
negative	" the best customer service and after - sale service comes as standard as far as we are concerned .
negative	we go every length to make_sure you get everything you need and to keep in touch with you to make_sure everything is running the way you want it to "
negative	and
negative	" our excellent service continues after your purchase too , offering you spares and after care as well as comprehensive warranty ,"
negative	sorry , not in our opinion .
negative	we wont be buying from you again .
negative	ordered 0 remanufactured hp carts but all 0 would not work with either of my printers .
negative	have e_- mailed but no response .
negative	will no be using them again and would not recommend .
negative	placed an order with tekshop000 on 00th_jan_0000 - for sony htsa 0 . 0 home_cinema kit £_000 . 00 .
negative	item then goes out of stock and awaiting new stock .
negative	get an email late last night that they are cancelling my oder as sony has increased the price to over £_000 .
negative	why the hell would they take an order in the first place when they dont have stock .
negative	i could have got it from another supplier for £_00 more .
negative	i ordered a product on december 00th .
negative	after not receiving it by early_january , i contacted the company via e_- mail and they replied_saying it would be despatched that week .
negative	the following week , the order '_s status on their site was still " being prepared ".
negative	i e_- mailed again to find out what was going on and had no reply .
negative	i e_- mailed once more and , again , had no reply .
negative	luckily i had paid via_paypal so was able to open a dispute with them .
negative	my money was refunded in a couple of days and the company didn_'_t_argue against the dispute i had raised .
negative	however , there wasn_'_t even a comment or e_- mail to apologise for the inconvenience .
negative	i wish i had checked out sites like this before i ' d made an order .
negative	looking at the recent reviews , i wouldn_'_t have gone anywhere_near them if i ' d known beforehand .
negative	don_'_t waste your time .
negative	i ordered a bunch of flowers on 00 march for mothers_day to be delivered on the 00th it is now tuesday 0st april and the flowers still have not been delivered .
negative	i have emailed customer_support twice_now but still not got a reply back .
negative	it is pointless getting the flowers delivered now as mothers_day as been and gone
negative	the worst signal i have ever_experienced .
negative	cant_believe orange are still going .
negative	know of several people who had to change companies due to the lack of signal
negative	i went to buy a phone for my gf from here and they tried to get me to get every insurance under the sun .
negative	i kept saying no but they constantly pester and try to force you to buy something .
negative	i ended_up walking out , all they are interested in is money .
negative	bad company
negative	i am so shocked at how bad this company is .
negative	looking at the website you would think it is a respectable company .
negative	ordered a bag which was in stck .
negative	did day 0 - 0 days for dispatch which i didnt mind .
negative	0_weeks went past so i had to email them , got told the bag i wanted was out of stock .
negative	this was never advertised and they took the money out of my account already .
negative	told me to wait a week for it to b back in stock .
negative	waited 0_weeks without anything so had to email again , still not in stcok .
negative	kept telling_me to choose something else but i wanted this particular one .
negative	customer service skills were disgraceful and they dont have a phone number to call !!!
negative	in the end i received a bag which i did not want but im having to keep hold of it as they have ignored my email for refund .
negative	this place should be shut_down
negative	a really bad_experience .
negative	what are doing to ensure the tea is delivered ?
negative	over 0_weeks_ago i ordered 0 bedside drawer units .
negative	didn_'_t get them at marked delivery day so i phoned tesco direct to ask what happened .
negative	tesco send me back to wayfair because that was there order , so i phoned them .
negative	in wayfair customer service nobody even knew about me .
negative	no name or address , no traces of order .
negative	had to forward an email from tesco to confirm my order .
negative	week after had to do it again because was no answer and story was exactly the same .
negative	another week odd of waiting .
negative	nearly 0_weeks_ago i received and email_saying that the refund had been issued and i can expect money in 00 days .
negative	the day had come yesterday and guess_what ?!
negative	no money .
negative	phoned them again and they told me again the same story .
negative	something happened that they are not able to explain .
negative	the will investigate and they will get back to me !!
negative	!
negative	guys !!!
negative	don_'_t buy anything from wayfair . co . uk !
negative	they sucks !!
negative	!
negative	purchased item on line
negative	few_days_later received a full_refund saying transaction had been cancelled .
negative	i emailed asking why ?, but still had no response
negative	i am not happy with you service why there is not office at aiport i need my money back please 00000000000 call me
negative	parking_facilities excellent .
negative	toilet_facilities in airport disgaceful , do not know what visitors to scotland must think .
negative	i am absolutely appalled with prestige_flowers .
negative	i ordered mothers_day flowers 0_weeks_ago to ensure i got the flowers my mum likes and delivered on mothers_day .
negative	they were never delivered .
negative	emailed multiple_times yesterday as their customer service is not open at the weekend .
negative	so i called customer_services twice today , once to be told they would find out what going on and get back to me of which they never did and then later after being on hold for 00_mins , they told me they tried to deliver at 00pm today ( on a monday ) after mothers_day and no one was home .
negative	they suggested my mother picks_up the flowers from the local post_office if no one is home , as they were despatched from prestige last friday which is 0 days ago so she can inconvenience herself and pick_up her dead flowers for mothers_day .
negative	asked for a refund but customer_services they do not have that policy and i need to follow_up with email .
negative	if my mother organises for the flowers to be redelivered through the post_office and they are dead and my mother can call and get a replacement .
negative	they have completely_ruined what was supposed to be a nice_gesture and i will never ever order anything from them again .
negative	i would encourage people to avoid .
negative	use any florist but prestige .
negative	for some reason when the product arrived i opened it and the box was empty with nothing inside .
negative	wasting a lot of time and more money to sort the problem and actually get what i wanted !!
negative	!
negative	if there was another auction company on the web , i would use it , ebay is too expensive to sell stuff on , they get money from every way , even when a seller uses their other company paypal
negative	ebay has set its self up as the internet policeman , you can buy stuff on the high_street , but not on ebay , you can buy stuff on their foreign websites , but not their uk website
negative	there is no alternative to ebay , they kill any opposition , they have forgotten what ebay was about when it started
negative	and they will probably delete my account after_reading my review
negative	if you complain on this site they ban you . they are paid by and funded by casinos and all the big posters on it work for the casinos .
negative	waste of time the whole site . they slag to death anyone who dares have a grievance against any of there big sponsors like betfred etc
negative	been playing this crappy casino and its really rubbish very little game selection . you get very little in bonus rounds .
negative	you will lose a fortune in very a short time .
negative	but worst of all is its just no fun without bonus rounds .
negative	recently_purchased a set of 0 solar_lights and upon putting out in the garden i found only three worked .
negative	i checked tesco '_s web_site and 00 our 00 reviews for that item said the same thing .
negative	i took the 0 none working ones back and was told i would need to bring back all 0 and have the whole box swapped .
negative	i pointed_out that looking at the reviews this would be pointless as it seems many of them are like this and could we check one to see this but was told no .
negative	when customer service was a priority tesco did well but it now treats its customers as if they don_'_t trust them and not willing to check another box was just being plain difficult as this would show the poor quality of the item and also stop me from more continued wasted journeys .
negative	i wont be ever going back to tesco and with my purchases though its store for my home & business as well as entertainment , wine , £_00 per week fuel and credit_card its lost a minimum of £ 0000 from me which now go straight to sainsburys .
negative	i can only see more bad_news for tesco and its share holders while it employs people with no common_sense to deal with issues instead of sticking to the book while doing this will not sort the issue .
negative	it does show how the company has changed when just two years_ago i this exact_same issue took back the none working ones of a solar light set and had them swapped .
negative	absolutely_hopeless .
negative	glasses were totally not as_described thick lenses instead of thin_lenses for rimless infact 00_% thicker than they should have been .
negative	returned glasses still_awaiting refund .
negative	customer service useless .
negative	claim they are busy on other customers so can not deal with the customer they are conversing with !
negative	no need to repeat all that has_gone before , enough to mention
negative	incompetent engineers ; lies from the help - centre ; money taken to which they are not entitled .
negative	without a doubt the worst company i have ever had to deal with .
negative	i give them one star because it is not possible to give less .
negative	i once logged_into the system to look around and have since been bombarded by junk_mail from people i don_'_t know wanting to be my friend !!
negative	it took_ages to get my profile removed ( customer_services were quite helpful in the end so they get the star ).
negative	i received an xbox_000 game from them that clearly was not new .
negative	they sold it as a new game and what they sent was an original disc that had been refurbished and put in a non - original dvd case .
negative	i complained about this .
negative	all they advised was that i send it back to them for a refund .
negative	they ignored my comments about the game not being new .
negative	mysteriously they never received the game even after 0_weeks and it has not been returned to me .
negative	i clearly_labeled the to and from on the padded_envelope .
negative	i did not have proof of postage and they are using this as an excuse .
negative	i have sent many parcels from my work address and all have been received within a day or two .
negative	deal with them at your own_risk .
negative	i have just had two months of being run around by talk_talk '_s customer_services .
negative	i do not think i have had a worse experience over the airwaves in my life .
negative	i was unable to speak to anyone in england and was continually put through to call_centers in india and south_africa .
negative	no body - but nobody wanted to get a grip of my problem and i was continually passed from pillar to post .
negative	for a company of this size the service was totally_unacceptable and i was tearing my hair out with frustration after weeks of being treated_like a third rate customer .
negative	in the end i had to resort to a rather serious letter to the ceo directly , at which stage i suddenly got what i needed .
negative	a complete disgrace .
negative	couldn_'_t access webmail for several accounts under one domain .
negative	although i hadn_'_t changed the password i thought i would reset the passwords from the control_panel but the credentials i was using wouldn_'_t work .
negative	using the chat support , ' john ' got me access to the control_panel but the mailboxes were not there .
negative	they had been deleted by 000reg hence the error .
negative	apparently i had free mailboxes either as an error or part of some legacy account .
negative	john said :-
negative	" we understand that is not your fault however please_note that this was a system error and the emails used were free of charge instead of paying for them .
negative	we have previously written to advise you that your account exceeded its mailbox quota and that unless addressed , some of your email_addresses would be suspended after 00 days and deleted after 00 "
negative	this is utter_rubbish and i have had no such communication from you either via the post or email .
negative	deleting mailboxes in such a wholesale , carefree manner is unacceptable .
negative	i only have a couple of domains with you but also run a web agency and will be moving mine and all future business away from you .
negative	thanks .
negative	pre ordered limited_edition gibson bill kelliher explorer and securing what was promised to be the first uk distributor to have these with a £_000 . 00 deposit .
negative	several weeks past with no receipt received and no sign of anything .
negative	i called another well_known internet gibson dealer ( starts with a g and ends with a k )
negative	only to find they have them in stock so i asked richtone to refund my deposit and placed the order elsewhere , which was delivered in 00_hours with great customer service as always !
negative	richtone kept saying they had refunded my deposit but have not and have now ceased all communications !
negative	my bank has raised an official_complaint with them in order to try and re coup my losses and they still have not complied or replied to the bank or myself .
negative	do your self a favour and go_elsewhere as my experience of this company is that they are in competent and blatantly lie !
negative	out of pocket by £_000 . 00 with nothing to show - a complete_rip_off !
negative	not much faith in bank either , but thats another story !
negative	ordered some perfume just over two_weeks_ago and am still_waiting .
negative	frames much to big , lenses out of focus . but promised a replacement , free pair immedietly .
negative	if any of the " customer service " personnel worked face to face with the public they would be punched in the mouth for sure .
negative	i spent £_000 on an all - in - one pc and paid for nominated day delivery .
negative	it never arrived .
negative	i had to chase them constantly over the next couple of days to be told " it was despatched from our supplier 00_minutes ago " yeah_right !
negative	when it did eventually arrive the machine constantly rebooted with a " error 0000 no os ( operating_system )".
negative	i again chased for days for a return number which when eventually it arrived , brazenly stated that i would have to pay £_00 to have the pile of garbage returned .
negative	unbelievable .
negative	i phoned them and was told in no uncertain_terms either pay or leave it where it is .
negative	this place gives internet trading a bad name and to think comet went_bust trying to compete against these ill - mannered thieves .
negative	at_least comet knew what customer service was .
negative	i was in the market for a few pc '_s for my business but their attitude has probably lost them £ 0 , 000 in sales .
negative	to the directors of laptops direct - you need to do an " undercover boss " episode .
negative	to prospective_customers - do yourself a favour go and soil your underwear , you '_ll have much more fun !!
negative	oh and i too think 0_star is too much but it '_s the minimum .
negative	i ordered a chain catcher .
negative	it was showing as available on the website .
negative	i waited a week and had not received the chain catcher or any email to say that they could not fulfil the order .
negative	i then phoned up - had a really helpful guy_who did not deal with internet orders who said that the system showed one as being in stock , but he could not find it in stock .
negative	he then got someone_else to phone me up .
negative	this other person said that they did not have it in stock and i was told that it was on order , but they didn_'_t know when it would be in and they would send it then .
negative	i asked why no - one had contacted me to tell me that they could not fulfil my order and why i had to do the chasing and they didn_'_t really have an answer .
negative	i wouldn_'_t normally leave a negative response like this - most shops try hard , but for an_automated_response to be sent out like this to a dissatisfied customer smacks of clumsiness !
negative	the lack of choice in the shoes i chose , ie size and colour .
negative	ordering and delivery simple and efficient .
negative	but what was really annoying , after receiving the shoes , i received an e_- mail from ecco saying the same shoes were now half price !
negative	thanks ecco ???
negative	?
negative	ordered from gap .
negative	said delivered when never did .
negative	other times just throw over fence .
negative	hardly secure delivery .
negative	spent 0000 pounds in their belfast store , bought alot of stuff , they were very helpful and the prices were good .
negative	a small internal crack developed in the screen of my 00_inch tv after 0 months .
negative	they sent it to panasonic who said it wasnt a manufacturing_fault .
negative	a richer_sounds engineer looked at photos of the crack rang me and said i must have hit it with something .
negative	i told hold him the crack was internal and that it was obviously not from something hitting it .
negative	there are several cases of this sort of screen cracking online .
negative	i offered to go 00 / 00 on getting an independant engineer to evaulaute they refused and ignored all my calls and letters thereafter .
negative	i was forced to pay for an independant assessment myself , i then was forced to go to small_claims court to which they didnt_turn_up .
negative	a judgement was made against them by the judge for the full_amount and now after the period for reasonable payment expires tomorrow i am forced to go and get the judgement enforced and the courts will recover the money on my behalf from them .
negative	so moral of the story they are good sales people but if anything_goes_wrong its a different_story .
negative	shame i have to go to this extreme after spending alot of money in their store .
negative	i ordered my flowers for the 0th on the website .
negative	i got emails_telling_me they had been delivered to the address on the 0th .
negative	so i called the person_who was due for the flowers to be delivered and she said she hadn_'_t received them which spoilt the surprise .
negative	so i called the helpline and was told although it was showing on the system they had been delivered they were still due to be delivered some time between 0 - 0 on the 0th as originally ordered .
negative	then i had a call off the person i ordered the flowers off that the next door_neighbour had been delivered them an had brought them round .
negative	a day early .
negative	i won_'_t be using the service again as the whole surprise was ruined .
negative	i would also like a refund but don_'_t want to go through the process of wasting my phone bill again staying on the phone for ages talking to a foreign call_centre who doesn_'_t understand what i '_m saying or can '_t actually decide_whether the flowers were delivered or not .
negative	00 days to deliver 0 product due to a " new system "?
negative	jokers !
negative	no wonder mp are getting a bad rep
negative	my shirt arrived damaged .
negative	super fit .
negative	but a smear tear on the chest on the fold line .
negative	sent pictures showing the damage .
negative	0 days_later a response , no pic .
negative	sent pic by email .
negative	0 days_later , response quizzing for more info .
negative	0 days_later , response asking to send it back .
negative	too much effort .
negative	total_waste of my time .
negative	ffs , why not just send me a new shirt immediately after my first contact ?
negative	wish i knew about this reviews before
negative	i '_m so feed up with talktalk , they are from far the worst internet supplier i ever had !!
negative	!
negative	last time on support i was so upset and i even was told that is not so easy to leave them , they were very rude !
negative	i always had problems with talktalk , very slow_speeds , videos are almost_impossible to load in peak time , but that is not a big problem as i use internet for work and i don_'_t need to load videos , internet keeps shuting down and then reconnects , it '_s problem after problem and now the smarphones are getting problems to connect too , 0 phones here ( s0 ) always struggling to connect , they keep saying getting ip adress or disabled , i check the router setting panel and there '_s no option like energy_saving so why is the router shutting_down wireless , everybody here already knows where the reset_button just to make you a picture
negative	honestly i was so fine with bt but then i gave them a go , just to save me some money but will not call them again , they keep send me from one department to another , and the computer technicians know less_than me ... the problem is the router i told them but i '_m not allowed to upgrade , right ... but new customers have half the price and better routers ... that '_s nice
negative	i was told that if i call bt they will help me to switch back to them , calling tomorrow .. . maybe after new year , i '_m used to ahve a bad service for a few_years so i can hold 0 more weeks
negative	bye_bye talktalk , you should take care of your old customers , that '_s should be your main policy , not just attract and attract more contracts honestly stay_away
negative	booked & paid for a mobile appointment - received a call next_day to say we cant make it .
negative	then said it will be up to 0 days before i get my refund .
negative	dont take payment until you are sure you can provide the service kwik_fit
negative	i ordered some products for my birds but they have not arrived after 0_weeks .
negative	i have been trying to use the live_chat , the telephone_number and sending messages .
negative	i have had no reply from any of these systems .
negative	i am about to make a complaint to paypal .
negative	i wish i had checked this site first , i don_'_t know how this company is staying in business .
negative	placed a £_00 order for christmas_gifts ( ready made stockings ).
negative	several days_later i received an email_saying the order had been shipped .
negative	a few_days after that i logged_into my account and the order status was strangely " awaiting shipping ".
negative	this morning , almost two_weeks after_placing the order i called them ( had to get the number of their parent_company from saynoto0000 . com as they don_'_t publish a phone number ) and was told the order was being sent back to them as the courier couldn_'_t find our address ( my work address which gets about 00 deliveries a day ).
negative	the only thing offered was a refund and they were not willing to re - ship .
negative	they couldn_'_t even tell me which courier firm they had used .
negative	i '_m now having to go into our local town and shop for these gifts at various different shops which is a pain as i don_'_t have much spare time .
negative	i would not use hawkins bazaar or any of their other_websites again and would not recommend to others .
negative	set_up direct_debit with tesco credit_card in april for full monthly payment .
negative	got interest added on in may and june statement .
negative	got interest credit back immediately , after costly 0000 phone_call to tesco credit_card call_centre .
negative	cancel my direct_debit today .
negative	never pay tesco credit_card using direct_debit facility .
negative	their system is flawed .
negative	when applying , there is no clear warning such as ,” you will receive a message on your xxxcard statement when your direct_debit has_been set_up .
negative	until then , please continue to pay your account in the usual way .”
negative	the direct_debit guarantee stipulates ,
negative	if you request tesco bank to collect a payment , confirmation of the amount and date will be given to you at the time of the request .
negative	even_though in my may statement : your nominated_bank_account will be debited with the full balance on 00 / 00 /_0000 or soon after .
negative	to my horror , in my june statement , i still have £ 0 . 00 interest added on for not paying on time previously .
negative	just received my phone bill today , £ 0 . 00 ex - vat to tesco credit_card call_centre .
negative	in may £ 0 . 00 ex - vat to tesco credit_card call_centre .
negative	one week_ago i notified virgin_mobile that my mobile_phone did not receive any signal in my local area .
negative	one week on , the problem has not been solved .
negative	however , i have discovered that 0g_network is working fine .
negative	cheeky virgin_mobile has quietly reduced my mobile signal in my local area to 0g , while many of their competitors have upgraded to 0g for their networks .
negative	yesterday my online_banking was blocked .
negative	reluctantly i phoned santander ’_s helpline to unblock it .
negative	their helpline number , 0000 , cost me money .
negative	to my horror , a credit agency , experian , used by santander has not been informed that i was a santander customer .
negative	another excuse came up by santander fraudulent department was that i recently changed my mobile_phone .
negative	when i challenged the definition of the word , ' recently ', and they said anything up to 0 months .
negative	so , i immediately reminded them that new and better smart phones coming out every few_months .
negative	anyhow , i have got a 000 current account , paying £ 0 monthly_fee .
negative	so it seems that not only i have to pay a regular monthly_fee for a current account , but also i need to pay extra phone bill .
negative	however , i have demanded a refund of £ 0 .
negative	the refund of £ 0 would just cover the cost of phoning their helpline department .
negative	it covers neither the cost of santander providing a poor service , nor feeling of humiliation , embarrassment and helplessness suffered by me .
negative	done my first order online with ocado .
negative	their computer is a bit_strange .
negative	i bought 0 colgate toothpaste and 00 pronamel toothpaste .
negative	ocado computer could not distinguish the two toothpaste when both were doing promotion .
negative	the helpline is not helpful .
negative	so i have cancelled my order within the hour , and no more online shopping with ocado for me .
negative	cannot provide the service they claim to - do not use at all costs
negative	ordered the tyre , it came back via e_- mail as run_flat for a bmw , the legends at the side of the tyre have a bmw logo and rf , means nothing if no information about the product is not clear , the fact that it was for a mercedes might have given suplier a clue .
negative	i phoned the specialist advisor , not at desk but did phone back .
negative	i explained the problem to be told " you have ordered the wrong tyre , i acepted a cheaper tyre , no confirmation of refund .
negative	on fitting the wheels were over tightened , and the tyre under inflated , air_gun as usual .
negative	cheaper in kwick_fit by £ 0 . 00 , not a big issue , as this was a partner of csma it should have been a bit cheaper .
negative	not convinced that i will use them again , as i have in the past .
negative	i placed an order on july 0th 0000 for 0 pairs of work trousers and a pair of knee_pads , everything that has happened to shaun happened the same to me .
negative	they answered my call once ( after 0_weeks ) and promised delivery within the next 0 days , i am still_waiting on 0th_september .
negative	i would never use this company again .
negative	and i have requested a full_refund , i will get my work trousers from krowmark embroidery .
negative	i have just left another message on their answer phone asking them to get back to me , i doubt they will but it ’_s worth a try .
negative	it looks_like i will have to take this down the legal route
negative	in common with the majority of others , you must avoid this company , i have waited 0 months now for an accurate bill that reflects my usage .
negative	i had smart_meters installed sadly they were not .
negative	i had them taken out and replaced with ' dummy ' meters but am still being sent estimated_bills that relate to the smart_meters removed 0 months_ago .
negative	i am now in dispute with the company and while the dispute is ongoing i am building up arrears ( which is worrying )
negative	i have asked for compensation and been advised that compensation would not normally be discussed mid - dispute .
negative	i have contacted the ombudsman .
negative	unbelievably i am reluctant to switch suppliers because for me , given my postcode , first_utility remains on a cost basis , the cheapest .
negative	however sometimes cost is not the only factor !
negative	!
negative	the worst shopping_experience i have ever had .
negative	i ordered one bouquet of flowers with a card and i was charged for 0 which ended_up being £_00 more .
negative	when i tried to amend the order and later cancel it i couldn_'_t get in touch with anyone as they don_'_t have a phone number and the e_mail page wouldn_'_t work .
negative	when i finally got a response the flowers had already been delivered and they refused to acknowledge my complaint .
negative	absolutely discussing .
negative	i have received a faulty product , appliances direct are now ignoring my messages to them .
negative	next step , as i paid by amazon , is to get them to sort this out or refund me , if not its trading_standards and the small_claims court .
negative	i '_ve been disgusted with their service and most_importantly their attitude .
negative	flowers sent on wrong day
negative	charged for delivery when the website said free delivery
negative	won_'_t reply to emails
negative	only plus_side were flowers were beautiful , on saying that , i '_ll never use you again as i '_m totally_disgusted with the service !
negative	the last two products i bought were faulty .
negative	i have ordered regain extra strength ttripple pack numerous time and the last two products the pump action spray stopped_working before the first bottle was used .
negative	this meant i could not get the correct application .
negative	total disappointment
negative	first they sent a text to my wife saying that the delivery would be here “... anytime_between_0am and 00 . 00_hours ”.
negative	that is a 00_hours window for a company claiming in their site that they will give a 0 hour_window for delivery .
negative	of course they never came .
negative	my wife changed the address , to make it easier and , again , received a text stating the time of delivery that , again , never happened .
negative	vodafone is about to loose a contract because of dpd as the parcel was suppose to arrive in the morning of 00st oct . and is now 0pm of the 00nd and there is no trace of anything .
negative	do not use this website .
negative	they have taken a lot of peoples money and do not send you any keys .
negative	they never reply to any support chat or support emails .
negative	they are a fraud and are stealing peoples money .
negative	stay_away !!!!!!!!!!

negative	i purchased xbox_points for my son on monday jan 00st , these were to be sent immediately by email , by 00 . 00am the next_day having heard_nothing i telephoned gamesbite and was assured by a young_man that my order was being_processed , by 0 . 00pm still no response so back on the phone this time i was told they would be with me within the hour , 0 hour later still no xbox_points and surprise the office was now closed .
negative	0 . 00am the next_day i receive an email to say my payment was accepted but still no xbox_points .
negative	finally after 0 telephone_calls and 0 unanswered_emails and nearly 0 days waiting my points arrive at by midday .
negative	i would not recommend this company and will_certainly never use again .
negative	use at your_peril !
negative	!
negative	my email is lataslawomir @_yahoo . com i buy bancho set more than month_ago stil i heven '_t them i didn_'_t get any delivery notis so you now is not delivered or samone taket .
negative	many_thanks i just lost 00 £
negative	i have paid £_00 for a cd booklet size photo_book .
negative	the quality was extremely bad and the £ 0 postage for something that was sent 0nd_class in an envelope was ridicolous .
negative	price aside rltge qualuty was awful .
negative	the worst one i had so_far .
negative	i '_ve ordered twice_now and both orders were delivered incomplete .
negative	first order placed they forgot to deliver the grout , second order they forgot to deliver the tile spacers .
negative	both_times the job was delayed at cost to my business .
negative	when you go into a shop , you see what your going to buy .
negative	on - line , you have to rely_on a picture and hope the integrity of the company honour your choice .
negative	they didn_'_t .
negative	ordered 0no .
negative	0 phase mcb '_s from the website , received the confirmation_email and the money left my account all £_000 of it .
negative	i went to the website to chase up the order and find out that they have ceased_trading .
negative	thanks for ripping me off !!!!
negative	!
negative	these_people are frauds - do not buy from them !!!
negative	be warned they are trading on amazon and not shipping out items but taking the money !
negative	they trade under cresentdirect on amazon - you have been_warned
negative	for the second time this year i begrudgingly placed an order with the hut , the item was showing as in stock and despatch within 00_hours .
negative	after waiting a few_days and no arrival i logged on to my account to check the order status and for the second time my order has_been cancelled without informing_me .
negative	it seems to me that this company either has very little stock of items it advertises or they blatantly don_'_t exist .
negative	i will not order from here again and that includes their other site zavvi .
negative	couldn_'_t up load the pic i needed give in gave up keep my money u need it more than me
negative	i ordered 00mm golfball bulbs but received 00mm bulbs so not impressed .
negative	i left a 0_star_review for nigel_o ' hara after my awful experience shopping ( if that '_s what i can call it ) with them .
negative	it was taken down within hours by the company for no proof of purchase .
negative	i have noticed that there are now several reviews that have been taken down for the same reason , funnily_enough , none of the fake 0_star reviews have been taken down .
negative	i replied to you the next_day with a pdf of my order confirmation and a week and a bit later my review is still not live and i have heard_nothing from you .
negative	i have also contacted your support email address about a rather concerning matter regarding fake_reviews being added to your site for this company because nigel_o ' hara were running competitions on their facebook_page whereby the only way to enter was to leave a positive review on your site .
negative	i am not sure this practise is even legal !?
negative	but once again , i have heard_nothing from you .
negative	what else am i supposed to do to get in contact with you ?
negative	very disappointed in the customer service i have received from yourselves !
negative	i ordered a watch for my wife '_s birthday .
negative	it stated on their website , delivery within 0 - 0 days which wasn_'_t a problem .
negative	however , i didn_'_t expect 0 months later to still not have received my item .
negative	i had to contact them on a weekly_basis as they never contacted me bar 0 phone_calls basically telling_me that they were still_waiting for the item from their supplier .
negative	every week i had the same message back " we apologise for the delay , we expect the item to be with you by next week ".
negative	that happened for just over two and a half months !!
negative	what shocked me the most is that i arranged them to contact me regarding my order about a month and a half after_placing it and he just repeated what was in the emails they were sending .
negative	i asked what was causing the delay and they told me that they couldn_'_t tell me , i then asked if they had been in contact with the supplier and the gentleman '_s response was " no , we don_'_t normally do that with slight delays ".
negative	so not only had they given me the same copy and paste response each week , they hadn_'_t even chased the item with the supplier and had the audacity to say that a month and a half was a slight_delay .
negative	they offered me , actually , no they didn_'_t ... i asked for a small discount as a way of an_apology and they asked me if i wanted to change my order to another item .
negative	due to the massive two and a half month wait and the disgusting customer service , i decided to change my order to a different watch .
negative	low and behold , they didn_'_t have this one in stock either , i waited a couple of weeks and had no contact from nigel_o ' hara , not even an email to let_me know they had placed a new order for me .
negative	by this point , i had had enough and cancelled my order .
negative	during this entire time , they were still accepting orders on the watch i ordered which is what i find most disturbing .
negative	how can a company take orders for an item they evidentially don_'_t have and obviously have no way of obtaining .
negative	even as i write this now , they are still taking orders on the watch and it '_s still out of stock !
negative	how many other people must be going through the same thing as me ?
negative	so to round off , this is the worse shopping_experience i have ever had !
negative	i can '_t express how bad the customer service was with just the same generic email being sent to me each week and not telling_me anything .
negative	i asked them several_times if they didn_'_t think they were going to get the item in stock to let_me know so i could cancel the order and order elsewhere , but each week they promised me it would be with me the following week .
negative	a terrible_terrible company and i would stay as far away from them as possible !
negative	just to add , it '_s been 0_weeks since them promising my refund within 00_hours and i have still not received it even after_contacting them .
negative	in my opinion , they ' re actually fraudulent .
negative	i have had so many issues , and have found their support to be absolutely_terrible .
negative	as said previously , they ' re a benchmark for how badly a company can run .
negative	i have paid two years in advance , and have never managed to get a refund !
negative	ordered many items over bank_holiday and reserved online , said to collect on sunday 00 / 0 / 00 , however store closed when i arrived . so i then went and placed order online only to find now my account debited and no items received , they gave very poor_excuse saying " problems with web orders " be warned do not purchase from the homebase website . will now be taking up refund to my card thru my credit_card provider , simply unacceptable customer service .
negative	hi ordered 0000 premium business_cards , sent 0 emails no replies at all , only automated receipt emails . paid nearly_£_000 and used 00_%_discount_code and free_postage but was charged postage and no discount was applied , tried several emails to customer service and no replies received . regards shaun jackson . excelarate driving school .
negative	i had the misfortune on an offer from photobox , spent 0 hours on web , trying to upload_photos for calender , speaking on chat numerous_times with tracie currie , poor customer service as saying will not upload_photos from google chromebook ? saying i need to try different computer . well surely i am not going to buy another computer when i have new chromebook and there systemscare not up to date , very unproffesional service , avoid at all costs .
negative	phoned up for simple fridge hinge , no replies for 0 hours , then phoned to to clarify and they were emailing someone_else on totally different email address , very confused as to whether the part for my bosch_fridge was the correct_part despite all info given to them on the product number , so to this end went online to another company part , ordered within minutes and £_00 cheaper , so i would say avoid this company .
negative	ordered flowers they use yodel courier , never arrived on day promised . then receive arrogant call from customer_services can say can arrive up to 0pm that night , will reclaim from from card provider , definately not recommended , avoid plenty of other great websites ?
negative	i ordered online a number of shirts spent_nearly_£_000 however it says online buy one get one free , customer serivces not so unless you add two items to basket , absolutely_ridiculous when clearly the web updates to 0 items for each item , then you receive only one . they then offered me a measley 00_%_off next purchase but i lose 00_% of my order as no free items , very rude customer_services on online_chat and never answer phones . avoid this company be warned shop elsewhere online read all below negative_reviews . digraceful .
negative	hi ordered items in one order 0 items despite going into store after receiving email to say to collect on two items arrived , rude staff instore and online help unbelievable poor , like trying to contact india , in short close your online account . dont_bother with debenhams much far_superior customer service on the high_street
negative	so i placed an order before 0pm on the 00th , the postal option i chose was next_day .
negative	it should of been here on the 00st .
negative	it still hasnt arrived .
negative	im starting to think that the item will never arrive and that i just wasted my money on buying things from a website that , after inquiring_about the order , basically turned round and said ' thanks for your money , now f_** k off '.
negative	they have made no attempt at trying to sort it out , all they done was took the canadian way out by saying sorry then leaving without and reasoning .
negative	then the c_** ts had the nerve to say ' hopefully next time you shop with us , you '_ll choose tracked ' lets just wind back here , they made no effort to sort it out , just told me to leave , didnt even offer anything for complimentary purposes , no cash_back , no free item .
negative	so please tell me why the f_** k would i shop with thrm again ?
negative	yeah sure , let_me just give you more money !
negative	whats that ?
negative	i wont get the item ?
negative	oh no , ah well maybe this time after_placing an order of 000 quids_worth ... oh no they just bought the staff all coffees .
negative	seriously though , at_least give a rats arse about your customers .
negative	they clearly have no concept of what an unhappy customer is nor how to deal with one .
negative	they ' re idiots that cant even offer you something so that you dont go bad mouthing them ... well , i just did .
negative	maybe next time you '_ll sort your customer_care out you lazy care free self righteous excuse for a shop .
negative	i '_ll leave ya with this one in hopes that one of your staff are required to read these reviews , would you shop with choscards after_reading how i was treated ?
negative	lets put it in to an analogue , you ' re walking down the road having a nice day , when this guy just comes and takes all your money , now you had quite abit on you because you just withdrew it to pay off some debt ... so all that money is now gone , youll never see it again .
negative	but the next_day comes and you see your best mate talking to him and having a laugh talking_about how much money they just made .
negative	how would that make you feel ?
negative	do you see where im coming from ?
negative	now ask yourself , would you shop with them again ?
negative	this company are worse than terrible to deal with .
negative	i am continually plagued with a poor internet_connection , 0g is hopeless on my mobile , and their on - line e_- mail service is worse than useless .
negative	when calling their customer_services i am always put through to some poor chap in india that doesn_'_t have the slightest idea what i am saying , never mind me him !
negative	one star is far too generous
negative	waited over 0_weeks for an order that was supposed to be available from stock .
negative	after numerous e_- mails to play '_s customer service i was still unable to secure a delivery date .
negative	what infuriated me even more was the fact they were still advertising the product with a 0 to 0 day delivery time !
negative	their e_- mail response was even worse , with a standard generic_reply received each and every time !
negative	needless to say i will never use play . com again .
negative	i was about to but a washer from ao . com , very attractive price , but here '_s the rub .
negative	to get an evening delivery £_00 . 00
negative	to get removal of old washer £ 0 . 00
negative	to get disconnect of old machine £ 0 . 00
negative	to install new machine £_00 . 00
negative	this is the extra_cost of £_00 . 00 suddenly not so attractive , some argos offers include all this for free so looks_like my business is going to argos .
negative	also argos offer 00 month interest free credit using their argos_card .
negative	why don_'_t you do this ao . com
negative	had a thief smash my window this afternoon , i called my insurance who said i must use autoglass .
negative	i called them at 0000 today , they suggested they would call to fix tonight between 0000 and 0000 .
negative	this is a totally_unreasonable .
negative	i told them not to bother !!!
negative	! they really dont have a proper out of hours service be warned if you use them they cant really care offering stupid times like that .
negative	i have used this service before and had a good service but not this time .
negative	i called them 00_mins before i arrived at manchester terminal 0 only to be told we are very busy as this time and you will have to wait 00 - 00_mins outise the terminal .
negative	i mean they know we are coming and at wha time .
negative	the police were not impressed .
negative	they dont like you wating more than a few minutes .
negative	when we got back this morning i was told we are very busy and only have one driver and you are 0rd in the queue .
negative	i waited 00_mins at 0000 this moring in the cold .
negative	when i called them they were verty rude .
negative	they also had clocked up over 00 miles on my car so not so impressed this time .
negative	i bought some verifocals in may 0000 and had them within a week .
negative	they were not comfortable so i tried to get a refund as their policy .
negative	however , they don_'_t tell you that they will not refund for lenses which is most of the cost .
negative	i ended_up ordering a new pair with a partial_refund for the frames and paying the cost of the lenses again .
negative	it took_ages to get these back and they did not have the reactions lenses nor the polarizing lenses i had paid for .
negative	i sent them back again and eventually_settled for a partial_refund and to them sent back as they were , as it was now three_months since my first purchase and i was not willing to wait any longer .
negative	i booked online to have my exhaust checked and when i turned_up , the man at the garage was very rude and said i didn_'_t have an appointment because i hadn_'_t phoned .
negative	nowhere did it say i had to phone when booking .
negative	he then checked their computer system to see that the booking was on and he discovered that it was .
negative	no apology , just another tirade about no - one had phoned him .
negative	i felt_like walking out and going elsewhere !
negative	he said to drive the car in and he ' d have a look , which he duly did after 00_minutes or so .
negative	the he gave_me a quote which was £_00 more than the quote i ' d been given at my local_garage .
negative	i said no thanks .
negative	i won_'_t be using them again !
negative	my 00 year_old father has had a pride 0 mph scooter for some years which has_been excellent in operation for him .
negative	however now he has stopped driving a car , he asked me to source a small 0 mph scooter suitable for taking onto a bus .
negative	in doing some_research i came_across proridermobility . com .
negative	their website says all the right things i . e “ as seen on bbc top gear ”,_“ famous reputation by providing the highest_level of customer service and after sales service in the land ”,_“ priority to any sale is the peace of mind which the customer can have ” and “ 0_star back up service and warranty second to none ”.
negative	these self ( deluded ) awarded references are , in my opinion , completely false and very misleading as i will now tell .
negative	as there are size / specification restrictions for taking a scooter onto public_transport , i telephoned pro_rider and spoke to [_name_] in sales to get advice on a suitable model .
negative	i explained what was required and for what purpose and on her advice , i decided on the pro_rider elite portable scooter at £_000 . 00 as she said it was certainly fit for purpose required .
negative	the scooter arrived in packaging that needed to be cut open to gain_access .
negative	fully charged my father took the scooter 00 yards along the pavement in his cul - de - sac , so he could cross a small side road with drop kerbs .
negative	the scooter went down the first drop kerb ok but ground to a complete halt when trying to get up the opposite drop kerb .
negative	now this is a perfectly normal low gradient ( 0 : 00 ) drop kerb but this scooter was unable to drive up it !!
negative	my father was then stuck on the scooter which was firmly stuck having grounded itself on its two stabiliser wheels !
negative	incidentally my father weighs 00 stone so not exactly heavy .
negative	i then tried the same manoeuvre taking a faster run up but the same thing happened to me – stuck with no ability to go back or forward !!
negative	in order to get it to move again , i had to get off it and drag it back ( which my father on his own would not manage ) onto level ground and drive 00 yards back to his garage and park it up .
negative	totally not fit for purpose – utterly_useless !
negative	my father agreed with me that the scooter be returned with an explanation as to why it was not fit for purpose and request a full_refund as this was only 0 days after delivery .
negative	i rang and spoke to another sales staff_member [_name ], who said the scooter “ should ” be ok for the intended use .
negative	i said it was not and said we wanted to reject it and could they arrange to collect it .
negative	no was the answer they would not !
negative	i asked if the carrier they used to deliver it could be contacted to help and i was told no again .
negative	we would have to re - pack it and get it to them ourselves .
negative	i therefore packed it myself and arranged for a courier at a cost to us of £_00 . 00 to deliver it back to proridermobility . com
negative	a few_days_later proridermobility . com wrote back to say they had received the scooter back in a dirty and damaged condition !
negative	i then rang their general_manager , a man called [_name ].
negative	he claimed that the damage was sufficient that they would take £_000 off the price paid .
negative	i asked for photos as i said that the scooter was clean and had only been ridden for a few yards .
negative	the photos he sent were not very good but showed a couple of scuffs marks – not £_000 worth of damage !!!
negative	about a week_later my father got a partial_refund of £_000 . 00 .
negative	so we ended_up with a lot of aggravation , wasted hours of our time which we paid £_000 for !!!
negative	.... and still had no scooter .
negative	i feel very let_down by this experience with proridermobility . com so before you buy from them rather_than another supplier be warned !!!
negative	on my experience they are a company who are happy to take your money but when things turn out like those we experienced they don_’_t want to know or help and will then find a way to not refund in full .
negative	good points : absolutely none at all .
negative	negative points :
negative	0 .
negative	£_000 is low and it shows in the quality of the prorider scooter which is low grade in design & finish .
negative	0 .
negative	the performance was appalling not able to go up the smallest of gradients .
negative	0 .
negative	the shopping_basket had such a poor fitting it fell_off at the first small bump in the pavement .
negative	0 .
negative	proridermobility . com are not a customer service focused company – by any stretch .
negative	we both feel extremely let_down by this awful experience with proridermobility .
negative	my advice is to read_reviews carefully before_deciding what and who to buy from .
negative	perhaps a safer and even better option when buying a mobility_scooter is to go to a local retailer rather_than buying something untried online from a company who could lead to the type of problems we encountered .
negative	you should then be able to test_drive and make a satisfactory purchase .
negative	this is what we ended_up doing and my father is delighted with the small shoprider monaco scooter bought from the well stocked retailer ‘ the mobility shop ’ in west moors , ferndown , dorset .
negative	this scooter performs really well and incidentally has no problem getting up the same drop - kerb the prorider failed at .
negative	he has now made his first trip taking it on the bus with ease .
negative	i expected my review to end on this more positive_note but i ’_m sorry to say it does not !!
negative	having posted my review at the beginning of january_0000 , my father received a telephone_call out of the blue from the general_manager at proridermobility .
negative	he claimed that the review was libelous and said they were considering legal_action !!
negative	my father told_him that the review could not be libellous as it was the truth .
negative	a little while later he rang my father again to say that he had now spoken to his staff and he now had a truthful understanding of the situation .
negative	( did that mean the scooter we had returned was not even the dirty , damaged one they had previously referred to ?!)
negative	they were now prepared to offer my father £_000 .
negative	my father told_him he was happy with that .
negative	however they would only do this on the condition that i remove the review i had posted and ceased to post anymore .
negative	the gm wanted to speak to me which we did the next_day .
negative	he agreed with me that my review was not made in haste and was thought through well but reiterated the conditional offer .
negative	i explained why i felt that they should be to cover the consequential loss of expenses and compensate me for the day off i had to take and the 000 mile_round_trip to sort this out .
negative	i said an additional £_000 was more than fair .
negative	as it was not his decision he said he would get back to me .
negative	but he never did !
negative	some days_later my father received two emails a few_days apart_from mr simon_betts managing_director of proridermobility full of incorrect statements but saying that as communication had broken down they were taking_legal_proceedings and considering contacting the police regarding my review !!!!
negative	i decided enough was enough and wrote to the md mr simon_betts of proridermobility as this was a complete nonsense and i did not take kindly to the bullying_tactics of this md simon_betts .
negative	i spent a considerable time and effort to spell out all the inaccuracies in his ridiculous email .
negative	in return i got a email back from mr simon_betts spouting more rubbish but the threats had now got serious .
negative	mr simon_betts was now accusing me of blackmail and threatening to sue for “ substantial damages ” as i had not removed my review !!!
negative	some 0_weeks_later i have not heard a thing from their solicitors or the police or mr simon_betts .
negative	to say all of this fiasco and accusations has vexed me would be an_understatement .
negative	i have no_intention of being bullied into removing my review as it is 000_% accurate and the deplorable way my father and i have been treated is exactly why the review will remain live .
negative	do not buy from proridermobility . com they are awful and their product is too .
negative	unacceptable delivery and no per warning advice ...
negative	i switched my electricity_supply from scottish_power to isupply energy on 00 november .
negative	i have been chasing scottish_power ever_since to , first , accept my final meter_readings , second , close my account and refund £_000 . 00 .
negative	meter_readings finally accepted on 00 november , but account is still open and no refund cheque issued .
negative	looks_like a deliberate series of delays to me .
negative	heading_says it all .
negative	think_twice before buying .
negative	it is not bright and beautiful as on the web_page , it is the total_opposite .
negative	very dull , boring and depressing colours .
negative	never again order online paid for saterday delivery waited all day nothing , then suspect postman stole on monday then about 00_hours of emails and calls to talk to someone sensible that refunded
negative	terrible communications .
negative	no delivery .
negative	awful .
negative	my order was not processsed for a week , when i queried this the customer suport rep told me " oh i will need to check with the warehouse , i don_'_t think they got the email "
negative	when the order was eventually dispatched it was incomplete , no one informed me that i would not receive two items .
negative	shoddy website , shoddy service , i will never use them again .
negative	recently_purchased a pair of north_face tent mules which were unfortunately the wrong_size . i paid the £ 0 to return them and asked for a pair which their website showed were in stock . some 00 days_later i received a message_saying i have had a refund , no contact from the company offering me any alternative which the website is still showing they have stock of . so at the end of the day i have paid out £ 0 in postage which is not refunded and have no tent mules , which i am sure they still have in stock , no communication , nothing . poor .
negative	thy are just a fraud company .
negative	be - careful .
negative	don_'_t trust them .
negative	they will take your money and will not answer you .
negative	i purchased some electronic_cigarettes how ever money taken in july and to this date nothing in post and the company who was posting told me when i asked why delay apparently waiting for goods from china weeks go by nothing same excuse and then ring again bizarrely now no one answers .
negative	i look at their web_page and strangely_enough they are on a fourth_floor in a building in london .
negative	contact voucher and they say give them 00hours to respond blah_blah .
negative	well i would not buy from them if they gave a holiday for £_00 .
negative	all i want is a refund .
negative	basically dont be conned like me .
negative	i checked that the item was available in stock before placing order .
negative	after a delay , and having sent in my scrip , i was then told the item would not be in stock for a further week !
negative	ie ten days after_placing my order .
negative	i shall not be using pharmacy0u again .
negative	my bad_experience contains all the usual problems you get with yodel .
negative	the waiting in all day , watching the fictional tracking on line , being told it has_been delivered by amazon when it hasn_'_t , being told about attempted delivery by yodel when there was no attempted delivery [ cctv to back me up on this ] delivery driver saying he ' could not gain_access ' when i actually spoke to him inside my building asking him where my parcel was on the same day he supposedly could not gain_access - and he , unbelievably , smiling and laughing and saying the next driver will bring it .
negative	he never did bring it .
negative	never has a company made my blood boil so much and got me so worked up as this diabolical entity that i feel so strongly that i need to warn all others about the nature of this hideous beast .
negative	the fact is that i preordered my ps0 over a month in advance with guaranteed delivery before_xmas ( guaranteed mind you !)
negative	with amazon .
negative	amazon were almost as useless as yodel telling_me to just be patient and to wait .
negative	i was told a number of things by amazon , such as it will_definitely be delivered in the next 00_hours , 00_hours absolute max ( i was told that twice by two_separate amazon people on different days .
negative	i was told there would be an investigation a couple of times .
negative	what i was told the most was ' i understand '.
negative	that really started to hack me off .
negative	' i understand mr ...., i understand '.
negative	of course you understand .
negative	there is nothing difficult here to understand !
negative	i am not trying to convey to you the finer intricacies of quantum mechanics .
negative	we are both speaking the same language .
negative	stop telling_me you understand !
negative	i will automatically assume you have understood , amazon , now go away and do something with this new found understanding you have .
negative	go and get my parcel delivered for instance , that would be a good start .
negative	that '_s all i want .
negative	not too much to ask , is it ?
negative	i waited and waited .
negative	the whole exasperating experience has left me so frustrated , i am struggling to write this review .
negative	i do not need this stress in my life .
negative	i hadn_'_t done anything wrong , all i had done was order from amazon and paid straight_away .
negative	why did i deserve to get treated in this terrible manner ?
negative	i tried_phoning yodel ( so many_times !)
negative	you soon realize what a pointless exercise that is .
negative	still , you have to try don_'_t you ?
negative	a machine asks you what your tracking code is , which is a mixture of letters and numbers and you can have hours of ' fun ' with the voice_recognition software as it guesses what you have said .
negative	even when you say it crystal clearly , it gets it partly right as it repeats it back to you in it '_s mechanical prerecorded voice , but then it throws in a number or letter that sounds nothing like what you had said ( would be funny if it was a comedy sketch , the opposite of funny in real_life ).
negative	when you persevere and it finally repeats it back to you correctly and you confirm it , it replies " i '_m sorry we do not have any information for that tracking_number .
negative	please try our helpful website . goodbye " and then hangs up on you , i kid you not !
negative	the yodel depot is a 00 min drive each way from where i live , and i do not live out in the sticks , i live near birmingham .
negative	desperate to have this nightmare come to an end , i toyed with the idea of going to collect it .
negative	but of course , one does not simply go and collect a parcel from yodel .
negative	oh no .
negative	you have to give yodel 00_hours notice so that they can ' prepare ' your parcel ready for you ( make_sure it '_s looking it '_s best and what have you , spruce it up ready for it '_s big day , maybe give it a spray with some pleasing scent and tie a nice new red ribbon around it '_s middle ?).
negative	and how , prey tell dear yodel , is one supposed to arrange to collect a parcel in 00_hours time when the robot on the end of the line does not hold any details for your parcel '_s tracking_number and cuts you off ?
negative	if you think i am driving an_hour and a half '_s round_trip just to let you know i '_ll be coming again to make the same trip tomorrow but that time around to collect my parcel , then forget it .
negative	bad enough you don_'_t do the job you are paid for in the first place as it is without expecting me to put myself out to that ridiculous degree .
negative	ha , and yodel ' chat ' online .
negative	you have more chance of winning the lottery than having someone available to ' chat ' with you .
negative	i couldn_'_t believe my eyes when one day i saw that someone was available to chat ( my browser was literately open all day every day tracking my parcel ) i nearly fell over .
negative	so i started to chat to a girl called k **** e from yodel .
negative	everything about the chat took_ages and was as annoying as everything else in this sorry_saga .
negative	she did not answer any of my questions and took a very long time ( i mean 0 mins or more per line ) over each short reply .
negative	fortunately i was sat at a desk all day so she could take as long as she liked as far as i was concerned .
negative	i was determined to see it through to the bitter end .
negative	after confirming my details and parcel '_s tracking_number , she just kept asking what was in the parcel ?
negative	alarm_bells started ringing , " why do you need to know that ?"
negative	i asked her , " you have all my details and tracking_number , why do you need to know what is in the package ?"
negative	she just said the delivery office are asking for this info .
negative	i did tell her in the end as it was obvious the conversation would not progress any further if i did not .
negative	she said someone will be phoning me later the same day .
negative	" really ?"
negative	i said .
negative	" yes , on your mobile .
negative	is that okay ?"
negative	she said .
negative	" yes , fine " i said somewhat dubious as they did not have my mobile_phone number and did not ask for it .
negative	needless to say that phone conversation never happened .
negative	the ' chat ' with k **** e ended with her saying " thanks for contacting yodel , it ’_s been really nice chatting to you .
negative	enjoy the rest of your day ."
negative	trust me when i say the tone was nothing other than pure sarcasm .
negative	i was contacting amazon every day and in the end i just said i want my money back ( which nearly killed me as i had waited so long and invested so much time and emotional energy , and even now at time of writing this 00 / 00 /_0000 ps0 '_s are like gold dust , next to impossible to get hold of ).
negative	finally they came back and told me my parcel was missing in transit ( read ' stolen ') who could have possibly taken it from a yodel delivery office ?
negative	hmmm , i wonder , could it possibly be a yodel employee ?.
negative	i see the yodel delivery driver most days .
negative	he comes to the office i work at .
negative	i would say he ' delivers ' to , but i see precious_little evidence of that .
negative	friday of last_week he pulled up , rummaged around in the back of his_van for a while , moved a few parcels around before getting back in and driving off , making no attempt to make a delivery but no doubt the online tracking would say different .
negative	on the occasions that he does decide to come inside the building he has a big_smile on his face and chuckles as he asks " has your parcel still not turned_up yet ?"
negative	i do not see the funny side .
negative	in a way it was a relief to be told definitively that the parcel would no_longer be coming and to get some sort of closure , the waiting had finally come to end .
negative	the stress of waiting in and trying to get my parcel delivered was making me ill .
negative	in conclusion ,(& kudos to you for reading this far ) it bothers me to see people giving yodel 0_stars on here .
negative	i do not know if it is people who feel sorry for yodel employees or yodel staff themselves writing their own reviews or if it '_s trolls , doing what they do for reasons only known to themselves .
negative	it bothers me because it detracts from all the really really horrible experiences that so very many people are having at the hands of this terrible company .
negative	read the reviews for yourselves .
negative	why would so many people go to the time and trouble to write_reviews on sites like this if they didn_'_t feel so strongly about how badly they have been treated ?
negative	yes of course they handle so many parcels that sooner or later somebody is going to have an okay experience with yodel , but why are so many having to suffer as i have ?
negative	what is wrong with you yodel ?
negative	take a good hard look at yourself and sort yourself out !
negative	it '_s no good telling watchdog and the press that there are no_problems everything is fine .
negative	my experience is not one isolated incident .
negative	your on watchdog for goodness_sake , that should tell you there is something desperately wrong with your company .
negative	stop ignoring the problems and get it sorted !
negative	nowadays i check to see who will be delivering if i '_m considering buying online .
negative	it '_s sad but it '_s a case of having to .
negative	i simply will not buy from anyone that uses_yodel , especially as this is not the first time i have had a bad_experience with them .
negative	if a company does not state which carrier they use then i assume it '_s because they are embarrassed to admit they use yodel and again i won_'_t use them .
negative	p . s .
negative	i just received my brand_new ps0 yesterday .
negative	i used asda direct , click and collect .
negative	paid for it online and collected it from my local_store just up the road the very next_day , as they said it would .
negative	absolutely no_fuss or trouble at all .
negative	i only wish i had done that in the first place .
negative	p . p . s .
negative	lee from yodel , don_'_t even bother mate .
negative	too little way too late .
negative	i won_'_t be emailing you .
negative	i '_ve been through all this and i have had it with yodel so don_'_t act like you are bothered now .
negative	this company is absolutely_useless run by a load of cowboys why people don_'_t use royal_mail more often is beyond me and out of all the alternatives this lot of morons are the worst even worse than yodel would you believe and they are rude with it , if i could give them half a star i would , had i known my amazon order was coming through them i ' d have paid extra for royal_mail , but at_least i know next time , ovoid this company at all costs .
negative	bunch flowers look a lot bigger on webpage , came in a box by dhl they looked like they had been slung around as when i opened box it took me 00_minutes to sort them out before i gave them to my wife .
negative	( everything every where ) thank_god i answered the door and not my wife who i got them for
negative	i purchased my refurbished stated in a0_condition laptop from microdream it arrived well_packed on the day i expected it .
negative	the service from microdream who refurbish laptops is far from good i have set out the problem i have had below
negative	i do know my way around a pc this one came riddled with malware , adware , viruses , spyware you name it had it .
negative	it was a nightmare to get it up and running , in all my years of experience this was the worst infected machine i have ever_seen .
negative	i got rid of 000 with my first attempt later another 000 , followed_by 0 more the following_day , also this machine needed a defrag it was at 00_%
negative	yes it '_s running now but if you know little about pcs be very careful in your choice of company , service comes in many forms if microdream is refurbishing a laptop , that machine should and is expected to be fit for propose which it clearly was not .
negative	i would like to thank trustpilot for letting_me review microdream on their site .
negative	phoned up to confrim that my parcel was out for delivery the next_day after ordering i was told it was tracked as " out for delivery " so i stayed in .
negative	late_afternoon as it had not arrived i phoned again and asked for the tracking_number which they gave_me , but when i tracked the parcel it showed it had not even left the hub in london .
negative	i waisted the best part of the day waiting in as i was given the wrong information about the progress of the parcel .
negative	i phoned again and asked why i had been told it was out for delivery when it was clearly not and i found i was dealing_with one of the most useless rudest company '_s i had ever delt_with .
negative	the guy on the end of the phone kept telling_me no one would have said that to me if it was not the case and refused to let_me speak to a some one higher up in the company .
negative	he kept telling_me that i had made my mind up any way and what was the point of talking to any body else .
negative	i am presuming he was the one that told me it was out for delivery in the first place .
negative	he also kept blaming parcelforce , but my problem was not with parcelforce being late just the fact i was waiting for something that was never going to arrive when i was told to expect it before 0pm .
negative	the website does not show the true condition of the watch ; i order an omega_constellation from watch finders , it was far from the 00 / 00 quality they promised .
negative	they issued me a refund a week_later with a cheque that took another week to clear and to make it up they said we will offer you free_postage when you order again !
negative	i ordered another watch , it was small in size ; obviously links were missing - they did not charge me for postage initially , but when returned for refund , they charged me for postage !
negative	un fair , miss - informed and above all xxx !
negative	you cannot charge for something when you have agreed initially that its for free !
negative	they said they will send a cheque to make up for the postage cost - its been months now and i don_'_t think i should expect anything !
negative	my wife had to renew her passport recently and it arrived ( eventually ) via this excuse for a company .
negative	the driver failed to deliver on day one , unable to operate the doorbell .
negative	so , we visited the website which was unresponsive .
negative	tried again 0 hours_later and eventually re - booked delivery ( they try hard at this point to charge you for accelerating the service ).
negative	passport was delivered the next_day after the driver phoned , again unable to operate the doorbell
negative	well , today we have ( not ) received yet another home office document .
negative	so , back to the website - it tells_me the ticket number and postcode i have entered don_'_t match ( hello ...
negative	i have your card dx group , you were here at this postcode at some point this morning ).
negative	after much messing_around on the phone (" why not pay to accelerate your delivery ...") re - booked for tomorrow .
negative	what is the government thinking_about !
negative	passports , id cards and such like are important_documents , you need them to get on planes and so on .
negative	using this company illustrates just why public services often maintain such a poor public image .
negative	one also wonders , given the nature of what they are delivering whether there is actually intent to get you to pay for delivery ?
negative	got a plane to catch ?
negative	ordered seed spuds for main crop on the 0 rd may , no delivery !
negative	seed spuds ordered 0rd may , 0 complaint emails , ignored by them , and 0 phone_call of 0 , after 0_weeks , yes 0 , second phone_call actually checked up on my order , then tells_me they ran_out , and the order had been cancelled .
negative	thanks a bunch , thats my season planting up the chute isn , t it .
negative	last_year thompson and morgan performed much the same , this year it , s fothergills , whats up with these seed people , are they that arrogant they think they can get away with it ?
negative	treating people as if they dont exist .
negative	lousy firm , non_existent customer service , don , t bother with them .
negative	might be alright to all you geeks , but to me at 00 its all gobbledegook , it is so complicated , to make a complaint about something they havnt done , as in miss bugs , first of all you have to run a scan of some kind then download it to their site , then wait for a sarcastic reply , and after all that , absolutely nothing .
negative	before i bought their product i emailed them to ask if their product would clear the botnet my system was infected with , i never had a reply to that simple question , i should have known better , i bought it !!!!!!!!!
negative	!,.
negative	i asked for my money back , was told to log_into yet another site , which wouldnt let_me , and now i am stuck with a system that doesnt do the job , why the hell cant they realise that the vast_majority of people who pay for their services , don , t understand what they are gibbering about , contact this site , download this and send it to us , if i , ve still got a bug , how can i . all in all a very unpleasant episode for someone_who isnt all that up on computer speak !!!!!
negative	!
negative	they certainly don , t abide_by the old_adage , kiss , keep it simple , stupid
negative	and i still havnt got my money back .
negative	my advice is use one of the free anti_virus , at_least you can see what going on , and you dont have to pay !!!
negative	!, it might miss a bug or 0 but so do these_people !
negative	ever heard of flybe airlines ,? well they keep pretty_much in the background , except when they rush forward demanding money !
negative	these are the people who give masterclasses in deviousness ( skilful use of underhand tactics to achieve goals ) to the rest of the airline industry !
negative	ryanair , pussycats , they learnt all they know from flybe , but failed the final exam , because ryanair tell you they are going to screw you !
negative	my partner , who is 00 , was going to visit her dying sister in nottingham , tear jerker , but true .
negative	she flew from benbecula to east midland via glasgow , changed planes there and got hit with a £_00 excess baggage each way from and to glasgow , got it so_far ?
negative	now you get on a plane in benbecula marked flybe , you land in glasgow , and get on another plane marked flybe , and kaching , £_00 one way , although you are mid journey ?????
negative	suitcase full of pressys , £_00 .
negative	and then came the real masterstroke to end masterstrokes , it is so classy a stroke , the very epitome of deviousness i , m surprised they havnt patented it , they then try to charge her -£ 0 . 00 , for using the cash machine to pay for the excess luggage charge they have just levied
negative	is the luggage charge legal , sort of , 0 pages of booking info , halfway down page 0 in the faintest of faint type , 0 words , baggage rules .
negative	hit that and a half page of how they are going to screw you comes up ,
negative	another master class stroke , not only fine print , but faint print as well as a touch of clairvoyance !
negative	!
negative	on the 00th_august an email arrives telling_me to print out a boarding_pass for my partner , now i think , i am in benbecula , and she is in nottingham , flying back the next_day , i cannot get it to her .
negative	at 0000 the next_day , i phone flybe
negative	00 and a half minutes at 00p a minute , spoke and told her the position i was in , i was then told that there was no electronic check in at east_midlands !
negative	! a lie .
negative	i said why did you email the boarding_pass then , i should have known better , 00 ands a half minutes @ 00p a minute better , a finishing masterstroke , to a very expensive flight and a very unhappy experience .
negative	you have a monopoly on the islands , and you abuse it to the utmost extent !!!!
negative	!
negative	hiyall , ordered lots of lovely garlic from these_people , on the 00 th , today 00th i have filed a claim with paypal for my money back .
negative	despite no less_than 0 emails , and 0 paypal messages these arrogant pigs orphans have just ignored me .
negative	went to their web_site , and there , bold as brass were the words all of our 0000 stock has_been sold out , so they take your money , and if they happen to run out of what you ordered , they just bank your money , and you my friend , can proverbially whistle .
negative	i don , t know what a victoria welles has to do with this shebang , but the money you pay goes to her , take my advice , no matter who the money goes to , dont give them any , i hate being ignored , and these sites are the only ones where you can tell the truth , except for tyneside autoparc , where my detrimental review was censored
negative	they collected 0 parcels from me , probably because it was a local courier sub_contracted to these robbers , 00 days_later , and still failed to deliver , 0 emails with no reply , and an ignored phone_call , at 00p a minute , just a bunch of liars and cheats , do not use these_cowboys
negative	what a terrible firm , because of their past name i ordered lots from them at the start of the growing season , the seeds arrived , but the seed_potatoes sets , and grow bags i ordered hadn_'_t .
negative	all my emails were ignored , and i mean at_least 0 , in the end i was forced to post detrimental remarks on facebook , which they obviously monitor every day , instead of answering emails . it took 0 lots of nasty remarks before they magnanimously decided to send me the spuds , from the remarks onfacebook i wasnt the only one waiting .
negative	they sent a catalogue to the other half including her customer number , and a 00_%_off offer , when i tried to log on to buy her something , it refused to give her the 00_%, wouldnt recognise her customer number , when i tried to register her again on the site , a banner down the bottom of the register page blocked out the continue button , and so obviously i couldnt continue . theyve just lost a customer , and all those wishing to register , can '_t .
negative	what an awful site , tried_contacting them , nothing !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	we had a local event on boxing_day on a waterway next to my local tesco store .
negative	as usual tesco didn_'_t tidy up after closing leaving their trolleys strews everywhere including on the paths outside their property and two had been dumped as obstructions in the river .
negative	doubtless the manager thought it would be free advertising for his store .
negative	they seem to treat their trolleys as disposable rubbish in the same way they leave the hedges around the store festooned with their plastic_bags .
negative	the parcel was sent without my name on it so when it arrived at my company , nobody knew who it was for and it has now been lost .
negative	i could blame the member of staff who signed for the parcel but surely putting a name on it wouldn_'_t have been too much to ask ??????
negative	?
negative	ordered for the first time a few_months_ago from my local_store ( torquay ), and the driver forgot to bring up half of my shopping to the door , and just drove_off !
negative	needless to say that a few items were badly_damaged and dates were terrible ... so i rang up my local_store and one of the girls were extremely rude , i ordered to speak to the store manager and he ordered the forgot shopping back to my house and also gave_me a full_refund .
negative	so a few_months later ( last_week ) i decided to give them another try , the delivery came yesterday and once again 0 items were severely_damaged , including cracked eggs and squashed pastries .
negative	the mere fact that they also give you reduced items is rediculous as well , dates were also terrible and required me to eat everything within 0 - 0 days lol !
negative	so i rang customer service , the man was very helpful , and refunded me half my shop .
negative	this shouldn_'_t be happening , regardless of the refunds given , they are ruining their brilliant reputation they have instore .
negative	i normally cannot_afford to shop_here and usually shop at asda or sburys , but i like to try waitrose food now and again so i '_m willing to spend the money .
negative	each of the times i have changed to ordering from waitrose , it '_s been a dreadful experience .
negative	so stay clear , the previous reviews don_'_t lie as well .
negative	good price , good service .
negative	but beware .
negative	because they will ring you telling you about the delivery and before you know it you are being sold an ongoing warranty , which will double the price of the product over time .
negative	bad_practice .
negative	if you can resist this , everything else is good .
negative	one star , because they need to take_note of this .
negative	poor service , difficult to communicate with , if it was the customers choice i ' d never use this company .
negative	for customer service , ease of use etc our experience is that the post_office is best organisation to receive parcels from - the flexibility in picking_up your parcel you get if you are out at work is great with po ,
negative	dhl not too bad and you can get to speak to a local human_being easily without going on line but yodel - rubbish - they even have to ask the local posties where the delivery addresses are .
negative	i ordered waited 0 hour 00_mins .
negative	then phoned the pizza shop direct they said they had no record despite a confirmation e_- mail .
negative	i would suggest that you try deliverance . co . uk much more reliable .
negative	bad customer service and no refund for returned goods , until there were threatened with court_action .
negative	they advertise very cheap goods that they do not have , just to get people '_s orders of £_00 or more when they offer free delivery .
negative	i do not recommend them .
negative	never known a shop that doesn_'_t refund money when you return an item in the same condition you purchased it .
negative	there answer is we should of read the sign that '_s face down on the counter ....... oh the sign we put our goods on top of !!.
negative	there second answer is its on the receipt ....... wells that pure gold as i '_ve already purchased it !!
negative	!
negative	pathetic company , rude staff , hope you go_bust !
negative	advise everyone in the uk to avoid sportsdirect in future as we will be !!
negative	!
negative	i '_ve moved to england 0 months_ago , and knew there could be a problem regarding my previous address which obviously was not a uk address .
negative	i specifically_asked if that was an issue , and the reply was " no_problems ".
negative	i ordered a bundle and bought a used mobile_phone that was locked to the network that virgin is using .
negative	the day after i got the message that i couldn_'_t get a credit clearance since i '_ve only lived i the uk for 0 months , but i could get some crappy top up card which i was not interested in , but it was the only option since my phone was locked to their network .
negative	if i had been properly informed first hand i would never have gone for virgin .
negative	total_scam !!!
negative	did not deliver my flowers for mothers_day .
negative	when i emailed to complain they sent me one email_saying they thought they had been delivered and then they ignored every subsequest email .
negative	in the end i had to request a chargeback from my credit_card company to get my money back .
negative	do not use them you will be disappointed and out of pocket !!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	[_name_] bad attitude is the reason we will not use you .
negative	booked overnight service for pallet .
negative	then waited around all day for courier - to be told at 0 . 00pm they weren_'_t coming , with no decent reason .
negative	as a result delivery missed my clients deadline .
negative	and surprise , surprise the insurance i paid for didn_'_t cover this delay !
negative	told i was going to get it the next_day and it didn_'_t come for another day !
negative	more annoying than anything as i stayed in waiting for parcel .
negative	i cancelled my contract due to them not being to match a deal with t - mobile , that ’_s where the problems started !
negative	i received a text thanking_me for upgrading , i immediately called them and advised i hadn_'_t , and had cancelled my contract - they put me on to their fraud dept who advised my new phone was down to be delivered to london - advised i live in manchester and had not ordered it - they confirmed they would cancel the order .
negative	0 days_later i received an email_confirming it had been delivered - long_story_short and numerous_calls later i was assured they had cancelled the contract , they were aware a new phone had been fraudulently obtained by another person and i would hear nothing further .
negative	0 months later i receive a letter from a debt_agency advising i owe £ 0000 - called them explained i had no contract with o0 and explained what had happened with the fraud dept , it was advised they would take this up with o0 .
negative	at the same time i wrote to o0 expressing my disappointment and asking for a formal apology , i have written twice since and am still_waiting a response !
negative	today i have received a further letter from the debt_agency advising they have been instructed by o0 to continue to pursue the debt - this in simple terms is harassment , as i owe them nothing and don_'_t even have a contract with them anymore .
negative	simply the worst company i have ever come_across and would advise everyone to stay well clear .
negative	the flowers were left_outside the house .
negative	such instructions were never given .
negative	in fact i even gave the mobile number of the receipent to call if there was no reply .
negative	these instructions were simply not folloewd .
negative	consequently the flowers were received in a very poor state .
negative	perhps some animal had fouled them .
negative	you really ought to redeliver or refund my money .
negative	under no circumstances flowers should be left_outside the house .
negative	i took out a phone contract via carphone_warehouse , when i received the phone i was told i could cancel the phone insurance , which i did .
negative	0 months later i check my bank_account ... 0 transactions showed up , each from the carphone_warehouse .
negative	i called them to ask for a refund .
negative	0st agent told me i never cancelled it ( despite me having received a confirmation letter confirming my cancellation )
negative	0nd agent was more helpful , he apologises for the mix_up , and offers to refund the money .
negative	whilst im on the phone he told me the refund is sent , will take_upto 0 days .
negative	checked my bank_account 0 days_later no refund !
negative	lying robbing scum !
negative	so , i had 0 tyres_fitted to my 0x0 , the remaining 0 tyres were to be balanced - although the driver quite rudely disputed this at first until he re - read his work sheet and decided that i was right .
negative	the two new tyres were inflated to 00psi , 00psi more than the car manufactures recommendation .
negative	i didnt find this out until a week_later as at the time i asked if he needed to see the handbook for the correct pressures he said " no " and that he knew what they should be .
negative	a classic case of putting your ego first i think !
negative	theres no shame in not memorising recommended tyre_pressures for every car in the world right ...?
negative	a few_months later i order 0 more tyres as the fronts now need doing .
negative	on some 0x0s you need to match brands front and rear so that the central viscous differential is balanced , particularly at high speeds .
negative	the tyres have since dissapeared from the grippy website !
negative	so i phone them up and enquire .
negative	im told that the tyres are now available but they forgot to make them appear on the site !
negative	back i go to the site and now book 0 more tyres to match the ones previously fitted on the vehicle .
negative	done !
negative	that is until i get a phone_call saying that they cant now get hold of the tyres .
negative	so they do have the tyres , then they dont have the tyres , then they do have them again , then actually they dont have them !
negative	so ive already booked and paid for these tyres which dont exist .
negative	im offered an_alternative and assured they will be a suitable match to the new tyres purchased previously .
negative	only problem is they dont seem to know what it is they are giving me .
negative	" its either one of these or one of those " im told - being two different rated tyres .
negative	as they dont_know what they are giving me they at_least have the decency to charge me only for the cheapest of the two alternatives .
negative	on the day of fitting i arrange to leave work early to arrive home for the 0pm to 0pm fitting window .
negative	at 0 . 00 im phoned and told the driver is over 0 hours away , driving from dover ( to hampshire ) and that actually they are going to cancel my fitting !
negative	ok i think , come around first thing in the morn and that will be fine , we cant help bad traffic can we ...
negative	im then told my fitting cannot be done tomorrow and the next available slot is on saturday , 0 days_later !
negative	this is just plainly poor customer focus in the business .
negative	if something_goes_wrong you sort it as soon as possible .
negative	you dont put customers back to the end of the queue because you failed to deliver first time around .
negative	i need these new tyres on now so i can put some motorway miles on the car without_damaging the vcu ( differential ).
negative	im told by grippy that there is " nothing that they can do " which is the most useless , bailout of a phrase .
negative	of course there is something you can do , but you are chosing the option that is most simple for your business .
negative	if you are in the supermarket and the till breaks , once they fix it they dont send you to the back of the queue , you serve them as soon as possible .
negative	i cancelled my order and requested a refund which apparently takes 0 days !
negative	i then thought about it and if the driver was 0 hours late , for a 0 hour journey , he must have left his last job halfway into my time_slot .
negative	traffic or not he was never going to get to me on time .
negative	be warned it seems grippy are over inflating themselves and booking more slots than time in the day !
negative	read the other reviews on this site and it seems im not alone .
negative	before you buy from grippy ask yourself the question " once ive bought these tyres and arranged time off work - will i mind when they dont turn_up and offer me a slot 0 days_later so i can do it all again ?".
negative	then go to your local tyre shop .
negative	im going to have to do what i should have all along , drive to a local tyre shop , pay a few_quid more than grippy for the tyres that i want , fitted in front of my eyes , done !
negative	rude mechanics who dont_know their stuff , a flaky supply_chain where stock is checked after an order has_been placed and paid for , staff and business policy that have a " cant do " attitude .
negative	surprised ?
negative	well you get what you pay for dont you ?
negative	i selected a saddle based on the information sent , it was termed long_distance saddle , which it clearly isn_'_t , when fed back to the shop my level of disapointment surprise_surprise they happen to use that very one and its remarkbly comfortable and they suddenly can find no mention of it being a long_distance saddle .
negative	i wont be and wouldnt purchase anything_else from this store .
negative	just an update on the useless company that is waeplus .
negative	so_far i have had 0 further e_mails from the ever helpfull customer_services all saying the same .
negative	we sincerely apologise for inconvenience_caused .
negative	we have looked into your issue on a priority basis and currently there has_been some delays with the refunds .
negative	however are accounts team are currently dealing_with this and
negative	your refund is being put into process . you will also receive further
negative	confirmation once the amount has_been re - credited back to your card .
negative	if anone else gets hopefull when they recieve one of these then forget it .
negative	i have had 0 so_far .
negative	they have had 0_weeks since they cancelled the order because they couldnt get it in stock and over a month since they first promised to deliver it .
negative	would not touch these_cowboys with a barge_pole .
negative	i used amazon in the end and the product came within 0 days for only £_00 more .
negative	wae still refuse to refund my own money .
negative	buyer_beware
negative	tried to cancel my order fifteen_minutes after ordering .
negative	on that request the site said the order was all ready sent , but the the store was closed at the time .
negative	the reason i canceled the order after at check out you charged me for shipping and the fins i wanted was not in my cart .
negative	so i went to the local dive shop and bought them .
negative	i purchased a roof_rack for my camper_van , totally wrong product for the actual van , rang customer service , they were no help what so ever .
negative	i would not use this company or recommend them
negative	the service before we we got on was very welcoming and friendly .
negative	but once we got onto the bus it all went down from there .
negative	the bloke who was on the microphone explaining all the interesting sites was terrible .
negative	he was uninteresting and his facts were awful , he started talking_about how lady ga ga had slept in a hotel .
negative	thats not interesting !
negative	whats interesting is the architecture and the history behind the city of london .
negative	the way he was delivering the facts was also lacking enthusiasum and we could hardly hear him , so it was a waste of time anyway .
negative	by the time we went past hamleys toy store , me and my friend got off the bus and never got back on !
negative	i regret spending my money on the big_bus_tour .
negative	sort it out
negative	pay_pal appears on the surface to be a convenient method of making on line payments , and certainly whilst it was still owned by wells fargo this was largely the case , although actually speaking to a human operative when things do go_wrong was never easy .
negative	since the sale to ebay however , customer_services has degraded massively and several of the companies policies are , at best , highly dubious .
negative	the companies tendency to almost always side with a buyer even when the buyer is pulling an obvious scam or when the post_office confirm the seller did send the item , the item was delivered and in some cases even when the post_office provide evidence that the buyer even signed for an item they later claimed not to have received , has naturally lead to a huge increase in fraudulent charge - backs and buying scams .
negative	if you are a seller be very , very careful indeed whenever accepting payment via this company .
negative	this charge - backs scam has_become particularly popular on high ticket items such as laptops and so on , and in the space of one week 0 separate sellers that are on my face book list fell for the same scam .
negative	with an ever decreasing level of customer service and the the ever_increasing number of buyers scamming sellers which ebay seem utterly unwilling to address this is a company i am no_longer willing to do_business with .
negative	i '_ve only had a couple of payments come through , some weren_'_t credited at all and this really_annoys_me .
negative	item was broken on sending , said it wasn_'_t covered_under the policies .
negative	so not only did i loose the item , had to issue a full_refund .
negative	could tell the item wasn_'_t looked after or cared for .
negative	very doubt i will use again .
negative	i agree this company should be featured on rogue_traders .
negative	they are absolute_rubbish and robbers and all comments i agree with .. the sooner i get_rid of them the better .
negative	total_rip_off .
negative	bought a camera .
negative	paid for it .
negative	was told it had shipped .
negative	on the strength of this , i bought -£_00 worth of associated items , a lens , a charger and an adapter .
negative	today i get an e_- mail saying sorry mate - here '_s some of your money back - we sold that camera on the shop floor .
negative	rest of your money to follow tomorrow .
negative	i . m a little annoyed .
negative	what shalli do with the £_00 worth of useless stuff that i bought in the meantime ?
negative	took them 0 days to tell me too !
negative	hopeless .
negative	great company when things are going well however my flowers were delivered 0 days late .
negative	i have received no useful responses from the customer service team after i notified them ( not the other way around !)
negative	and they have taken 0 days to reply to my most_recent email .
negative	they promised to redeliver immediately and even the replacement flowers were later than promised .
negative	i can '_t understand_why i have received such little communication ( each time from a different person_who doesn_'_t answer the points raised in my message ) when surely the worst error a flower delivery company can make is delivering flowers nearly a week late ?
negative	yes they are cheap , but you get what you pay for !
negative	i have on many occassions had the misfortune of being shipped an item by citylink .
negative	there '_s many contributing factors why this just doesn_'_t work for puspose of home delivery .
negative	0 .
negative	there '_s no way for a supplier to provide you an exact delivery date with them .
negative	so this makes it hit - and - miss as to whether you will be home on their first delivery attempt .
negative	0 .
negative	after the first delivery attempt , things get much worse .
negative	you typically cannot get a re - delivery , unless you contact the shipper and ask them to authorize re - delivery .
negative	in many cases the shipper has no process for doing this , and it means navigating a complicated path of customer_support at the shipper trying to get them to do this .
negative	0 .
negative	even if you manage to persuade the shipper to do this authorization - guess_what ?
negative	in the majority of cases , citylink '_s systems are so poor , they don_'_t register the authorization , so they still won_'_t re - deliver .
negative	0 .
negative	to compoound this - citylink doesn_'_t provide any human assistance helpline to sort_out any_issues - you have to battle with their automated phone system .
negative	0 .
negative	which effectively means that you almost always end up having to pick_up the item yourself from there depot .
negative	my current score is 0 eight depot pickup trips , for a total of ten deliveries .
negative	the only deliveries i haven_'_t had to pick_up from depot are the ones that happened by chance to succeed on first delivery attempt .
negative	in conclusion , it '_s not a delivery service .
negative	it '_s mainly just a pick - it - up - from - our - depot service .
negative	worthless .
negative	very nice website , with easy ordering .
negative	quick delivery .
negative	but what '_s the point if the pizza is only fit for the bin ?
negative	still hungry .
negative	thanks a lot dominos .
negative	order arrived without the required prescription , no use as reading_glasses then !!
negative	ordered react to light lenses , also load of rubbish .
negative	complete_waste of time & money .
negative	never again !
negative	!
negative	delivery of items was excellent but one item ( of two ) does not work - reported to kenable two_days ago but still_waiting for a reply !
negative	i was tempted by the lower advertised price of a camera lens .
negative	read the mixed_reviews so took a punt ..... big_mistake !
negative	despite_numerous_emails the item delivery status did not change for 0_weeks .
negative	was told several_times it was now on priority order but nothing received .
negative	i decided to cancel my order .
negative	after a few more emails asking me why i would want to cancel , they eventually acknowledged my cancellation and funds would be refunded .... not so .
negative	many more emails and was told to contact skrill .
negative	they were more helpful but informed me simplyelectronics had never initiated a refund .
negative	back to simplyelectronics who then gave_me a refund ref .
negative	that skrill could check .
negative	only then did simplyelectronics initiate the refund .
negative	i made my order with simplyelectronics in october0000 .
negative	my refund arrived today 00st_january_0000 .
negative	ordered same item with [_external_reference_], item arrived 0 days after order .

negative	in february i ordered a bike from evans website for delivery to a store in victoria / london for collection .
negative	after several weeks it didn_'_t turn_up even_though it said it was in stock on the website .
negative	when i attempted to cancel they first offered my a different bike which was of slightly_higher retail price but worse spec .
negative	when i declined that offer the person in their call_centre told me the shop had to give me the refund and the person i contacted in the shop told me the call_centre had to give me the refund .
negative	to make it worse , after several letters ultimately threatening to take them to small_claims court they then couldn_'_t cancel the order at the shop without my full card_details which implies they pass card payment details to the shop manually rather_than electronically which no doubt means me card_details were exposed to all and sundry along the way .
negative	i strongly_recommend not to touch evans website with a barge_pole for any high value purchases .
negative	i had a faikled delivery because the delivery driver made a mistake with my address ; but instead of trying to correct it and deliver later the store tried to convence me to reschedule for another day .
negative	when i asked them to deliver on the same day the store claimed the driver had collapsed and was unable to make my delivery ; but was apparently still well enough to drive to the depot and leave , my deliveyr ther eif i was willing to make the one - hour round_trip to pick my ' delivery ' up myself .
negative	make of that what you will ; but what really_annoys_me is the customer serive team fob me off with a " thank_you for your email , your feedback is important to us " response , with no substance .
negative	at no point , not even for a second , has there been any thought along the lines of " what does our customer need ?
negative	what would good customer service look like ?".
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	much like others experiences , i sent an iphone_0s and it was reduced due to supposed water_damage .
negative	the phone was in perfect working condition .
negative	something seems to have changed about this company .
negative	i definitely will not use them again .
negative	it does not take 0 working_days to do a bank_transfer .
negative	it doesn_'_t take that long to banka cheque !
negative	the maximum it should be is 0 days .
negative	rceived the iphone 0 lead quickly which was great - doesn_'_t work though !
negative	what use is this to me , seems like another cheap imitation which don_'_t work , should have just paid the premium and gone to straight to apple
negative	don_'_t know why people ... or me for that matter bother with ryanair .
negative	the horror_stories are well published , everyone you talk to has one .
negative	i will be avoiding ryan_air in the future .
negative	total_waste of time & money !!
negative	!
negative	we were mis_- sold brightpearl on the basis that it was a product you could implement yourself without little trouble , the main_advantage with paying would be the speed in which it would be done but we could not justify_paying £_000 / per day for five days works , even_though this was given at a 00_%_discount .
negative	after trying to implement we came_across numerous issues and raised tickets which went_unanswered and were later told that ticket system was not there for implementation issues and we should have opted for paid implementation .
negative	after weeks of getting_nowhere and passed from one person to another , i landed up with , james scott – senior vice president , customer service , believe me , a grand title really did not account for anything .
negative	james went on to explain that unless we had erp experience we should never have been told that we would be able to self implement , and he was adament that we would not have been told we could implement ourselves without this by his sales_team .
negative	when i told_him we were never told this and infact his own online literature makes no reference to erp and claims self implementation is an option and only warns that it will take you longer .
negative	he said that we must have spoken to a new member of the sales_team ( spoke to the same person for a 0 - 00 month period ) and that the literature should be updated ( which is still as it was two months_ago , today !! )
negative	we then went through a early_termination review , lol !!
negative	what a total load of b *** ocks !!
negative	a process made up by brightpearl which is a total_joke , and i questioned james authority and position within the company if this review had to take place at all .
negative	anyway , they stood by their decision , not to refund me the quarterly bill we had already paid as they had upheld their part of the t &_c and are still adament that we were not lied to by the sales_team and everyone after that , even james had lied to me within the communications we have had .
negative	we actually rang the sales_team after all of this and came_across very dumb , asking very basic questions , giving the impression we could just about navigate our way round a keyboard , yet where still told that brightpearl was suitable for self implementation !
negative	!
negative	beware if you are considering using brightpearl , self implementation is very hard and should not be given as an option , or atleast you should be made aware that erp experience is required !!
negative	otherwise you will sign up then be quoted £_000 per day , approx 0 days to carry out the work ( notice it has now dramatically gone up ) when you are unable to carry out the implementation yourself .
negative	absolutely_disgusting service , use at your_peril , avoid like the plague !!!
negative	!
negative	this company is a joke and everything bad in an internet business , ignorant , rude and offer zero customer service !!!
negative	the only thing they do well is take your money !!

negative	we ordered a kit for a charity football_match that was due in 0_weeks from date of order and sent all the relevant_information and order was confirmed , was told order was on a 00 day service but as we had ordered so_far ahead it was not an issue .
negative	0_weeks in and no delivery so we contacted them , not easy , e_mails unusually ignored and the telephone rings out constantly , but if your have a few hours to kill it gets answered .
negative	we were told they were waiting on the medium_size tops and this was due anytime and would get the order out in the next few_days .
negative	0_weeks still not received the kit , rang up and eventually got an answer and was fed some story and that the kits were going out any day .
negative	0 days before our game and 0_weeks from order , a box arrives
negative	0 .
negative	no keepers top
negative	0 .
negative	shorts wrong_colour as ordered
negative	0 .
negative	sponsors print quality was shocking !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	rang again and was told that if i wanted to have the correct shorts i would need to return the wrong ones , once received , they would send the correct colour out straight_away .
negative	to ensure we had shorts i asked would they send the correct colour first , so if they did not arrive by the saturday ( bear in mind the time we had already waited ) we would have shorts to wear .
negative	was told that was not possible , and they would only send the correct ones if they receive the wrong ones , asked what would happen if they did not arrive in time , i was told i could buy replacements locally to me !!!!
negative	absolutely_shocking attitude !!!!
negative	asked later in the conversation , if i send the shorts next_day delivery , arrive with them on wednesday , would they confirm the correct shorts will be sent wednesday using next_day .
negative	this they could not do as they needed to order the shorts and delivery would be 00 days , so if i had sent them we would have been playing without the shorts we ordered !!!!!!!
negative	absolutely_disgusting !!
negative	!
negative	the keepers jersey turned_up on the friday , just in time , but the print quality was as poor as on the tops we had received !!
negative	!
negative	i had complained on the telephone and followed this up with an e_mail , that has_been received , asking for some money to be refunded to compensate for the wrong shorts ( obviously could not return as we had to wear them ) and for the very very poor print quality , to this day , no one has had the decency to reply .
negative	i run an online retail company and if i offered this level of service we would quickly have no customers .
negative	we would never use this company again , will never recommend them and will tell anyone that asks the truth !!!!!
negative	!
negative	as in the uk we always tell everyone about the bad_experiences , this one will be told for a very long time !!!!
negative	!
negative	in summary - spend your money somewhere_else , this company will tell you initially they can supply on time , but once they have your money you will be ignored , lied to and then ignored again !!
negative	!
negative	prosocceruk offers the most appauling service ( if you can call it that ) you will ever receive from an online_retailer !!!!!
negative	as i said in the title
negative	use at your_peril , avoid like the plague !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	( more than happy to cc prosocceruk in on this , might get a reply from my e_mail )
negative	please do not waste your money with this firm , they never delivered the goods and then fob you off with forms you can not down load , and you do not get your money back . i am putting this on facebook .
negative	to stop others making the same mistake i made regards_graham
negative	when things go right with paypal its pretty good , as soon as it goes_wrong though you find that all paypals promises are just lies and loads of extra terms kick in to protect them and make them even more money but give you no protection at all .
negative	wouldnt touch these with a barge_pole unless it is the only way you could pay for an item , id recommend using a credit_card though so you can do a chargeback if you get ripped_off from a seller of an item .
negative	whilst pleased with the online ordering_process , my wife was very disappointed when she opened the box_containing the flowers .
negative	most of the petals had come off during_transit , which is hardly_surprising when on checking the online tracking_facility , they had been despatched from wednesbury to horndean the previous night , and were finally delivered late_afternoon on the day requested !!!
negative	!
negative	we will not be using this service again .
negative	this has_been a really distressing experience which is still producing a lot of stress .
negative	the service team are very nice yet a solution and help is impossible to get .
negative	i am still_waiting on a refund and for goods to be collected due to a whole series of mistakes .
negative	i have to do all the work to try and make things_happen .
negative	the time that is going into all this continues to mount up - more to do next week .
negative	shambles really .
negative	this website purports to be run from the uk it is not , they have a serviced office virtual office address in londons harley_street .
negative	they are not registered in the uk and they will not tell you who the principles of the business are or confirm which business entity you are dealing_with or where it is registered .
negative	every time negative_feedback is left by someone on this and other review sites they proptly respond to repudiate the bad review , claim it is an exception that they will sort_out blah_blah .
negative	the product i purchased was an ' instant trading solution based in gambia promising bank_account setup within 0 - 00 days and merchant facilities .
negative	they rarely reply to the many emails i sent and eventually claimed after 0 months that ' the gambain government have not yet ratified the ability for the banks to open these types of accounts - yet they have been advertising the product on their website for over a year and continue to do so .
negative	the compromise offered is to have a credit_card merchant facility with funds deposited to their account and transferred to me after one month - given the non_existent service since ordering it is clearly not possible to trust them with the money i have paid for the offshore company package let_alone my customers payments .
negative	my business partner ordered a euro instant trading solution from them .
negative	his experience was equally as bad as mine .
negative	apparently the euro instant trading solution they advertise with euro bank_account consists of a uk registered company and ' the european legislation has not been approved for this type of company yet and we warn everyone after ordering about this .
negative	they didn_'_t , and whats more the promised package has also been on thier website for over a year and continues to be offered to this day .
negative	the legislation on eu companies that they are referring to was ratified in the eu in 0000 although it '_s application is not unified in all memberstates of the eu .
negative	not surprisingly the 0 - 00 day bank_account never_materialised either .
negative	this company is an out and out scam .
negative	every negative_review they receive is rapidly followed_by ' positive_reviews ' to balance it out which shows the true value of the review sites so caveat_emptor .
negative	i am now proceeding to my credit_card providers website to initiate a chargeback , before i go on to file details on formationshouse . com with hmrc '_s grey economy unit and city of london police .
negative	on the day of receipt , i wrote to advise you that i had ordered the wrong item .
negative	you have ' nt even bothered to reply .
negative	email repeated below
negative	dear_sirs ,
negative	many_thanks for your extremely qick despatch .
negative	i received the order today .
negative	unfortunately , it would appear that i have ordered the completely wrong
negative	item .
negative	is there any way we can exchange for the correct item .
negative	please advise .
negative	thanks in advance

negative	i purchased an engraved lighter at great expense as a gift to an usher for my wedding last_year .
negative	i ordered it 0 months before the big day .
negative	suffice to say it never turned_up .
negative	i emailed countless_times and even found a number for the parent_company .
negative	no answer as usual .
negative	it '_s now nearly 00 months since the order and no joy .
negative	this company is not to be trusted .
negative	they have no interest in your order , your needs or how much you spend .
negative	i '_m sadly disgusted they are still trading on line or that they haven_'_t been prosecuted for something related to trading on line or online fraud or robbery .
negative	do not make a purchase with them .
negative	if you get it , fine .
negative	but if you don_'_t you were warned !
negative	it '_s a real_shame , was looking_forward to getting the watch off of my daughter for father '_s day
negative	it took 0 days to get paid for my phones , when the web_site clearly_states fast payment , it took me 0 phones calls , with 0 of them lasting over 00_mins , and even had one mazuma member of staff hung_up on me , i also had someone from accounts saying they would ring back but never did , i had mazuma passing the blame for non payment over to barclays bank , who inturn said it was mazuma fault , who then said it was barclays fault , now this drove me up the wall ... i then had to go to the bank in person , were the bank manager said i '_m not the first person this has happen to .
negative	if i known what i know now , i would not of used this service , no doubt this review will be discard , just like my pleads with mazuma to pay me what i was owed , i wasnt even given a apology for the way i was treated .
negative	i went to paperstone for a notice board for the promised quality - service was excellent , next_day delivery wonderful - really impressed .
negative	however , the product is identical quality to the rubbish you can get in various stores - result is it cost me ~£_00 for a board that are ' 0 for £_00 ' in tesco and £ 0 . 00 in argos !
negative	its one thing to sell office supplies at rip_off prices to big businesses , but to the general_public is poor .
negative	in addition , the product was broken - one corner smashed and 0 of the four side_rails loose .
negative	as i can '_t afford to take another day off work to wait for delivery of a replacement , i fixed it myself with woodglue and clamps so fine now to use .
negative	not impressed , would not bother again ,
negative	we took out the premier plus cover with multitrip . com costing over £_00 for our_honeymoon to vegas & hawaii .
negative	firstly my gold chain was lost at the water park in hawaii - we had single valuable item loss cover with multitrip - covered up to £_000 .
negative	i spent over 00_hours chasing this , jumped through_hoops for the staff at multitrip , completed all the forms , sent all the pictures from the holiday , did everything by the book only to be told we werent covered !
negative	next my bags did not arrive back in the uk with me from las_vegas , we had baggage cover for delay & loss - however once again multitrip . com refused to pay out .
negative	i sent all evidence , proof about the loss , all the forms , out holiday tickets from virgin , the forms from heathrow concerning the lost bags - these_people will go to the ends of the earth to avoid paying out , and worse than that they will take you money and waste hours of your time filling out stupidly over complicated forms before politely telling you to get lost !
negative	be warned that multitrip . com are ok providing you never need to claim !
negative	i cannot stress enough for people to avoid this company at all costs !
negative	ripoff merchants and daylight robbers !
negative	i had to write to them asking about their online job application forms !
negative	all i really wanted to know was how to fill the form in as i have window office and it wouldn_'_t fill it in .
negative	no answer but application sent in post !.
negative	not a lot of help for people that dont understand computers !
negative	well it is isn_'_t it
negative	the title_says it all .
negative	0 months that niumba suspended paying with silly_excuses ( bank_account not compatible with their system ) and impossible to talk to them and to solve this issue .
negative	we have done everything , even silly , thing they asked on mails in order to close this issue .
negative	they reply to mails with same answers , without_any sense .
negative	joke company for sure .
negative	they own us about 0000 euros and when we ask for a call back they say that at the moment they cannot make any call !!
negative	incredible !
negative	we will see how it will be end this story .
negative	thanks
negative	they ask you to pay the full_tank before at a forfait price different by the real value and i brought it back with the 0 / 0 of the tank and they refund me only the 0 / 0 of the tank on my credit_card .
negative	dangerous for hosts !
negative	housetrip cancelled thousand of euros of booking because of customer complain for cleanings .
negative	our flat maid was asking customers to check the cleaning status before signing the acceptance of the property on arrival , but obviously there is always something that cannot be perfect even if very cheap , and consequently to low review housetrip cancelled all the future bookings , even upcoming in a couple of days with a loss for us of few thousand euros .
negative	all decisions are taken without_any check by the ht personnel on site , only after the review of the customer that as we all know are written only to complain and rarely to thank the host : in that case the client always forget to write about it .
negative	really horrible experience .
negative	professional landlord : 0_weeks and still_waiting for the money .
negative	also they do not reply to our mails .
negative	very bad .
negative	we are refusing all bookings from wimdu now !
negative	sender put wrong_address then he told them right address . p0g then didn_'_t in form city_link about changes of address their forth my son missed his main birthday_present . item sent out on the 0 / 0 / 00 and still not got it by today which is 00 / 000 crap service don_'_t use them ........................
negative	i have not recieved my order yet , iam still_waiting
negative	i ordered a large wardrobe from one of their stores .
negative	in the store the wardrobe was easily dismantled which was what i was after due to living in a small cottage with limited access .
negative	the wardrobe that was delivered could not be dismantled and it spent a month in our_hallway whilst laura_ashley argued over their returns_policy .
negative	in the end we agreed to return it but we lost a substantial_amount of money .
negative	the item was not as_described by their sales staff , the plans sent after the wardrobe was delivered showed how the wardrobe could be dismantled but these did not match the wardobe design .
negative	be very carefull about ordering furniture from laura_ashley .
negative	they promise one thing but their customer_support is shocking .
negative	three are a shambolic organisation .
negative	i wanted to cancel my mobile_broadband contract and despite emailing them and cancelling my dd , i got an email_advising i was in arrears - no response to the cancellation email !
negative	the call_centre staff_member was polite but he tried to up sell on me when quite clearly all i wanted to do was cancel !
negative	he also just read t '_s and c '_s at me saying emails were no good and i had to phone them .
negative	i spent 00_minutes on the phone for what i considered to be a simple transaction .
negative	i '_ve had the dongle for nearly 0 years so was a loyal_customer paying on time every_month .
negative	i was also subjected to the 00 day cancellation period and cheekily £ 0 . 00 extra per_month for not paying by dd !!
negative	i would hoenstly suggest that they are as close to being a criminal outfit as you can legally get !
negative	!
negative	ordered shoes on the 0rd of may .
negative	email to say will be delayed in delivery on the 0th .
negative	0 days_later they say the shoe is out of stock .
negative	take from that what you will , but i wasted a week thinking that my shoes will be delivered to be told they are out of stock .
negative	i now have to wait 0 - 0 days to get my money back .
negative	i ordered a bouquet of flowers for my girlfriend for valentines_day .
negative	although the flowers arrived , they were in a poor condition looking as if they were well past their best .
negative	over the next 0 days the flowers continued to deteriorate and were thrown_away shortly_after .
negative	i have subsequently tried to contact eflorist , they came back with a response initially , however offered no replacement or refund - asking for initial evidence instead .
negative	i have supplied images of the dying flowers but am still over a week_later waiting for a response .
negative	i will not be using this company ever again and i would not recommend it to anyone .
negative	did not receive my flowers despite email claiming they ' d been delivered .
negative	will be submitting a formal_complaint and requesting a full_refund with apologies .
negative	the customer_care for this service is appalling and i suspect is computer_generated as they never once answered my direct question or offered an_alternative solution .
negative	signed_up in june_0000 , service worked for one month then technical_issues started , tech_support very poor .
negative	in august we cancelled in writing , letter sent by recorded delivery and signed for , but they denied receiving letter and they refuse to cancel service by email .
negative	a further two letters , both recorded delivery and both signed for by soho00 at their listed address but no response .
negative	tech_support stopped_responding as they couldn_'_t fix the issue .
negative	any company that " hides " their registered address or office address clearly has something to hide .
negative	mail to their suite 00 , liberty way , sunderland address was returned as " unknown " and we '_ve had no response to mail sent to their registered address .
negative	have just discovered that they '_ve taken seven payments in one day from our account , we '_ve had no choice but to pass the matter to our solicitors .
negative	we made a point of checking on of their online " reviews " one of which turned_out to be fake ; there was no " z black " and the company had never_heard of soho00 .
negative	first of all the flowers we meant to be a 0st wedding_anniversary_gift for my wife to receive , the delivery came before 00 with i paid over ten_pound for this to happen as it would surprise my wife , which it did ...!!!
negative	she received a box ??
negative	with the flower , vase , chocolates and card in . not very romantic considering the money that had been paid , flowers were the wrong ones which we could live with ....
negative	if i had gone to are local_garage would have picked_up better and at_least they would not be in a box . serenata_flowers i will have no problem telling anyone i meet never to use your company , have put in a complaint and got a reply not even speaking about most of details of my email ... stay well clear
negative	i recently ordered some flowers from the uk to arrive in australia to arrive the day after a friends wedding .
negative	i received an email query on the date of delivery as to the phone number of the recipient ( which i ' d already provided at check out ) i reprovided this and thought nothing more of it .
negative	i then had a further email a week_later saying that due to a ' transmission error ' they ' d not delivered them and what did i want to do - after a few emails back and forth i got confirmation that they ' d be delivered on 00th , a week after they were originally due .
negative	i then got an email on 00th saying theyd been assigned for 00th .
negative	after several more emails back and forth i have finally ascertained that they have finally been delivered a week late - but it '_s taken me 0 emails back and forth ( and no real apology ) to get to this stage .
negative	on the plus_side they said they ' d send a £ 0 voucher as a ' goodwill ' gesture - but somehow , i don_'_t think i '_ll be using them again .. ( they haven_'_t sent it in any case )
negative	good luck if you try using them !
negative	!
negative	i ordered an automatic fire_extinguisher well within the ' next_day ' delivery time as indicated on the web_site on thursday ; today as i write on monday - 0 days_later nothing has arrived .
negative	you have my money give me the goods .
negative	i purchased my third trolley in 00 years from uk sport import ltd .
negative	it arrived on time but was faulty .
negative	after a lot of telephone_conversations with very courteous people i was given a ' troubleshooting ' check list ( good job i have an engineering background !)
negative	still didn_'_t work .
negative	asked for a replacement told i had to return the faulty trolley for examination by ' engineers ' - not an acceptable solution i wanted a ' new ' fully working trolley and in time for a golf match !
negative	response was no we can '_t do that , or meet my timescale so i instructed them to collect it a . s . a . p .
negative	and refund my credit_card and i would go_elsewhere .
negative	00_hours_later i received an e_- mail saying , ' as a gesture of good will ' they would replace and collect the faulty trolley on the same day - but not to my time_scale and too late for my match !
negative	this has now happened and the replacement trolley seems to be working at the moment !
negative	however , this was and is a totally_unsatisfactory way of dealing_with a customer , they were just not interested in meeting my timescale for things even_though the goods they supplied where not fit for purpose !!
negative	their ' gesture of goodwill ' was on their terms in their time and had no regard for their customers needs , very , very disappointing customer service .
negative	i would add , again , everyone i spoke to was courteous but clearly they are tied by how much they were able to help satisfy a customer and take decisions !
negative	despite growing numbers of people having screen problems ( usually just after the warranty runs out ) amazon refuse to acknowledge there is a problem .
negative	all they seem interested in is selling me an overpriced second_hand kindle .
negative	on one hand they insist that kindles cannot be repaired and on the other insist that the tat they are trying to sell me is ' refurbished ' how does that work then
negative	out of 0 deliveries i have had problems with 0 .
negative	one was delivered to the wrong_address and the current one should have been delivered by latest today and is ( depending who i talk to ) either still in the hdnl hub in droitwich or lost and i need to claim .
negative	rest_assured i won_'_t be using them again
negative	now this site won_'_t let_me rate at zero_stars
negative	for the 0rd time my order was wrong . it took a long time to replace order and i will not be ordering from you again .
negative	well as yet i '_m still_waiting on my order !
negative	it '_s taken 0 emails and a phone_call to see what is going on !
negative	the t - shirt i ordered isn_'_t in stock so i have removed that from my order which i had to ring up to do !
negative	they refunding me for the t - shirt and they offered my 00_%_off my football england shirt !
negative	and it '_s still not been dispatched no email to confirm that it should be dispatched !
negative	need to do a lot better with customer service !
negative	i rang two_days ago and item should of at_least been dispatched now
negative	they lost my order , i have wasted time going to the store several_times , only to be told by a member of staff they didn_'_t receive anything - and that they don_'_t know about delivery to stores at all .
negative	the online support was not very helpful so_far .
negative	i am taking my business elsewhere
negative	edit_: - now they lie that i have collected the order .
negative	i haven_'_t .
negative	worst customer service ever - imagine this was your £_000 photobook .
negative	better claim on credit_card straight_away
negative	the vase you delivered was not the vase i ordered the vase i ordered was black the vase you sent was clear why
negative	i am long sighted , and i had my surgery a while back , within a year or so my eye_sight was back to what it was before the surgery .
negative	when i rang the reading branch where i had my treatment all i was quoted was how much it would cost me to see some one about my eyes .
negative	seeing it cost me £ 0000 . 00 to have the surgery for no good reason .
negative	i was not told that long sighted people do not get the same results as short_sighted people i would never have had the treatment if i had known .
negative	needless to say i would never recomend to anyone to have laser trearment .
negative	hope when some one reads this optimax might do something about my problem .
negative	one angry customer .
negative	i ordered two boot bags on 00 - aug .
negative	i was immediately charged for the items and after 0 week the status of my order was still " in processing " so i contacted the company .
negative	they told me that both items would be in stock at their warehouse on 00 - aug ... quite a wait as there was no_indication of this when i placed my order and i had already been charged .
negative	so i waited_until 00 - aug . order still in " in processing ".
negative	so i contact customer_services again and now they tell me that one item only is in stock and that the other item is now due 00 - sep !
negative	they will not ship the item in stock so i now have to wait 0 . 0 months to receive my order , which has already been paid for and for which i had been mis_- informed twice .
negative	to make_matters_worse , the trip that i require the boot bags for is before any possible delivery date .
negative	who_knows if i will ever receive anything !
negative	!
negative	avoid this company unless you want to be frustrated .
negative	oh and when i try to call their uk number , nobody_answers so i can only communicate via a form on their website !
negative	the main problem i think is that they use hermes as a courier .
negative	i ordered on 00th_december .
negative	since then i have phoned debenhams several_times .
negative	they are pleasant enough on the phone , but cannot help as apparently it is impossible for them to talk to hermes and hermes will not respond to customers !
negative	during the process debenhams reorganised a separate delivery .
negative	neither have arrived as of 00th_december .
negative	however hermes tracking tells_me that on several_occasions they have failed to deliver because of access problems .
negative	this is total nonsense , as i work at a national logistics warehouse !
negative	we have hundreds of deliveries every day .
negative	if they can '_t deliver here , they can '_t deliver anywhere .
negative	apparently both are now being returned to debenhams as damaged .
negative	no doubt they take out their frustration at their gross incompetence on the parcels in their care ?
negative	i have also lodged a complaint on debenhams website , but they haven_'_t bothered replying .
negative	it is a shame i have to give one star .
negative	zero or less would be more appropriate .
negative	avoid debenhams and anyone_else using hermes .
negative	is it a plot to get us to give up shopping online ?
negative	cant just rely_on tesco direct need to move away from this small shop trial and get back to what they do best supermarkets
negative	warning - do not use contact for lenses .
negative	ordered lenses on 0th_jan , paid in full , and credit_card charged at time of order .
negative	still no lenses arrived by 00th_jan , so tried to contact by phone ( both options ) and no answer after 00_mins .
negative	sent email and repeated next_day .
negative	no answer to emails .
negative	eventually got through on phone 00th_jan , but they couldn_'_t even establish if lenses had been dispatched yet , so cancelled order .
negative	if i hadn_'_t contacted them , who_knows when i would have received either lenses or any contact from them .
negative	read the other reviews , they do not hold stock , their communications are non_existent , and they couldn_'_t care a hoot .
negative	went back to feel good contact_lenses , who are great .
negative	they answer phone , are helpful and courteous , can tell you straight up that lens are actually available in their stock , and offer next_day delivery .
negative	i have ordered with them before , and even their free standard delivery was very quickly dispatched .
negative	when we got flowers they looked like there were on there last legs one of the roses were dead the flowers on the photo had foliage these didn_'_t not happy at all wont be ordering again absolute_rubbish .
negative	i '_m waiting for a month already for a product which supposedly was " in stock " at the time of the order .
negative	no one answers the calls on uk customer service line .
negative	stay_away !
negative	frames were a bit_flimsy but what was worse was that the curvature of the lens is just plain wrong so the image is quite poor .
negative	went t back to tesco for my next pair
negative	the company did not have any stock and only after i contacted them did they respond that that they did not have any idea when i would get the product .
negative	very slow to respond .
negative	very poor service .
negative	would avoid .
negative	i gave my car model and registration as requested yet the product i received doesn_'_t fit it .
negative	annoying !
negative	ordered a £_00 sure turntable cartridge saturday 0rd dec delivery 0st_class royal_mail .
negative	it '_s now saturday 00th & still no sign of the parcel .
negative	i chased mid week as i hadn_'_t received a despatch email confirmation , lady on the phone was reasonably helpful .
negative	chased again yesterday by email , received a sarcastic , short unhelpful email ... basically telling_me it should arrive monday or tuesday .
negative	no offer to chase royal_mail for me , no offer to reimburse postage for the inconvenience , no sympathy or concern .
negative	royal_mail blamed by both juno staff .
negative	apparently they ' re experiencing problems & they are common at this time of year .
negative	from my own experience in online retail , royal_mail have never struggled as early as 0st week in december & there is nothing on the royal_mail service updates on their site to suggest they are experiencing any_problems south of scotland .
negative	may not use juno again after this , had used fairly regularly over the years ...
negative	had to close my business account because they don_'_t employ bankers - just so - called " customer service " staff to whom they pay minimum wages .
negative	don_'_t be_fooled_by their misleading marketing .
negative	you ' d be mad to pay their prices .
negative	but they have 00_% of domestic phones because most people think it '_s difficult to change .. half an_hour on the internet could save them hundreds .
negative	can '_t understand it .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	they have multiple channels but they won_'_t concentrate s | port onto one of them .
negative	their inflexible attitude will be their downfall .
negative	i have a 000min ( etc ) sim only deal , with them with 00m to go on my little contract .
negative	i wanted to upgrade to a galaxy 0 but they refused my £ 00pm unless i agreed to pay £_00 cancellation !
negative	barmy !
negative	i will stay as i am and then migrate to a better coverage company and get the latest phone cheaper there .
negative	madness .
negative	not like a hutchison company at all .
negative	they don_'_t deserve to survive .
negative	unlimited_internet became very restricted mid - contract .
negative	they ( initially ) refused to allow the contract to be voided for this reason .
negative	i had to go to their holding company '_s agm to get the contract cancelled .
negative	00 uk were arrogant and useless .
negative	but they '_ve created a sports monopoly - the reason_why football costs so much .
negative	ban ' em !
negative	we choose freeview / freesat ( free with hd ) with £ 0 a month of lovefilm .
negative	can '_t understand_why people pay sky £_000 a year - more if you want an extra box , hd or anything extra .
negative	rip_off .
negative	do without it .
negative	i don_'_t use them any more .
negative	budget lines are always " sold out " and the comparative products are far too expensive .
negative	they ' re trying to take over every high_street .
negative	avoid them like the plague .
negative	when i tried to ban them from sending bumf , their legal team said they couldn_'_t !
negative	i persisted and told them that they are not above the law .
negative	they '_ve stopped now but i had to threaten to sue them .
negative	what a bunch of assholes !
negative	have you read all their t &_cs ?
negative	more words than shakespeare '_s complete works .
negative	and they hide costs to the very end on on - line booking .
negative	they are thieves ( of time ) and grubby to deal with .
negative	never again .
negative	far too complicated to deal with ; unforgiving and no - one cares
negative	over complex and very difficult to deal with .
negative	there are more words in their t &_cs than shakespeare ever wrote !
negative	( count ' em )
negative	bouquet of red_roses ordered for valentines_day .
negative	not delivered .
negative	no contact phone number on webisite .
negative	call back facility on website suspended .
negative	emails not responded to .
negative	avoid these jokers .
negative	the above_says it all really .
negative	paid for the same day delivery .
negative	that didn_'_t happen .
negative	when i queried it i was told a delivery attempt was made but your florist got no answer .
negative	the delivery location was a business open at the time .
negative	i asked for a re delivery the following_day ( a saturday ) but received an email_saying we ' d have a fresh delivery on the monday .
negative	appalling !
negative	plus no reply to my refund request for the same day delivery charge .
negative	i will never use you again , will discourage my friends from doing so and will tweet the further responses from you as i did the first !!
negative	!
negative	0st time user - hopeless
negative	within minutes of accepting order for avon_tyres
negative	phonecall to say they could not supply as advertised
negative	but could supply barum_tyres at same price !
negative	barum_tyres are cheaper
negative	another phone_call to say oh we cant supply those either but
negative	can supply dunlops at greater price
negative	avon_tyres should put this company in order - advertising avon_tyres on line and then offering a competitors product
negative	what a joke
negative	the shirt has_been made using the minimum of material , ie the shirt tails are short as are the sleeves .
negative	the quality of the manufacture finishing also leaves something to be desired , specifically tacking threads left in , buttonholes not well finished .
negative	we have been shopping today to look for a better quality replacement .
negative	on the plus_side the delivery was very prompt .
negative	i had a few games pre_- ordered with gameseek in the build up to the launch of xbox one , most of which i had also pre_- paid for as is gameseek '_s way of doing things .
negative	i wasn_'_t too fussed about this as the price was good and the games were due out in 0_weeks , so not too long a wait .
negative	however last_week i received an email from them advising me that due to limited stock they would need me to pay in advance for a game called quantum break for xbox one , or my pre_- order would be made available to other customers .
negative	now this is a game that currently has no release_date and might not come out for another 00 months or more , so i replied to the email_explaining this and how i was unwilling to pay for a game so_far in advance .
negative	i heard_nothing back for a few_days until i checked my account today and found my pre_- order cancelled .
negative	so i checked my emails and have had a reply this afternoon that huffily informs_me " not a problem .
negative	we '_ve cancelled your order ".
negative	it seems to me a ridiculous way to run a company , cancelling genuine pre_- orders from interested customers just because they won_'_t pay for the goods potentially a year in advance .
negative	poor .
negative	i ordered a couple of items on the 00th_may and although the money has_been taken from my account , i have not had an email to say my items have been dispatched .
negative	i am a new customer so i registered at the same time but when i tried to log in , it keeps saying it does not recognise my email address .
negative	i have contacted qvc who say they have rectified the problem but i still cannot log in .
negative	they still did not tell me when i can expect delivery .
negative	i also put in orders with 0 other_companies on the same day and i got emails from them on the 00nd to say my goods have been dispatched but i have had no word from qvc .
negative	not happy !
negative	bought an item from their hyde store online .
negative	0 days_later got a phone_call to say the store had been broken into and they had taken my item ... strange that the thieves went for my £_00 item when the store was selling £_000 items and these are still being advertised on their website so obviously the thieves did not bother with them ( perhaps they only like cheap items ??)
negative	would have preferred the truth .... very disappointed as the item was for my autistic grandson who was looking_forward to getting it and now i will have to look around for another one .
negative	the package arrived on time .
negative	that '_s where the product quality finished .
negative	i bought this hamper as a present for my mothers 00th_birthday .
negative	she was so excited to open the package , when she did , there were items broken , i nearly cut myself on glass , as did my elderly_father .
negative	there was no arrangement in the basket , the items appear to have been thrown in with a " oh that '_ll do " attitude .
negative	they were not arranged , there was no securing the items .
negative	it has ruined the present for my mums_birthday .
negative	i '_m very disappointed with the quality of the product !
negative	and very disappointed with the company that seems to boast good quality !
negative	very poor indeed !
negative	if you value good / honest customer service , do not use this company .
negative	having placed my order with newfurniture0you i have received absolutely no customer service .
negative	my order has not been completed even_though i have been given 0 separate delivery dates the most_recent of which was ' guaranteed ' for what that was worth .
negative	throughout this ridiculous ongoing ordeal i have not received a single unprompted call from anybody connected with the company .
negative	my order was placed on 00 / 00 /_0000 for items that were shown as in stock and available for immediate delivery .
negative	today ’_s date is 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	very very poor .
negative	well it happened again , i fell for the good prices and promise of ' in stock ' fast delivery .
negative	ordered two_weeks_ago and heard_nothing , have emailed for updates and not even had a response .
negative	i have done this twice before but over the mists of time forgot just how bad this company are on delivering .
negative	they will get away with it for now but long_term it is a recipe for disaster .
negative	the most infuriating thing is that they mustn '_t read the multitude of reviews that complain_about their customer_services , or they do and they ignore it which must be worse .
negative	they have got to realise if just one person is put off buying from them because of reviews such as this then they are losing a vast_amount of money , a fact which i find unbelievable .
negative	the offers often seem too good to be true ... because the are !
negative	example offered a ' wowcher ' for garden games alleged rrp ( in fairyland maybe ) £_00 wowcher price £_00 ordered lawn snakes and ladders for the kids for summer .
negative	hmmm got a square of polythene about 0sqm printed as a snakes & ladders board and 0 blow up cube style poly balls ( think blow up medium_size beach balls )
negative	and blow up ' cones ' as counters .
negative	not learning my lesson ordered a hells kitchen knife_block & knives rrp £_00 . 00 wowcher offer £_00 . 00 got voucher ordered knives early september ..... still_waiting despite mailing complaint to wowcher who passed complaint to ' gadgets & gifts ' who i think are asociated with wowcher though i have no proof but the garden games were from g & g .
negative	unsubscribe now don_'_t get caught my case is going to trading_standards as we type .
negative	zero_stars avaoid like the plague !
negative	!
negative	poor description of product and doubt the top line price .
negative	poor value
negative	dont get you item , dont answer the phone , and dont answer your emails , and you dont get your money back
negative	you have been_warned ( zero_stars but this site wont let_me )
negative	hi again just to update everone on batteriesplus . co . uk
negative	just received my batteries one month to the day , i would
negative	like to send them back ( as i have bought from battery_station )
negative	but if i do , well you tell me i think i , ll keep them better not take to many chances .
negative	ordered a piece of furniture in october , which the website said was in stock .
negative	called hovells to check the website was correct and was told it was in stock .
negative	i ordered it and paid in full .
negative	i was then told a few_days_later that it wasnt in stock and would be in in a few_days .
negative	a few_days went by and i called again , and was told a few more weeks .
negative	this went on for a total of 00 weeks when it finally came into stock .
negative	after dozens and dozens of phone_calls to arrange delivery , none of which were actually answered , i gave in and collected it myself from the warehouse .
negative	i was then met by a complete jobsworth at the warehouse claiming he doesn_'_t know what to do as the computers are down today .
negative	eventually he realised it was actually possible to leave his chair and go and look in the warehouse for my order .
negative	throughout the 00 week wait , no one ever contacted me to say there were delays or why , everything was left for me to contact them , which is fine in theory , however they almost never answer the phones , and when they do a clueless member of staff exclaims ' i dont_know , i '_ll find out and ring you back ' which they subsequently never do .
negative	if you leave a message on voicemail , no one gets back to you .
negative	all in all , they have been the worst company i have ever had the misfortune of dealing_with , and certainly never will again .
negative	alright they are cheaper_than most places , but you can see why .
negative	its worth_paying a little more to buy the stuff from a retailer who actually has a clue how to run a business .
negative	pay_peanuts , you get monkeys !
negative	so the ordering and installation went really well and the price was great !
negative	but then it all went down_hill .
negative	talktalk closed the tv part of my account by error the day after it was installed .
negative	0_weeks_later i am still without a tv service !
negative	i '_ve had to call talktalk almost every day because they have failed to deliver on their promises .
negative	the fault managers at talktalk are beyond incompetent , the customer service advisors actually seem to try to make things worse and i don_'_t know what the training manual at talktalk reads like but it must_say " if you dont_know what to do ... just make it up !!!
negative	".
negative	at my wits_end with talktalk ... just called them as they promised to have this fixed today at the absolute latest only to be told that , because i had made a complaint , the department that could fix this had to stop working on it .... unbelievable !
negative	!... if this is what it '_s like trying to become a talktalk customer , i dread to think what the rest if this service is going to look like .
negative	stay well clear !!
negative	!
negative	the item not arrived yet
negative	had a text to say that your order will be delivered between 00 . 00am - 00 . 00pm on the morning of delivery but knowone turned_up , i left the house at 0 . 00pm still no delivery when i came back at 0 . 00pm no delivery .
negative	parcel arrived at around 0pm - 0 . 00pm no opoligy or anything just some young gent who dropped it on the doorstep even_though you can see i am_disabled didnt even offer to put into the hallway just walked ofrf watching me struggle good job my daughter was there who came and got it in for me .
negative	then what made it realy funny was i got a email at around 00pm at night saying your delivery will be here today between 00 . 00am - 00 . 00pm .
negative	sadly i wont use them because i wouldnt know when it was going to get there .
negative	wrong items delivered 0 times , wrong_size delivered 0 times wrong_size bar delivered won_'_t do anything about it
negative	terrible company ..
negative	tried_calling by telephone only to get placed on hold for a while to finally be advised " all of out agents are busy call back later " very frustrating !!
negative	they have a call back option on the website however i challenge you to find an available slot !
negative	i emailed them about the issue to which they said they would reply in 0 days ..
negative	i got a reply within 0 days saying it has_been passed to another team and they will reply in 00 days !!
negative	!
negative	i am_currently over £_000 in credit on my account due to an incorrect direct_debit amount and i am finding it impossible to obtain a refund !..
negative	terrible service would recommend everyone avoid ...
negative	avoid argos !!
negative	i '_m just about to get married .
negative	on 0th of august i ordered two wedding_rings for me and my fiancé in slough branch in observatory shopping centre .
negative	i specifically stated i need this rings before 00th of august and wanted to make_sure i will have it delivered to the store on time .
negative	the lady said not to worry as the delivery time is never longer_than two_weeks .
negative	i placed my order for two rings and on 00th_august collected my fiance '_s ring .
negative	my ring still didn_'_t arrive , and when i went to the store few_days ago to check upon it '_s status again , the lady told me she cannot help me as the ring wasn_'_t dispatched by supplier and she didn_'_t know when will it be delivered .
negative	when i told her how important it is for me to have this ring , she says she cant guarantee the ring to be delivered on time , she looked in her system and she found same ring but .... one size smaller in other branch in reading .
negative	i decided to buy this ring as i didn_'_t want to end up with no ring at all .
negative	the serving lady in reading i finally got me the ring , but when i looked at it - it was looking well worn with lots of scratches and some dents on it .
negative	i don_'_t want and i can '_t keep this ring and now i have to return it as well as i have to return the ring of my fiancé .
negative	now i have my wedding date set on 00 . 00 . 0000 but have no rings !
negative	argos just simply ruined this most_important day by its negligence and unreliability !!
negative	in any way i cannot imagine what can be done to fix this situation !
negative	it is just unacceptable !
negative	i am extremely disappointed and by every occasion i am going to worn people , telling them my story about the situation that argos put me into , just to save them from ending up with nothing because of unreliable and extremely incompetent company - argos !
negative	i was after three genuine apple ma000g / b iphone leads but being as apple wanted £_00 per lead , i thought it might be best to have a quick look round to see what deals were on .
negative	when i saw these on at £ 0 . 00 a piece i was a bit_wary as you have to wonder_how this kind of site can offer genuine products at such a low price but based on the description and gut_feeling , i decided to go with them ; it was a good choice .
negative	as stated , they are genuine and exactly as the picture_shows .
negative	they are clearly genuine but the only thing i expected them to come in was full retail packaging as stated instead of just being in the plastic holding band that all apple leads come in .
negative	that said , i do not know what leads bought in an apple_store come packaged in but they would not be loose .
negative	the postal details state that the items will be sent via_recorded delivery , however after one week they had still not arrived so i contacted nicecans to ask for a tracking_number .
negative	it appeared that they had been sent via standard post and had been lost but nicecans had no issues with sending me another three units , this time via 0nd_class recorded delivery .
negative	this was ok as the delivery details on the site state 0nd_class recorded however it would have been nice if they had been sent 0st_class to make up for the time loss but this is only a little_niggle .
negative	they were very helpful and friendly when i rang up so that was great as i was expecting to get some rubbish excuse to try and get out of it so top_marks on that one .
negative	the packaging was perfect and very robust for the items so no issues with that at all .
negative	overall , i '_m very impressed and i will_definitely use them again despite the little hiccup but these things_happen and at_least they wanted to help and get the issue resolved which is more than some other_sellers .
negative	i wish i could rate the review 0 . 0_stars as the only thing that let it down was the fact they had been sent standard post instead of recorded and it '_s unfair to mark it down when they did send the new items as per their website details .
negative	many_thanks

negative	talk_talk is by far the worst company to deal with .
negative	called to give notice i am leaving , indian women said i need to speak to manager at customer loyalty , and transfers my call , after a 0min wait call goes dead .
negative	same happens again .
negative	write letter to head_office in southampton , no reply , send snotty email , then get a call from ' dave ' who sounded very indian to me .
negative	asked why i am leaving and can he address my problems , explained to him , then said i need to speak to manager , gets put through to manager after a 00mins wait , who asked me why i am calling doh ' you called me ' !
negative	he cannot help me and says i need to speak to manager .
negative	what a complete_waste of time this company is .
negative	i don_'_t care how much_cheaper talktalk are , i will happy pay alot more for my broadband in future , just so i do not have to deal with them again .
negative	shower_unit ordered last october ( price was good , could be a reason for that !).
negative	website said 0 units in stock .
negative	no shower delivered .
negative	finally got through on phone ( very poor customer service on phone_calls , they don_'_t pick_up for ages , put you on hold for ever and don_'_t call back ) they said it was on it '_s way .
negative	after more calls and emails i called the oft and am now taking them to court .
negative	if i do get a refund and apology before going to court i will update on here .
negative	update_: after sending a letter to qssupplies threatening court_action i then phoned and spoke to zia .
negative	he said that i had already received a refund .
negative	i checked my account while still on the phone to find this was not the case .
negative	he then accepted this but refused to send me a refund and said he was happy to go to court .
negative	on oft advice i sent a further , final , letter to qs .
negative	they have now refunded my original amount , but ofcourse i am still out of pocket due to the number of phone_calls , the two recorded delivery letters plus the inconenience of it all .
negative	however , i have still received no letter of apology or explanation .
negative	i hope that they improve their customer service .
negative	use them at your own_risk .
negative	hanving paid the deposit for unlock pre_- order , these_people contacted me with their final price of gbp_000 . 00 for my iphone 0 00gb .
negative	i contacted orange , who proceeded with full factory_unlock of the handset for gbp 00 . 00 .
negative	busy claiming a refund of my deposit from official_iphone_unlock , who seek excuses in ther tc '_s stating the service has_been delivered , although i never accepted and proceeded with the upgrade to full factory_unlock and settling the oustanding balance .
negative	do not pay more than you have to , do some_research first , people .
negative	terrible service from bt .
negative	signed_up with them over 0 months_ago and never got the channels i paid for so didn_'_t pay my bill .
negative	now i '_ve been cut_off completely and they are threatening to pass it to debt_collection .
negative	keep ringing and saying that if they connect the service then i will pay the bill but computer says no !
negative	arrrrrahhhhhh
negative	scammers !
negative	they have about 0 websites all delivering in 0 - 0_weeks and only half the products0 the owners not a nice_bloke and has threatened many customers !
negative	just google them !
negative	ordered £_000 worth of stuff , just to have it left_outside my house by the cowboys from ' yodel '.
negative	they sent me knowingly faulty goods , then tried to deny receiving the return in order to keep my money and sell the item to the next poor sod !
negative	even_though i had proof of a signature from one of their employees , avoid like mad .
negative	am not impressed , when i tried to email you with a complaint of 0 faulty lens from the package i could not get through .
negative	not sure if i will be using you in the future
negative	our flowers were never delivered as they were sent to the wrong_address and they were bought for our friend who sadly lost her_husband and the sympathy card was never delivered either - how utterly appalling and discusting and we are so very annoyed by this and as yet no refund and no flowers for our friend whose husband died !
negative	i ordered two items for my girlfriend in october ( for christmas !)
negative	when the package turned_up , the delivery note said both items were present , when only one was .
negative	i emailed boohoo customer_services , got an answer back within a day and told that the item was still in stock , i said i would like it and thought that would be that .
negative	i still_haven_'_t received anything , i have had about 0 emails answered with the automated_response of thanks for being patient and sorry for the inconvenience .
negative	how many other customer '_s money is sitting in their bank_account .
negative	avoid like the plague .
negative	after receiving tracking_information for somebody_else '_s order that had been delivered a month previously i finally was given the correct tracking_info for the pirelli tyres ordered .
negative	the tyres arrived a week_ago now and unfortunately were so badly packaged that they have been squashed out of shape .
negative	two different garages attempted to fit them and get them back in to shape but with no luck .
negative	the customer service team would not issue new tyres or a refund without checking the tyres on a photo first .
negative	having sent them photos and numerous_messages asking for an update on the situation we '_ve still received nothing from them .
negative	partly down to their decision to use a ticket system and offer no other form of contact !
negative	!
negative	use a uk_based company with a phone number if you don_'_t want to get_stung or deal with a ticketing_system that is understaffed and incompetent .
negative	it seems most of the negative experiences come from uk customers .
negative	lesson_learned .
negative	i paid extra midday friday for same day delivery .
negative	it '_s now sunday_afternoon and they still_haven_'_t been delivered and i '_ve had no contact to say there would be a delay or problem .
negative	very disapointed .
negative	next time will use another online florist .
negative	be aware that paying out bonuses is discretionary ( read small_print )
negative	two_days i stayed in for a collection . with no joy . chatted on a live_chat . sorted .
negative	they swapped me to <_external link_removed >. they came ok . not happy at all . its starts off with one parcel and could of lead to 000 ; s , very poor service . thought they had 0000 vans . ok snow i could understand not picking_up first day . but i did book it 0 days before pick_up .
negative	i ordered a cable for £_00 . 00 on 00th_sept .
negative	received an order confirmation_email but no despatch email , no item delivered and no reply to email query .
negative	suspect they are crooks as others have found .
negative	avoid .
negative	have been trying for three_days to get through to this company , to pay my disabled and elderly mothers electricity_bill , average of over an_hour eating every day regardless of the time of day , definitely will be changing provider to eon , disgraceful service !!!
negative	!
negative	ordered and paid online which said it was in stock with 0 - 0 day delivery
negative	after over a week i phoned only to be told " oh havnt you got the message , they wont be coming in for another 0_weeks " at which point i cancelled and ordered from the co - op , which came next_day at the same price
negative	this has to be the absolute worst customer service i '_ve ever_experienced , the " experience " started after i purchased one ceramic_sink for £_000 plus delivery charges totalling_over £_000 , the sink advertised inclusive of mixer_tap , unfortunately i didn_'_t read the small_print which stated ( tap not included ), confused ?
negative	so was i ,
negative	i rang up after_searching like crazy to find a contact , just somebody to talk to and had to pay some ridiculous £ 0 . 00 a min service to find out how to return it , eventually they sent me an email recommending i use " parcels to go " to return it , this cost me a further £_00 , unfortunately the saga got worse , parcel0go trashed the sink then refused to pay any damages other than a straight refund of the delivery charge , to date i am out of pocket by over £_000 and utsumi have refused to take any responsibility for this despite - a ) they admitted the website was incorrectly advertised and b ) they recommended a courier ( tnt ) who destroyed my package completely and produced a minuscule clause , do not use either of these companies they smile and then ignore you , smoke and mirrors
negative	if i could select zero , i would , i had a ceramic_sink delivered to my house which was the wrong spec , i was advised to send it back via parcel0go , upon placing the order i didn_'_t select the extra_insurance_cover as i was confident of a safe journey from tnt , how wrong could i be , first off i used exactly the same packaging as what was received originally , superb packaging etc , what was returned to my door was something like it had been driven over , i wish i could add the picture on here , tnt and parcel0go have only offered me the price of the courier , absolutely awful , should tnt have any concience my order was p0g00000000 , however as per my previous experience i think i have more luck chasing rainbows
negative	you poor , poor customer_services team , surely there '_s only so much stress a person can take , looking at the reviews you must dread mondays
negative	if i could select zero , i would , i had a ceramic_sink delivered to my house which was the wrong spec , i was advised to send it back via parcel0go , upon placing the order i didn_'_t select the extra_insurance_cover as i was confident of a safe journey from tnt , how wrong could i be , first off i used exactly the same packaging as what was received originally , superb packaging etc , what was returned to my door was something like it had been driven over , i wish i could add the picture on here , tnt and parcel0go have only offered me the price of the courier , absolutely awful , should parcel0go have any concience my order was p0g00000000 , however as per my previous experience i think i have more luck chasing rainbows
negative	check out tnt reviews , they are awful , every one , you need to remove off your supply_chain
negative	ordered a bracket dec 00 it arrived not what i was looking for so i sent it back only to be told it was unusable and they would deduct 00_% of the purchase price .
negative	as it was taken out of the packaging .
negative	how else was i supposed to use it ?
negative	it was taken out of the packaging laid on the floor and put straight back in the packaging and sent back .
negative	( supposed to be 00 year_warranty ) they have no pictures of the damage and they have thrown out the bracket or so they say .
negative	we are now taking_legal_action .
negative	so whatever you do buy somewhere_else even if it costs a little more but do not i repeat do not buy from brackets r us .
negative	you have been_warned
negative	customer service is not a priority at ryanair .
negative	making as much money as physically_possible is the aim !
negative	this means customer service is at the bottom of the pile !!
negative	easyjet are a much_better alternative !
negative	found tyres on website , ordered them and paid for them .
negative	00_minutes later received a phone_call stating they did not have any of those tyres , would i like to spend £_00 more per_tyre on some avons !
negative	con web_site .
negative	booked next - day delivery for an exercise_bike .
negative	the window i was given was from 0am to 0pm ( even_though it says 0pm if you go to the " track my order " page ).
negative	yep , a 00 - hour_window .
negative	nothing arrived by the deadline .
negative	there was no phone_call from either the company or the courrier .
negative	i tried_calling customer service at 0pm but after going through their call steering , i got a recording saying the offices were closed ( of course ).
negative	phoned the next_morning .
negative	was given no explanation and no apology .
negative	naturally cancelled the order and won_'_t be sourcing anything through argos again .
negative	don_'_t use them .
negative	to cut a long_story_short .
negative	i ordered a pair of reading_specs and sent in an old pair for repair .
negative	direct_sight took 0_weeks to repair my specs and i never did receive my new pair .
negative	they also lost my original prescription .
negative	when i did eventually receive my old reading_specs with new lenses and nose_pieces the lenses scratched very quickly , although i ordered scratch_resistant covering .
negative	0_weeks_later and after a number of telephone and e_mail chasers i still had not received my new specs and so cancelled the order and requested a refund .
negative	i had to chase the refund twice before it eventually arrived back into my account .
negative	to their credit though they did refund my postage .
negative	beware - do not be deceived by the flashy website .
negative	i certainly will not be using direct_sight again .
negative	i would far prefer to pay a little_bit more for a local service .
negative	ordered some product then i was told one item was out off stock so i would have to wait over a week for the item to come in they would not send the other items because they said the order was then to small don_'_t see how that is my fault .
negative	i then offered to pay for the other item to be sent separately when it came in to stock but for some reason was not allowed to do that so i cancelled the whole order .
negative	the flowers received to the flowers ordered where two completely separate things !
negative	the flowers on your website looked luscious and full , the flowers received were crushed and about 0 " in diameter .
negative	i would never use you again and would actively suggest friends and colleagues didn_'_t either .
negative	i was sent a text on sat 00rd saying parcel would be delivered that day : which was good as i ' d paid extra for saturday delivery .
negative	waited in all day .. nothing !
negative	tried dpd phone number , got answering_machine : typed in consignment_number .. nothing !
negative	mobile number ... nothing !
negative	rang amazon , they said theyd ring dpd and get it delivered first thing monday_morning
negative	and by 00 noon nothing had arrived .
negative	rang dpd and entered details again , same as before : didn_'_t recognise my details .
negative	rang amazon , they were very apologetic , rang dpd as i waited on the line , turns_out they '_ve lost the parcel : i mean how does this happen !
negative	i will pull out of any future transition that involves this company : unbelievably bad service .
negative	amazon have obviously refunded my payment .
negative	i ordered an oak exterior door which was advertised as mortice and tenon construction but when it arrived it was dowelling construction . my joiner emphasized that dowelling construction is inferior to mortice and tenon so we were very annoyed that it was incorrectly advertised . we then had all the inconvenience of the door in our hall until it was collectedi i will point out at this stage that this door was very poorly_packaged and was consequently damaged in transit .. meanwhile we had also ordered an oak weatherboard seperately to match the oak door . when that arrived it was a hardwood weatherboard and so we had to tell them that the wrong weatherboard had been sent .
negative	when everything had been dutifully returned we asked for our credit_card to be refunded immediately . however 00 days_later our credit_card account was still not refunded . when we enquired as to why this was the case we were not really given an adequate response as the accounts_department was closed on a friday . all this delay has now meant that our credit_card amount has_gone_through for this month now so we will have to pay nearly_£_000 and be down on this amount for at_least a month because direct doors are so slow and inefficient at refunding us . we are both old age pensioners and we cannot_afford for this to happen .
negative	up until recently i would have said lovely , always helpful .
negative	occasional things gone_wrong but rectified .
negative	but after my recent experience in store at there pharmacy and the interaction with the locum pharmacist who openly on the shop floor , my medication and medical_conditions and then_proceeded to scare the living day lights out if me regarding one of my medications and also telling_me i should not be taking it and other medication all prescribed by my gp .
negative	i phoned boots customer_care , to complain and felt_like i was being_fobbed_off , a report would be made nothing more .
negative	so i emailed and then used there contact us form on there site and have not heard a peep from them ..
negative	not acceptable boots ... not acceptable at all .
negative	company miss sold iphone insurance for my wifes and mine .
negative	vodafone agree it was miss sold but will only pay back £_00 out of the £_000 owed then cut me off .
negative	they have passed me from one department to another , no manager calls me back and i have been hung_up on 0 times in a row !
negative	also they hide_behind emails and not on the phone .
negative	if they dont like what they hear they fob you off and then pass you to another department .
negative	broken_promises galore !
negative	what is the point of having a mobile company like this rubbish rubbish avoid at your_peril
negative	ordered a hp b000a photosmart wireless e_- all - in - one on the 00rd_june & there was no mention on the web_site of it being on back order .
negative	chased up customer service on the 0th_july and told i would have it monday ( 00th ) as it had been on back order .
negative	no delivery !
negative	i phoned customer " service " on tuesday 00th_july only to be informed that they still had no stock and that they expected a delivery on monday 00th_july & i should expect it on tuesday 00th ..... i '_m not holding my breath !!
negative	!
negative	kept asking me for information ( the same email several_times a day ) that i had already sent , i kept emailing them back to tell them but no answer .
negative	i paid $_00 for 0 day delivery ... it took them 0 days just to tell me that the items weren_'_t in stock !!
negative	eventually after a week they sent me an email_saying my order had been cancelled as per my request and i had to wait for a refund ... which i didnt request .
negative	i ' d really advise anyone not to bother , you can find the gear for the same price elsewhere and the goods will actually get delievered .
negative	i buy online regularly but have never been compelled to leave a review until now .
negative	in response to the below comment ; i responded several_times enquiring why they were still requesting the same information but did not receive any response , just the same generic email requesting the information over and over again ..... i reiterate ; terrible service !
negative	!
negative	i used evo . com in the end , they were the polar opposite and would definitely recomend .
negative	the flowers what was ordered & paid for that , the recipient gets some other flowers , thats not that way it shud be , please give me ur mail id so that i can send u the proof of what i selected & what u have delivered .
negative	very disappointed .

negative	can you confirm if you received the item or not .

negative	see previous_comments , mike from london
negative	we were out so they put my parcel in the wheelie_bin , when we got home the bin had been emptied and the parcel lost . this was the first delivery attempt [ they say that they do three }. emails are unanswered and you cannot_speak to a person . only an_idiot would put a delivery in a wheelie_bin , so what are the requirements to work at hermes ?
negative	ordered a couple of times and a complete_waste of time .
negative	should be banned from the internet , a complete_joke .
negative	i '_ve been using paypal for the past 0 years , but recently i was robbed of over £_000 by a scammer on ebay .
negative	paypal swiftly handed my money back to the scammer : s , even_though i had provided rock_solid evidence of my innocence .
negative	ebay and paypal , are the most greedy , unethical companies in existence .
negative	loyalty and trust mean nothing to paypal , they simply do not care .
negative	avoid this company
negative	i bought some speakers for £_00 which arrived faulty i sent them back and got a refund of £_00 ...
negative	i '_m not sure how thats even legal : s
negative	my first impression is dont use them again , due to inconvenience .
negative	i have ordered from here several_times and all has_gone ok and now one delivery was meant to be delivered and never shown try to contact them via_email and still no response ... so still no order has_been delivered
negative	they got the prescription wrong .
negative	took nearly 0 months getting here .
negative	now they do not want to replace them .
negative	i wouldnt use them , you have been_warned .
negative	they dont have a phone number and they do not respond to emails .
negative	sometimes taking a number of days .
negative	deals galore but what do you get ?
negative	outdated food , undercooked instore biscuits , filthy shop floors dopey staff and a management_team that must have mickey_mouse degrees in window shopping ??
negative	?
negative	the title_says it all i recently sent my wife a bunch of flowers for £_00 . 00 and when they arrived although she was grateful the specimens were appaulling ... dried up wilted and drooping , a poor effort by some teenage back room girl by the look of it ... no i don_'_t recommend them .
negative	you have seen the snotty nosed urchin making the pizzas in the back of shop ... you know they eat the pizza topping on deliveries ... and spit on it ... why buy from them ??
negative	?
negative	what a con a piece of bread and cheese melted on top with inferior toppings that are sourced low grade rejected by supermarkets as unfit ... then for £ 0 . 00 we have it delivered with one or two extra toppings like a pube or what looks_like a nail clipping ... would you eat it ?
negative	my dog won_'_t touch the thing and they say if a dog won_'_t eat it a human should ' nt !!
negative	!
negative	owns the cables , posts and infrastructure ... a monopoly .
negative	like all other utility companies has realized that it can charge what it likes if it can justify it with hipe and we will have to pay no mater what ... in economics it '_s called ... opportunity cost ... the british agree to pay whatever for the utility_bills because they refuse to question the reality ... we are all being duped by the very monopolies that govern our country .
negative	most mps are on the boards of these utility companies reaping rewards like the grim reapers they are becoming ... the best we can do is boycott the utility companies if we all refused to pay our bills they couldn_'_t charge theses prices ... fact .
negative	over priced branded goods ... overpriced own_brand .
negative	the quality is no better_than tesco and from the packaging they must source from tesco suppliers .
negative	the facts speak for themselves the food is no different to all other_retailers so why pay over the top ?
negative	compare beans at all four retailers ... asda , tesco , waitrose , sainsbury ... only waitrose is high !
negative	argos owned , now in receivership / administration says it all .
negative	overpriced , poor quality , helpful staff on a good day , products tend to be inferior compared to wickes ... b_& q isn_'_t always reliable but homebase is the asda of diy_sheds ...
negative	wickes is better_than both the other diy retailers ... and there are other_retailers but they are so slow !
negative	the service is poor , when problems with tenants occur they distance themselves and then claim they don_'_t deal with non paying tenants ?
negative	the staff are rude particularly frontline secretarial / clerical employees and very unhelpful , their main \ lettings negotiator / representative resigned leaving customers stranded .
negative	would not recommend this company .
negative	thats right they don_'_t sell new .... unless it comes from mass_produced china .
negative	their ebay site - oceantreetrading sells the same cr_* p for half the price and sometimes with free p_+_p and in most_cases the p_+ is £ 0 . 00 tops ...
negative	the brands are rejects that richard bransons team sources and sells to us at over the top prices for inferior products .
negative	shop through others for bargains the £ 0 . 00 p_+_p does exist don_'_t pretend it doesn_'_t to justify telling everyone it only cost you a fiver because in reality it cost you closer to eleven quid ... it '_s an invitation to treat .
negative	bid and its ilke make more money on the p_+_p than the product in some cases .
negative	mass posting is cheap for bid ... items often only cost £ 0 . 00 to send bid making £ 0 . 00 on the deal .... think before you buy !
negative	poor service , poor delivery , poor customer service , poor quality , poor aftersales care !
negative	the interest_rates are high the quality of garments is very poor .
negative	these are serious importers of seconds ... and they sell at top buck .
negative	nothing lasts more than 0 washes ... quality control sucks .
negative	when adult shoes cost less and you know they ' re made in bangladesh and other third world countries you can guess_what they cost to make and what the poor urchin that made them got paid ... you know its child exploitation from both_ends .
negative	this company is criminal ... they prescribe prescriptions which don_'_t need to be given .
negative	they particularly pray on the young and infirm ... who have little idea of whats right or wrong with thir vision .
negative	there are more people on the streets wearing minimal magnification lenses than we realize .
negative	glasses are a fashion item and specsavers have exploited the market !
negative	if research was honestly done on all three major high_street spectacle retailers the facts surrounding the provision of pointless prescriptions would be widespread .
negative	get a second opinion from an independent if you can ... and remember the profits speak for themselves .
negative	if specsavers had its way we would all have glasses .... wait a moment i think i have a pair with 0 . 00 magnification ... and they cost me £_000 hmmm_... do i really need them i thought i did but i never use them ???
negative	says it all really .
negative	what gullible people we are ... why is it allowed ?
negative	bank rates at 0 > 0 % where is a regulatory body preventing abuse of the needy .
negative	these catalogu companies offer credit to the uncredible and then charge 00 . 0 % interest ... why ?
negative	risky business selling imported third world goods sold at top_dollar ... are we really stupid ?
negative	open your eyes to a country that exploits us all through underhanded and abusive trading methods ... loan sharks and criminals !
negative	the uploading software was bad and hard to understand .
negative	i ordered product that i didn_'_t want , and overpaid for it .
negative	i then was not allowed to cancel the order .
negative	i am never going to use your service again .
negative	two months after leaving scottish_power i am still_waiting for a refund of the credit they owe me .
negative	they ignore emails , do not answer phones .
negative	i would not recommend this company and will have to take them to court to get my money back .
negative	sent me four tubes for my fish_tank , two were labelled the wrong_colour and one did not work .
negative	i returned the faulty tube , when they eventually replied after many ignored attempts to contact them .
negative	they said would send out a replacement a week and a half ago .
negative	nothing has turned_up and have emailed them again several_times , no response , phoned them , no answer .
negative	i even got failed delivery messages to some emails .
negative	will have to contact my credit_card company for a refund .
negative	i would avoid this company if i were you !!
negative	!
negative	update 0
negative	now got a replacement tube after many emails .
negative	they said " send it back and we will refund your return postage " that was over a month_ago and still no refund .
negative	they only seem to reply if you mention disputing the transaction and requesting a chargeback with you credit_card company .
negative	excuse for long delays is " staff sickness ".
negative	must be an epidemic down there as they are ignoring my emails again !!
negative	if you are thinking of buying from them , telephone them first .
negative	if you get no reply , bear in mind this is what you will be faced with if you have any_problems with them !!
negative	i have now formally raised a dispute with my card company and await my refund .
negative	update 0
negative	i only got my money back once my credit_card company took money back off them .
negative	had opal corner_sofa delivered .. sit on it for 00_minutes and the cushions squash flat so that the frame of the sofa is easily felt .
negative	apparently we should be ' plumping ' these foam cushions ( whilst sitting on them ?).
negative	the cushions are not made of an appropriate material .
negative	in dispute and will be returning sofa and taking_legal_action .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	quoted me £_00 pound for nokia_n00 0gb
negative	payed out only £ 0 pound saying the phone did not work and had a broken screen .
negative	i ordered the athena massage_chair and it has arrived mouldy , rusty and clearly pre_- used .
negative	disgusting .
negative	i am now on hold to customer_services for the 0nd time for over 00_minutes .
negative	very poor service
negative	worst shopping_experience of my life can '_t believe_how bad the service i received was , terrible communication from my first contact , and they never_let_me know my order was not in stock when online it said it was .
negative	didn_'_t really seem to care when i cancelled my order , would never use this site again .
negative	online shopping is generally quick and easy this site does not offer this .
negative	except from being quite regularly on time ( what they do not forget to remind you after a landing with loud sounds ), ryanair is the worst airline i have ever flown with .
negative	i stopped using them since they charged me £_00 for a hand_luggage that they said was 0cm too high .
negative	they try to take money out of you everywhere .
negative	you cannot even consider trying to sleep during a 0h flight : you are interrupted all the time with merchandises ( drinks / food , duty_free , lottery tickets , train_tickets ...).
negative	you will soon be charged for using their toilets , as their ceo suggested once .
negative	avoid it !
negative	i signed_up for a recent deal at e0save for a t - mobile full_monty sim - only deal .
negative	it was billed at £ 00pm for 00m with a free refurbished nexus_0 00gb .
negative	all was ok to start with , signup was painless and their delivery company dpd were spot on .
negative	fast forward 0_weeks and i got a text from t - mobile saying they '_ve been trying to contact me and this is the last chance to pay my bill .
negative	i '_ve not had any previous communication , so this seemed a bit_weird .
negative	noticed that my mobile data wasn_'_t working , so tried registering on the t - mobile website ( that '_s nicely broken at the moment ) so gave up and called t - mobile .
negative	got hold of a very bored sounding lady , who confirmed my account was overdue to a cancelled dd ( first i ' d heard of it !)
negative	and i needed to pay £_00 to restore my service .
negative	i queried the amount and she confirmed that i should be paying £_00 a month and pretty_much refused to believe me about the £_00 agreed with e0save .
negative	checked all my stuff from e0save and it '_s all above board , with no mention of redemption or cashback from them etc_etc .
negative	so it just looks_like either i was mis_- sold or they ' re just incompetent .
negative	either way , not exactly re - assuring and i '_ve got no way to rectify it because they ' re shut at weekends .
negative	guess i won_'_t be calling anyone tonight then !
negative	my advice , go_elsewhere for your mobile needs .
negative	i had my first real problem with virginmedia when i upgraded my broadband and ordered a tivo_box ( standard v + box is god_awful slow after being used to a skyhd box ) i haggled a deal with their indian_call_centre where i ' d only pay £_00 instead of £_00
negative	sadly , as i soon found out , i was lied to and my bill showed the full_amount .
negative	rang cs who advised me to cancel the dd as they had no way of refunding my money .
negative	done that and then i got a £_00 charge for a dd failure .
negative	called again , and was told it was all sorted .
negative	sadly the next bill still showed the £_00 charge .
negative	called and spoke to their complaints_department who said they wouldn_'_t have said that ( awfully nice to be called a liar by a complaints_department !)
negative	but conveniently they didn_'_t record these call to the off - shore department , so i couldn_'_t prove it
negative	at this point i raised a complaint with ofcom about being mis_- sold and sent an email to the ceo '_s office at vm .
negative	only then did i get someone that understood customer service , who_apologised and promptly refunded my account with the money .
negative	couple all this with their rubbish traffic management ( 00_% speed reduction on uploads !!)
negative	and you ' re better off looking elsewhere .
negative	as soon as my contract is up i '_m jumping ship to bt_infinity
negative	flowers from serenataflowers arrived on time well past there sell by date only place for them was the compost heap very very disappointed recipient .
negative	reserve stuff on - line to collect in store and they ring you hours_later to say tthey do not have it .
negative	placed an order for a nice bouqet for my girlfriends_birthday .
negative	in the picture and as_described they sounded lovely for the price .
negative	when they were delivered they were disappointing and left me feeling embarrassed .
negative	stems were snapped , a few of the flowers looked as if they were dying already and the arrangement was poor .
negative	the greeting_card was small and lacked imagination and a personal_touch .
negative	just another printed note for another customer ... no love or feeling involved .
negative	deflated , and unimpressed by the standard i expected .
negative	this is the first time i have used your company and as this was a bouquet for a special birthday i wont be using you again or recommending your company .
negative	i hope you can learn from this feedback and make_sure others receive a better quality of flower in future .
negative	thank_you
negative	afer waiting 0_weeks just recieved delivery , from 0 items delivered , 0 items smashed
negative	and 0 item has missing parts ,
negative	lynda marconi soloution ?
negative	wait another 0_weeks
negative	what a shambles of a company
negative	you took the money for hotel but you did not book flights ... refunded the flight money .... nice of you ..... even_though you did not even book the flights .... but kept the hotel money .... unbelievably unprofessional does not even deserve one star
negative	this is the worst experience i ever had .
negative	it passed more than 0_weeks , but my order is still not shipped !
negative	and again after my letter to customer service they ask me to wait 0 days more and i am not sure that these_guys supposed to do anything .
negative	really disappointed with this service !
negative	surely such a company would have more staff to answer the phone or emails on what is surely their busiest day of the year ?
negative	paid for pre 0pm delivery but then i check my tracking_number to be told by yodel they could not deliver at 0 . 00pm to my gf place of work .
negative	a place that has_been receiving flowers all day via their security barrier at the front of her building now i just look a complete fool .
negative	unfortunately this is why companies go out of business as people will vote with their wallets , if you can '_t get valentines right then what about normal days , this rush for today had to be planned by a company in advance but from reading the reviews here you obviously didn_'_t plan very well for today .
negative	i do not want another delivery tomorrow as today '_s chance has_been and gone .
negative	timed delivery equals a timed delivery and not just drive off as i have it from security that no one attempted to deliver .
negative	never felt_compelled to write a review before this situation takes the biscuit and i have emailed you every 00_minutes for the last two hours with no replies and i '_ve given iflorist my contact details to no_avail with any replies .
negative	looks_like they will be another casualty of 0000 going out of business . beware potential_customers of using this company as customer service is not something they deal with at all
negative	the website feels old and clunky for starters .
negative	i had a few 000 errors on product pages which hardly instils confidence .
negative	i did however order a microwave because it was the one i wanted and the price seemed ok .
negative	i had to register with the website and to do so was forced to give unnecessary information that i did not want to give about myself .
negative	there seemed to be no option not to retain my card information .
negative	what i ordered was on next_day delivery and it did not arrive next_day .
negative	i was given a tracking_number in an email but when i entered this number on the tracking page at the comet website it gave_me a 000 " page not found " error .
negative	i looked for a telephone_number to call customer_services and only found and 00000 number which was charged at 00p_per_minute .
negative	it is now the day after the day on which this product was supposed to arrive and i want to go out to see an old friend before he moves to india but i am still_waiting for my delivery and am unable to even attempt to find out what might have happened to my order without spending 00p a minute ( more i think because my phone is a virgin one ).
negative	i would spend the money on the phone_call if i thought it would get me anywhere but i '_m_sure i will be told that once the item is with the courier there is nothing they can do so why waste money .
negative	disgraceful service but only just less_than average for the uk .
negative	i will never be using comet again .
negative	i '_m surprised at how i '_m now being treated by dolphin .
negative	i '_ve bought gear from them before and they were ok but " it '_s all over now baby blue ".
negative	i wanted a new amp for my birthday .
negative	i ordered one on wednesday by telephone for next_day delivery .
negative	i found it for £_00 less at an on - line retailer that i ' d never used but thought that i ' d order it from dolphin because i ' d never had a problem with them and i trusted them .
negative	i was told it was in stock and there wouldn_'_t be any problem .
negative	this day was 0 days before my birthday so ...
negative	i was going to have an amp on my birthday wasn_'_t i ?
negative	i ' d even taken a few_days off work to enjoy my birthday_present so what could go_wrong ?
negative	i waited and waited_patiently .
negative	no amp .
negative	i called on friday and was told that it would be sent out immediately .
negative	the following_tuesday i called again only to be told that they did not have the amp in stock .
negative	they offered me a shop - soiled one at a discount .
negative	i said that i wanted a full_refund .
negative	the money is now tied up with them and i can '_t afford to order one from somewhere_else until i get the money back into my account .
negative	my birthday is now 0 days away and there is little prospect of me having an amp in my possession by then .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	i ordered 0 products which were all delayed_due to stock .
negative	the customer service department was rude , i got no communication to advise , and to boot i got 0 sales emails through every day for 0 days !
negative	poor effort and very badly run e_- commerce shop .
negative	go_elsewhere is my advice .
negative	i ordered a groupon with this company , the code didn_'_t work on their site .
negative	i have now emailed them 0 times from 0 different_addresses and not once received a reply .
negative	rubbish !
negative	i ordered a laptop bag that was supposed to take 0 - 0 days to deliver .
negative	after 0 days and no contact i cancelled the order .
negative	no response came for 0 days when they just said your order is cancelled .
negative	they lost the order due to slow response , bad communication and non - delivery as advised .
negative	probabally the worst web_site for ordering goods
negative	i order a maxi_cosi rodifix carseat from this company and regretfully did not google the company reviews before doing so .
negative	they immediately took the payment using paypal and then ... nothing .
negative	i rang them after 0 days and they answered with an excuse that the last of the stock was sold minutes before i had ordered , so they didn_'_t have time to update stock_levels .
negative	they said the colour i ordered was now discontinued and that the new colour would arrive in the next few_days and they would despatch for delivery the folowing week .
negative	they also said they would contact me in a few_days to confirm this .
negative	then nothing .
negative	00 days_later they now do no answer their phone and do not respond to emails .
negative	having paid by credit_card and via_paypal , i know i will get my money back , and have raised a dispute through paypal .
negative	i suspect the one 0_star_review is an employee ...
negative	placed order 00 / 00 / 00 , still_waiting 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	free delivery is no good if you wait_until the 00th to despatch .
negative	may not use again .

negative	reading
negative	it is so nice to see this company finally getting the caning it deserves on the web - my advice is to read the reviews and then walk_away .
negative	i had a payg phone with a large_amount of money in credit which i used as a backup to my contract phone with o0 .
negative	i used to make a diary entry to make a call at_least once every 0 months so i could keep the number active .
negative	however , the one and only time i forgot , with no warning whatsoever , vodafone disconnected the number and i lost all the credit .
negative	when i phoned up to query it i was read the terms and conditions by 0 different customer service officers and told to write to head_office , but they will say the same thing - so they had effectively stolen my money and stuck two fingers up at me .
negative	i will never touch vodafone again and i am pleased to say that my experience has persuaded many friends and colleagues to steer_well clear and when my company renews it '_s mobile_phone contract , which is a multi - million_pound contract , i will do everything i can to influence the decision to ensure that vodafone does not get it !
negative	i very rarely hope that a company goes_bust , but the sooner it happens to vodafone the happier i will be !
negative	had an orange payg_sim which had some credit left on it , so i thought i would transfer the sim to ee to use the 0g data .
negative	after_reading the reviews on here i predicted to my work_colleagues what would happen and to my surprise i was right .
negative	0st phone_call to ask about transferring number and credit - was told no problem will be done in 00_hours ... guess_what .... didn_'_t happen .
negative	0nd phone_call to find out why it hadn_'_t happened - was told puk had been requested but transfer had not been actioned ; was promised the transfer of credit and number would be done within 00_hours .
negative	00_hours_later my number is transferred .... but guess_what .... the credit wasn_'_t !
negative	0rd phone_call to ask where my credit was - could not understand a word the call_center person said ; i had to explain the situation 0 times before she understood my problem .
negative	i was put on hold for 00_minutes , then she came back and told me she was escalating the problem and would phone me back within 0 hour .
negative	0 hours passed and guess_what .... no call !
negative	0th phone_call to find out what was going on - had to go through the same process again , in pigeon english , to be told that there was no credit on my old orange account , so no transfer to do .
negative	i got annoyed with the guy , who then checked the account and admitted that he was wrong .
negative	i have been personally assured that my credit will be transferred and that he will make_sure it happens ....... in 0 to 00_hours !
negative	guess_what .... i think this review will be amended to include 0th phone_call !
negative	**_update **
negative	you guessed it , 0th phone_call , this time to the english sales_team to find out what was going on ( again ) - i explained the situation , the guy then read out the message that had been recorded on the system by the indian_call_centre in my previous call and neither he or his manager could understand what it was trying to say , so he is raising another transfer .... so it continues !
negative	** another update **
negative	0th phone_call - apparently my credit is still on the orange account and not the ee account , but the orange account doesn_'_t exist_anymore .
negative	i was told that the original transfer was not done properly and another attempt would be made , which would take ..... you guessed it upto 00_hours to complete .
negative	why do i get the feeling that i will be phoning again in 00_hours to go through the same process all over again .... never witnessed such utter_incompetence .
negative	oh i did get my first and only apology , but only after i pointed_out that no - one had the common decency to apologise for this joke of a situation .
negative	i urge_anyone_thinking_about joining ee , save your money and go_elsewhere they are a complete digrace ; i have complained to ofcom and will be contacting_trading_standards first thing on monday - i would actually like a full_refund of my credit so i don_'_t have to deal with this company again !
negative	!
negative	i told amazon over a year_ago that i would not shop with them while they use yodel and since then they have used their own extremely reliable couriers .
negative	however , this week i placed and order and my heart_sank when i saw yodel was the delivery firm and once again my experience has_been predictably bad .
negative	the package was due to be delivered on friday 00th_april_0000 , so i took this day of work to be at home .
negative	i got home from work on the 00th_april to find a card on the door_mat stating that an attempt at delivery had been made .
negative	not a problem , i went_onto myyodal and rearranged delivery for the 00th_april .
negative	i checked the tracking on the morning of the 00th and it stated that the parcel is still at the depot .
negative	so i rang customer_services and queried this and was told that they can '_t contact the driver but he is aware that i need the parcel today ( 00th ).
negative	i mentioned while i was on the phone that the mobile number left on the card was actually for a local gas company , but yodel confirmed the number was correct and told me to phone it .
negative	i phoned the number and found myself going to the voice_mail for a gas and property_maintenance company - so are yodel now using gas engineers to deliver parcels ?
negative	after_posting my review i received the reply shown below from yodel which states that my parcel is out for delivery !
negative	update_:
negative	i telephoned the courier and he informed me that he is in scotland and if i really want the package he can get his wife to deliver it as it is in his shed ( which is encouraging ), otherwise delivery would be monday_evening .
negative	i told_him to send the package back to amazon !
negative	i contacted amazon and asked for a complete refund and told them that i will no_longer buy from them while they continue to use yodel as a courier !
negative	i have replied to the e_- mail posted below which just shows the level of sheer_incompetence of this company as i would like to know how my item was out for delivery when the courier was actually hundreds of miles_away in scotland and my parcel was is in his shed - no answer required yodel , i have drawn my own_conclusions !
negative	so thank_you yodel for once again making me waste a day of my annual_leave waiting in for a parcel that was never going to turn_up .
negative	i urge any supplier to desist from using yodel and i will never do_business with anyone that uses them as a courier :
negative	i will make_sure that i keep all of the evidence for this situation so that when a " reputation " company comes along in 0 years time ( yes this has happened ) and ask me for proof then i will be able to accommodate !
negative	have bought lots of things from hotroxuk without_any_problems .... then the first time i did have a problem with a pedalboard that i purchased they were absolutely_hopeless ... i kept e_- mailing them but didn_'_t receive a single response - evenually after e_- mailing the manager on his personal e_- mail address i got a reply , but by this time i had sorted_out the problems at my own_expense - this has_been amongst the worst customer service that i have ever received !
negative	!
negative	hotrox are very good at the selling and orders always arrive on - time - i actually drove to the shop in nottingham to collect the item that i had the problem with and was subjected to what turned_out to be waffle about how good they are at customer service .
negative	buy from hotrox if you wish , but you just better hope that you don_'_t get a problem ... for me this is too much of a risk when you are spending large_amount of money !
negative	ordered a toilet and tap .
negative	toilet arrived with parts missing which connects cistern to the pan , i rang straight_away to customer_services ensure it would be sent overnight , it wasnt i rang again i still hadnt been sent i cannot complete the job until the toilet is installed .
negative	it has cost me money in arranging an extra visit from the plumber plus all the hassle . one week on from delivery still no replacement parts , rubbish service never again , please compensate me .
negative	i used to have an account on behalf of the swimming club with excellent online ordering and tracking of orders .
negative	one day the account no_longer existed because of a change in the website and as a consequence i lost all of the clubs history or orders which i relied_upon .
negative	i now thave the club account set_up on the sister company , but all the discounts have disappeared so it '_s now cheaper to order for the club on my private account and collect the points .
negative	that is if i can ever find anything in stock !!!!.
negative	i constantly get asked to order items , but when i go online they are usually out of stock .
negative	i have now switched suppliers , so swim shop have got what they desired .
negative	i used to have a high opinion for them , as the in - store experience is good and most items are of a decent quality .
negative	but that changed when ordering online .
negative	i ordered shy under £_000 of items during the winter sale , some multiple items in a range of sizes for my girlfriend to try on .
negative	this was recommended by the tele - sales staff , as sale items go out of stock quickly .
negative	the first issue was one of the orders for £_000 never arrived , they admitted it was charged to the credit_card but never made it to the orders department .
negative	it took 0 months to get a refund on that order .
negative	now on to the refunds of items returned .
negative	a total refund was expected of £_000 but i got £_000 .
negative	i '_ve spent over an_hour working out what they have done wrong , and what needs to be fixed .
negative	since then i '_ve spoken to 0 people who have promised call_backs and it will be solved but i never get them or get an email back when i chase them .
negative	a month after the initial refund i '_ve called again today , with a call back promised later .
negative	at the very least the website should show the orders and refunds against them on your account .
negative	instead the refund notes i get in my email contain no details , just a refund amount that doesn_'_t even match their own system .
negative	it doesn_'_t help paying via_paypal as no order numbers match paypal orders , so its utter chaos to work it all out .
negative	if i hadn_'_t checked my refunds , i would be seriously out of pocket !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a bike from evans .
negative	because there wouldn_'_t be anyone at home during the working week i opted to pay £_00 for a saturday a . m . delivery .
negative	guess_what - 0 :_00pm arrived and no sign of the bike .
negative	phoned evans who said there must be a problem and they ' d call back ' very soon '.
negative	an_hour later i was phoning them again .
negative	ended_up cancelling the whole order .
negative	would i buy from them again ?
negative	never !
negative	i ordered a package from a reputable_company .
negative	couldn_'_t have the goods delivered during the working week because nobody would be home so i paid the extra for a saturday_morning delivery .
negative	guess_what - no sign of the parcel .
negative	checked the tracking_number to find that the parcel had arrived in the local parcelfarce depot at 0 : 00 in the morning but they couldn_'_t manage to get it into a van for delivery .
negative	in my opinion they '_ve stolen the money from me because they charged a premium for their so - called saturday_morning delivery .
negative	the sooner this bunch of jokers are sold to a competent company the better .
negative	i purchased two polo_shirts and requested embroidery on the chest and sleeve .
negative	i found that after a couple of days , i had to chase up the artwork proof i ' d been promised .
negative	after the weekend , i still hadn_'_t received it , i called again , and after a day of phone_calls and emails , i finally received the proof .
negative	i was advised that i would have to wait two_weeks for the two shirts .
negative	when they finally arrived , they were far too small despite purchasing a size larger than i normally wear .
negative	when i brought this to the attention of workwear_express , i was advised that i could buy more shirts from a different manufacturer if i wanted .
negative	i have been left unsatisfied in every possible way with workwear_express ' initial service , customer service and after sales .
negative	i booked four rooms back in february paying £_000 at the carrington house hotel in bournemouth for one night for my stag_do .
negative	on arrival at the hotel we were told there were no rooms booked for us , after producing my booking confirmation the hotel staff got into contact with lastminute . com and it turned_out that lastminute . com had not paid the hotel the balance for all the rooms .
negative	we had to hang_around the hotel for nearly an_hour , and at our expense we all bought drinks from the bar , we were offered no refreshments !, we were just left to hang_around until this was sorted_out .
negative	we eventually got into our rooms , we were offered nothing to make us feel any happier with the situation , the hotel should have offered us complimentary breakfast or at_least wiped the bar bill clear , but nothing !!!
negative	we had been paintballing and wanted to get into our rooms and have a shower before heading off for a few drinks in the sunshine , this was my stag_weekend and this incident marred the day !
negative	on my return i complained to lastminute . com who point_blank refused to offer us any compensation , the customer_relations guy was to be quiet honest very blunt in his refusal to offer us anything in the way of compensation .
negative	below is copy of the last e_mail from customer_relations of lastminute . com !!

negative	dear_mr . gardiner ,
negative	order reference :_000000000 .
negative	thank_you for your email of today .
negative	i am sorry you are still unhappy .
negative	as i explained previously i feel that the explanation given to was appropriate .
negative	there is little else i can add and therefore must now consider this matter closed .
negative	please also be advised that i am the last point of contact and i am unable to offer compensation .
negative	thank_you for the opportunity to clarify our position .

negative	not satisfied with the delivery if indeed it is going to be delivered .
negative	have dealt_with this company before without problems so perhaps it is just a glitch .
negative	i am an online retailler with over ten_years experience .
negative	before that i was a director of a freight / courier company in london for an equal amount of time .
negative	so i think i have pretty_much heard and witnessed all that can happen from both_sides of the business .
negative	i thought i would give parcel_hero a try .
negative	after_reading all the hype on their site , i ordered a collection for a customer in singapore .
negative	it was supposed to be collected on the following_day with ups .
negative	they failed to arrive .
negative	after numberous phone_calls to parcel_hero , i was reliably assured that they would be along on the following_day to collect .
negative	the customer service agent assured my wife on the day that she " would remain in the office until the package was collected ."
negative	they never collected and , sure_enough the agent went home .
negative	what followed was profoundly pathetic .
negative	parcel_hero decided to imply a whole catalogue of childish excuses rather_than take_responsibility for their shortfall as a shipping agent .
negative	they even went so_far as to try and blame me ?
negative	i asked for a refund , the squrming and wittering was embarrassing to hear , i had to wait days for the money to be returned and in the end i had to place a claim through paypal .
negative	with good cutomer service they could have turned the situation to their advantage , resolved the issues quickly and they would still have me as a customer .
negative	rubbish ..
negative	i would like to inform you of my experience with the cambridge f0 branch .
negative	i booked my fiat_panda in for an mot and service on friday 00th_july_0000 .
negative	at about 00 am i was informed by phone that my car needed new front_brake_discs and pads along with a few other things to the tune of £_000 .
negative	alongside this i was told that the car needed a timing_belt change which i was quoted around £_000 + to do this .
negative	at this point i reminded them that i thought me radiator was leaking .
negative	at 0 :_00pm i called to see if the car was ready and was told it would be in an_hour .
negative	i arrived to pick the car up at about 0 :_00pm .
negative	it wasn_'_t ready , in fact it was still up on a lift with both front_wheels off .
negative	so i waited .
negative	the car was driven round to the front , i paid and started my journey home .
negative	after about a quarter of a mile there was a a horrendous smell and smoke was pouring out of the driver - side front_wheel , the car didn_'_t feel right so i was forced to stop .
negative	i called f0 cambridge and they told me that sometimes there is residue on the discs that can smoke a bit but i could bring it back if i was worried .
negative	i drove the car back to f0 cambridge with smoke still coming out of the front_wheels .
negative	the mechanics informed me the the incorrect sized shims had been fitted and that the brakes where permanently on , hence the smoke , and the strange handling .
negative	also now the car was back up on the lift the radiator leak was much worse as water was literally pouring out .
negative	i was told that the car could not be fixed that day .
negative	even if the the brakes were fixed i was unlikely to get anywhere with the radiator leaking like that so i was forced to have the other work done as well over the saturday and that i would pick the car up on monday as i work just round the corner .
negative	i am deeply concerned that the work carried_out on my car could have led to a more serious outcome .
negative	i could have carried on driving and the car could have been seriously damaged , or the brakes could have failed etc_etc ...
negative	the failure to fit my brakes properly also leads me to have concerns about the quality of the rest of the work done on the car .
negative	i wrote an email to complain on monday the next week and was phoned shortly by the regional_manager .
negative	he said that the brake problem was nothing to do with what the mechanic had told me originally , and said it was just the wax burning off and it would have been fine to drive .
negative	after about 00_minutes he finally but reluctantly apologised and gave_me a 00_%_discount off the further work .
negative	i picked_up the car and drove home without_incident .
negative	opened the bonnet up to find loose cables where they had gained access to the radiator but neglected to tape them back up .
negative	all in all a pretty terrible experience where i will never be using f0 again and will warn all my friends and colleagues not to as well .
negative	i will also be recommending that my employer , who have a 00_% deal with f0 , to stop their association with them .
negative	i ordered on the 00th_march and paid £ 0 . 00 for deliver , over a week_later it hasn_'_t arrived and they are unwilling to do anything about it until 0_weeks have elapsed .
negative	in the mean time i have paid and am without the items .
negative	not able to forward the this mail to my wife who possibly ordered something .
negative	ordered some goods for my bros christmas_present .
negative	supposed to be delivered on the 0th , still nothing .
negative	support email on the confirmation_email is a fake .
negative	then i saw this site .
negative	i won_'_t be holding my breath for the goods .
negative	let '_s face it , they probably don_'_t even have a bottle of aspirin .
negative	avoid !
negative	it was like waiting to be hanged !
negative	!
negative	i ordered a product , not a rarity , a rug sac .
negative	it took an age to arrive , the time scales involved were only surpassed by the tracking your product option .
negative	for spain the germany to wherever .
negative	they cannot blame the christmas_period as i ordered the product after this .
negative	don_'_t buy any fashion products because they ' ill be organising themed weekends at butlin '_s before they arrive .
negative	appaulling .
negative	do not use this company
negative	work overpriced ( more than double local companies ), engineers did not turn_up ( i waited more than 0_weeks and they missed four appointments ) and they were extremely rude when they did actualy contact me .
negative	and for all of this , they actually charged me for the pleasure - without actually completing any work .
negative	still fighting for a refund !
negative	how can a well_protected , bubble_wrapped parcel get soooo badly mashed up in transit ?
negative	it '_s as if someone was jumping up and down on it .
negative	it was a large cheque to be presented to a charity , and the end_result is deeply embarrassing .
negative	thank_you myherpes .
negative	not .
negative	the service was great .
negative	when the chark line came it looked but the line is a bit hard to pull out and its a bit hard to reel in i have been working with chark lines for 00 years and this one is not right
negative	i ordered a small pair of earphones from amazon and they are being posted by you .
negative	i got next_day delivery .
negative	i ordered them last sunday and still havnt received them , we even put a clearer sign out side our house to exclude that , we couldnt find you excuse because we saw you drive past our house !
negative	and again same email to the exact word .
negative	now ill get the same message as everyone_else which probably wont work and receive no explanation .
negative	why ?
negative	ordered something , got it , all good there .
negative	then i tried to work out on the overly_complicated members area if i was signed_up to anything .
negative	no , i was not .
negative	0 month later i find a £_00 charge on my bank_statement for prime .
negative	i never asked for this and had to spend 00_minutes of my time trying to figure_out how to contact them .
negative	yes , i got a refund , but this to me is a very unethical way to conduct_business !!
negative	!
negative	don_'_t think i will use them again
negative	the online_chat was helpful , but the fact that you lost the order will mean that i will probably not use cewe_photoworld again .
negative	there are many other_providers of photobooks and i guess the old saying ' you get what you pay for ' sums up my experience .
negative	i ' d rather pay more and not have to chase up an order .
negative	thanks and good luck in the future
negative	i purchased sky_broadband via the topcashback website in july with the promise of cashack within 0months .
negative	however , there is no display of any transactions made on my account , just evidence of clicks to merchants .
negative	a missing cashback_claim lodged has not yielded any fruit .
negative	i previously recommended this site to friends , but on this evidence base , perhaps i should be telling them to avoid instead .
negative	ordered 0xpurina veterinary diet ha ( hypoallergenic ) order no 0000000 on 00th_june
negative	still_haven_'_t received it .
negative	in desperation had to go back to my vet and pay £_00 . 00 for a 00kg_bag .
negative	thanks a bunch .
negative	delayed the order for several weeks due to one item being out of stock .
negative	i then changed the order and was due a refund - this was never sent .
negative	hopeless service , no phone number , no response to e_- mails .
negative	avoid at all costs !
negative	my parcel ( worth £_000 ) was ' delivered ' to a bin ... only the driver is now unsure which bin .. and where ..
negative	the driver claimed it was delivered to a ' black bin ' but i don_'_t have one outside my property and next door only have red and yellow bins .. three_weeks has passed since it was ' delivered ' and i still have no item .. no note was left at mine or next doors to say it was in the bin .
negative	who on earth thought putting a £_000 parcel in a bin was smart ?
negative	left alone not telling anyone
negative	ive wasted roughly half a day on e_mails back and forth and calling up about the parcel .
negative	if i could be_bothered i would be pursuing loss of earnings but doubtless this would have to be through small_claims court which would take months so no point .
negative	nicole brown however has done her best to chase the location of the missing parcel and has kept up with communication , thank_you nicole .. seemingly the only person at your company who gives a ****
negative	stop dumping ( you call it delivering ) parcels in bins !!
negative	they are for refuse collection .. my £_000 parcel is not refuse !
negative	!
negative	the whereabouts of the parcel are still unknown as the delivery driver cant_remember where they ' delivered it ' but are confident it was delivered somewhere ... wow .. they will go far in life !!
negative	!
negative	in the mean time i now have to spend more of my time sorting_out a replacement parcel with the company i spent the £_000 with in the first place .
negative	i couldn_'_t be me more sincere when i say ' i hope i never have the miss fortune of ever having to deal with interparcel / hermes ever again .
negative	instead of an e_mail saying sorry .. how about you compensate me for the 0 hours ive wasted chasing this missing parcel and sack the driver who cant even remember where the parcel went ?
negative	allan chambers
negative	i tried to book a return flight , as opodo was the only site that showed one of the legs as available .
negative	i assumed they had bulk bought some tickets , and that '_s why they were there .
negative	turns_out not , and the flights weren_'_t available .
negative	opodo took the full balance instantly .
negative	i tried to phone customer_services , and after being on hold for 00_minutes , got to speak to someone , who said the whole booking would be refunded .
negative	about a week after the money had been taken , a refund came to my card for just the failed booking , not the full_amount i was originally advised - enabling opodo to keep all of the fees and handling charges for the original booking total amount .
negative	i '_m still in discussion trying to get the relative proportion of the fees recovered , but i don_'_t want to give them more money by calling the non geographic_number , and it takes about a week for anyone to reply to an email .
negative	in summary , i ' d say don_'_t bother .
negative	it would have been cheaper and a lot less hassle to book with the airline directly .
negative	on the face of it prices look good but service is dreadful , no communication . i bought 0 items one i found out was in stock and the other i found out after a couple of weeks was not . first item still_hasn_'_t been delivered after 0_weeks and other item they could not supply although still advertising on website . i won_'_t be doing_business with this company again regardless of price !!!!!
negative	ps item not in stock and couldnt supply was top of the range tecnifibre squash_racket , you can buy them anywhere online and delivered in a few_days .
negative	i purchased a tv from appliances direct .
negative	as soon as i went to check out , they automatically add £_00 worth of rubbish i didnt ask for or want to the basket .
negative	once removed i clicked the how much delivery will be button : £ 0 . 00 , but when i went to check out after filling these details in this prices wasnt available as i live in aberdeen ( aberdeen is not highlands !)
negative	as my wife and i work full time i paid the extra money for the tv to be delivered on the saturday .
negative	we sat inside all day waiting for the tv to arrive ( no approximate_time is given ).
negative	no tv arrived .
negative	i phoned the expensive helpline on monday and after sitting on hold , going through lots of menus i eventually explained the situation .
negative	i was promised a call within_00hrs .
negative	i waited the two_days .
negative	no tv arrived and i received no phone_call .
negative	again i called and pretty_much started the proceedings again .
negative	this time i was promised a call within 00_hrs .
negative	again no delivery and i received no phone_call .
negative	i phoned
negative	again and found out nothing , they had no idea if the tv had been dispatched .
negative	but this time i got an email_saying i need to wait a week for a responce ... im still_waiting .....
negative	after i submitted the review , i was contacted by a member of their management_team and appologied to .
negative	the investigation failed to find anything out , so another tv was scheduled for delivery two_weeks after the initial delivery was meant to be made .
negative	due to the terrible service i received i asked for the price of the tv to be reduced to the now lower price being offered online and that i get a full_refund for the delivery cost .
negative	i was promised both of these refunds .
negative	after waiting in all saturday again i received no tv !!!
negative	i also received neither of the refunds .
negative	avoid_avoid_avoid .
negative	beware - the website says everything is in stock - it isn_'_t .
negative	it has said this the whole month i have been waiting for my plasma .
negative	they don_'_t answer emails and rarely answer the phone - when they do it '_s promises but no action .
negative	i '_ve had to get credit_card company to suspend the transaction .
negative	worst online outfit i have ever_encountered .
negative	i ordered flowers well in advance for valentines_day , but the 00th came and went with no sign of the flowers .
negative	they finally got delivered on the 00th ( not quite the point for valentines_day ) and despite me opening a support_ticket ( because i couldn_'_t get hold of them by phone ) they just closed the ticket with no explanation / apology .
negative	useless and will never use again .
negative	i thought 0 and 0 had awful customer service but easy space are infinitely worse .
negative	i really cannot_believe_how a company can have such atrocious customer service .
negative	i have waited almost a week for my queries to be answered .
negative	the senior escalation manager keeps stating that my queries have all been answered , although they haven_'_t , and keeps closing my ticket ( the one complaining_about the other tickets not being answered ).
negative	it '_s actually quite comical , or would be if i didn_'_t really need a response .
negative	i seriously think the email support is just a robot answering system .
negative	there is no evidence of any intelligence behind it whatsoever .
negative	totally_unacceptable service .
negative	scottish_power couldn_'_t even run a sweet shop .
negative	i switched from edf because of their terrible service and scottish_power took incorrect opening readings .
negative	i have told them about this and they fail to issue a credit .
negative	you cannot get through to a human_being ( well it takes about 00_mins of waiting ).
negative	i would like to see them wait that long for a customer to answer .
negative	quite the worst service i have ever had , so i will close my account .
negative	placed an order on 0 / 00 / 00 and paid an extra £ 0 . 00 for 00hr delivery as i needed the item before going travelling at the end of the week .
negative	it '_s now 0 / 00 / 00 and i haven_'_t even been sent a confirmation_email to say they '_ve received my order even_though it '_s marked as " complete " on their site and my account has_been charged the full_amount .
negative	an email to customer_care yesterday lunchtime has_gone_unanswered .
negative	i ' d sooner recommend chemical castration than this using this lot .
negative	flower where old and at the bottom of parcel also all different_sizes valentines_day bear said baby_girl on it , me and my partner are not expecting a little_girl !!!!
negative	very in happy .
negative	this store has terrible staff , and managment .
negative	they are rude , arogant and extremely unhelpful .
negative	they will do their up most not to do an exchange or a refund , reciept or no reciept .
negative	i have had more than one problem with this branch .
negative	store assistant " amanda " is particualy rude and has a very clever attitude , i think she things she owns the whole company .
negative	store manager andy is very poorly_trained and not management material at all .
negative	i have never had any trouble or bad service at other argos stores , just keighley , so stay_away from there if you think you may need to return anything .
negative	in fact stay_away full stop , not a nice store at all .
negative	i hear the same about the store from friends , family , and just people i know passing me in the street , keighley argos has a terrible reputation , especially regarding its staff .
negative	i would not use them again because they did not deliver as promised despite charging for it .
negative	0rd edit_:
negative	just had an extremely arrogant chap call me up from chess to tell me that i owe them money and that because i have ignored all their efforts to contact me over this debt his department the escalated debt department were now dealing_with the matter .
negative	because of the tone taken i asked to speak to [_name ]' s supervisor but he refused to do this .
negative	it was very clear that [_name_] didn_'_t have a clue regarding any of the account history and that he didn_'_t believe a word i said on the phone .
negative	so after countless_emails and a few telephone_calls chess are still claiming that i have never contacted them and that i owe them money ( which they are adding fees to despite their claims of no small_print )
negative	one to avoid .
negative	so yet another example of chess '_s terrible customer_services and dodgy business_practices .
negative	one to avoid 0 / 00 .
negative	0nd edit_:
negative	just a note to say that chess have been in touch again .
negative	interestingly chess have decided to try and hold me to terms and conditions which i have never signed_up to or agreed to .
negative	i signed_up through thevirtualnumbercompany and this website still says " no small_print " and " 00 days cancellation notice "
negative	they claim that they have not received any of the numerous email that i have sent to them .
negative	chess are amongst the most dishonest companies i have ever_encountered .
negative	0 / 00 terrible company .
negative	original text :
negative	i became a chess_telecom customer through the virtual phone number company around 00 months_ago .
negative	i have two lines , one is a local number the other is an 0000 number .
negative	both are on a 00 day rolling agreement .
negative	they have consistently overcharged me line rental and despite_numerous attempt to get them to rectify the situation they have simply ignored me .
negative	their staff on the phone can see that i am being charged too much but cant understand_why or do anything about it .
negative	so after almost 00 months i gave them their marching orders .
negative	having paid one month in advance and being on a one month deal i don_'_t owe them anything .
negative	they owe me !
negative	however as they can '_t even get the basic billing right i doubt i have any chance of getting the money they owe me !
negative	to add_insult to injury chess have ignored my cancellation and have continued to send bills .
negative	i have cancelled the direct_debit with the bank but this hasn_'_t deterred them .
negative	i have replied to every email they have sent but have never had a response in return .
negative	now they are adding fees to the account and threatening me with their legal team who will apparently pursue me .
negative	yet it is they who owe me money !
negative	so here the bottom_line .
negative	if you choose chess they will overcharge you , they will ignore your emails and when you choose to leave they will_continue to bill you and threaten you .
negative	0 / 00 from me .
negative	terrible company .
negative	edit .
negative	: i have now been contacted by someone from chess_telecom .
negative	however that person denied the company was overcharging me and when i said i was not in the office at the moment and was unable to give detailed_information about the over charging because i didn_'_t have the invoices in front of me , the put the phone down .
negative	another great example of chess telecoms terrible customer service .
negative	i should also add that a message has_been left on the answering_machine asking me to call them up on a premium_rate number !
negative	so again 0 / 00 terrible company .
negative	having been a customer with ybs for a long time i always believed they were better_than the banks and that i could trust them .
negative	this changed when i was overcharged by a third_party using direct_debit .
negative	when i tried to claim the money back using the direct_debit guarantee i found it wasn_'_t worth the paper it was written on .
negative	they refused to give a full and immediate_refund and while i did eventually get my money refunded it took a lot of time and hassle .
negative	it wasn_'_t the worry free experience the guarantee offers .
negative	if you are looking for a trust_worthy alternative to the high_street banks , the ybs isn_'_t it .
negative	sadly .
negative	akinika is one of the worst companies i have ever had the misfortune to deal with .
negative	when they called me they claimed to be her majesties revenue and customs calling about tax credits .
negative	it soon turned_out that the akinika employee was being dishonest as they did not have information which hmrc have .
negative	akinika claimed that i have been overpaid tax credits and that i have received and ignored a letter they have sent me .
negative	neither is true .
negative	the akinika staff refused to log the dispute and refused to investigate , they simply demand i make payment to them immediately .
negative	they even refused to provide information about their company , even their address .
negative	akinika have a website but it doesn_'_t list the companies registered address , or any address .
negative	it doesn_'_t list the companies registration details or status .
negative	there is no provision to make a complaint .
negative	this company doesn_'_t care for normal uk trading_laws or debt_collection regulations .
negative	took 0 month payment in advance , yet when we left after two years they forgot about that and refused to give us our money back .
negative	leaving us £_00 out of pocket .
negative	after selling a product and receiving payment through paypal i shipped it confidently .
negative	however when the buyer received it they decided they wanted it cheaper and paypal removed the whole amount from my account .
negative	this meant i had no product and no money .
negative	ebay just doesn_'_t care about its customers .
negative	it is geared up for handing disputes between buyers and sellers but when ebay gets it wrong you might as well talk to the wall .
negative	just remember , the bigger they are , the harder they fall .
negative	i '_m giving up on ebay because they keep ignoring me .
negative	i bought an iphone_0gs online for my son for christmas .
negative	the description said good workin condition .
negative	getting the phone to stay on is impossible took it to a phone shop only for it to cost me another £_00 to get it working as it should i am not happy about this at all and i will be pushing to be compensated for this as this should have been tried out before advertising it as good working condition .
negative	tried to contact the store via_email 0 days ago still_waiting for them to get back in contact with me piss_poor customer service its like u got my money now you don_'_t care .
negative	very very poor service .
negative	will not use cash generater again
negative	o / no #_00000000
negative	i deliberately chose to order from uk web sites to avoid import_taxes etc .
negative	the first i knew that the item was being imported from_hong_kong by me was when the couriers demanded i pay over £_00 to obtain delivery .
negative	because of this i could have bought the lens from john_lewis for almost exactly the same price with local supplier warranty
negative	i used hermes four times and although their deliveries were usually late the goods arrived eventually .
negative	the last time i arranged for a parcel to be collected from our business premises the courier arrived and said she didn_'_t have room in her vehicle for it , she would come_back later when she had made some deliveries and had room .
negative	she didn_'_t return .
negative	i called parcel0go , the agency who made the booking and took the payment , they said they couldn_'_t act until three_days had passed .
negative	two_weeks passed with p0g saying that it wasn_'_t their problem and hermes said that they couldn_'_t discuss it because i had booked through a 0 party .
negative	no courier ever arrived and i had to book again , this time with city_link who came the following_morning at 00 : 00 and the parcel was delivered the next_morning before 0am .
negative	our business uses a self - storage_facility locally as an overflow warehouse and in talking to the manager there i was told that hermes used to be customers .
negative	i saw a video of the loading_bay when hermes couriers were handling customer '_s packages they were thrown around , kicked and generally mishandled including being left_outside in the rain the couriers vehicles were private cars stuffed full of packages .
negative	in one scene a woman manages to slam a side door shut with two soft packages hanging out .
negative	when the car reaches the gate and the courier gets out to key in an exit code she_sees the packages jammed in the door and pulls one out without opening the door , you can see the package rip open , she looks at the contents and slings the damaged item over onto the passenger_seat , she then opens the back door and about ten items fall out onto the soaking road .
negative	watching this performance and then being told that the couriers get paid 00p for each delivery which has to cover wages , fuel and car use , i can understand_why so many deliveries go_wrong .
negative	i will never use hermes again and have written to p0g saying that i think they are disreputable for using hermes , i have a strange feeling that these two companies may have more of a relationship than they are prepared to admit .
negative	if it was one instance , or maybe a couple over a period of time , because we live in a house with only a house name on a lane , then i ' d give them the benefit of the doubt .
negative	but parcelforce manage .
negative	so do ups .
negative	so do fedex .
negative	even dpd seem to have finally got their act_together .
negative	but citylink - come on .
negative	every time !
negative	i '_m not exagerating .
negative	every time we have a delivery using citylink , without_fail , the first day will end with a gleeful " successfully delivered " status on their tracking with some bizarre name having signed for it .
negative	obviously , this has not actually happened .
negative	i guess it makes the driver feel better .
negative	then next_day , it '_s miraculously out again .
negative	and not delivered .
negative	again !
negative	numerous ( expensive ) phone_calls and useless emails later , and they will eventually find the house , and provide a parcel that looks_like it '_s lost an argument with a forklift truck .
negative	our house has got a nameplate on the gate .
negative	in fact , it '_s got two .
negative	it '_s 000_yards from the postcode center .
negative	it '_s been here since_0000 .
negative	it '_s just not that difficult .
negative	if a company tells_me they are using citylink now , and if there '_s an_alternative supplier , i always take the alternative .
negative	even if it '_s hermes !
negative	even they can find the house !
negative	anyway , before i started ranting about this , the web_page tells you to type this as if speaking to a friend .
negative	so in summary , if i were telling this to a friend , i ' d tell them for goodness_sake , don_'_t use citylink .
negative	so .
negative	don_'_t use citylink .
negative	for your own sake , and the sake of those you love !
negative	i have heard bad things about fitness first , but i decided to have a look for myself .
negative	on first_impressions , fitness first seemed very basic .
negative	truth be told they were renovating some areas , but still it seemed quite subpar .
negative	i enquired_about membership details , and was briefed by one of the staff .
negative	i wasn_'_t shown around the area for some reason , so the actual conditions and facilities remained a mystery to me .
negative	since i would soon be travelling_abroad , i decided to hand over my contact details to them for more information about membership in the future , which turned_out to be my biggest mistake .
negative	fast forward a week_later , i was packing for holiday when my phone rang .
negative	turned_out to be someone from fitness first who sounded just like ali g ( rudeboy accent ?)
negative	who wanted to talk more about the membership i enquired_about .
negative	i politely told_him that i was currently busy packing for holiday and would like to talk more about this when i return to the uk , however he was not willing to accept this and continued to talk about the membership plan .
negative	i then politely told_him a second time that i was busy packing , to which he rudely hung_up on me mid sentence , which i have to say really irritated me .
negative	00_minutes later , my phone blared at me again , another person from fitness first with the same intentions .
negative	whilst he wasn_'_t as rude as the previous person , it was at this point i ended_up blocking the phone number from contacting me directly ever again .
negative	will i ever get to finish packing today ??
negative	i could imagine a queue of fitness first staff just waiting to turn my phone into a christmas_tree .
negative	never again will i want to associate with fitness first and their etiquettes , like a bunch of obnoxious school kids waiting in line at a sweet shop to pester the cashier .
negative	in short , i really cannot recommend fitness first to anyone and would advise people to not even bother enquiring_about joining .
negative	if the staff are that rude and persistent to a potential curious new member to their gym , i dread to think the treatment i will receive upon becoming an actual member , and that '_s forgetting all the bad_stories i '_ve heard .
negative	chiquitos has to be the worst dining experience i '_ve ever had .
negative	having never eaten there before , i was excited to try out their menu , but my eagerness soon turned to utter dissapointment .
negative	first and last time i '_ll ever go there .
negative	upon_arriving at the entrance , we were looked at by the passing staff , but not spoken to or acknowledged , which was very strange .
negative	when we were finally allowed to sit_down in one of the darkened corners of the restaurant , the staff_member took his sweet time in finding menus for us , which actually was just the beginning of this painfully_slow service .
negative	you ' d think ordering a simple beverage would be as simple as either opening a can or filling the glass up from a dispenser .
negative	no idea what the staff were doing as the drinks took around 0 minutes to arrive which probaly isn_'_t that long to wait ... had it not been us as 0 of the only 0 tables occupied in the entire restaurant .
negative	the starters took 00_minutes to arrive , and the nacho - things we ordered where actually moist and tasted stale , and it was barely warm and didn_'_t taste great .
negative	it was at this point when i realised i needed to get out of here , but we still waited for the rest of our meal .
negative	as for the main course , it took a good 00 or so minutes to arrive .
negative	and even then , it wasn_'_t even hot , just luke_warm .
negative	infact i stuck my fingers in it and took a photo to post on my facebook to share my experiences with my friends , which prompted them to also reveal they had bad_experiences eating at chiquitos .
negative	the restaurant is not even busy and i have no idea what the chefs in the kitchen are doing , but a bunch of meatballs and some rice surely can '_t take that long to cook ?
negative	sure_enough , we weren_'_t the only ones suffering , as another table near us was complaining_about the service .
negative	i couldn_'_t be_bothered to complain , having worked a mean shift earlier and not in the mood for confrontation .
negative	well , thank_god it all came to an end and as i left , i muttered " i can '_t wait to get out of here " to one of the tables as we were leaving .
negative	last time i ever set foot in any of their branches .
negative	being involved in the food industry myself ( just as a regular chef mind you , not a managerial expert so don_'_t think i '_m a know - it - all ), i can '_t help but mention that there are so many things wrong with chiquitos , especially with the professionalism of the staff , i '_m baffled they still remain in business .
negative	unfortunately the experience was so bad i started_using the chiquitos word to describe things i dislike , albeit with slightly mispelt letters to rhyme with a certain naughty word .
negative	i ' d definately recommend to everyone to avoid chiquitos at all cost to prevent utter dissapointment and a waste of money .
negative	like i said , first and last time i '_ll go there .
negative	the quantity and quality of flowers were very poor , most of the roses were wilting and dying .
negative	furthermore the free chocolates that were supposed to accompany them , did not .
negative	the service from rentalcars . com was abysmal , totally unusable in that they did not ever give me a voucher in time to use to collect the booked car .
negative	in fact , after i have finished my journey in a self - hired rental car , rentalcars . com have still not provided me with a voucher number , so i have to instruct my bank to reverse their charges as nbo service was provided .
negative	great if everything goes_smoothly but if they mess up they just ignore you .
negative	even when you do get a reply to an email and you reply back to them again , they '_ll ignore you for about a week or 0
negative	didn_'_t receive my order on the day i was supposed to so the next_day i phone up .
negative	after waiting on the phone for over half an_hour i went through to an agent that muted their headset , they accidently took it off mute and i said " i know someone '_s there because you just took me off mute " then they hung_up the phone .
negative	ended_up cancelling the order .
negative	but yet they still sent it out 0 days_later ( it now being 0 day since it should have been delivered ).
negative	this all happened at the end of june and i '_ve only just got my refund today .
negative	absolutely_shocking service , and in my opinion , unreasonable delivery charges , will never use them again .
negative	bodybuildingwarehouse is cheaper with free delivery and same quality .
negative	they also maintain contact with customers , even speaking to me on twitter .
negative	i '_ve had friend who have also had lots of problems with my protein and it '_s took them months to get refunds and have things rectified
negative	the shed that i ordered was great well built and easy to put_together however customer service was terrible and shedstore was not able to resolve a simple problem .
negative	the shed was to be delivered in mid april_0000 .
negative	i rang shedstore the day before to find out whether it would be a morning or afternoon delivery .
negative	i was called back and told that it would be an afternoon delivery .
negative	i therefore went out in the morning and came back just before 00 : 00 to find the shed part stacked in the drive .
negative	no delivery paperwork had been left , there were no assembly_instructions and the roll of roof felt was ripped and had holes in .
negative	had i been at home , i would not have accepted the roof felt .
negative	i immediately contacted shedstore who emailed me the instructions and asked for a photpograph of the damaged felt .
negative	i immediately sent a photograph .
negative	that was on 00th_april .
negative	i sent a follow_up email on the 00th_april because i hadn_'_t had a response to my first email .
negative	i then started telephoning them .
negative	i must have made 0 - 0 phone_calls to them .
negative	they are always very pleasant on the phone and promised that i would get a replacement felt sheet quickly or that someone from the manufacturer would call .
negative	none of this happened until 0th_may ( about 0_weeks after i notified them of the damage ) and guess_what ... the new roof felt was cut about 00mm too short so could not be used .
negative	luckily a friend had a part roll of felt so i used this instead .
negative	i would not use shedstore again .
negative	there are many similar companies out there and i would hope that at_least one would have a better customer service department .
negative	booked a week holiday hotel in italy from uk .
negative	on contacting hotel to book taxi from airport , hotel informed be not booked .
negative	expedia never informed me it was cancelled and i had booking confirmation e_mail .
negative	on spending fortune for one hour on phone to expedia , they could not explain_why and did not care at all .
negative	avoid expedia like the plague , i am putting this review on every site i can find
negative	took my order and payment .
negative	0 week_later - email from tredz tells_me items are out of stock , but will be in end of week .
negative	0_weeks_later - email from tredz items will be in stock end of month !
negative	asked to immediately despatch in stock items .
negative	0_weeks_later grips and chain arrive .
negative	this was a trial purchase with ordinary bike items , but it seems tredz are happy to sell you items they don_'_t have .
negative	this is in breach of the distance_selling_regulations .
negative	six_weeks .
negative	no delivery .
negative	still advertising 0 days .
negative	i can just imagine the fun i '_m going to have getting a refund .
negative	i had ordered stuff for my daughter for easter and paid for next_day delivery the items were meant to come on the saturday they did not arrive until the wednesday after easter which was no good then wont be shopping here again
negative	placed order with woolworth for some canvas_prints .
negative	told they would be received by such and such a date then heard_nothing .
negative	only by checking the website re status of delivery did i find the order had been stopped due to out of stock and they never even bothered to inform_me .
negative	would not use the site again .
negative	so after having my grand die and having an_emergency c section to save my daughter life i choose to order mine and my husbands funeral clothing on boohoo . com as in unable to move around to get to the shops !
negative	my item was ment to be delivered yesterday which apparently it has_been left in a secure place ( why couldn_'_t you knock on the door ?)
negative	so now after_contacting customer service i need to go print a form off and then send it back to them to get my items resent or refunded .
negative	i don_'_t have a printer in my house so it means i '_m going to have to travel to the closest library to use one which isn_'_t open_till tuseday when my funeral is .
negative	all in all boohoo have just added a bunch of stress on to a very stressful time .
negative	i will never shop with you again .
negative	got sent the wrong phone returned it told i would be given a new handset free of charge 0_weeks_later still no phone !
negative	to now be told that its not in the notes bunch of lying twats !
negative	when i saw your advert i didn_'_t realise that i was only to get one flyswat as the advert only spoke about flyswats ( plural ).
negative	i think that the price of £ 0 - 00 for one flyswat was grossly overpriced as it would cost pennies to make in china .
negative	thank_god it was postage free
negative	i obtained a business insurance quotes , sole purpose of pulling together a business plan for a new venture .
negative	received the 0 suggested quotes after completing a short form .
negative	i have since received pushy_sales calls from the broker company which is behind moneysupermarket . com .
negative	they are very pushy , and only interested in trying to secure a sale / commission .
negative	at no point are you informed that sales calls and emails will follow , and despite ticking the ' no marketing ' option i still get hassled .
negative	my advice to anyone_thinking of using them : don_'_t give them any contact details under any circumstances , unless of course you enjoy having your inbox filled with spam .
negative	i only give one star as the system doesn_'_t allow you to leave zero .
negative	pay for a next_day delivery which is collected on thursday , arriving at aberdeen_depot ( destination depot ) on friday_morning only to sit there until the following_tuesday .
negative	pacels0go uses other couriers to carryout the logistics such as tnt / dhl etc and immediately blames these partners when something_goes_wrong .
negative	don_'_t try and leave any negative_feedback on p0g facebook or website as it is immediately deleted .
negative	clearly only want folk to know about the good experiences and not the numerous_occasions when things go_wrong .
negative	poor service logistically and also the customer service abilities leave a lot to be desired !
negative	ive had really bad_experiences whilst ordering groceries online with asda .
negative	delivery late ( no warning / notice )
negative	customer service appauling ( dont_know what they are talking_about )
negative	substitution a joke ( eg butternut squash substituted with peanut_butter )
negative	have to assist drive to get your items from the van
negative	items frequently missing but charged
negative	i refuse to shop online with them now !
negative	very difficult to obtain info as email links do not seem to accept any password including new ones agreed over the phone .
negative	emails contradictory . original camera defective and eventually returned .
negative	reference_numbers keep changing so impossible to track by phone or email .
negative	receptionist declined to accept order number as she could not use it on her system !
negative	had emails requesting info re return of camera after receiving confirmation_email that they had received it !!
negative	at same time had email_saying that i could have a refund if i wanted .
negative	found out later that order had been cancelled despite further request for info to aid tracking the order .
negative	l hand does not appear to know what the r hand is doing .
negative	net result no camera ( was a christmas_present ) and no refund yet .
negative	could not recommend them
negative	i placed my order for a galaxy ace phone on the 00th of november and it is now 0th of december and still have no phone . i have phoned got no joy , sent e_- mails someone will get back to you that is the answer i keep getting still hoping i will get a reply to say when my phone will be on its way if ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	avoid !
negative	!
negative	i ordered flowers , registered my details ( including mobile and email ) and received order confirmation .
negative	the order was for the following_day , for my 00 year_old grandmas birthday ; no delivery took place and no notification of attempted delivery was left .
negative	i have received no contact , in 0 days from eflorist informing_me of any_issues .
negative	my grandma was extremely disappointed , this is the worst customer service i '_ve ever_experienced .
negative	order not sent out .
negative	no contact to explain_why .
negative	use this company at your_peril .
negative	once they have your money you ' re irrevelent .
negative	i sent my phone in full working order no cracks or scratches however when it came to paying me my money they did not offer the full_amount it is the first time i have used this company and is going to be the last i have always used mazuma and never had problems and been paid the full_amount with them .
negative	they may offer you a little more for your phone but when it comes to paying out they will offer you less making_excuses because they think that the seller will just want the money and take what is offered .
negative	reading the comments it '_s clear that this company does this on a regular_basis , it would suggest the complaints_department are not doing there jobs properly as i '_m_sure they would not keep getting the same bad_reviews
negative	the only positive i can say about this is i did get my phone back
negative	i ordered flowers for my wife '_s birthday and they arrive the day after her_birthday with no water , dry and looking very ill . having contacted them about this , there was no customer service or offer of a refund .
negative	absolutely gutted as the surprise was total spoilt .
negative	order some flowers on thursday last_week to be delivered on friday and they didnt arrive or on saturday or today !
negative	just spoke to someone on the live support and after asking me all the same question i had to fill out to get on the live_chat , he said there has_been a system error so they didnt get delivered .
negative	i asked_him for them to be delivered tomorrow then and he said he cant do that as its past the cut_off date !
negative	i told_him he missed my cut_off date by 0 days so he should be ale to get them delivered tomorrow .
negative	after alot of him not really understanding what i was saying , we agreed they will be delivered on wednesday .
negative	we shall see !!
negative	kind of too late on wednesday though , ruined the moment !
negative	!
negative	the virgin_media product has_been poor .
negative	the customer service has_been poor .
negative	the only time i have had them seem eager to communicate is whrn they want to sell more product at which point they are very persistent .
negative	sent ipad for repair to oxford - signature obtained for po receipt
negative	have not heard_anything since i am wondering_if this is a scam
negative	if go_electrical are serious about improving the shopping_experience for their customers ( as they say they are ) they could do the following :
negative	a ) ask the girl in sales not to get irritated when you ask to speak to the customer_services team . it appears they do not have a direct line and you are unable to talk to them . it '_s an email service .
negative	suggestion , have a direct line to " customer_services "
negative	b ) ask the girl on sales , not to get irritated when you ask to speak to the " accounts team ".
negative	incidentally when i rang the shop i was told the " team " consisted of one person .
negative	suggestion , have a direct line to the " accounts team " so you can discuss why your refund hasn_'_t arrived .
negative	c ) ten days after returning my damaged item i rang paypal to ask where my refund was .
negative	it was initiated 0 days after returning the item . i was told by paypal there were insufficient funds in the account and they were having to extract money from the funding source which could take 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	i got the money 00 days after the item was returned .
negative	suggestion , keep your paypal_account fluid .
negative	d ) i was told that refunds are done in " weekly batches " which is meaningless when you are asking when you can expect your money . i . e you can '_t speak to accounts to get any explanation as to where your money is . i got a brief email 00 days before i received my money saying it had been processed to my account . if there ' d been money in the paypal_account i wouldn_'_t have had to wait so long .
negative	i was told i would be called back but wasn_'_t and received a screen print of the paypal refund insisting the money was in my account it wasn_'_t .
negative	suggestion , check your facts before sending terse emails .
negative	don_'_t get the customer to do the donkey work of ringing paypal , do it at the behest of the customer when it '_s your mistake .
negative	believe the customer when they say the money is not in their account .
negative	why not adopt a more friendly helpful service .
negative	irritable unsympathetic staff drag you down .
negative	your reviews suggest your happy customers are those when things go well .
negative	when things go badly ( returns , out of stock etc ) you never seem to get it right .
negative	you certainly don_'_t seem to really want to listen to feedback to improve . the worst online retail experience of my life .
negative	orange were previously an excellent network , but since the merger with t - mobile they '_ve been on a mission to be abject di ** s about everything , everywhere :
negative	the customer service leaves a lot to be desired .
negative	the left hand is often oblivious to what the right hand is doing .
negative	staff are rude , abrupt and lacking in appropriate knowledge .
negative	the network_coverage has_become considerably poor .
negative	any postcode i '_m in , inconveniently , exists in a " network hole ."
negative	funny that , because their online service checker doesn_'_t seem to share that opinion , but their staff obviously know something an_automated checking service does not .
negative	still , constant contradictions , mobile service outages and rude staff aside , they ' re doing a fine job .
negative	i used this company to buy an mp0_player that never showed up .
negative	they never refunded my money , and , as i i used a debit_card , my bank weren_'_t very helpful either .
negative	they didn_'_t reply to any emails , and they have no phone number .
negative	these_guys are dirty scammers .
negative	f_* k ' em !
negative	for anyone who_wants to receive good quality products or decent customer service , do not use sport and leisure uk .
negative	heres why :
negative	my wife ordered a massage_chair for her business as hers needs_replacing .
negative	the chair arrived and had a number of issues , primarily the fact that it was poorly_constructed and so the seat did not sit squarely on the frame ( as well as other issues regarding parts not fitting on correctly ) not wanting to risk the well - being of her customers using the chair , she called sports and leisure uk the same day and explained the issues .
negative	we were offered a replacement product which we declined as we did not trust that there would not be the same issue again ( as many other_reviewers on this site have found !)
negative	we were asked to take photographs of the problem and email them on to prove the chair was faulty which we duly did .
negative	we received a call to say they agreed there appeared to be a problem but they would need an engineer to verify this , so my wife had to wait in for a second time for a courier to arrive to pick the chair up .
negative	a few_days_later we received a call to say the engineer found no issues with the chair and it was user error !
negative	my wife has_been using exactly the same chair sourced from another company for a number of years and so knows exactly how to put it up .
negative	we have asked a number of times for a refund and each time been refused as they claim there is no issue with the chair , despite our photos to prove otherwise .
negative	our options are :
negative	0 .
negative	receive the same faulty chair back and pay £_00 for the privilege of having it back on top of the original cost
negative	0 .
negative	not receive it back , be left without a product and be charged £_00 for the cost of the courier having had to pick it up from us !!!
negative	the chair only cost £_00 in the first place !
negative	!
negative	so we have no chair , and no refund which is completely_unacceptable .
negative	my wife is 0 months pregnant and so i do not want her having the stress of dealing_with incompetent customer service reps who have no interest in what the customer wants and who lie about whether managers are in the office .
negative	we were told that a manager who sent us an email 0 minutes earlier was not in the office today !
negative	however , they will not speak to me as my wife placed the order .
negative	i have now had to get the credit_card company involved to try and get my money back
negative	my advice to anyone : do not use this company .
negative	poor quality goods supplied , and then they will refuse to refund your money .
negative	daylight_robbery .
negative	i feel that the ceo of orange should be_ashamed of the people he has working for him .
negative	thank_god for the cooling_off period i really dodged that bullet
negative	hi friend
negative	i bought some oakleys from you a few weeks_ago .
negative	i noticed that you took the money from my account .
negative	however , there is still no sign of my glasses .
negative	can i possibly have my money back or a pair of sunglasses if its not too much_trouble ?
negative	or are you planning on just keeping my money ?
negative	thanks
negative	adam
negative	i ordered then returned a part that you sent me that was wrong , for a fridge_freezer .
negative	i returned this quite a while ago now and still_havent had a full_refund back onto my bank card !!!!
negative	not happy
negative	i made a mistake on my order but didn_'_t notice this until i had paid for it .
negative	i thought never mind i '_ll cancel the order then re - order the correct items .
negative	i cancelled it within 0 mins of placing it , then ordered the correct items on a seperate order only later to be told the order had already been processed and could not be cancelled ( why not ?
negative	i clearly hadn_'_t left the warehouse within 0 minutes when i was ordering at 00 : 00 at night !)
negative	so my order couldn_'_t be cancelled .
negative	two_days_later i receive duplicate orders , and items i did not want .
negative	i contacted my protein to return the items only to be told i would have to meet the cost of returning them .
negative	an_absolute_disgrace i believe since they failed to prevent the items i didn_'_t want been sent in the first place .
negative	this was a totally_unacceptable circumstance and my protein have just lost a good customer over this !
negative	!
negative	had problems with an interface i purchased from here a few_years_ago .
negative	the company just did not want to assist me in the matter .
negative	luckily i found out later i just needed a driver update .
negative	recently i purchased an active subwoofer from them .
negative	the item became_faulty on its fourth use but i did not diagnose the problem to the unit until a few weeks_later .
negative	from my first contact with them regarding the issue it took them 0_weeks to replace the faulty_unit , plus i had to contact the manufacturer to arrange the warranty cover myself !!
negative	( this should be their job )
negative	i did offer for them to credit_note me as i wanted some more_expensive items as an_alternative but they refused !
negative	terrible service , incredibily difficult to get hold of there person in charge of service department ( sam ) and all_round bad_experience !
negative	i will not be using them ever again and will make_sure all the contacts i know who also buy dj & sound equipment know to avoid this company .
negative	they delivered the wrong item then refused to deliver the replacement at a suitable time causing a 00 mile_round_trip to the delivery depot i wouldn_'_t recommend them
negative	absolutely gutted that i have another holiday booked with them this year .
negative	i paid my hotel fee for 0 nights in marrakesh in march this year .
negative	got on the plane and got to the hotel , just to find out that there was no reservation done i had to call travel rep from abroad and spend £_00 just to get told that the company they worked with was no_longer int_he business and that they were going to sort the hotel for me ... ( didn_'_t have the decency to let_me know before i left home , or advise me how this was going to work ) i had to waste money that they are not not happy to refund as it wasn_'_t their fault .
negative	; seriously disappointed with these_people .
negative	if you pick them make_sure they give you a written confirmation that your hotel has_been booked and proof from the hotel would be ideal too ,
negative	processed a cancelled order and then tried to make me pay for it !
negative	complete_joke and just pure incompetence .
negative	avoid_avoid_avoid .

negative	and i still wait for answer about my order witch was missing my creatine ....:(
negative	we have recently ordered a blue green rug from made .
negative	when delivered it had no elements of blue - green only and they will not provide a full_refund and cover the cost of pickup instead claim we have changed our mind .
negative	photos were provided clearly showing the variation and they have refused to admit what seems to have been an error on their web_site .
negative	exceptionally poor customer service !
negative	ordered a costume and paid £_00 for express delivery only for my product to arrive after the date for which it was needed .
negative	wouldn_'_t use site again
negative	would have been two stars but that review was referred for referring to another company .
negative	this one doesn_'_t , it is entirely about mighty_deals and not any other individual , organisation or company .
negative	i hope that is clear .
negative	customer service was unanswered and overall i would not use again nor advise anyone i knew to consider doing so .
negative	the sailing experience was spoilt by the attitude of the car deck stewards .
negative	they seem to be " on commission " to pack the cars in so tightly that it is impossible to get out of your car and walk to the exit doors without getting your clothes dirty by contact with other vehicles .
negative	my wife and i are of average build , and we have an average car .
negative	despite this , once we were parked up like sardines , and we could not open the back doors to remove our overnight luggage .
negative	the adjacent cars had blocked us in .
negative	so we had to struggle to pull the bags over into the front seat area .
negative	no sympathy from the car deck stewards .
negative	to our astonishment , the customer service desk admitted there were frequent complaints , but that '_s how it had to be because " management want to pack as many cars in as possible ".
negative	we did not experience this problem during two crossings to ireland on stena line during 0000 and 0000 .
negative	why ?
negative	because stena ships are more modern and take account of modern cars being slightly_wider .
negative	the dfds fleet on this newcastle - ijmuiden route is very old .
negative	next time -- and sadly we have already booked the same routing in september -- we will wear old clothes and i may just refuse to drive my car the last metre up to the car in front .
negative	if the deck stewards have a problem , then tough .
negative	next year , we will travel hull - rotterdam on p_& o .
negative	other passengers we spoke to told us this was a better service and the car decks are not nearly so cramped .
negative	i also consider this " sardine stacking " process pust the dfds operating licence at risk .
negative	health and safety is still a legal_requirement even in international waters .
negative	photographs were taken on this trip , and i will have the camera out in september .
negative	every year , for the past eleven years , i have paid my water bill over a few_months .
negative	every year united utilities have sent me dozens of threatening_letters and made dozens of threatening phone_calls .
negative	i have written to them and phoned them , but i get nowhere .
negative	this year will be no different .
negative	why can they not communicate ?
negative	why have they no email address ?
negative	why do they waste so much money ?
negative	order number : 000a000000
negative	i strongly_recommend that you avoid purchasing a bed with dreams .
negative	i spent_nearly_£ 0 , 000 on a bed with dreams in january .
negative	eventually they arranged a delivery date for early april ( yes that long ) and i arranged a day off work to receive the bed .
negative	as part of the order we paid £_00 . 00 for a bed recycle that meant i had to take apart my old wooden_frame bed for them to collect .
negative	as the day went on i thought i had better chase dreams on a time for the delivery .
negative	on making this call , we found out that dreams had cancelled our delivery without informing us , and that the bed would not be in stock again until may .
negative	the old bed that had been taken apart was not in state to repair , so we just had an old mattress on the floor to sleep on .
negative	i have a 0 month pregnant partner who was in a situation where we have to sleep on the floor for the final 0 months of the pregnancy .
negative	i have had to purchase a 0nd_hand bed and pay a van to deliver , at my own_expense .
negative	dreams , aware of the fact they are leaving a 0 month pregnant women to sleep on the floor , have been no help whatsoever , have not made any attempt to explain the reason for the cancelled delivery ( without forceful prompting from me ), or to explain_why we have had to wait nearly_half a year for a delivery .
negative	0_weeks_ago i cancelled my order with dreams and demanded a full_refund ( phone and email ) and was told someone would get back to me on the matter to arrange the refund .
negative	i just contacted dreams again , and they have not even updated my details to say the order is cancelled , so are expecting to deliver the bed in may .
negative	so_far i have paid nearly_£ 0 , 000 for a bed i haven ’_t received and nearly_£_000 for a 0nd_hand bed and delivery to cover the inconvenience .
negative	i also lost a day of holiday for the trouble ( a day i could have spent with my new_born baby ).
negative	dreams offered my £_000 of vouchers in compensation .
negative	when i laughed at the thought of ever spending money with them again , they offered £_000 cash , but given the stress they have caused both me and my partner , i don_’_t feel they deserve any sale from me .
negative	this company have proven to be completely unreliable , unhelpful and uncooperative from day 0 .
negative	please avoid at all costs .
negative	yours ,
negative	dan
negative	the systems and processes aren_'_t adequate for an online business .
negative	if an item isn_'_t in stock ( as was the case with my purchase ), then the system should reflect this and not give the shopper a poor experience .
negative	to take a customers payment and then to take 00_hours to inform the customer and make the refund just adds insult to injury !
negative	based on my experience and to save future disappointment i won_'_t be shopping with ella james again .
negative	poor all_round experience .
negative	next_day delivery garanteed - means shit
negative	staff a friendly but not very helpfull
negative	i would defo not use them again
negative	great for getting_rid of unwanted junk but watch out for the selling charge which is sometimes difficult to see if you are an infrequent user .
negative	might be cheaper to stick an ad in the local rag .
negative	having_spoken to talk_talk about the fact that the resetting of the broadband line had not solved a connection problem we had with the modem provided by talk_talk some two years previously and which now was not able to be reset by the manufacturer but had to be reset by talk_talk as per the manufacturers instructions broadband , it was evident that the only solution was to leave talk_talk and try another_provider .
negative	i was then persuaded that the solution would be to take out a new contract which would give me a stronger connection and a new modem .
negative	i asked if this would be a seemless transition as my office of some 0 persons relied on this connection .
negative	i was assured that it was and to my surprise on the next_day when the order went through we were disconnected from the broadband .
negative	after many hours of conversations with talk_talk it was evident that the only solution they could offer was for my company to do without broadband , wait for 00 days until the order and reconnection went through .
negative	imagine what this has done to my business , a disastrous financial_loss .
negative	no compensation offered , infact when i asked for at_least three_months free rental i was told that as it was my fault talk_talk were unable to offer compensation in this instance .
negative	the staff on the whole were unaware of the systems in place for other departments to help , and the whole matter is being disputed still .
negative	we have been connected 00 days_later but no new modem has_been sent out .
negative	the time wasted by my staff in trying to configure the best response from talk_talk in order to get some work done has_been in excess of 00hours which has obviously been monitored , taped and logged .
negative	i thought using tyre - shopper was easy and gave it a good review in so_far as ordering the tyres were concerned .
negative	the tyres were for my son '_s car .
negative	he is a driving_instructor so needs tyres with goos legal tread .
negative	however when he went to national_tyres to have them fitted , they had no record of the order .
negative	national contacted head_office who said the tyres were not even ' made ' and they didn_'_t know when they would be available .
negative	they offered more_expensive ones !!!
negative	they said they had tried to contact me but there were no missed messages on my phone !
negative	these tyres were offered as tyre of the week .
negative	how can tyres be offered that don ; t even exist ?
negative	very disappointed with tyre - shopper and will not be using them again .
negative	i only hope the alternative tyres will arrive or that there will be no problem with a refund !!!
negative	!
negative	we bought a camera from pixmania .
negative	we sent it for repair just out of warranty .
negative	this took five months , not helped by emails in ' franglais '.
negative	the ' safe and secure ' payment website is a nightmare and kept saying payment failed .
negative	we tried 0 times and gave up only to find later they had processed the payment of £_000 three_times but can only get one refunded !
negative	so a repair of a screen ( which retails at £_00 by the way ) has cost us £_000 .
negative	be warned - avoid extreme frustration and expense - do not deal with this company .
negative	sorry pixmania but the world has to know how you treat some of your customers .
negative	yes i was stupid not to read the confirmstion screen before i clicked confirm , but i ended_up buying cancellation_cover i didn_'_t want , and paying a booking_fee that wasn_'_t included in the original quoted price .
negative	the supplier should not be allowed to select products for you that you have to click to deselect .
negative	i woukld love to know how much money they make from customers being caught as i was .
negative	i won_'_t be using skypark_secure again .
negative	amazon told me that my parcel was due for delivery by 00 may 0000 .
negative	i checked the parcel tracker service and saw that yodel say they attempted delivery but my address was wrong .
negative	my home is awkward to find so i called up to give details .
negative	all day today their site has said " gatwick service centre out for delivery 0 : 00 am " and here we are , over 0 hours_later and no sign , no call , no text , nothing , zip , nada .
negative	i know they say they can deliver anytime_between 0 : 00 am and 0 : 00 pm ~ potentially a 00 hour day for the driver and that doesn_'_t even include getting back to the depot .
negative	i could go into driving hours and multi - drop rules ( assuming they don_'_t use a tachograph which would be more punitive to driving hours ).
negative	given that on a good day with no traffic or other hold - up crawley is 00_minutes away from my home i can only conclude that i am not getting my parcel today .
negative	this is particularly annoying in that yesterday i spent some time on the phone giving precise details of how to find my home and passed on my home number and mobile number .
negative	a thorough waste of my day and i will probably have to go through it again until the parcel is eventually delivered .
negative	a text to give even a 0_hr time_slot would be preferable to the way i have been treated today .
negative	update
negative	parcel finally delivered at 0 : 00 pm .
negative	on talking to the driver it is clear my directions weren_'_t passed and the delivery was only made because the driver used his initiative .
negative	i do not blame the driver for my experience .
negative	i will endeavour to find out who the courier is next time and if it is yodel i would rather not place an order for goods .
negative	if they operated a text based system , like dpd did on 0 occasions for me about a week_ago , my rating would be that much higher .
negative	animals being sent to slaughter are treated better .
negative	ordered size infant & got a size 0 till 0 year_old .
negative	not very happy sizes on web_site are wrong !
negative	very very disappointed !
negative	placed , order , never rec ' d , emailed customer service , advised will get in few_days , never rec ' d item .
negative	cancelled order using online_chat .
negative	still_await refund when items get returned to sender , very unfair and unprofessional company , will never use again and will not recomend .
negative	this is something i have never had to say before about any online company .
negative	very unhappy customer still with no resolution .
negative	ordered wednesday_evening for delivery saturday for important milestone birthday which i could not attend .
negative	so thought 0 full days should be enough for delivery on the third day .
negative	had message today from royal_mail ( monday , so 0 days now ) to say flowers have been delivered .
negative	i am very disappointed with the service .
negative	spoke to prestige_flowers today , they were apologetic , but referred me to their terms and conditions that state they cannot guarantee next_day delivery .
negative	however on their website it clearly_states next_day if ordered before 0pm .
negative	if they cannot guarantee 00_hours , then don_'_t state it and hide the caveat in the terms and conditions section .
negative	they are not transparent as a company .
negative	be honest and state it on the front page by the clock , which is the bit everyone sees .
negative	will i use this company again ?
negative	i gave it 0_star for unacceptable experience .
negative	there was no offer of appeasement , although the person i spoke to was apologetic , so not her fault , there is obviously no system in place when they do not deliver what they state , however well their intentions may be .
negative	buyer_beware if delivery date is important !
negative	000 - reg have the worst support centre i have ever come_across .
negative	keep well clear or use at your own_risk .
negative	i have spent the last two years moving all of my services away from them , and still they are using outdated cards to renew services that have been cancelled and they have emailed conformations of this , but still they are renewing the services .
negative	my bank are now pursuing them for fraud .
negative	beware .
negative	up to 0_weeks delivery - no chance still_waiting - should of been delivered before_christmas for my 0 children .
negative	groupon have no control over suppliers at all .
negative	0 bean_bags ordered early november via_groupon for my children for christmas , up to 0_weeks no problem because thats before_christmas !
negative	no communication to confirm order will be delayed
negative	no reply to e_- mails
negative	groupon have no control over delivery
negative	00 days ago told bean_bag is on the way
negative	0nd bean_bag now being delivered ( we '_ll see ) in march
negative	£_00 . 00 voucher - but if you compliment company on website you get 00_euros !
negative	worst customer service i have ever received in my life ( 00 years ), looks_like infurn are monitoring this website and trying to mop up .
negative	too late .
negative	infurn e_- mailed me this week to say that they are not using dhl anymore and are using another firm , i have asked for the name of this mysterious firm and groupon or infurn are not responding .
negative	i '_m on twitter_@ craneyo and will tweet every day about this complete_lack of customer service by groupon and infurn .
negative	# beanbagjustice is the hashtag i will be using !
negative	virgin_media helpline - spent 00_minutes with operator who was unable to help and so transferred me to customer service , then 00_minutes on hold before being told that customer service had closed at 0 .
negative	on hold again .
negative	phone has now run out of batteries .
negative	vm used to be ok with their helpdesk - not any more !
negative	poor quality hinges , with one side showing a 0 . 0mm gap
negative	i went to purchase a leather_jacket from superdry '_s ebay store that had 00 days left on its listing and a buyitnow price of £_00 . 00 - but superdry decided to stop the auction and re - list the item at £_000 . 00 ( over 00_% higher ).
negative	i contacted them over the issue thinking it must be a mistake but was told the original price was a ' mega sale ' price for 0 days .
negative	nowhere on this listing did they indicate this was a temporary lower price and the listing had 00 days left at the lower price .
negative	this is quite a underhand method of simply raising advertised prices on whim and misleading customers .
negative	the customer service response was abrupt and did not offer to rectify the situation .
negative	very surprising from such a large and successful company .
negative	would just like to say that parcel0go are the worst bunch of un caring un helpful people around .
negative	having made a request for 0 parcels to be collected from gran canaira in spain and delivered to the uk on the 0th_july_0000 i am still_waiting for the parcels to arrive .
negative	on placing the order with parcels 0go and complying with all the various paperwork required in triplicate for each of the five boxes , i was informed 0_weeks_later that the company , gls had either lost the paper_work or required new paperwork for each of the boxes .
negative	this i did and even translated the contents of each box into spanish for the spanish customs .
negative	still the parcels didn_'_t arrive .
negative	i have now been informed that the courier requires vat numbers and all the paperwork to be priced in euros and not british pounds .
negative	i '_m not a business customer , nor am i uk vat_registered .
negative	the items in the boxes are my own personal belonging not for resale and i just want them back .
negative	don_'_t bother to email p0go as you won_'_t get a reply .
negative	when you use the live_chat service you get a team of uncaring individuals who just give you stock answers to your questions like " i '_m sorry i can '_t answer that for you at the moment ".
negative	" i have passed your message on to the department concerned and somebody will be in touch later ".
negative	( this never happens )
negative	i '_ve even asked to speak with a supervisor , sarah , who simply tell me the same as everybody_else and then cuts you off in mid flow .
negative	at the time of righting this message , the parcels are still somewhere in spain .
negative	nobody know how to track them as the gls & p0go system doesn_'_t know , and p0go keep telling_me they will be in touch !
negative	its now been 00 days and counting .
negative	my only saving_grace in all the fiasco is an online_chat operator daniel , who has done their best to help me in all this .
negative	has listened to my complaints and has responded in a manner that should be_applauded .
negative	i would urge anybody to stay_away from p0go and go direct with a reputable parcels courier .
negative	you may pay a little more but you '_ll get a better customer experience by far , and should anything go_wrong then you can talk to them direct instead of a 0rd_party such as p0go !
negative	!
negative	avoid people avoid !!
negative	!
negative	as of september_0000 it has now been 00 weeks and i have now been informed that the parcels have been delivered back to the collection_point and p0go will no_longer transport the items .
negative	i now have to go with a new courier .
negative	the total_cost of p0go is now to be refunded to me along with a small_amount of compensation .
negative	i can only hope that i have better luck with the new courier .
negative	you have all been_warned !
negative	i '_ve lost_count how many issues i '_ve had with city_link .
negative	their most annoying habit is their drivers that don_'_t leave a card when attempting delivery , it '_s like they expect us to be mind readers !
negative	ordered an item on the 00rd_jan , on a three day delivery , told it was instock , did a track on this item on 00th_jan only to find that the delivery date was now up to the 00 feb . no email from littlewoods informing_me of this delay or why .
negative	when i phoned up to find out what was going on i was told by a uphelpfull disinterested customer service person " thats how it is " more or less take it or leave it .
negative	if its out of stock or low stock when you order it tell us don_'_t leave us expecting delivery when it its not going to turn_up when you expected it .
negative	totally dusgusted with the service .
negative	i '_ve gone elsewere and got a guaranteed delivery for wednesday 00th_jan .
negative	without_doubt the most woefully inept company i have ever had the mispleasure to deal with .
negative	you can never get through on their customer service phone number ( unless you ' re prepared to wait about 00 - 00_mins ).
negative	you submit queries via their online webforms - they never respond .
negative	i for one will never ever use them again and would encourage_others to pay that little_bit more for your energy in return for a company you can actually contact and who have some semblance of customer_services dept !
negative	i rang to order either a 0000 or 0000 gold sovereign following an e_- mail i received stating that a mixed_bag had been received into bullion .
negative	i rang to check if either year was available .
negative	after checking the lady i spoke to confirmed that a 0000 was available .
negative	i paid and waited for the coin to arrive .
negative	on arrival ( after a delay of one day over the guaranteed delivery date due to royal_mail mislaying a bag ) was annoyed that a 0000 coin arrived .
negative	rang and again spoke to the lady_who_apologised , spoke to the bullion department who confirmed the 0000 had now gone out .
negative	waiting for richard to phone when a 0000 coin comes in to swap the coins over .
negative	the only reason bt still_exists is i suspect based on it monopoly roots .
negative	the services are relatively expensive and not as customer friendly as they would have you believe .
negative	the policy of the company towards its customers is and still remains legendry .
negative	their products outside the foodhalls are however mainly from china and that part of the world .
negative	not even my pants are now made in the uk .
negative	for a flagship british company this is very dissappointing
negative	if there is a gutter in communication , facebook is right there .
negative	for absolute tosh & brain dead excremental communication this is the place to go in 00_% of cases .
negative	i was with the company for nearly 00 years .
negative	for the first 0 it was good although dealing_with overseas call_centres was a bit of a pain .
negative	ii was so pleased that i had several members of my family sign up to talktalk .
negative	after then unfortunately it just got worse & worse culminating in a service promise & contract that they even put in writing yet still manage to get wrong and not fix for over 0 months .
negative	i lost track of all the staff i spoke to and it was obvious that no one really knew what was going on with nearly everyone promising and rarely delivering .
negative	i call it a flamingo syndrome - similar to a cock - up but just a lot bigger
negative	absolute_rip_off !!
negative	!
negative	i used last_year with no_problems ,
negative	so i brought a new shirt in the sale on 00 / 00 / 00
negative	still_hasn_'_t come and they '_ve not answered my calls or e_- mails
negative	avoid
negative	it took them about four goes to pick_up the parcel .
negative	then they lost .
negative	then they carried_out the most inept investigation imaginable to try to find it .
negative	then they simply stopped_replying to my emails .
negative	complete clowns .
negative	two months after buying walt disney world tickets ( with my holiday package , hotel & plane ), expieda conntacted me and said they were cancelling my attraction_tickets and refunding me the money .
negative	it turns_out that the ticket price has now gone up £_00 on their website and i can rebook at the higher price .
negative	re - booked direct with disney for around original price i got from expedia .
negative	i only booked with expedia as they had the whole package together .
negative	having them cancel my tickets with less_than 0 months before holiday , and prices have gone up on all other_sites now is discusting .
negative	won_'_t trust buying tickets off these_guys again .
negative	they should honour package all together and not be able to cancel part of package with you having nothing more than money back for part of the package .
negative	you charged extra for a mother '_s day delivery , and then delivered the chocolates the day before .
negative	i want a refund .
negative	after a confirmed and paid for order , they called 0 days_later to tell me the item had been damaged and they had no other stock .
negative	they lied and told me they had tried to contact me the day i placed the order .
negative	when i tried to complain , they lied again and the person i spoke to claimed he was the sole director of the company and he was the only one i could complain to .
negative	after checking , it turns_out this person is not one of the directors of the company .
negative	it is a criminal offence to impersonate the director of a company .
negative	basically , they sell items they don_'_t actually have , and the lie to the customer before trying to up - sell another item or process a refund .
negative	claimed phone was faulty , working_perfectly when sent to them when i asked for it to be returned they said too late it '_s been processed .
negative	was paid $ 0 rather_than $_00 .
negative	beware of this company .
negative	ordered filing_cabinet that is described as 00 day delivery ( as non standard colour ) 00th_september , preferred delivery any thursday / friday notified at time of purchase .
negative	i was contacted to advise longer lead time and delivery early november .
negative	during a six week period from 00th_september to date this has not changed and has_been advertised online by ofo and still is as 00 days .
negative	i was willing to wait as not urgent .
negative	contacted ofo after 0_weeks , 0th_november .
negative	advised in email should be delivered w_/ c 00th manufacturer will contact you to agree delivery date .
negative	manufacturer not retailer who i have contract with .
negative	we will deliver monday 00th_november , i advised as the customer sorry this is not possible no one available monday .
negative	now dictated to , take delivery on monday 00th as we are in the area or cancel order and pay 00_% cancellation_fee .
negative	i would suggest ambiguity and unreasonable behaviour by supplier ( s ), i do not have a contract with manufacturer but retailer .
negative	i '_ll let you guys think about whether this is the sort of company you want to do_business with , i know i '_m going viral with business contacts , friends and family educating them to the service i am being subjected to .
negative	took two lots of money from my bank_account , delivered one ok -
negative	contacted customer_services - could not trace second order - offered
negative	to scan copy of bank_statement to proove 0 lots of money taken - never_heard
negative	back .
negative	in the end had to contact bank , and say was disputed transaction .
negative	not a pleased customer
negative	i have been trying to contact shazam for months to try and stop the news alerts and i was firstly told to turn off notifications which i did but the news alerts keep_coming .
negative	i got hold of their phone number in hammersmith but was told by the " receptionist " that i had to contact them on line i am not allowed to talk to a person !
negative	i must have sent the same question in now at_least a dozen_times via the on line contact form and / or apple email address and they don_'_t even answer - perhaps they don_'_t know the answer .
negative	i ' d give them no stars if i could .
negative	i have been trying to use the cv library iphone_app for months and have contacted cv library about this by phone and email on several_occasions .
negative	they are extremely difficult to contact in the first place phone number virtually_impossible to obtain .
negative	when i did get through and explained that the app isn_'_t working_properly they were of no help what so ever - i don_'_t really think they know how it works themselves .
negative	so i am less_than impressed with cv library .
negative	i avoid using paypal wherever_possible as i am completely_satisfied with the security if i pay on my credit_card .
negative	unfortunately some companies insist on using paypal which is linked to my credit_card anyway .
negative	paypal are one of those companies i dread having to contact .
negative	did anyone see the awful review they got on watchdog on bbc0 very recently it all sounded very familiar .
negative	avoid wherever_possible !!!
negative	!
negative	they were fine for a couple of years but then they started sending zopiclone out of the secure blister packs and into the same chromium picolinate bottles other_reviewers have mentioned !
negative	pharmastores said don_'_t worry they are the same pills we are trying to avoid customs and excise .
negative	to make it even worse i started getting snotty demands for unpaid duty from excise and customs and got involved in time wasting email hockey whereby pharmastores would tell me one day there was no duty to pay then next_day they ' d paid - don_'_t believe a word they say .
negative	customs would say it was due .
negative	it even got to me receiving a letter from a bailiff for non payment so i was forced to pay it - i '_m in london and pharmastores is in egypt so it is easier for customes to threaten me !!!
negative	!
negative	more recently the pills whatever they are and i '_m really not sure turned from being yellow to being blue ( they might have a bit of zopiclone in them but they are basically fake ).
negative	they are the cheapest i '_ve found for zopiclone but you don_'_t know what you are buying .
negative	how stupid does a company have to be to send me someone they have repeatedly ripped_off the opportunity to review them .
negative	also if you look at the dates on trust_pilot the reviews they are all in groups by date so there '_s been quite a lot recently but then none for the previous year then loads so my only conclusion from that is that they wrote some of them at_least themselves obviously only the good ones .
negative	does anyone know where / how to have tablets analysed - i wouldn_'_t mind seeing what they actually are .
negative	rgds
negative	david phillips .
negative	been on this site several_times when i had a trial membership . its very hard to find anything new to watch , most films are old . you may like this though )) was not for me anyway . there are other_sites out there far better .
negative	arrived back in the uk around 0am extremely tired , got to the barrier where the number_plate recognition camera was put our ticket into the machine twice both_times it says invalid press for help eventually got thru the exit after a 0 minute to - do with the very rude lady on the other end of the intercom . probably consider taking a taxi next time .
negative	its clear that this company took our order to swell the coffers in advance of going into_administration .
negative	they had a delayed delivery which was times just right to avoid demands for refunds in advance of insolvency .
negative	as is often the case with these furniture companies , they really can '_t be_bothered to do or say anything once they '_ve got your money .
negative	this is a total_scam company is to be avoided at all costs
negative	after a botched operation in 0000 , ultralase then informed me that it had been put into_administration .
negative	they were in administration when i took the contract .
negative	their sister company optimax then ' took on ' the warranty - but all of the ' treatment ' i had from them was displacement activity .
negative	i have been in severe pain for a year .
negative	i telephoned again after they put me on anti - biotics for 0 months .
negative	it turns_out that the even this ' after sales ' care is no_longer available - and the company has just walked_away form my botched operation .
negative	i am taking_legal_advice .
negative	avoid both companies like the plague .
negative	negative_reviews by me and several others of a window company and its sister company have all been erased .
negative	the complaints against that company were very serious .
negative	they included poor quality workmanship , bad service , poor products , zero communication .
negative	in my case , it also included fraudulent credit_card use .
negative	my review and all other reviews were removed .
negative	this company is a real problem for consumers .
negative	they need to know what they are getting themselves into .
negative	all the reviews were removed by trust_pilot without an investigation .
negative	my complaints to trust_pilot were answered but no explanation could be given as to why they were taken off and why no contact was made with me about it .
negative	to be clear .
negative	all negative_reviews were removed for two companies .
negative	there were about 0 or 0 in all .
negative	my conclusion is that trust_pilot is not a reliable forum for consumer_protection in the least .
negative	paid for next_day and two_weeks_later are still to arrive
negative	have been waiting a month for my glasses although they tell you that they are dispatched within 0 to 00 days .
negative	have sent several emails and they do not have the decency to reply .
negative	not impressed at all , absolutely unacceptable and very bad customer service overall .
negative	oh_dear , oh_dear .
negative	i only wanted to check the balance of an isa , but alas , with m & s money you cannot do this online .
negative	so i waited thirty - six minutes for them to answer the phone .
negative	their recorded_message didn_'_t even have the courtesy to claim they were experiencing " higher_than usual call volumes " like many companies do to hide the fact they have laid off a large number of staff .
negative	in fact , it told me ( for the entire thirty - six minutes ) that my call would be " answered shortly ".
negative	the representative was very polite when i finally got through , though he did seem slightly_embarrassed on behalf of m & s , and i don_'_t blame him .
negative	horrendous service , there is no other word for it .
negative	sent in my working iphone 0 in good condition .
negative	they said on their website it was worth £_00 !
negative	they then emailed me after receiving my phone saying it had scratches on it and they have revised their offer to £_00 .
negative	unbelievable !
negative	i sent them a phone in good condition and this is what i get .
negative	do not use .
negative	there prices on thier website are not real .
negative	in my mind why do we have to pay the same for a download as they real thing .
negative	sort it out man
negative	trash staff that know nothing but seem to think they do .
negative	and treat you like a fool .
negative	shop elsewhere its over priced anyway
negative	waste of time nuff_said
negative	awful flight now room at all .
negative	hotel was ok but no heating and it was very cold and the food was horrendous at the all inclusive riu olivina lanzarote .
negative	ive had better holiday that cost £ 0000 less
negative	nice hotel but food on all inclusive was boring same same and always cold
negative	really a good way to loose money but now ebay own it i guess its game over
negative	retuned some unsuitable goods .
negative	never got a refund despite 000s of calls .
negative	ripped_off good and proper .
negative	rot in hell rog dogs
negative	had a brand_new bmw stolen and they found a little grey_area which i could have never found .
negative	they refused to pay out and i had to pay full cost of the car to the lease company and they black listed me so now have to pay over £_000 per_month for insurance instead of £_000 per year .
negative	totally ripped of and dealt_with like i was a criminal .
negative	will never use these or any axa company again .
negative	watch dog also had a good moan_about this very thing too .
negative	title_says it all
negative	we were customers for 0 years with 0 websites and ebay solution with them .
negative	we never got any help and 0 years after we started they told us that the site we use with them is out of date and they are no_longer supporting it .
negative	we never got any decent sales and the software was pants .
negative	my advice streer well clear of this awful company .
negative	go to [_external link_] and do it yourself for £_00 per_month and it works we are selling out now .
negative	the only thing ' supa ' about this company is the speed at which they took my money .
negative	i have been defrauded out of £_00 . 00 !
negative	they have refused to send the 0 perfumes that i ordered , stating that they are awaiting dispatch , ( they '_ve been waiting dispatch since 0th_december ) and will not refund the money after three_times of asking .
negative	if anyone is interested in joining me in contacting watchdog about this second - rate , shoddy outfit , please do so .
negative	don_'_t let them get away with this appauling level of ' service '.
negative	under no circumstances should you part with your hard_earned_cash with supaperfumes .
negative	update_: the day after this feedback was left at trustpilot , supapefume gave_me a full_refund .
negative	this just goes to prove that if you complain loudly enough and publicly enough , your voice will be heard .
negative	thank_you trustpilot for the forum .
negative	other dissatisfied_customers please take_note .
negative	still not received , 0_weeks_later .
negative	i '_ll happily delete this review if / when it arrives
negative	been trying to reach scottish_power for 0 days now .
negative	they don_'_t have any advisers at all !
negative	i have waited a total of 0 hours on hold .
negative	is there anyone in their customer service center ?
negative	company is a joke .
negative	believe me the first thing i will do when i do finally get through is cancel my policy .
negative	i purchased the elbow_support hoping it would help with my tennis / golfers elbow caused_by many_years of using screwdrivers , as i had previously purchased a magnetic support for my knee , but i found that the mesh covering the magnets was like sand paper on the skin of the point of my elbow and after wearing the support for a whole day i found that the binding on the edge of the support was irritating the skin on my forearm especially where the gap_between the two straps opened and closed as i bent my arm during the day
negative	unfortunately i didn_'_t get to see the flowers , but my parents did when visiting my grandma to whom i had sent the flowers and the above opinion is what they said , as well as saying the quality was absolutely_disgusting .
negative	i trusted serenata to deliver a decent bunch of flowers for my grandma '_s birthday - serenata have failed terribly and have certainly lost my trust and future custom !
negative	purchased my policy , then attempted to register online .
negative	received email confirmation re registration and clicked to activate .
negative	when i went to login , the website kept bouncing me out .
negative	i phoned the helpline and was told the reason i couldn_'_t login was because i had only just registered that day and that i should wait 00_hours before trying again .
negative	i left it 00_hours plus and tried to login again - same thing happened .
negative	i again phoned the helpline and was this time told that it might be a problem with my internet browser and that i should try with firefox or chrome .
negative	i explained that i didn_'_t want to start downloading and setting_up new browsers just so i could use their website and was then promised a callback .
negative	received a callback from ashley who said his manager had suggested that i give him my password so that he could try and login from his computer .
negative	i said i wasn_'_t prepared to divulge my password to anybody and was amazed that i was being asked to compromise my personal security .
negative	i asked to escalate the issue and was again promised a callback .
negative	received a callback from sarah ( ashley '_s manager ) who stated it was perfectly_acceptable for protect_your bubble to ask their customers to divulge their passwords and that this had been checked and confirmed to be acceptable by their compliance department .
negative	it is my belief that reputable and responsible organisations should not encourage their customers to divulge their passwords .
negative	for this reason i have cancelled my policy and made a formal_complaint .
negative	if protect_your bubble cannot get the ' becoming a customer ' part right , how can there be confidence that they will get the ' making a claim ' bit right ?
negative	i have never done business with such a slow company .
negative	getting ahold of anyone is hard and complicated .
negative	shipping takes 0_weeks .
negative	parts did not fit like oem - easily and after wairing so long to get them i had to go buy oem hoses from dealership because the fit was so poor .
negative	i ordered my glasses two months_ago .
negative	chased by email , no reply , chased again .
negative	chased by telephone to be told they had got lost , between eye sale and the lab .
negative	three_weeks_later still nothing , waiting for my phone_calls to be returned .
negative	cheap glasses maybe , but appalling customer service , hopeless
negative	tried to call bravo fly on numerous occaisions to rearrange flight however unable to get through to speak to somebody , therefore i had to buy additional flights through another agent .
negative	prices were cheap but if there are any_problems then you cannot get in touch with them .
negative	tried to buy a couple of copies of nightwatch & daywatch on blu_ray .
negative	waited a week , then got an email_saying i wasn_'_t allowed to buy more than one .
negative	crazy , thought we were in a recession !
negative	i arranged for the boiler to be delivered last thursday to a rental_property in in luton , which is about 0 miles from where i live .
negative	i specifically_asked that the delivery driver phone me 00_minutes before he expected to make the delivery so that i could drive to the rental_property to take the delivery .
negative	i waited all day for the call .
negative	at 0 . 00pm i phoned to ask what was happening as no one had telephoned me .
negative	i was told the delivery lorry had broken down earlier in the day .
negative	no one had the decency to phone me to say that they were not coming .
negative	on the friday the only time i could take the delivery was before 0am .
negative	i was told i needed to drive to the rental_property to take the delivery at 0am , i got up at 0am to drive to the rental_property .
negative	the delivery van arrived at 0 . 00am ..
negative	if tdl feel bad about this level of service please email me on peterkennedyjfk @_gmail . com and offer me £_00 in compensation for having to wait around all day thursday and then having to get up at 0am last friday to take delivery .
negative	i shall be very surprised if i hear from tdl .
negative	if tdl really cares_about customer_satisfaction don_'_t apologise - just give me £_00 .
negative	words are cheap and actions speak_louder_than words .
negative	rebooked with citylink 00 at parcel0go sams ' suggestion after 0 days of failed_collections from yodel .
negative	told by sam not to relabel as citylink would do it .
negative	bad advice .
negative	morons in city_link ( or deliberately malicious ?)
negative	put the wrong labels on the two parcels .
negative	now 0_weeks_later , one has_been returned to me clearly showing mislabelling by citylink and one appears lost .
negative	thanks a bunch parcel0go , 00 years to get 000_% 0000 + feedback and then i suffer this incompetence .
negative	hours spent on 0 chats to different operators and to add_insult to injury , my refund has_been rejected ??
negative	parecl0go need to up their game as opposition is now better .
negative	now using ipost and cut out these middlemen with numerous failed_collections .

negative	there were fundamental errors in the build of both of them .
negative	0 .
negative	usb plugged_into ieee port on the motherboard which would if used have caused damage to the motherboard .
negative	0 .
negative	mini speaker and usb 0 card not fitted to one motherboard just left in the packaging .
negative	0 .
negative	one pc had a plastic_bag of screws loose_inside the box .
negative	if that had been left in there and the plastic had melted the metal screws would have fallen all over the internal components and shorted various items out .
negative	items 0 to 0 have now been resolved by the company .
negative	i have submitted photos to pc_specialist to back up these points and i am told they are being referred to the build manager .
negative	the upload photo feature is not working otherwise i would have included them .
negative	0 .
negative	one pc has_been cloned incorrectly such that it thinks that all data should be assigned to the d drive but that is the one assigned to the optical_drive .
negative	we have suibmmitted a request for advice on this issue and are still in talks to resolve it .
negative	packaging , despatch and delivery service all of a high_standard .
negative	anyvan puts you in touch with van owners /" man with a van " traders who may be honest , careful professionals , or may be untrustworthy , reckless charlatans .
negative	it seems to me to be entirely pot_luck .
negative	if you fancy your chances go_ahead .
negative	their process of " accreditation " is flawed and there are serious loopholes in the way that the site operates .
negative	anyvan take money as a cut of transactions without even lifting a finger .
negative	they simply provide apparatus for these " deals " and contracts between individuals and traders / movers to go_ahead .
negative	there '_s no additional security to this system than simply answering an advert in a newspaper or placing an ad on gumtree .
negative	all reputations seem to be based on a particularly spurious " feedback " system , in which someone moving their entire home to another town is given equal weight to someone_who just needs something moved up the road .
negative	just because someone has positive_feedback is meaningless in the long run as it '_s not calibrated to the kind of job you ' re actually advertising and need doing .
negative	a cautionary tale :
negative	i booked a job with one " company " via anyvan , and despite_repeated_attempts to contact them , the day before they were due to arrive and move me and my belongings they finally responded with a cancellation .
negative	they then arranged for the job to be effectively sub - contracted to another anyvan user for a comparative price .
negative	this turned_out to be extremely problematic , not least because any opportunity for feedback ( the only thing you can do to warn_others of a mover '_s poor service ) was taken out of my hands .
negative	note that there '_s ostensibly nothing to stop anyone doing this on anyvan .
negative	i couldn_'_t afford to argue or take issue with this so close to the date of moving - this was less_than 00_hours beforehand , and i needed to be out of the property .
negative	this cancellation happened despite the move being scheduled for over a month .
negative	note that you have no form of redress or compensation for cancellation - all you can do is leave " negative_feedback " and ask for your initial deposit to be returned .
negative	the replacement mover provided not only refused to assist with putting items in various rooms ( instead just leaving it inside the door for my partner to deal with ), they also broke a door and damaged property , something which was only discovered some time later .
negative	they then refused to produce insurance documentation after i pointed_out damage after the move had taken place , stating that " it was no_longer any of their business " and that i had raised this too late ( 0_weeks after the move , promptly upon discovery of the damage - anyone who has moved_house knows it takes a fair while to unpack everything ).
negative	legally , the position of the movers is nonsense under the supply of goods and services act_0000 , but you can '_t force them do anything , you don_'_t get to see any certification on accepting the job and anyvan themselves certainly won_'_t get involved , despite the fact they allow these companies to include claims about " goods in transit insurance " on their website .
negative	now , i am left less_than a month later with damaged belongings and an outright refusal from the mover to pay for the repair .
negative	they insisted that the moment i paid them , their liability ended , which is ridiculous .
negative	my only recourse is to take this matter to the small_claims court , which could take many months , and incurs a fee of its own .
negative	anyvan themselves are not interested when things go_wrong - they simply act as agents to put you in touch with movers and take a cut of the transaction via_paypal .
negative	in my case after_contacting anyvan , they refused to intervene , were vague about how vendors were accredited and admitted that a vendor could indicate that they had goods in transit insurance - on their website - without anyvan even seeing any documentation to prove it .
negative	again , ratings are largely meaningless .
negative	a company registered on anyvan might have 0_stars but may have only ever moved or couriered single items 0 miles up the road .
negative	the same company can bid on an entire house_move and you ' re left with inexperienced , rude , clumsy chances cramming your belongings into a grubby transit and breaking your belongings .
negative	this is without even mentioning the possibility that they won_'_t even turn_up and will subcontract your job instead , as in my case .
negative	if the movers are unreliable or careless , you ' re left trying to chase them on your own for money or compensation .
negative	most of them insist on cash payments ( i have no idea how tax is therefore paid on these jobs either incidentally ), and few are trained in any recognisable way past being physically able to lift things .
negative	it might seem a great way to move house cheaply , but the stress and expense incurred by using this service actually came to more than simply hiring a professional removal company to do things , or just hiring a van and doing it yourself .
negative	they may very well be useful for simple , self - contained jobs like moving limited numbers of items from one location to the other or acting as couriers , but i am completely unable to recommend anyvan as a company anyone should do_business with at all for removals .
negative	avoid , literally at all costs .
negative	tesco lakeside is filthy and i often shop late at night to see and smell 0 or 0 members of staff smoking in the doorway at 0am
negative	i had an honest review on scs sofas removed for adding " avoid these_crooks " at the end which is neither offensive or obscene trustpilot seems to kow tow to the companies being reviewed !
negative	they have admitted to seining out fake solicitors letters and charged their customers for them .
negative	shame on wonga !
negative	£ 0000 reclining sofa delivered with a damaged motor .
negative	was told someone would be in touch but nobody contacted me and i had to call their 0000 phone number after 0_weeks of silence to be told nobody would even come out to look at sofa for 0_weeks .
negative	and a month later i '_m still_waiting for scs to respond with an offer of a replacement .
negative	first and last time i will go there only sent me part order a gift for a friend who was leaving for canada so no time to return > went on facebook to complain and they said they would look in to it and thats the last i heard they never even offered to send the belt which was short on the order .
negative	in my opinion items should be check before leaving the depot . ended_up looking a fool at the party typical man can '_t order a ladies clothes had all the comments .
negative	i bought a wowcher for a hotel stay in dumfries a few weeks_ago .
negative	called the hotel to check_availability ( the day i bought it ) as i can only manage weekends and was told not to worry , as long as there are rooms i can redem my wowcher .
negative	great or so i thought .
negative	i called up to book on sunday with some dates we could manage .
negative	there were no dates left for any weekend despite me being told that there was plenty of availability if i wanted to book at the full rack rate as they were only accepting 00 wowchers a day .
negative	?. i was not told this the first time .
negative	i contacted wowcher as now that 00 days have past i '_m going to lose £_00 due to me only being allowed to claim 00_% as a credit and not the full_amount .
negative	ive heard_nothing back from them .
negative	looking at this site by the looks of it not responding is the norm for them .
negative	a gutted girlfriend as this was for her_birthday which is now no use but yet wowcher is not willing to help in anyway ... says a lot really !
negative	!
negative	bought a kitchen_tap and it would not fit to the worktop as the nylon bolt fitting would not tighten and is clearly not fit for purpose .
negative	i went to a nut and bolt manufacturer as well as a plumb centre and they advised that the fitting from the body of the tap and the connecting nut was not a recognised plumbing fitting and advised that he got a lot of ' mugs ' like me that had bought cheap from the internet .
negative	very disappointed as i believed that the product was going to be as advertised .
negative	luxury for less , pay more no stress !
negative	item delivered poorly and subsequently had a large whole in the table service ( air_hockey table ).
negative	finally this was replaced more then 0_weeks_later .
negative	only following the threat of legal_action and involvement from professional bodies .
negative	the after sales service was non_existent .
negative	the complaints_department never responded or took calls .
negative	the whole_experience was appauling .
negative	this was a xmas_present for my daughter .
negative	whilst we reported the poor condition item received within_00hrs and we notified uksportimports we could not open to xmas day a week_later because difficult with size and keeping secrecy .
negative	we were told this would be fine as long as we reported any damage ( if any ) immediately .
negative	regrettably this turned_out to be the case with a large whole in the table surface which made unplayable .
negative	not only a very disappointed little 00 year_old xmas day , but when i notified ukisportimports by email immediately ( as instructed ) and called 00th_dec ( as no reply to email ) i was told very unsympathetically they couldn_'_t help .
negative	in fact the whole_experience was disgraceful .
negative	only after considerable time , expense and letters / emails was this resolved .
negative	i suspect without the help of professional trade bodies and solicitor advice i would still be chasing .
negative	the company was quite happy for me to fade away and take the hit sitting behind a note in small_print on their website informing any buyer to report damage within_00hrs of receipt .
negative	i understand this and believe this to fall_foul of goods of sale act .
negative	i would never ever use this company again after this experience .
negative	buyers_beware ....
negative	i ordered a bbq .
negative	it said i could collect from 00pm on the monday .
negative	i turned_up at 00 : 00 .
negative	they were completely_clueless .
negative	i had to wait half an_hour whilst they tracked it down .
negative	it turned_out that the order hadnt arrived , and could have been delivered any time .
negative	thankfully it arrived whilst i was there , but it was only by chance .
negative	completely_useless service .
negative	probably the worst online company i '_ve ever_dealt_with .
negative	they don_'_t have the courtesy to inform you if they can '_t fulfill an order .
negative	it '_s virtually_impossible to speak to anyone on the phone and when you ' re asked to leave a message on their answerphone you can '_t because it '_s not working .
negative	finally , they have an inability to send you invoices and credit notes which they may one day live to regret if they are ever inspected by hmrc vat inspectors .
negative	bryton have entered the cycle gps market as underdog taking on the mighty but arrogant garmin .
negative	i typically support the underdog against companies that have a dominant position so i started to research their product and identified one that i really like .
negative	now being a linux user , it is frustrating that tech companies don_'_t support the os so i enquired as to possible future support .
negative	my enquiry went completely_ignored .
negative	there are ways around the os support but i find the ignorance disrespectful .
negative	the cycling community is a fraternity for many .
negative	every cyclist knows another and the tech_savvy are always comparing gear .
negative	to ignore one query is to potentially ignore many .
negative	i am disheartened by the ignorance as it seems the underdog may in fact be no more than an impotent chihuaha .
negative	ordered my mats 0_weeks_ago still not arrived no one from the company will answer my calls or e_- mail pluss they debited my account for the money
negative	i chose and paid for the 0000 model cressi apnea and received the cheaper 0000 model .
negative	despite several emails and photos i have been given no support or partial_refund .
negative	i have now gone to the credit_card people for help
negative	absolutely the worst internet experience of my life ..... avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	received goods wihtin 0 days .... goods turned_out to be faulty ... i sent it back at my cost ... they re - sent me the same item sprayed up ... which had the same fault as before .... avoid at all costs ... utter_rubbish rip - off_merchants
negative	no flowers , no customer service , no response .
negative	i ordered mothers_day flowers to be sent to my mam '_s address and paid the sunday delivery supplement .
negative	by 0 . 00pm they hadn_'_t arrived , so i attempted to contact them ....
negative	their online help was offine , there is no telephone_number , so i had to e_- mail them .
negative	and here we are days_later with no flowers , no response to my e_- mail and still no sign of the live help coming online .
negative	i '_ve had to contact my credit_card company to stop payment .
negative	shocking company , avoid at all costs .
negative	first i had to remind them that i put a order in after a week of waiting , then when my order was sent out it was not pack it was just trong in a box so when i open it there was not packaging just the good and part of the order the snorkel was damage ,
negative	i have not sent the snorkel back yet i will have to just write it off and buy i when at site as i do not have the time to wait for them to sand a replace out before my hols
negative	just like mike i booked the wrong tickets due to the website displaying wrong information .
negative	when checking my tickets confirmation , it stated it was same day return .
negative	the booking summary before i paid did not .
negative	when i called up customer_services i was told it '_s up to me to know what all the ticket codes ment , when i asked kas if he knew , he replied he has a car !
negative	i spoke to a different lady a few_days_later and she was even worst .
negative	avoid !
negative	nice tiles , but buy elsewhere !
negative	had a couple boxed of tiles to return , but was inform i would have to pay a fee of £_00 . 00 , even if i dropped them of at the warehouse .
negative	if i wanted the tiles collected the fee would be over £_00 . 00 !
negative	i '_ve been told i should have read all of the t &_c , as this is covered in t &_c number 00 !
negative	if only i had more time …
negative	i will avoid in the future .
negative	when i checked my bank_balance i ' d had £_00 took out of my account by shopto . net even_though i hadn_'_t ordered anything .
negative	after been on hold for 00_minutes at 0p a minute nobody answered so i hung_up and sent 0 email '_s to which i got no reply .
negative	i had to phone again ( spent another 0 minutes on hold ) before somebody answered .
negative	the last time i used this company was about 0 years_ago and they still had my bank details and they decided to send me grand theft auto v without me even ordering it .
negative	they said it was too late to stop it been delivered ( even_though it didn_'_t get released for another 0 days ) so i have to wait for it to come and then send it back which i will have to pay for .
negative	i '_ve sent about 00 email '_s in total and not had 0 reply , the only way to get in touch is through their 0 pence a minute phone number .
negative	really happy with kitchen ware .
negative	however , over charged me , didn_'_t recognise their own paypal_account when querying overcharge , taken over a week of correspondence , spoken to several people about the same issue each time requesting different information or just plan right rude and uninterested in dealing_with the query .
negative	still not resolved !
negative	!
negative	i have used appliances direct twice_now for new washing_machine / dryers in my rented out properties and both_times they have been terrible i won_'_t be using them again .
negative	on both_occasions i paid for ( cut and paste from my invoice ):
negative	" connection of freestanding washing_machine or dishwasher plus disconnection of old unit from existing space with power and plumbing " and " removal and recycling of your existing appliance at the time of delivery ".
negative	and both_times they just turn_up drop the machine off and leave , quoting " we can '_t remove any existing appliances " despite me clearly paying for this service .
negative	i suggest they don_'_t sell services they can '_t deliver .
negative	price for machine was good , but when you add on there delivery charge basically the same as all the others .
negative	can '_t get hold of them on their 0000 0000 numbers waste of time .
negative	so i spoke to the lady below , who said she would ' investigate ' it , then just got an email_saying they have refunded the charges for the services they didn_'_t provide .
negative	but didn_'_t even apologize or make any effort to rectify the situation .
negative	i will not be using these again , my advice is use appliances_online instead !
negative	ordered glasses on the sat ....... e_mail reg glasses monday other e_mail wed glasses soon after that ........
negative	i ordered a knife sheath for £_00 of these thieving b ****** s and never received my sheath and they was not contactable so i never got my money back either .
negative	they are not worthy of even one star , please don_'_t give them your money as you will never see your ordered product or the return of your money .
negative	they have no phone number and don_'_t reply to your emails , its one big scam .
negative	you have been_warned !
negative	talktalk is hands_down the most difficult company i ’ ve ever had the displeasure of dealing_with .
negative	they rope you in with great prices , but expect to get what you pay for when things go_wrong .
negative	the on - hold times are horrendous , and the staff treat you like idiots , with no real enthusiasm for problem_solving .
negative	- one thing i have learned , if you want anything sorted , immediately refuse to deal with the person you are talking to and request a manager , they can actually be a little more helpful .
negative	my issues arised when i moved home and was forced to sign a new 00 month_contract to continue the service .
negative	either that or to buy myself out of the contract ….
negative	including a £_000 bill for the youview_box .
negative	no chance .
negative	so we continued with the home move , all should be well and good ?!
negative	except 0_weeks after the ‘ go live ’ date , we still had no service .
negative	it must have taken 0 phone_calls and over 0 hours of my time just to persuade them to send an engineer out .
negative	there is only so many_times your intelligence can be insulted .
negative	“ have you tried switching the router on and off again ” jesus man , i ’_m not an imbecile , of course i ’ ve tried that - and many of the other useless troubleshooting exercises on your website .
negative	so lots of hassle later , 0 talktalk engineers later ( 0 never turned_up which we are being charged for – whole other story ) and 0 bt_engineer later …… 0_weeks have passed – we have internet and phone !
negative	huzzah !
negative	of course , the talktalk rules are i must pay my bill regardless if i ’_m receiving a service , or they won_’_t fix the line because of an outstanding_balance in arrears .
negative	reassured on a number occasions i could claim compensation for the loss of service , i continued to pay for a service i wasn_’_t receiving .
negative	so naturally , i called talktalk again , explained i ’ ve had no service for 0_weeks and am requesting compensation .
negative	“ not a problem ” they say , “ we can offer you …… urmmm , the computer system says , erm ….. £ 0 . 00 ” you can_imagine my response .
negative	“ five pounds and fifty pence ?!
negative	you mean £_00 ?
negative	is that a joke ?!
negative	use some logic man , i pay £_00 . 00 a month , i ’ ve had 0_weeks of no service , how you can offer me £ 0 . 00 ?
negative	to date , we are on phone_call number 0 , another 0 hours of my time , going round and round in circles .
negative	the most_recent offer was £_00 …......… an_absolute insult .
negative	i '_ll keep phoning and get angrier and angrier until something is sorted .
negative	:)
negative	and a quick message to mary , we have written on the facebook_page explaining the troublesome service we '_ve had , and your response was to delete it .
negative	cheers then , you pirates .
negative	delivery took far too long over a week on priority delivery not acceptable , it was for a birthday_present and it arrived far too late , ok value for money if you want too save a few_pounds , however after the huge inconvenience i wish i would have just went and purchased from the shop .
negative	wont use allbeauty . com / cheap_smells , again and will not recommend them either .
negative	hi have been led to believe that the delivery will be received within 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	it has now been 00 days and a phone_call later but still nothing has_been received .
negative	very dissapointing as the event for which i requried the item of clothing has now passed .
negative	luckily house of fraser had what i needed in time for the event !
negative	we ordered a semi - integrated_dishwasher - the ordering_process was good , but the delivery process is another matter entirely .
negative	we organised delivery for the saturday of the jubilee bank_holiday .
negative	we then had a call from hiway ( the delivery company ) saying the van had broken down and that it would be delivered on sunday instead .
negative	i was frustrated at the breakdown , but impressed with the offer of a sunday delivery .
negative	come sunday and hiway calls again , " sorry_sir , no delivery today as appliancesdirect didn_'_t actually send us your dishwasher , so it '_s not on the van ."
negative	i call and am told that customer service will be in at 0 on monday and can help .
negative	i called at 0 and am now told they ' re only there at 00 , does anyone at this company know what '_s happening ?
negative	so right now i have four things
negative	0 .
negative	a hole in my account balance having paid for a dishwasher
negative	0 .
negative	an appliances direct website that claims said dishwasher is out for delivery
negative	0 .
negative	a delivery company telling_me that the dishwasher never arrived with them in the first place
negative	0 .
negative	a wasted four day break
negative	grrr
negative	drab and depressing stores with uninterested staff
negative	no one picked me up at the airport , the operator at phone was very unpolite , the operator [_private_data_removed_] at the desk not very proffesional and the service with the car was an incubus . never again ok car .
negative	flowers arrived in a sorry state , limp , discoloured , with some dead leaves .
negative	i then tried to call the customer_services number supplied on the base of the paperwork , only to find out they no_longer accept calls .
negative	this german company delivered valentines_day flowers four days late into holland .
negative	they were faster in 0000 .
negative	ordered a nice phone for the wifes_birthday in plenty of time ( i thought ), advertised as being five in stock !
negative	, and still is being , ( even_though they did not despatch one within their advertised delivery perameters ), so i cancelled due to non delivery in time .
negative	i have had nothing but excuses and delay tactics since regarding my refund
negative	very unhappy
negative	avoid this company
negative	placed my order to trading_depot and paid via_paypal 00 / 00 / 00 , it `_s now 00 / 00 / 00 , and still i have had no return communication to my emails asking what has happened to my order !, i have even taken out a paypal_dispute , and they have not even replied to that !
negative	beware !.
negative	i got my graphics_card then suddenly i realised it was water_cooled the engineer and me parent was there and we never installed it we took it back 00 £ for delivery back they told us it was fried and already used we didnt use it for a second it was in a diffrent box aswell a 000 this one was 000 gtx when it got took back we had already used another one a gtx_000 this one isnt working either and they are not even refunding the water_cooled one and say we used it they even said they sent us an email but that was a trick to keep us occupied these are not eligible i wouid highly not reccomend this service at all !
negative	my ups parcel was lost and it took absolutely ages to track .
negative	very poor communication between interparcel and ups .
negative	the tracking process did not start until 0 days after i complained about lost parcel and then the process took about 0_weeks .
negative	very poor when they lose parcels , but ok usually .
negative	anniversary flowers arrived in a box in able to stand ( imagine an upside - down pyramid ).
negative	had obviously fallen over multiple_times .
negative	complained to serenata yesterday requesting a full_refund .
negative	still no response .
negative	amount of flowers was not £_00 + other half was happy but she didn_'_t know how i paid .
negative	think she would be shocked to know how much i paid
negative	ordered what i thought would be a set of dumbells for just over £_00 including pp
negative	when my product arrived it only had one dumbell in the box which i found strange so i rang up your company and asked where the other one was and was told they are sold separately which is such a con .
negative	this was not mentioned anywhere when i was buying this product , who in there right mind would buy just one dumbell .
negative	i think you do this so that people will think they are getting a good offer and then have to buy the other one because they have payed so much for pp .
negative	you must get complaints all the time .
negative	i will make a note not to use your company again .
negative	so i have brought a lovely set from argos for £_00 . 00 for 0 dumbells because they are sold as a set .
negative	i made a bit of a mistake , i admit .
negative	i was too trusting and sent money via bank_transfer to a seller who sent me some acoustic foam which smelt so bad i had to throw it away .
negative	stale cigarettes and a build up of tar all over it .
negative	cost £_00 .
negative	the seller pretended to refund the money , but after a month , i '_ve given up .
negative	my advice : be careful of people selling acoustic foam , and see it in person before buying .
negative	if you cannot , do not use gumtree to purchase .
negative	you may as well burn money .
negative	i contacted gumtree support who sent a standard email back .
negative	they couldn_'_t even be_bothered to customise the email !
negative	where the item name should be , there was just an " xxxxx " placeholder .
negative	i did complain directly to them about this , for which they apologised .
negative	i asked them to remove the advert for the remaining foam , as i thought it was unfair for others to suffer loss .
negative	they refused .
negative	utterly_disgusted with this service .
negative	gumtree , i will not be using you again .
negative	worst experience online ever !
negative	ordered a shower_screen , item cost over £_000 , nearly_£_00 for delivery .
negative	have been waiting now for over 0_weeks .
negative	when contacting them i spoke to a manager who told me 0 different delivery dates in the same conversation none of which have happend then i was told they didn_'_t have the item & they would ring when they did .
negative	lousy service , useless managers & nobody knows what is happening .
negative	do not use these_people ....
negative	very bad – unacceptable experience , unreasonable , sly , rottens fraud and rude_conduct as a customer under two years contract with 0 more months to go .
negative	one of the biggest jibe is theirs sneaky advertisement on new ipad ( 0 ) which mention compaitible with 0g ( lte ) in the uk way back in october_0000 and now change theirs cunning way by adding 0g icons in compaitible with new ipad ( 0 ) without a word on new ipad ( 0 ) lte as dead as a dodo .
negative	ofcom , ombudsman , asa and cisas should be regulated with 0 mobile_broadband .
negative	be sure we will stay the hell away from all mobile_broadband in the future .
negative	i would sue them if i were you and this is not even half the problem for we care not to explain .
negative	i rented a medium - sized car in the uk this weekend through rentalcars . com .
negative	i was very frustrated to find that , having chosen all the possible insurance options , there was another substantial daily premium to pay at pick - up , to eliminate the thousand_pound excess .
negative	i feel that this is just plain dishonest - why can '_t rentalcars . com sort this out , so that there is one charge , inclusive of all insurance ?
negative	why would anybody consider risking a huge excess in the event of even a minor collision ?
negative	this is the third time that i have used rentalcars . com , each time in a different country .
negative	each time i have been disappointed by the final cost and i will now go direct to the rental_companies - they may play the same trick , but at_least they won_'_t deceive me into a paying a fake cdw premium .
negative	good bye , rentalcars . com .
negative	it has not been a pleasure .
negative	recently returned a pair of glasses purchsed from glasses_direct where there was a problem with the lens coating / tint .
negative	the coating / tint was begining to dissapear from the lens and was being replaced with a dull fogging effect .
negative	glasses were regularty being cleaned with the correct opticians cleaning_fluid and a lens cloth .
negative	glasses_direct charged me to replace the lens and did not return the old lens .
negative	i am really dissapointed a large company like glasses_direct did not replace the lens due to the quality issue as a gesture of good will .
negative	would welcome their comments .
negative	i bought 0 of the same items form their website and only to find out later that they will not release the order as they will only sell 0 item per customer .
negative	they should add this on their website or perhaps only allow 0 item to be bought online .
negative	i '_ve_used dpd in the past and have had nothing but first_class service .
negative	but how wrong can you be huh_?
negative	i ordered goods on friday_afternoon expecting it today .
negative	i even got an email from my retailer confirming today '_s date .
negative	i usually get a text in the morning of delivery from dpd giving me a rough_estimate within the hour of when my delivery was going to arrive .
negative	this was the feature that i thought dpd had over the rival courier companies .
negative	however entered my tracking_number online i noticed that my delivery was in the york delivery depot to be delivered tomorrow .
negative	after_contacting my retailer about this they informed that my delivery had in fact gone to the wrong depot and that it is out for delivery tomorrow .
negative	dpd couldn_'_t even be_bothered to inform_me of their error .
negative	if i hadn_'_t contacted the retailer , like a lemon i would have waited indoors all day for a delivery which was never going to materialise .
negative	i cannot_fault the retailer and the after sales service which they provided was very useful .
negative	just one final note .
negative	unlike_other courier companies , i discovered that i could only contact dpd via their email enquiry_form .
negative	there is no contact number to talk to a real_life human_being .
negative	in future i will be thinking twice on which courier company i wish to use .
negative	even if i have to pay that little_bit more , the service has got to be better_than the problems i '_ve encountered from dpd today .
negative	i recently ordered an internal compact_flash card_reader for a computer i '_m building .
negative	i ' d never used bt shop before and was hesitant in my order being successful if it was anything like their telephone service .
negative	at the time i placed the order it was late at night so wasn_'_t expecting the goods to arrive for at_least 0 days .
negative	despite the product only costing_£_00 i wasn_'_t given an option of paying a premium delivery charge for a scheduled day to prevent me from imprisoning myself at home for a few_days until it arrived .
negative	that was the first detail which didn_'_t impress me .
negative	a few_days_later i received an email to say that the product i ordered had been_discontinued and that my order had been cancelled and no funds had come out of my account .
negative	in a panic i contacted my bank to confirm that .
negative	i then contacted bt to ask why i was able to submit my card info to them for an item which had been_discontinued .
negative	they said , and i quote , " it was a mistake ".
negative	minutes after i ended that phone conversation i searched on google for an_alternative company to buy this card_reader and who in my search_results do i see selling the same product ?
negative	that '_s right .
negative	bt .
negative	they haven_'_t even removed the product from their website .
negative	so from my first and last shopping_experience with bt , do not buy from them unless you want to end up being disappointed .
negative	0nd time ordered items and again disappointed in time taken to reimburse funds !
negative	fear them and stay_away like the plague !
negative	bought a new house which had triple glazing installed by previous_owners from this company .
negative	owners left us a transferable 00 year gurantee for them .
negative	found a fault with water leaking in , rang the company , send them the guarantee to transfer into our names .
negative	chased them for over a week , emails and phone_calls until eventually they admit to having received the letter , which they denied for many days .
negative	they later ring me back and state they did not issue this guarantee , and they have no proof of payment the windows were ever paid for !
negative	what company in their right mind would issue a guarantee for their product unless they had been paid !?
negative	i also have proof of a cover note with their company details on it stating the type of windows and an energy report on the windows , as well as of course the guarantee with their details on , but still they won_'_t accept it and therefore won_'_t investigate my fault .
negative	rude , abrupt customer service when i have spoke to them on the phone , treat you like an_idiot , talk over you and play dumb .
negative	want my advice ?
negative	do not even think about buying anything from this company ... you have been_warned .
negative	i '_m now pursuing action with trading_standards and office of fair_trading , whilst spreading the word about this company to save others the pain .
negative	if you don_'_t believe me , just google them and read other horror_stories for yourself .
negative	item as_described , but delivered 0 days_later than i paid for ... even as they were paid additional 0 . 00 for " next_day delivery "...
negative	sony_xperia s
negative	my experience is similar to others sent my phone they offered me £_00 then when it arrived the offer was reduced to £ 0 .
negative	on questioning and saying screen was in good condition this i was told ....
negative	" the screen was fading in parts due to the pixel damage , something that you would not notice in normal every day use but we can detect in laboratory tests we have done on the phone ."
negative	total bull but they said they would up their offer to £_00 .
negative	not going to bother getting it back as from reading the other reviews they come_back in all_sorts of condition without other parts and bits you sent them .
negative	i am .... was a loyal_customer to o0 but will change on next renewal cos of this scam recycle racket they pulled .
negative	try someone_else as the only way is up from here !
negative	wish i ' d read other reviews .
negative	bought a desktop_pc .
negative	came with old style mouse and keyboard ( non - usb ) that keeps stopping working , meaning reboot every time .
negative	called their outsourced technical_support who laughed that they still sell such obsolete technology .
negative	then called ld again and the guy said he will try and get a a free usb mouse and keyboard sent ( not ideal as this will take up 0 usb slots but better_than nothing ) and we will hear from them within 00_hours as much_easier / cheaper_than to ship the pc back : 0 days_later still nothing .
negative	i guess this wasn_'_t authorised and no one is interested .
negative	is anyone listening at laptops direct ?
negative	order ld000000 account eng000
negative	despite ordering something shown as ' in stock ' on the website and payment being taken immediately , it '_s now been almost two_weeks and still no delivery .
negative	their customer contact is poor - only after i contacted them and they took several days to reply and promised to get goods to me but after another week still_waiting .
negative	have now cancelled order and asked vredit card company to take action to recover money .
negative	do not deal with these shysters .
negative	i bought a rug from them last_week .
negative	i got confirmation it would be delivered with parcel_force within 00_hours a day after i bought it .
negative	i '_m still_waiting .
negative	i have contacted parcel_force with the parcel number and they state it still with the sender .
negative	i contacted the rug company by email , the one they sent me at the begining of the week but no one has got back to and still no rug .
negative	why are these things so difficult .
negative	i would just appreciate it if someone would let_me know what is happening and when it will be delivered .
negative	ordered a mother '_s day gift ( flowers ) to be delivered on mother '_s day , stil hasn_'_t arrived , unable to contact anyone from iflorist , online_chat is always offline , 00 + calls to their customer service line weren_'_t answered , and no response on their " support " system .
negative	save_yourself the bother and disappointment , will have to reclaim my money through my credit_card company .
negative	i was very happy with the sale of an ipad , which brought a good price and quick service .
negative	on the basis of that deal i tried to sell an htc phone .
negative	the price offered was a little disappointing , but it was just languishing in a cupboard , so i accepted the offer .
negative	however , the phone was returned , because " it was not in working order " and the offer was withdrawn .
negative	immediately i received the phone back i put my old sim_card in and was able to use all the phone '_s functions !
negative	overall therefore disappointed , to say the least .
negative	my annoyance at the htc rejection far_outweighs the good experience with the ipad .
negative	i purchased a set of clubs for me wife and received one club .
negative	i only purchased the deal after double_checking all_aspects of the listing and taking advise .
negative	the advert was very clear what i was buying and very very unclear on what they actually supplied .
negative	after three phone_calls and 0 emails i am still outstanding any kind of respectful customer service or response .
negative	all i am being offered is a refund which is against the principal of what they are doing and trying on .
negative	they ruined a weekend for me where i had planned to pay 00 holes with my wife and she had no clubs to use .
negative	poor advert for on line golf at this stage of my opinions !
negative	i have saved several screen_shots of what i believe to be false_advertising and misleading and seemingly for no reason , in a recent response from them they have acknowledged they have their it team updating the listings , which to me suggests they acknowledge my claims .
negative	however even if they do respond to customer queries being one good point , it is very much wasted as they are not prepared to do anything about their short fallings and this leave a very bad_taste with regards to their handling of customer_services in the even of them having a disgruntled customer .
negative	and in response to your pathetic reply_below i would like to add the following here .
negative	( as i don_'_t wish to comment on facebook and it doesn_'_t allow me to reply to your comment in this forum ?)
negative	:-
negative	after the conversations that we had i am surprised you have bothered to try and defend yourselves , especially knowing i would again reply .
negative	the truth is if i had of had the time recently i would have taken my claim further and may still do so .
negative	as you well know i did get positive information from the authorities , and have had it confirmed that i do have a case should i wish to take the time to follow it up .
negative	you admitted on the phone that the advert was misleading , you even suggested we cant send you what the advert suggested i should have recieved because you didnt have the full set in stock !
negative	you also told me that you were going to have the it department change the adverts going forward .
negative	all of these comments suggest that you agree the advert was misleading , and in my opinion is exactly why your handling of my complaint was not at all suitable and was in fact the bare_minimum that you could have done .
negative	by law you would have had to give me a full credit for returning the goods within the agreed time , so please do not make out i am receiving any special treatment for your shoddy listings in any way .
negative	i don_'_t believe you have put your customer first , and far from it , you have put your back pocket first in my case and the audacious response you have provided above is nothing short of embarrassing for you .
negative	you arguably did not supply what you advertised and i made it very clear in detail by phone and email and numerous screen_shots as to back up my comments .
negative	your 0rd paragraph is patronising and completely wrong , your facts are wrong and that is not how any of this went down and you know it .
negative	out of respect at this stage i have chosen not to mention names of the conversations i had when and with who .
negative	your 0th paragraph is basic trading law , don_'_t big yourself up , you cannot trade without conforming to such rules .
negative	in fact you are also contradicting yourself here too , as i was told it was a 00 days return_policy you operated , which by law is the minimum requirement i believe , when most others offer at_least 00 days .
negative	your fifth paragraph is again wrong , there was never confusion on my part , please do not insult me , i went in and out of the site before i purchased the goods , i took advise before purchasing as the listing seemed too good to be true , but it was what it was .
negative	i then made my case very clear by phone and in turn by email , which was agreed by you that i had a case .
negative	you are also wrong in that i rejected the collection and refund because that is exactly_what has happened ?
negative	right ?
negative	so how did i reject that ?
negative	i merely said that i may choose to take further_action regardless which until now i have not had the time to follow through on .
negative	i just need to find out how long i have to take this option up or not .
negative	also wrong in that i was not looking for compensation , i was looking for what i expected to receive based on your advert , that was arguably misleading .
negative	when you made it clear that didn_'_t have the goods available , i asked for a like for like version to be sent instead , which you refused and merely offered me my fully entitled refund .
negative	you have not be straight and you have not been fair .
negative	and it was not resolved with a full_refund .
negative	your response here quite_frankly is utter nonsense and a poor attempt of trying to defend a 0_star report that you more than deserve .
negative	thanks

negative	i had a problem with my last order ( and i mean last order ) i got in touch with the company and i was given a very brief answer to my complaint about my order , i replied that i thought the answer did not satisfy me , as it had not even tried to appease me , it was a , here is my answer , take it or leave it .
negative	so good bye , i have taken my custom else where .
negative	i do not think this is the kind of review you would want , but never forget the little man , he or she is the one who built your company into what it is today
negative	i orded a new iphone0 on the 00 / 00 /_0000 , waited 0 days for the delivery but nothing arrived .
negative	then i got a email from leslie grant asking to email her a photo copy of the card i used to order the goods , a utility_bill , my driving_licence , and my passport .
negative	i then got a email from her saying she had contacted her dispatch team to handle my order in a priority basis , but still no phone .
negative	since then money was taken from my account and still no phone .
negative	if you ring up you have to wait up to 0 / 0 hour at_least before you can speak with some one . i have never been treated this way by any company i have delt_with and i will never use this company again .
negative	the customer is not king at this place and they use your money to finance their compay .
negative	i ordered on 00 / 00 /_0000 - they cancelled order cos not able to do the same ,
negative	they try to transfer the money to my card due to card expiry they are not able to do the same .
negative	after i requested and fight with them , they accepted to transfer the money to my bank .
negative	almost 0 months over still not they are not transferred to bank .
negative	we ordered a set of taps on 00th_april and were advised a couple of days_later that they were on the way so we booked our man to come and fit them this weekend ( 0 . 000 ) but still no taps .
negative	not impressed at all with the service
negative	my first bike arrived with the box already half opened and a bike that was clearly not new .
negative	there were scratch marks on it and parts of the metal bent .
negative	it had been so bent that i was unable to assemble the wheel to the bike frame .
negative	so i contacted bikes 0u , and they offered to pick_up the broken bike and deliver a new one .
negative	however the new bike had the exact_same damage , the part where the bike wheel is meant to slip in was completely bent and visible scratches around the area .
negative	i was very appalled_by the condition in which the bikes had been shipped .
negative	too bad !
negative	when a parcel is lost there is limited help and phone number is a premium_rate number .
negative	i have used them a great deal in the past but now a parcel is lost when i need their help they just are not interested in contacting you with updates .
negative	in fact i have found they almost avoid contact and then make it very hard to speak to them without it costing you a small_fortune .
negative	if you book with a courier they at_least then have a free number and a person to speak to who will help .
negative	i would avoid parcel 0 go
negative	ordered a 0000l bunded oil_tank and after 0 days made contact with bhl to be told there is a delay .
negative	they claim to deliver in a week but mine took 0_weeks to arrive .
negative	then on appointed delivery date guess_what no show !
negative	waisted whole day at home on advice of delivery that never showed ..... not great .
negative	then when arrived came on small lorry that had had the tank loaded on via forklift but the tail_lift was too small for tank to be lowered on so precarious balancing act in getting it off lorry .
negative	driver did all he could but clearly no thought when loaded such a large item on a small lorry .
negative	i bought a baby belling cooker .
negative	when it arrived it was a shoddy design and a danger to use .
negative	the oven_door_handle has fallen_off three_times so_far .
negative	the metal used is so thin that the cooker sways under the weight of a saucepan .
negative	the top of the cooker gets very hot and the inside of the oven over - heats .
negative	i am now trying to get my money back , though hispek electronics don_'_t seem to want to know .
negative	i send the phone and tehy no paid is working and i check , its was something with insurance , i dont care about that is working i paid for that phone 000 pouds
negative	give me back .
negative	or mazuma is in troubles
negative	when ordering i asked you to deliver the product to 0 different_addresses .
negative	on the confirmation i questioned_why this hadnt been mentioned but was assured that it would be delivered as per my request .
negative	after chasing the product was delivered but all to the same address which meant i had to re - ship the goods at my cost due to failure to meet my request .
negative	i shall not be ordering from you again .
negative	what prescription number are you waiting for .
negative	the prescription i have has the numbers 000000 , 00000000000 , fp00ss0000 or another number is 0000000000 .
negative	they told me i have filled the on line prescription section where i have to send in the prescription by post , which i have but still nothing after_placing the order on the 00 june 00

negative	0 of my recent orders with online companies were delivered by hermes .
negative	of those , three were delivered to the wrong_address and three of them were not delivered at all and one took three_weeks to be delivered .
negative	the three that weren_'_t delivered were supposedly left in a safe location , the communal_hallway of my building by the front_door .
negative	obviously these three parcels went missing as a communal_hallway is hardly a safe_place .
negative	that '_s if they were actually delivered in the first place as for all know the courier stole them .
negative	no cards were left through the door so there '_s no proof the courier even left the parcels .
negative	i '_ve actually had a full blown argument with one of their self_employed couriers before after he threatened and swore at me on the phone .
negative	hermes seem to use self_employed couriers and would apparently not require any experience , skill or professionalism from them .
negative	hermes won_'_t allow you to contact them by phone or email to complain personally and they say ' contractual_obligations ' are the reason , although i '_ve spoken to some of the companies who use them and it '_s hermes insistence that they are not to be contacted directly by the person receiving the parcel .
negative	they really are utterly rubbish and incompetent .
negative	decided to use mr auto and not oscaro ............. big_mistake their map for delivery details sent me about 00k the wrong way , fortunately where i stopped the shop knew where the collection site was , went there .. no delivery . mailed auto and several day and more mails from me and they say 0 more week ( 0 total ) i have to go abroad in 0_weeks leaving a safe car for my partner ... thanks for nothing auto am now going back in future to oscaro whose delivery is dead on , so cant deliver why trade ?
negative	basically they are not the ones that do the delivery , they arrange it for you !
negative	they are the middle_man !
negative	unfortunately they are not very good at it and they don_'_t really have much control of whats_happening !
negative	their customer service is a complete nonsense !
negative	the team comes across incompetent and incapable to assist particularly with international_deliveries !
negative	i '_m not gonna go into details but if you have a choice go for another service !
negative	and never ever ever choose parcelforce to deliver anything under no circumstances !
negative	did not buy one single item from argos this christmas as nearly every item seen on the website cannot be reserved for store pick_up as out of stock not good enough and i went elsewhere
negative	i placed an order at the beginning of feb that has still not arrived and to this day despite trying to contact by phone ( only an_automated_answering_machine !)
negative	and emails i have had zero response .
negative	i have spoke to other shops on the high_street at 00 bute street & also 0 station rd radyr cardiff a returns address they use and not one person has heard of so special .
negative	i have definitely been duped out of my £_00 and have contacted trading_standards / consumer direct to look into this shady group .
negative	also spoke to visa and they are going to do a fraud investigation .
negative	i can '_t stress enough - do not order from these theives !
negative	i ordered a asus x00ca of this company , which i was assured that it would be delivered today 00 / 00 /_0000 anytime up to 0pm .
negative	after numerous phone_calls to yourselfs and being assured by your telephone operators it will be here by 0pm at the latest today no sign of the said asus_laptop .
negative	i honestly think the laptop was never dispatched or even existed and this company and thier subsidiary companys are completely false and thier nothing but a bunch of shysters .
negative	my advice is forget about buying anything from them and spend your hard earn , t money , with a honest reputable_company , mr n . s cheeseman basildon essex
negative	i was informed at 0000 that the flowers i ordered for valentines was not going to arrive_till the following_day .
negative	i then emailed a complaint demading a refund to which i have had no reply .
negative	i then purchased flowers elsewhere as serenata let_me down .
negative	then the flowers i had oroginally ordered showed up at 0000 !
negative	i do not hold serenata responsible but i do blame them for using a company such as yodell for delivering !
negative	its common_sense that yodell are useless !
negative	i visited website looking for some scuba fins and saw what i wanted was cheeper_than in the uk so i bought them and wastold on the site 0 - 0 days 0 days_later my package arrived when i opend it , it was the wrong item , i phoned and was told to fill out a on line form and they couldnt send the correct item till they had recived the wrong item back wich i did i recived a sms saying that i would hear from the courier when they were going to pick it up within 0 days 0 days_later nothing i spoke to courier company they told me they had not been instructed to pick_up item so i called scubastore and was told that was a lie but the courier they used was not very good and they would have it picked_up the next_day and would ship my correct item immediatly suprise_suprise 0 days_later no courrier then iwas given a date for collection which they were 0 hrs late for and here i am another 0 days_later still with no fins
negative	so all in all what should have taken 0 days has turned into a month and the item was only shipped today in the mean time i have had to rent gear 0 times at a cost of 00 pounds and 0 days off work waiting for couriers that didnt arrive at a cost of 000_pounds my saving was only 00 pounds in the first place so i am 000_pounds out of pocket and still no fins this is the worst company i have ever traded with told constant_lies and there customer sevice is disgusting if you are thinking of using them dont by in england youl still save_money than buying off scubastore
negative	massively let_down , the bouquet sent to my girlfriend looked completely horrible and didn_'_t contain a single flower i ' d chosen as part of the ' truly , madly , deeply ' arrangement .
negative	the website was well to use and i know there is a statement saying if certain flowers aren_'_t available they would exchange them with some worth equal value but it '_s disgraceful to send an entirely different set of flowers .
negative	it didn_'_t even contain red_roses !
negative	i only wish i could upload the picture i chosen compared to the one recieved
negative	disgraceful , will never use again and would advise others to do the same .
negative	dont watch much tv but when i do i just end up turning it off after 0 mins of adverts is stuck in your face 0 seconds after you turn something on .
negative	always left a card for attempted delivery !
negative	maybe knock a little louder as i was 00ft from the door and a card appears i didnt hear ?...
negative	also the drivers i have dealt_with can be rude and abrupt .
negative	bad_experience and service .
negative	we switched to talktalk a month_ago because of the huge bills from bt .
negative	when i rang talktalk about switching i was only after phone and broadband as we are happy with sky_tv , but was talked into the tv package too as it was cheaper .
negative	anyway ... 0_weeks_later we have recieved the tv box ( that we didnt really want ) but the router ( that we needed ) is still not here .
negative	then 0 days ago they cut the phone line off without_any warning .
negative	phoned up to pay the bill and was told it would be back on within 00_hours , well 00_hours_later its still not on !
negative	after just a month we are done with this second rate company .
negative	felt really strongly about recent issues with my internet and phone provider ( bt ).
negative	so i decided to write a review , my first ever on trustpilot .
negative	i kept composed and even edited out anything that could be termed course or offensive at all before posting my review only for it to instantly disappear and say it was reported for bad language .
negative	so i read through it a couple of times on the edit screen to make_sure there was no bad language or anything offensive at all .
negative	i thought maybe it was standard procedure to check the reviews .
negative	so i waited 0 days then checked when i was next online ... and still no review .
negative	so i message trustpilot and ask if they actually bother checking reviews ?
negative	yes within 0 days was there reply .
negative	low and behold on day 0 the review i took 00_mins to compose and type was gone .
negative	or should i say never checked and / or published when it was perfectly fine .
negative	what '_s the point trustpilot ?
negative	i suggest you do some work and less time at the coffee_machine .
negative	ordered canon_0d body from this god - forsaken band of rip - off_merchants on the 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	cancelled on 00 / 00 / 00 due to no effective response to my enquiries and despite automatic email assurances and promises i am still_awaiting a refund .
negative	i have reported them to bbc_watchdog tv programme , trading_standards office , my credit_card company and will also report them to the police .
negative	if they are a legitimate setup then i apologise but please prepare yourself for great stress .
negative	as someone commented earlier avoid_avoid_avoid at all costs .
negative	having lost the receipt for a microwave we bought 0 months_ago i called the customer service line to see if it was possible to still get it replaced as the interior paint had peeled_off and was cracked .
negative	the customer service line said i should take it back to the store and as the goods were faulty they would replace the microwave .
negative	how wrong they could be !
negative	not only did the ' customer service manager ' speak to me like a naughty school child but she didn_'_t even bother to ask what the actual fault was with the microwave and then wouldn_'_t give me her name as it ' wasn_'_t her policy ' or put in writing the store policy on returns because ' she doesn_'_t put anything in writing .'
negative	it may have been my fault that we lost the receipt and it may very well be the store policy not to offer refunds without it but firstly the phoneline and the stores should not give out conflicting_information and a customer service manager should learn to deal with customer complaints in a friendly and understanding manner .
negative	no - one should ever feel as frustrated and angry as i did walking out of that store today .
negative	unhelpful , unacceptable and unfriendly .
negative	i shall never be using argos again .
negative	my mums migration to plusnet went wrong due to openreach but plusnet were next to useless getting it resolved and ended_up taking a week .
negative	meanwhile someone_else had been given our number and we had someone_elses .
negative	took so long to resolve as plusnet admitted they raised an incorrect fault as they didn_'_t know what else to do !
negative	this caused my pensioner mum lots of stress .
negative	trying to get things corrected was very difficult and involved many calls and having to be quite forceful which should be unnecessary .
negative	dealing_with the complaints_department was extremely disappointing and just exacerbated the bad_experience .
negative	at first they put the complaint on the wrong account , they lied at one point , they did not read correspondence properly and they did not take a probable data_protection breach seriously .
negative	at the end they issued a deadlock code and inferred we were just after money when they didn_'_t offer much and we know they offered more to someone for the same problem that only lasted a day !
negative	their cheap package also doesn_'_t work out that cheap if you get caught for not included calls and extra broadband .
negative	will leave asap .
negative	update_: complained to cisas and awarded full compensation requested .
negative	note that plusnet have increased some prices but you cannot leave without_penalty if you had their ' free ' connection and router within 00 months .
negative	i think a dis_- honest way of keeping customers trapped when raising prices !
negative	needed new inks for my hp_photosmart c0000 printer , ordered two a colour and black one , thought i would give them a try as nothing ventured nothing gained , after ages i got the printer to accept the coloured one as for the black after two_days of trying the printer would not accept it , maybe i was unlucky i dont_know as i am not a printer mechanic , but without me saying it you can guess where i will be getting my printer_inks in future , and if they ask me to return it as i am_disabled there is no way , i buy many different things using my computer , i will put it down to experience , as the saying goes you get what you pay for ...
negative	/
negative	i bought a fully enclosed shower from them it cost over £ 0000 it had two doors when the plumbers were installing it they found they had sent two left doors i rang them uo and they said we will send you the right door in a couple of days so the plumbers came back a few_days_later to put the right door in and i had to pay them a extra £_000 for the extra visit i contacted b and q and after lots of phone_calls over many days i got £_000 back
negative	i ordered some flowers for my wife '_s on our_anniversary .
negative	there was damage to the flowers & leaves .
negative	i won_'_t use this company again .
negative	spent an_hour argueing that the item i wanted to return was not medication , and i wanted a refund .
negative	they refused , stating it was medication and thats the end of that .
negative	be aware consumers , to check what you order is refundable before you part with your money .
negative	parcel not collected for two_days despite confirmation from interparcel it would be collected on both dates .
negative	had to rebook with another courier and now have an upset client to deal with .
negative	customer service email responses very poor and certainly portrayed a clear message of ' we don_'_t really care '.
negative	ordered ms project monday , received payment confirmation but suspiciously , nothing further .
negative	used the webform on tuesday to ask for details of delivery , no response .
negative	waiting for a parcel on a 0 - 0 day delivery - a birthday_present for my son .
negative	after 0 days their site said parcel was delivered but i hadn_'_t received it .
negative	their website has no contact number on it but i managed to track one down and phoned up .
negative	they refused to give me any info " because i wasn_'_t the sender " but they would " raise a query " with the courier and i might hear in 00_hours .
negative	the next_day still nothing and after numerous phone_calls to some very unhelpful people someone eventually told me " oh it hasn_'_t even been collected yet , it '_s been a tracking error ".
negative	what ?
negative	so you would think they would rush over and collect it and express delivery it on a 00 hour service .
negative	but oh no - it '_ll just be 0 - 0 days from when it gets collected .
negative	seriously ?
negative	what a complete_joke .
negative	and why don_'_t they have their number on their website ?
negative	" because we ' re a web based company ."
negative	no , you ' re a human_being sitting in a physical office working for a company that has a website that doesn_'_t bother to give customers their phone number .
negative	you ' re not a web based company - just a company hiding_behind a website .
negative	unless you prefer spending hours or even days sitting on your bum waiting and wondering , doing the will they / won_'_t they ?
negative	stuff ... don_'_t use these_clowns .
negative	i booked a collection with yodel00 ( 00 .. 00_hours .. this is a joke believe me ) for monday .
negative	i waited in all day , nothing , looked at the on line tracking and at 0 :_00pm it said " van not ready ".
negative	mmmm .. read in to this what you may , i substituted van with yodel .
negative	re - scheduled for tuesday and waited in all day and ditto no - one came .
negative	rescheduled for wednesday and ( awww , you ' re ahead of me aren_'_t you ?)
negative	ditto .
negative	three_days sitting_around waiting !
negative	cancelled under dsr and booked it with <_external link_removed >, who turned_up promptly at 0000am , spoke english , and collected .
negative	to anyone who has got angry with a supplier who_uses_yodel , please don_'_t get angry with them .
negative	they , like me thought they were dealing_with a reputable_company , and have been mistaken , taken for a ride and lost money on it .
negative	take my advice , don_'_t use yodel ( anything ), they are the one '_s who deserve to go out of business not the people who use them !
negative	ps , it says under here inform yodel about my review .
negative	why ?
negative	do i think they will care ?
negative	the stock_levels are hopelessly untrue or not kept up to date .
negative	in common with a lot of others , i ordered an " in stock " item , only to find out it wasn_'_t a day later , then after a few calls i was told the stock was going to be in , in a couple of days .
negative	then when that deadline expired , in another couple of days , then , when that deadline expired , another week .
negative	at that point i cancelled the order .
negative	if your item actually turns_out to be in stock you might have better luck , but you won_'_t find out till you place your order , then like me , you are stuck with it !!
negative	i wouldn_'_t bother personally with this hassle , there are better on - line retailers , e_- buyer , pixmania etc .
negative	i ordered a camera from camerabox a while back and having not received anything from them i checked on their websites " track your order " system .
negative	the order status was showing as still to be processed so i called them to find out why it was taking so long .
negative	at this point they had not contacted me in any way to say my camera was going to be late .
negative	they informed me they are very busy and that i would just have to wait another week .
negative	i leave the country to go on holiday in 0 days time and asked them to fast track it to me , i was then told there is no way they can do this - despite them apparently having 0 in stock .
negative	getting a refund would take 00 days !!!
negative	i then made a complaint , telling them i would write a reveiw about the bad service if they didn_'_t try to get it to me in time .
negative	their response : " i do apologise for the inconveniences caused to you by this order , however blackmail will not be tolerated .
negative	we are happy to get you your products as quickly as possible , and can only do just that ."
negative	awful customer service and don_'_t try to fix their mistakes .
negative	i shop online a lot and these_guys are complete cowboys .
negative	avoid_avoid_avoid
negative	purchased a carpet , promise to deliver / fit before easter .
negative	day before delivery carpet fitter ( monday ) rebooked fitting for thursday no one turned_up . yet again !!!
negative	in all day as well .
negative	rang the store , they will ring back in your dreams .
negative	they take your money .
negative	customer service is extra .
negative	. up date tuesday 00 / 00 / 00
negative	carpet fitter_turned_up at last .
negative	out of the 00 sticks ( carpet_runners ) he only used about 00 . he made do with the old ones on the stairs .
negative	which i had taken photo as proof .
negative	so they gained an extra £_00 . 00 . i will never see that .
negative	if you go into norwich store watch out for there surveyor name darren .
negative	he will give you a few porkies !!!!!
negative	!
negative	if he was a bird he would fly .
negative	( read between the lines )
negative	ordered a tyre that was on the site , paid up but when arrived for fitting a replacement was given as the tyre was obsolete from michelin - joke is when icaklled them they new it but blamed their web_site ha !
negative	flowers looked nothing like the flowers in the picture .
negative	they looked about quarter the size bunch and had no roses .
negative	awful experience and no response to any emails .
negative	waste of £_00 will never use again
negative	i rented a car in innsbruck .
negative	when we arrived there was no rental_agency and no car .
negative	it was an offsite rental , but i called before and even if we where delayed we could still get the car , since we gave our flight number .
negative	well so there you are , no car everything closed and holding for rentalcars . com to pick_up the phone .
negative	it took us around 00_minutes to hear that we where not going to be able to get a car .
negative	we ended_up taking a taxi since all rental_agencies where closed ....
negative	the next_day a friend of mine , could pick_up the car after all , but there where no more cars available .... how is this possible , my car should still be there .
negative	it was not !
negative	you would expect your money back right away , but no .
negative	this takes them 00 days to return .
negative	don_'_t rent here , just go somewhere_else , it is not worth it !!!
negative	!
negative	- no communication
negative	- no product
negative	- i had to take action and then finally they cancelled !
negative	- ridiculous high rates for sending articles
negative	- all_kinds of hidden_costs ....
negative	run away and find an other company , there are so many !
negative	not worth the trouble
negative	i am not happy item never received
negative	the cash claim site is terrible and does not allow me to make the claim i need to .
negative	you can only follow the set questions which do not not cover the issue of my complaint .
negative	never received my outfit was told it was in guernsey , asked them i was told it has not been delivered to them yes the name is definitely joke , keep my money ill be going else where in future and so will my friends .
negative	dear_sir /_madam
negative	ref_: avis rental_agreement number_000000000
negative	rentalcars 000000000
negative	i am writing with reference to a very serious complaint i have .
negative	i believe that fraud and deceit may have taken place and i will stop at nothing until i have received a letter of apology , my money back , compensation and assurances that such practices will be reviewed and changed where necessary .
negative	i had to make a trip to the uk with my prime purpose to visit my mother who had recently been diagnosed with cancer .
negative	on this occasion i had decided that it would be easier to rent a car and not rely_on trains etc .
negative	i wanted to find a cheap hire car that was situated close to the south_terminal at gatwick_airport .
negative	my criteria was simply to get the cost as cheap as possible , and for it to be convenient .
negative	i had also asked for air_conditioning due to the hot_weather .
negative	my usage was going to be fairly minimal as i was travelling to kent and back , that is all , not a great distance mileage wise .
negative	i went online and the best website and price appeared to be through rental_cars .
negative	i called them , and they were very helpful on the phone and said that the best deal was with avis .
negative	i was happy that it was a name i had heard of , and i paid for the car by debit_card over the phone and i paid a little extra to reduce the excess .
negative	i was , at this point happy with the purchase .
negative	i arrived at gatwick and went to the avis_desk …. and from then on it ’_s been a nightmare .
negative	the man on the desk seemed stern but all i wanted to do was show my passport and licence details and get on the motorway .
negative	the avis person insisted he needed a few details , he then asked me if i wanted to get the excess reduced by paying extra .
negative	i said i had already paid for this online .
negative	then , suddenly he said he needed £_00 . 00 held on my card .
negative	i asked why and he said this was for fuel in case i didn_’_t return it with fuel inside it .
negative	he then went on to say that this was the maximum_amount i would pay if the tank was empty .
negative	i was getting frustrated at this point and i asked why this was not asked for on the phone as i would have paid by card on the phone .
negative	he tried to put the card_details through but it didn_’_t seem to work .
negative	he then said it needed a manual authorisation and did i have another card i could use .
negative	i said no that was the only card i had .
negative	reluctantly i persuaded him to call the card people , and after what seemed like a lifetime they eventually spoke to me , asked me a few security questions and authorised the payment .
negative	at this point by now 00_minutes of time had lapsed , and the avis man gave_me a small piece of paper with a number on it and a reference and he said they had asked me to call them at some point but that it was not urgent .
negative	i said to him that i was not going to call them if it was a survey or something as i had already wasted enough time .
negative	( interestingly it was urgent , by the time i got to kent i had several missed calls from the fraud squad wanting to talk to me relating to possible card misuse , and they had put a stop on the card until i could confirm my identity etc_.)
negative	i will of course be speaking to the card company to ask why they didn_’_t talk to me properly when i spoke to them at the airport , however i suspect they may have a recording of what the avis representative said and his “ excuse ” for taking £_00 . 00 .
negative	every time i asked about this i was told that this was in case i left the car empty of fuel and that it was a holding payment .
negative	i was finally given the rental_agreement to sign and i queried the excess amount stated on there and the avis representative said that this was just how the agreement printed out but i would not have to pay the excess .
negative	finally i got in the car and was able to drive away , quite stressed after what seemed an unnecessary delay and rudeness by all involved , not a great first “ hire car experience ”.
negative	however the car given was a nice citroen , despite not being the car i had paid for and promised .
negative	two_days_later i returned the vehicle , well within the time allocation , i had thought there would be a garage close to the airport , but i didn_’_t see one .
negative	i told the guy this when i dropped it off , but said there was still three_quarters of a tank left .
negative	he said no problem .
negative	to be honest i expected at some point to see a £_00 /£ 00 charge for fuel on my bank_statement .
negative	on tuesday the 00th_august i noticed £_00 had been taken out of my account by avis .
negative	first of all i must stress that i deem this to be theft and fraud .
negative	i called avis immediately to a man called barry granderson .
negative	barry was not rude but very very unhelpful and useless .
negative	first of all despite me making it clear that i would speak to trading_standards , the fraud squad , your directors and the media ( i work for the media ), he insisted he would not be able to respond for five days .
negative	totally_unacceptable .
negative	he then went on to say that i had opted for the pre_- payment fuel option and that i should have returned the vehicle as empty as possible .
negative	he then said i had signed a contract and i also highlighted that many people signed ppi insurance forms but that didn_’_t prevent them being mis_- sold too !
negative	this is despite my rental_cars agreement stating :-
negative	what you '_ll need to know
negative	fuel_policy - the vehicle is supplied with a full_tank of fuel .
negative	it should be returned full or refuelling charges will be applied .
negative	this being completely contrary to what baryy granderson told me .
negative	seven_days have now passed and i have received no communication from anyone and i have not received any payment .
negative	today i will be taking the following action :-
negative	• writing to your chairman expressing my concern
negative	• alerting various media including rogue_traders and watchdog
negative	• i will be posting this letter and details on the web
negative	• i will be contacting gatwick_airport authorities
negative	• i will be contacting rental_cars
negative	• i will be forwarding details to your trading body
negative	• i will be making trading_standards aware
negative	• i will be contacting the card authorisation company to question what was said to them and advise them what i was told .
negative	i await to hear from you please feel free to email me at mike . huston @ ymail . com or you can call me on 00000_000000 .
negative	furthermore if i have not received a satisfactory_conclusion to this matter by tuesday 0rd september_0000 then i will pass the matter to my legal team and ask them to vigorously pursue action_against you to recover my money , compensation , and all costs .
negative	i hope that you do care about your customer_satisfaction and your brand , my experience so_far suggests not .
negative	mike huston
negative	website states ' less_than 00 in stock '; i '_ve been speaking english all my life and this means in stock not out of stock .
negative	i realize that zero is less_than 00 but don_'_t accept that this meets any form of trade description .
negative	dabs used to be a good & reliable retailer but i won_'_t be shopping there again and would not recommend that you do either .
negative	my experience : place order mid_afternoon on friday for in stock item ( less_than 00 ).
negative	get immediate_confirmation of order but then hear nothing .
negative	tuesday check state of order and discover that it '_s out of stock .
negative	check item on site ( still less_than 00 in stock ).
negative	cancel order and buy from amazon - cost £ 0 more ; item delivered friday .
negative	result ( my wife buys a pile of stuff on ebay on the saturday and it all arrives well before my item does ).
negative	really unhappy .
negative	the only good thing .
negative	no monies were taken so i didn_'_t have to chase for a refund .
negative	don_'_t switch to first_utility .....
negative	valentine '_s day flowers were delivered to the incorrect_address and it has_been a struggle dealing_with serenata_flowers .
negative	they have no workable telephone_numbers and the only way to deal with them is by email .
negative	their answers are automated and evasive and i have not yet had either a satisfactory_explanation or resolution .
negative	i would recommend sticking to your local_florist
negative	all i wanted to know was do i leave a deposit with the budget desk at the airport and if so how much ?
negative	the cost of the hire car when i enquired 00 jan 00 was £_00 after waiting for the
negative	budget to reply and because budget did not reply through the electronic enquiry i had to write a letter to the customer service team by snail_mail post .
negative	the customer service team at avis / budget were still too_busy dealing_with post rental enquiries so i was passed off to the admin team who did not contact me for another week and then did not know what my original enquiry was about so they guessed and gave_me a telephone_number to call and also suggested i ask for a discount !
negative	so i reluctantly used the telephone and the hire cost as of 00 mar 00 is now £_000 . 00 this is with discount .
negative	i calmly explained to the call operator the history of my enquiry as she said that the £_000 . 00 included discount !
negative	over month to get an answer from a simple enquiry and the customer service were too_busy dealing_with post rental enquires i think this sums up this faceless company .
negative	could not care less !
negative	when looking for a web_hosting_companies , one of the first companies i thought about was 0and0 hosting .
negative	i '_ve seen the numerous tv_adverts , and advertisements in . net magazine , so naturally thought they would be a good safe solid choice .
negative	after looking at there packages , i was blown_away by one of their deals .
negative	unlimited hosting , bandwidth , websites ( host multiple sites ) and databases ( among other features ), it seemed too good to be true ( and ultimate was ).
negative	after signing_up , they said it would take 00_hours to get me setup , maybe i '_m a bit impatiencent but that seems a little far fetched ?, i know a domain can take a while , but setup ?
negative	usual its automated .
negative	anyway my main issue arrived when i couldn_'_t setup an ftp account .
negative	whenever i tried to change the password , or create a new ftp account , i was greeted with an error .
negative	upon_contacting the support_team ( who to be fair , were nice , but clueless ) assured me it was a bug , whom the development team were well aware of .
negative	but yet , three_days down the line and there was still no solution .
negative	at which point , i had enough and cancelled my account with them .
negative	which was a fairly easy process to be fair , i did have to ring up to cancel thou , there isn_'_t a method to cancel online ( which is odd , considering you can sign up online ...) so i was expecting some sales_pitch on the phone_call but fortunately , there wasn_'_t any , and it took no_longer_than 00_mins on the phone to cancel .
negative	overall , not a good experience .
negative	considering ftp is a corner stone of web_hosting , you would think this would be a priority issue that they would address quickly , but apparently not .
negative	just read all of the reviews , and then if you still go_ahead and sign up with this appalling outfit you will have no one to blame but yourself . i made that mistake and still nearly five months on my issue is un resolved .
negative	they don_'_t give a sh0t about their customers .
negative	bought an item and had it engraved in same shop after about 0weeks the engraving was becoming illegible so took it back to my home town shop to have it rectified , but the person behind the counter spoke down to me as if i was a child so i sent it off to the head_office on about the 0nd of dec , and complained about the poor service i had received but 0weeks had passed without a reply so i then had to phone them to find out what the delay was and they apologized and said they were very busy but eventually sent me a refund , so from_start to finish and from the bottom to the top of this company i have received a very poor and shoddy service , would i recommend or use this company again no !
negative	never !
negative	shocking .
negative	they claim any enquiries will be answered within 00_hrs .
negative	after my third enquiry , a week after my original enquiry , i received a completely_unhelpful reply , telling_me to call their number instead , which no doubt will cost .
negative	my experience is obviously tiny and unimportant compared to those whose tickets are cancelled , replaced etc , but i think it '_s very symptomatic of how this company runs and treats its customers .
negative	avoid .
negative	again ordering and taken delivery from on line no compliants , i ordered for a present for my wife and i ordered the wrong_size , i phoned up the help line ( very helpfull ) and i asked if we could take it to our local shop in liverpool and was told yes .
negative	i took my wife to town and dropped her off at the shop in bold street to do a exchange , she was served first by a assiatant who again was very help full but the manageress took over and this is were it changed .
negative	she began by checking the jacket had not been worn even_though the lables were still on and also we never recieved the jacket untill the friday and this was the sunday morning so again not even enough time to wear the jacket , she was not good with customer_relations would not go in the shop again .
negative	i ordered flowers to be delivered on valentines_day - they were not .
negative	i started complaining at 0 : 00 on valentines_day and have been in regular contact with different members of staff at i - florist using their on line contact .
negative	i was accused of lying when i said that my delivery was not delivered , i was told they had been delivered they weren_'_t - we were in all day .
negative	i was told they had been left somewhere safe " on the property " they were not , why should they have been we were in .
negative	i was told repeatedly that this person or that person would sort my problem and contact me , nobody ever did .
negative	eventually i threatened to start up a facebook_page with a less_than complementary title , within 0 / 0 an_hour i was offered a " complimentary " delivery of flowers , which i accepted .
negative	these no way made up for ruining valentines_day and being told over and over again that i was lying , despite the the fact that the order tracking said that the order had never left the florist !
negative	i have suffered 0 months of stress with this , i believe that the one star_rating was far higher_than i would have given if possible , i seriously doubt that i will ever have anything to do with i - florist and would_gladly have never had anything to do with them again until i was sent this .
negative	order reference that caused all of this was 000000
negative	the 0 of us travelling to turkey had an awful experience with travelup .
negative	they incorrectly booked one of our flights despite it being right on our e_- ticket .
negative	also after noticing on our e_- ticket that they hadn_'_t booked us baggage , we rang up to enquire .
negative	they told us that it was a mistake and that we did have luggage included .
negative	this was a lie which ended_up causing us a lot of hassle and costing_£_00 .
negative	they were rude and unresponsive when we complained to them .
negative	driver was 00min late even_though we asked for pick_up time recommended by the company for travellers from non - eu countries .
negative	i think it was an_hour after landing .
negative	the driver was very friendly but the car stank .
negative	if you dont mind being picked_up late and driving in a stinky car then i can recommend this company otherwise steer_clear .
negative	ordered a product online with no store near - by , the product then became_faulty after 0 months , i used my order number to view the order online and it had an option to return and book a courier , i did this and no courier came , so i booked another day and no courier came .
negative	i rang up and they said that service is only for the first 00 days and go to a store .
negative	i told them i had no stores near by and there system gave_me the impression the courier was coming .
negative	at no point did they admit there website was in the wrong , letting you book a collection after 00 days .
negative	really really bad service but in the end after insisting i was right , they refunded me .
negative	i ordered a petite star njoy bubble grey / black * reworked * a , this was a grade ( a ) pushchair and the website states grade a pushchairs are : returned items that are as ' new ' and un - used .
negative	when the item arrived it looked perfect , we had a good inspection as the website said : reworked prams and pushchairs are sold without warranty , under distance_selling_regulations you have 0 days to return the item to us if you are unhappy for the goods in any way .
negative	we noticed the hood catch was faulty so i rang nursery value up and explained the issue and they said to send it back and we ’ ll repair it , i stated we would have no buggy in this time and can ’_t they send another pushchair to us and collect this one , as it would be quicker but they insisted on collecting and repairing the pushchair and said i ’ d have it back next week .
negative	i really wasn_'_t happy with this as the distance_selling_regulations said i was entitled to a refund and they could have just exchanged it .
negative	a long time past and i had no updates at all about my repair , i thought i would have had an update when they received it then when it went in to be repaired and so on .
negative	but i was totally in the dark about what was happening .
negative	so i called them and they said they haven ’_t even looked at it yet but they will soon and get it out the week after , i was totally unhappy with this as we at this point have been carrying our 0 month old baby around .
negative	so i stated i needed the pram asap and stated i was told i would have it this week and explained i had 0 days to cancel the transaction and said if the service is this bad please_accept my request to cancel , they then agreed to refund me i did actually receive the refund within 0 days but was shocked when they said : refunds can take up to 00 days but we aim to have these done with 0 - 00 working_days .
negative	they then said : we do hope that this experience hasn_'_t put you off purchasing from us again .
negative	so i said it hasn_'_t as i like the pram and may buy one from a retail store .
negative	but you ’ re never going to believe what they said next , remember the item came to me faulty .
negative	“ when we collect items for refunds we do need to minus £_00 from the refund for carriage cost , with this being a reworked item we generally would have charged £_00 for carriage as this comes with no guarantee for the repair .”
negative	yes they wanted to charge me £_00 carriage for their faulty item , i reminded them about the long_distance_selling_regulations , the law , trading_standards and their reputation .
negative	they then said they would refund me in full .
negative	so in short their pushchairs do look really good and are good quality but if you have a problem that ’_s when the issues start , i just want people to beware and know your rights .
negative	i want the manager of the company to read this and ensure that their staff are retrained and updated on selling_regulations , as you have good pushchairs but really really really bad aftercare and this can massively affect your business .
negative	i hope this review has helped some people .
negative	if they would have offered better service i would have gave these 0 / 0 .
negative	i have been ordering red_wine cases about 0 times now and every time the quality of the wines get worse and worse .
negative	granted , they are all extremely young wines and pretty_much taste like vinegar next_day , but they are generally dull and tasteless - i wouldn_'_t even recommend them to the casual wine drinker .
negative	the delivery was always next_day , but on my last order the courier did not follow_instructions to leave it with my neighbour next door - i had to inconvenience someone across the road whom i did not know .
negative	today a guy rang me and wanted to sell me a new piggybank - type system , apparently unlike any of those typical ' wine plans ' with plenty of benefits and discounts .
negative	it sounded alright on the phone and asked to be emailed the details in writing so i could have a look and then decide .
negative	moments_later i receive two emails congratulating me on signing_up to this new fantastic service !
negative	i had to sign into my account and cancel it manually , where i was faced with the most outrageous and miserable cancellation process i '_ve seen in my entire life - involving ticking several check boxes etc .
negative	it was absolutely_ridiculous .
negative	this is a warning to anybody_wanting cheap wine over the internet : stay_away from naked_wines !
negative	try laithwaites wines instead , for instance , i '_ve only had very positive_experience with them .
negative	placed order on 00 / 00 /_0000 worth £_00 . 00 .
negative	on 00 / 00 /_0000 i wrote :
negative	" could you please advise when this order will be dispatched ."
negative	on 00 / 00 /_0000 seller replied :
negative	" our dispatch team said that they will be shipping out tomorrow ."
negative	as of 00 / 00 /_0000 i have not received either dispatch_notification or the item itself .
negative	therefore i conclude that this company is involved in fraudulent_activity and a scam .
negative	escalated dispute to claim on paypal .
negative	had very bad_experience with these_people and when , yes when ( because they will ) they lose your parcel they don_'_t make much of an effort to find it and instead just pretend that the tracking_number the they supplied does not exist ??????????
negative	?/
negative	hopeless !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	after successfully ordering a new putter and having my credit_card charged , on chasing delivery i was advised the putter is not available in the uk market !!
negative	so why_advertise its for sale in the uk ?
negative	?
negative	to then take a further week to credit back my card is adding insult , why not charge credit_cards at the point of dispatch ?
negative	nice way to accumulate some funds !
negative	!
negative	won_'_t be ordering from this company again , or recommending .
negative	them .
negative	at the last_minute my wife decided to work from home on valetines and of course i had arranged for the flowers to be delivered to her office .
negative	appreciate that last_minute changes are at my risk but tried to email the morning of the 00th having been unable to get live_chat response .
negative	understand it might have been difficult to make the delivery address change even_though it was with a days notice but would really have appreciated some response , well in fact any response would have been good .
negative	disappointed
negative	twice i went through all the processes to book a space and twice i was knocked back at the payment stage .
negative	ok there was a note on the website saying they were working on it , but it didn_'_t tell anyone what to expect .
negative	eventually i found a phone number ( not on the site but with the help of mr google ) and got a guy_who was very helpful and went through all the booking procedures again .
negative	when it came to the payment stage , he asked me for my ' verified by visa ' password .
negative	that was a no - no so the booking was cancelled again .
negative	eventually i went through a 0rd_party site and managed to book and pay there .
negative	oh - i forgot to mention that each time i tried to make a booking the price kept creeping_up , so i ended_up paying around £_00 more for the week .
negative	the next time i '_ll arrange for a lift to and from the airport .
negative	bestilte_en dyr buket til udbringelse på_en arbejdsplads før kl 00 .
negative	buketten ankom ikke før efter kl 00 , da modtageren allerede var taget hjem , og iøvrigt afsted på ferie .
negative	jeg føler at jeg_har spildt 000_kr .
negative	på interfloras dårlige service , der gemmer sig under de ringe betingelser at ' de_ikke_kan garantere levering før eller efter et bestemt tidspunkt '.
negative	det burde dog være muligt at få_en buket leveret til_en adresse et stenkast fra den valgte forretning i løbet_af_en otte timers arbejdsdag - eller hvad ?
negative	interflora er i min mening blomsterhandlens svar_på_en doven håndværker .
negative	mvh
negative	en skuffet kunde
negative	i have never been so disapointed with flowers !
negative	they looked amazing online but when they were delivered they were rubbish i wouldnt of given them to my dog !
negative	with the amount i paid i expected something outter this world .
negative	flowers were half_dead and really flimsy !!
negative	!
negative	get the card right and you '_ll get a good review
negative	i '_ll cut a very long_story very short .
negative	xln left me without broadband for over a whole month !
negative	they couldn_'_t care less about the disastrous effect this had to my business , or my health .
negative	it nearly closed us down , seriously .
negative	i had to drive to work , then go back home ( for broadband ) several_times day , often in tears of frustration .
negative	when they finally found and fixed the fault over a month later , they suggested i wrote them a letter , this i did .
negative	the reimbursement i received is a joke , let '_s just say it wouldn_'_t even cover one tank of fuel .
negative	please guys , if you need broadband and phones for your business don_'_t search by price , like i did .
negative	it '_s not worth it , go with a reputable_company .
negative	this is the worst delivery company i have ever had any dealings with .
negative	i have never had a successful delivery from this company .
negative	i try my very best to avoid buying from other_companies that use yodel as their delivery ' partners '.
negative	just because they are the cheapest way to deliver shouldn_'_t mean the likes of amazon , asda and many others use them to deliver .
negative	i have had three total losses with them since the merger and the name change ( from hdnl to drop the bad_reputation ) and the rest of the packages i have had to collect the products from the depot .
negative	i have complained on every occasion and don_'_t even get a callback or a response when you e_- mail them .
negative	this company is a joke , avoid if possible and urge companies to not use them as a delivery partner .
negative	they send out broken good and unsealed containers ignore phone_calls and emails avoid with a barge_pole .
negative	had to contact customer_services on three_separate_occasions in order to collect my parcel , which meant me taking three_days off work and bloody finally found the right address !!
negative	apparently the delivery driver stated the reason for non - pickup was because there are two ( no .
negative	0 ) the street '_s .
negative	where in fact there is one no .
negative	0 and one no .
negative	0 bourne cottages .
negative	quite different_addresses , with totally different postcodes and they are only 000_yards apart on a straight road .
negative	if he had an_ounce of common_sense he would have tried both addresses , as he only tried one address .
negative	in closing , will not use hermes delivery again .
negative	our online order for 00 bottles of wine was due to be delivered 00th_december_0000 .
negative	we waited in all day .
negative	we are still_waiting !
negative	!
negative	tesco say their courier delivered it .
negative	but to whom and when ?.
negative	it certainly did not get to us .
negative	this is an ongoing dispute .
negative	at the moment i do not trust tesco !
negative	!
negative	i needed a second business line at home so contacted chess_telecom .
negative	the sales_guy was very helpful and signed me up no problem .
negative	customer service since then has_been utterly miserable .
negative	promised connection in 00 - 00 working_days .
negative	a month later still not connected and chess advised a minimum wait of three more weeks .
negative	i cancelled the contract and the embarrassed employee promised that the money they had already started taking by direct_debit would be refunded .
negative	since then , no refunds but plenty more bills !
negative	the latest one has just arrived , for £_000 !
negative	i have emailed and sent letters to no_avail .
negative	i am completely fed_up with chess_telecom and will be making a formal_complaint to cisas first thing in the morning to get this sorted_out .
negative	my advice is pay the extra with bt , as they may be more_expensive but they generally do what they say they '_ll do , when they say they '_ll do it .
negative	no one trying to run a small business and paying through the nose for slow broadband should have to deal with amateurs who can '_t pass simple customer status flags from contracts to accounts , and continuously charge for services not rendered due to incompetence / record overpromising .
negative	i ordered three parcels to be picked_up on the same day from this company .
negative	0 arrived damaged , the other two went missing .
negative	i had to refund the customers , and parcel_monkey only refunded the original postage cost , even_though i insured bot the missing parcels for £_000 .
negative	all because their system showed the parcels not having been picked_up .
negative	customer service is prompt , but they offer no compensation other than original postage cost even_though you pay extra for insurance .
negative	wide birth , avoid .
negative	use main companies like city_link , parcel_force , as they provide a tracking_number .
negative	the drivers for this company don_'_t have collection tickets , even if you ask for their signature .
negative	i had to hand write one and ask the driver to sign it .
negative	unbelievably shoddy work !!
negative	!
negative	avoid - dont be lured by cheap looking tariffs , will end up costing a fortune in data and over allowance fees , its that bad i just bought myself out of two contacts a year early , and still end up better off going with three .
negative	customer service varies from very very poor to occasionally acceptable .
negative	they are a vrrtual network - their bills are never up to date and are days behind , so you might think you have minutes and data left , but you might not !
negative	on their contract their is a monthly limit - i have proof that it does not work !
negative	how can i set a monthly limit of £_00 and end up with a £_000 bill ?
negative	in one word ;-
negative	avoid
negative	lies , dishonest , unreliable .
negative	wait_until end of contract and off this relation
negative	really happy with my order , fast and at a very good price , i was really impressed till ..................
negative	i looked to order more items from the range when i noticed that they were trying to sell them at above rrp due to the items been in sort supply , not very sporting to try cash in like that , you expect this kinda trick from 0rd_party amazon sellers ..........
negative	styr unna dette selskapet om du_vil ha varene dine før det_har gått ukesvis .
negative	sjekk at utstyr som blir levert herfra er i orden .
negative	f . eks at ram - brikker er satt i på rett vis .
negative	jeg_har sagt opp min kundekonto hos dette firmaet og kommer aldri mer til å handle så mye som et eneste papirark fra dem .
negative	skal heller omså gå til det landet som leverer varene jeg trenger enn kaste vekk tid på multicom .
negative	skal jeg beskrive dem med ett ord vil det i såfall bli søppelfirma !!!!
negative	!
negative	wasn_'_t happy at all , ordered for one , something for the iphone 0 , a skin , and got sent a skin for the ipod classic ... what i ordered was a motorbike pic ... got sent a green cow ... now couldn_'_t get more wrong if you tried ...
negative	my wife called to say thank_you for the roses in which i asked did she also receive any chocolates , she said no in which it does state to come with these . she then said that to be truthful that i should probably ask for a refund due to most of then being nearly dead and only 00 roses .
negative	have also emailed but not likely to get a response any time soon .
negative	this was without_doubt the worst experience of online purchasing i have ever made .
negative	they sold my item as ' in stock ' with a delivery of 0 - 0 days and ' fully_assembled '.
negative	it arrived 0_weeks_later as flat_pack .
negative	endless emails chasing the item and a threat to report the md to trading_standards ( i found his_name on companies house ) - as well as raising a paypal_dispute , resulted_in me actually receiving my item ...
negative	i believe a lot of other people haven_'_t .
negative	after 0_weeks of chasing i did actually ask for a refund but they ignored that and continued the delivery !
negative	they also have no phone number which is too convenient ( for them !)
negative	i really would advise you all to shop elsewhere .
negative	will never use this site again
negative	i '_ve been for more than year with tmobile and experienced many problems with tmobile costumer service team .
negative	few moths ago asked tmobile to change my tariff plan and was misinformed by costumer service representative as result overrun my free minutes allowance and was billed en extra £_00 .
negative	i had to make many phone_calls and sent official_complaint letter to sort it out .
negative	last_week i phoned tmobile and ask them to send to my new addrees micro - sim for an iphone .
negative	i especially repeated few_times that i have new address , but representative ignored it and sent micro - sim to old adress however she charged me for it £_00 .
negative	moreover tmobile representative blocked my current sim_card so i can not use my phone anymore and to contact them i had to buy pay and go sim .
negative	over the next few_days i have contacted tmobile 0 times and every time was given different information_regarding my micro - sim !
negative	one representative told me that delivery takes between 0 - 0 working_days , another told me it is next_day delivery and sim should be with me shourtly .
negative	sim still_hasn_'_t been delivered .
negative	it was funny to listen these_guys especially_considering fact that tmobile costumer service located in india and philippines .
negative	i going to tmobile store now , and will have to pay another £_00 to get micro - sim .
negative	and most interesting is that there was no need to change sim_card i just needed to cut my old one in any mobile store for free .
negative	thank_you tmobile costumer service that i have spent 0 week without phone and already have paid £_00 for nothing .
negative	gonna change my carrier for more_expensive but with professional costumer service .
negative	isto está a tornar se um transtorno , tenho 0 encomendas uma no dia 00 de julho e outra no dia 00 , até agora não recebi nenhuma e deixei de ter qualquer tipo_de resposta por_parte da_probikeshop , vejam lá se me resolvem a situação ou a devolução do dinheiro porque vamos a caminho de 0 mês de espera e eu sem encomenda nem dinheiro .
negative	cumps
negative	many negative experiences with bt , unfortunately .
negative	i hope they can sort themselves out at some point
negative	i placed an order for a canon_000d , but after 0 days and no email confirmation , i emailed them to ask them why not .
negative	they told me the order had not gone_through , and in one of the most difficult to understand emails i have ever received , insisted i must phone them .
negative	i asked them why , they didn_'_t say .
negative	i told them to phone me .
negative	they didn_'_t .
negative	eventually i placed the order with another company ( panamoz ) and long after the initial_contact with slr_hut i got an " order confirmation " email .
negative	they had put through the original order despite me telling them not to .
negative	i had to ring and cancel the order .
negative	terrible service , deliberately aimed_at getting you on the phone .
negative	how an internet company can possibly only deal via the phone is unbelievable .
negative	avoid , their low_prices are bait for foolish customers .
negative	first got battery changed 0 years_ago - watch came back scratched and stop - watch function didn_'_t work .
negative	had it fixed elsewhere .
negative	went back today as i had the " lifetime_guarantee " for the battery .
negative	they were very rude and unhappy to replace the battery under guarantee but had to as i had the paperwork .
negative	cam back even more scratched and they haven_'_t closed the back propoerly - and this on a watch meant to be waterprrof to 00m .
negative	keep away if you value your watch .
negative	i built three systems with parts from scan .
negative	they sent me a motherboard and ram that was faulty .
negative	when i spoke to their returns_department , they were incredibly_rude and obnoxious .
negative	they don_'_t want to know if items are faulty and assume it is your fault .
negative	i sent the items back and they were indeed found to be faulty .
negative	they are now refusing to pay postage_costs for returning the items even_though they were dead on arrival .
negative	avoid as if things go_wrong theydon '_t want to know .
negative	purchased a game from their online store , in the early hours of the night 0am ( couldn_'_t sleep ) got the order confirmation and charged accordingly , if you '_ve shopped with them online before you know the item is removed from their stocks once ordered , waited as the recommended delivery was 0 - 0 days no signs of item , waited to day 0 and still nothing , so i emailed the store in which it was coming from only to receive " the item you ordered we sold instore " which means they only sold it the morning after i had already ordered and paid for the item and furthermore did not receive any contact email / call / etc to tell me this was the case and the refund only came back after said date so i am very disappoint with this service .
negative	good customer service is not shown when everything goes smooth .
negative	good customer service has to proven when things go_wrong .
negative	already waiting for more than two_weeks , it soon will be three_weeks , and still no answer what '_s going to be done about it is wrong and is bad customer service !
negative	spent more than £_000 , 00 in one month and this is what i get ?
negative	running out of stock with what i have , my diet messed_up etc ... surely a supplement supplier should understand what this means to a sports fanatic and personal_trainer no ?
negative	telling_me on the phone to call me back in the afternoon and not doing this ?
negative	shocking ?
negative	no written acknowledgement after my first two emails of complaint so no sent a third one !
negative	worst experience ever_since i have recently decided to change suppliers .
negative	in all the years whereby i am buying supplements online , nothing of this has ever happened to me before !
negative	maybe it '_s telling_me i should go back to former supplier , at_least they understood how important customer_satisfaction is .
negative	up to bulkpowders to make this up to me and to change my mind about them and to change a bad_experience into a good one as i believe the products are very good quality and their different quantity packaging is a good idea as well allowing you to try a product by buying a smaller amount or to fit your budget .
negative	ronald
negative	im still_waiting for it ???

negative	courier ( yodel ) delivered to the wrong street then serenata_flowers did not accept this and have failed to contact me with a resolution as yet .
negative	the courier '_s driver turned_up at my mum '_s door the next_day to say he ' d delivered to the next street but had not been successful in retrieving them ... he ' d be back in an_hour he said bit failed to show ...
negative	very disappointed - i '_ve managed to miss sending a surprise to my mum on her_birthday .
negative	still no reply from serenata_flowers or any offer of a solution ...
negative	i will not be using you again
negative	alot of products services didnt track and couldnt put a claim in for them .
negative	i placed our second order , the confirmation came through whilst i was on a couple of days off so was unable to confirm the order in the allocated timescale , i called upon my return and they said it was ok . when the order came through two items were incorrect and the wrong_colour .
negative	i called to inform them and was asked " could i make use of them ?"
negative	i replied yes probably if i employ a member of staff to fit that size of blouse .
negative	i was then told " that if i wanted to place my order again then they would see if i could get a discount on the order " she would ask her boss and get back to me , i have not received any reply from them and i find it incredible that i am expected to pay for a mistake made by them .
negative	further more as they havent followed it up i shalnt use them again in the future .
negative	you just lost a customer !
negative	despite these gloomy economic times may be they can_afford to lose customers ?
negative	application process took well over an_hour and was still being_processed when i decided to cancel .
negative	i then contacted there live support who even after being connected to an advisor took 00_minutes to give me a pre_- prepared message .
negative	about how great quickquid is and how you can get cash in 00_minutes .
negative	i then said i wanted to cancel my account and was asked to confirm my full name and dob , i did that and then was asked for my postcode and one other piece of info .
negative	thats all fine i expect that these days but then he said thanks for providing that how can i help ?
negative	i then_proceeded to copy and paste the lines above .
negative	my application was cancelled but my account could be removed he said but i could make it inactive i wished .
negative	if you must use sites like these my advice would be to use another one .
negative	they have a . co . uk website but everything is still shipped from america .
negative	they took over a week to even dispatch my t - shirt .
negative	i ordered it on the 0th of december hoping to get it for christmas , but it hasnt arrived and doesnt even have a working tracking code .
negative	customer_services they told me i should expect it by the 00th_december .
negative	although they might say they ship from america on the about us page , a lot of people wont see this and when your shopping on the site it looks to be a normal uk site .
negative	buying any product that takes 00 days for delivery without prior_warning is unacceptable but at christmas its is just outright bad customer service .
negative	i still_haven_'_t received anything .
negative	i asked for the delivery date and then nothing happened .
negative	0 times i booked with you and twice i had problems .
negative	this was last time .
negative	booked taxi with clear requirements about child_seat , and a few luggages .
negative	i confirmed back with the company and they recommended a bigger car at an extra_cost .
negative	i accepted .
negative	they came without car_seat .
negative	i sent them back and i had to call another cab .
negative	as i said , last time !
negative	got a £ 0 , 000 computer from them for gaming and it is shit can only just play bf0 / mw0 on low setting
negative	next time i will build my own never again will i go to them for anything
negative	bought a dress_shirt , 00 . 00 down to 00 . 00 , washed it before i had even wore it and my wife put it in tumble_dryer .
negative	when it come out it had shrunk !
negative	when i checked the washing instructions it did say do not tumble dry but none of my other cotton shirts shrink when put in tumble_dryer .
negative	waste of money !
negative	your website and ordering_process confirmed the item was in stock when in effect the item was not in stock .
negative	i have made no purchase with your company as the item was unavailable .
negative	my credit_card was confirmed by your staff_member who contacted me as being fully refunded , however i may have a shadow on the purchase for two_days .
negative	plesae confirm by return that i have been fully refunded and that no purcase of goods of any desription was made .
negative	had issue with item purchased send 0 emails over a 0 week period and they did not even respond once .
negative	only when i opened a paypal_dispute did the reply .
negative	see my review for cashmyphone for full details .
negative	i used the reviews here to make a decision as a result of which i lost money !
negative	!
negative	whats the point in having reviews if they are fake and made up .
negative	trustpilot need to do more to stop fake_reviews !
negative	!
negative	i shall no_longer be relying on any reviews on here to make my decisions .
negative	my wife was given an unwanted upgrade by orange .
negative	the unit was brand_new and as we did not have a use for it we decided to send it sell it through many of the recycling_sites out there .
negative	i narrowed_down 0 recyclers who paid an amount i was happy with .
negative	i then goggled for reviews on these recyclers and cashmyphone came up as having the most reviews .
negative	so i sent the phone to them and a few_days_later received an email_saying there was a fault with my phone and that it was not brand_new , they reduced the agreed price by just over 00 %!
negative	!
negative	i called them and was informed that ’_s the way it is , i could not be_bothered to argue and reluctantly_accepted the reduced price and stated as they were paying me used price i wanted the box and all the accessories back 0_weeks on i still have not received these .
negative	be careful folks
negative	on the 0nd_august i went into the vodafone ireland retail store in cork and asked if i could purchase a sim_card for use in my mifi dongle , as i wanted to use data while i was in the republic and did not want to pay roaming_charges .
negative	i was informed the cheapest one they do is 00_euros and it comes with 0gig of data , so i purchased this and was told it would be active in 0 mins .
negative	i asked for a receipt for the purchase so i could claim the expense back from my employers .
negative	this was at 0 . 00 and i had a train to catch at 00 . 00 , so i rushed to the train_station .
negative	once i reached the train_station i decided to check my emails but something was wrong as i could not check my emails , instead i got a message_saying there was no credit on the sim .
negative	so i called the store , and got no answer just the answering_machine , i must have called 00 - 00 times at different times and not once did they pick_up .
negative	i left messages explaining the situation and left my number and to date no one has called me back .
negative	i got back into cork late that evening and my flight back to uk was early next_morning so i was unable to visit the store .
negative	called their customer_services line and have been asked to call back next week .
negative	all in all a terrible experience , customer service does not exist .
negative	stay_away they have done nothing but con me out of 00_euros .
negative	go into store and you are faced with lazy children .
negative	so i decided to place order on line .
negative	website crashes 0 times at checkout when paying by credit_card so i pay by paypal .
negative	then i get the payment refunded so i call customer_services , took over 0 hour to get through then when i do i find myself speaking to someone_else who did not have a clue .
negative	they then tell me that they cancelled the order as i spent to much and the parcel might go missing !
negative	they advise me to place order again by splitting into smaller orders but refuse to tell me what size order is ok .
negative	i offer to pay by credit_card for order and they can put through order as they want and i am told they cannot do that because of data_protection !.
negative	they do not have clue and i have just spent my £_000 order with jjb .
negative	customer service and knowledge is pathetic .
negative	stay_away they have loads of competitors you can use
negative	order a canvas and revived it only to find that it had not be wrapped around the frame correctly .
negative	after informing them it took them 0_weeks to say send it back to them .
negative	they advised me to send it back by a freepost service .
negative	so out of no fault of mine i have to spend the time buy the packaging , spend time taking into a local post_office to send back !!
negative	when asked why they cannot arrange_collection they replied they only have facilities to accept royal_mail .
negative	yes their prices are cheap but so is the quality of their products .
negative	my advise pay the extra and use another company .
negative	i live very far from my mum , so i ordered flowers to be delivered on sunday .
negative	they were delivered on saturday for some reason and my mum was out and missed them .
negative	they were then taken to the local_depot and she was told she could not pick them up for 00_hours .
negative	of course by the time she was allowed to collect them they were in a poor state .
negative	the free chocolates that came with them were ridiculously tiny .
negative	neither flowers nor delivery worth the money i paid .
negative	i signed_up for giffgaff after experiencing double - billing hell with virgin , expecting something better .
negative	what i got was far worse !
negative	i was one of the unlucky ones who got caught in a website outtage so my recurring goodybag did not recur .
negative	there was no notification of this and i did not get some rather important emails i was waiting for .
negative	fair_enough , they do not claim to supply a business - strength service but an_apology rather_than a load of criticism of me ( the customer ffs !)
negative	and self - righteous gobbledegook would have been fine .
negative	not only did my goodybag not recur , but i was unable to top - up in any way on my account - so effectively they managed to brick my phone !
negative	through all of these hassles there is no one to call up and talk to - you are forced to use their stupid forums where idiots who do not know what they are talking_about and have nothing better to do spam you with useless and inane comments so they can get a few_pence off their next bill !!!
negative	or contact their agents who take 00_hours to respond and then give you an equally useless stock response which indicates they have not even read your question .
negative	when they finally do read it you will get a bunch of patronising garbage about how great they are and not much else .
negative	when my phone finally came back on line after three_days i was told that my blackberry services ( yes , i know , sad isn_'_t it ) would take another few_days to resume , even_though i had paid for them , but they weren_'_t sure exactly how long ...
negative	i got on the phone to o0 - talked to a human - they had me sorted with a new account in 00_hours which has_been sweet ever_since and costs about the same !
negative	if it were possible to give negative stars i would give them a hundred - do not use them they are total c_** p !
negative	i keep getting blocked for adding people on a site that is supposedly all about social_networking and making new friends .
negative	add to that the fact i get no response from the system administrators despite_numerous_emails & messages via facebook , it makes me want to leave the site altogether and use twitter instead as they seem to have more of an understanding of how to deal with their users on a one - to - one basis rather_than being a faceless entity .......
negative	i wouldn_'_t bother using this company if you wish to receive your goods .
negative	item won_'_t show up and you will be out of pocket for at_least three_weeks .
negative	to save penny '_s on a item it is really not worth using this joke of a company .
negative	my third time i '_ve_used this company and second time i have not recieved my item , company policy is to blame royal_mail and make the customer wait three_weeks before any chance of getting anything at all .
negative	totally p ***** off with this company , ordered led_lenser seo0 focusing head_torch on the 0nd of november , allegedly dispatched on the 0th by royal_mail first_class .
negative	would it not have made good sense to used a tracked delivery service for an item of its value ?
negative	rang customer service this time rather_than doing it by email , was put on hold at first , not for long though , a customer service rep with a limited iq then answered , i had to then explain ... and i ' d say , answer all the questions i then put to him myself .
negative	conclusion being , my item probably wont arrive and i should probably phone back on the 00th of november and i '_ll probably get a refund or replacement , maybe .
negative	item was required i ' d say quite urgently , so i '_m now going to be out of pocket until at_least the end of the month .
negative	i am now going to have repurchase elsewhere , somewhere where paypal can be used , i then have paypal customer protection this company fails to offer , with an option of tracked delivery maybe too !
negative	i ' d advice anyone to shop elsewhere even if it '_s a couple of pounds_cheaper here it '_s just not worth it , this is the last time i shop_here .
negative	i had to use the despatch ref to post this review as the order reference wouldn_'_t let_me post , order id is 0000000
negative	wiggle used to be good , not any more .
negative	ordered my compression sleeves on the 00th of may , after a week my order hadn_'_t been processed so i emailed wiggle to ask them why ... two_days_later no responce to my email prompted me to dispute the order with paypal .
negative	this seemed to urge wiggle to ' process ' my order , i got a tracker number for royal_mail too !
negative	the tracker number doesn_'_t work though and according to some none royal_mail link on the wiggle dispatch email , my item should have arrived today .
negative	noooooo it hasn_'_t come .
negative	this is the last time i '_m using wiggle they are a joke , there customer service as gone awol .
negative	thanks to paypal i '_m protected and thanks to crc i can order the same item at a better price and they have been and still are brilliant .
negative	order no 0000000000 for miss .
negative	joanne fairhurst
negative	ordered on 00 may 0000 at 00 : 00 : 00
negative	usually delivered within 0 working_days
negative	currency gbp united_kingdom pounds
negative	update 00th_june ...
negative	as requested by wiggle i supplied the order details as above , 0 days_later no responce , also still no item and no responce via the paypal_dispute i raised yesterday .
negative	trust_pilot requested the invoice for the item so i could be verified as a genuine customer , this was emailed to them today .
negative	was going to delete this review and write it again on the trust_pilot link on wiggles website but wiggle have hidden the link and i couldn_'_t proceed .
negative	otherwise , i today repurchased the item from an_alternative company and expect to recieve soon !
negative	it will be my next review on trust_pilot , heres_hoping its a better service than the shameful one wiggle offer .
negative	no fewer than five emails promised a delivery date which was not met .
negative	three emails claimed that goods had been sent when they had not been .
negative	their web - site claims ' lambdatek started in 0000 ' although the company was established in 0000 - this is easy to check at companies house , and i did so .
negative	this company provided the absolute worst customer experience which i have seen .
negative	company employees refuse to provide names of directors and no email_addresses are available .
negative	stay_away !
negative	orange customer service is so bad i am tempted to swear .
negative	i called to query why they had not removed the insurance " orange care " ( strange name because in my experience they do anything but ).
negative	i went though the menu system to the billing enquiry section .
negative	inputted my pass word as requested .
negative	i was then given an_automated_message_saying due to the launch of the " i phone " they where very busy and .." call back tomorrow ".
negative	i was then cut_off ...
negative	i called again and went through the system - this time to add services .
negative	this time i got an answer .. wow - they are so interested in new customers and more money they are to busy to retain existing_customers .
negative	the good news is that when i did get to talk to someone they refunded all the extra_insurance i had paid and added 0 %.
negative	had the review been based_solely on the experience of talking the people on the insurance help line the number of stars given would have been more .
negative	however orange service in general is very poor .
negative	they also increased the cost of my contract mid term .
negative	always found cheaper prices onlinr and elsewhere
negative	my frames broke when the opticians were fitting the frames .
negative	smartbuyglasses denied any responsibility and have left me with the broken frames and no refund .
negative	also , due to severe eye strain i was getting glasses made up in a hurry .
negative	these were marked as in stock when i bought them .
negative	but they weren_'_t .
negative	when the frames finally arrived , they were the gloss frames when i had ordered the matt_finish .
negative	later delivery than website promises , wrong product and no refund on a faulty product .
negative	pretty easy to guess that my next glasses purchase won_'_t be from them !
negative	order a pair of bridgestone premium tyres from tyre_shopper .
negative	six days_later , on the appointed date when i went to one of their affiliated garage to have the them fitted , having waited for more than an_hour for one of the mechanics to become_available , only to be told that the tyres haven_'_t been delivered and i should return another day .
negative	made a phone_call to tyre_shopper only to be informed the problem is down to bridgestone .
negative	no apology nothing !
negative	suffice to say , disgusted with the overall service i opted to have the order cancelled and get a refund .
negative	it was a blessing in disguise though , as i managed to get a better deal from another company for the very same day .
negative	as for tyre_shopper , this will be the last time i will be dealing_with them .
negative	first time user of cash_generator online and i won_'_t be using it again .
negative	ordered my locking_wheel_nuts on 0 / 0 /_0000 .
negative	received an e_- mail on 0 / 0 /_0000 to state they had been dispatched and would be delivered in 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	i have phoned the hounslow store twice_now and each time spoke to a female called rebecca , she stated on both_occasions that she would check with the couriers and phone back .
negative	this she hasn_'_t bothered to do , her customer_care is crap !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i am going to e_- mail the branch and cancel my order and ask for my money back , it would be a waste of time and the cost of the call to phone hounslow branch .
negative	as i have returned my costume and sent numerous_emails with no reply from escapade i would not use this seller again
negative	i ordered a hard_drive from edock . tv ... 0_weeks and 0 emails later , still no delivery and no responses .
negative	the same as everyone_else !
negative	i '_ll try to get my money back through my bank as others are trying to do .
negative	do not oder anything from these_people !
negative	!
negative	flowers were knocked about , had been turned upside_down and the box had gotten wet , my personal message card , was nt stuck to the flowers , it was stuck underneath the box !!!!!!
negative	, very disappointed , cast a shadow over my girlfriends_birthday , won_'_t be using teleflorest again .
negative	i ordered a bed 0 - 0 delivery no actual date specified waited in and it didn_'_t arrive , emailed , no response .
negative	telephoned day 0 , 0 and they couldn_'_t locate .
negative	delivery company phoned to say it was damaged .
negative	i ordered another same schedule .
negative	day 0 phone_call to say could they deliver , but we away from home , day 0 - 0 parts arrived without warning , one missing , phoned and they said one piece lost , phoned next_day , still lost and so i have cancelled the order after 00 days .
negative	now waiting for the parts delivered to be uplifted .
negative	staff don_'_t seem surprised and willing to accept situation , with one exception will , but nobody will pass my calls onto him
negative	bitterly disapointed .
negative	the goods were ordered on the 00th of december .
negative	i received this survey yesterday the 0th of january which prompted me to call uk_tool_centre to ask where my goods were .
negative	i was informed they had overlooked sending them and they would be sent out within the next few_days .
negative	i would suggest that the time spent sending out customer opinion survey would be better directed at the core business ......
negative	i told aol when i ordered a washing_machine that access to my home was via narrow lanes and a big lorry wouldn_'_t be able to make it .
negative	they said that would be no problem .
negative	the lorry they sent was so big it couldn_'_t get within three miles of me !
negative	i offered to come to collect it from the lorry but the driver said he was ' not prepared to do that '.
negative	any suggestions i made to resolve the problem .
negative	which was of their making , were answered with ' we can '_t do that ' ' that '_s not possible ' etc .
negative	now they have simply cancelled my order as a ' delivery failure ' and i am waiting to get my money back .
negative	thanks for the reply , camille .
negative	order no aol0000000 .
negative	aol promised early this morning that your logistics branch would get back to me to see if the problem could be sorted .
negative	they did not contact me .
negative	i have cancelled the order but i am told it will take from 0 to 00 days for my credit_card to be refunded ' minus cancellation_charges where_applicable .'
negative	really ?
negative	0 to 00 days to refund me ?
negative	and there had better not be any cancellation_charges .
negative	aol '_s service continues to be execrable .
negative	shelby :
negative	it is not a question of my having ' resorted ' to cancelling my order .
negative	you have told me you are not able to deliver the appliance to me .
negative	every suggestion i have made ; get a smaller lorry ; subcontract it to a local carrier and even my offer to drive to where your delivery vehicle was and collect the appliance myself was met with a blank ' no '.
negative	you did offer to deliver to a different address .
negative	i had paid for removal and recycling of the old machine and connection of the new one .
negative	i do not know how you thought you would collect the old machine from somewhere_else or what good you thought it would be to connect the new one at somebody_else '_s address .
negative	as to refunding me , my bank '_s computer works in real time .
negative	it took you one day to debit the money to my card account .
negative	why does it take seven to ten days to process a refund ?
negative	are appliancesonline '_s cashflow problems really that bad ?
negative	heads up all you prospective_customers .
negative	most people posting reviews give this company two stars at most .
negative	i would give them zero .
negative	four people give them five_stars .
negative	i must assume that lee , tim , peter and justin are either pseudonyms or work for abbey_garden - or both !
negative	and now , suddenly , within the past 00_hours , fifteen people have given this company five_stars .
negative	faint odour of rat , anyone ?
negative	they overcharged me , admitted their error and three_weeks_later , after a letter and three telephone_calls they have still not refunded me .
negative	next step - small_claims court .
negative	i paid for next_day delivery on a product which apparently couldn_'_t be delivered when required .
negative	no clear_indication on the website , or even a warning when i chose the option it just let_me pay for something i would never receive .
negative	spoke to their customer_services who were short , rude and completely_unhelpful , with no offer of a refund on delivery .
negative	i have raised this issue with trading_standards as a false representation of a service . after spending_thousands with this company they seemed happy to lose a customer over ten_pounds in delivery costs .
negative	i would advise to completely avoid until they amend their website to only sell you products and services they can actually deliver on and change their poor customer relationship attitude .
negative	i have use this company before with great results , however this time things have been a joke .
negative	the product displayed a delivery time of 0 - 00 working_days , yet 00_hrs after they took the money i am told there is no stock and the product is back ordered , this could take 0 days - 0_weeks .
negative	0_weeks plus later still nothing , yet another email as you can speak with them ( no phone number ) am now told due to limited production they cant provide a estimated delivery date .
negative	they give you a tracking_number which is useless for tracking as they don_'_t update the website correctly , mine showed - processing , backordered then processing ( yet still backordered ) so wheres the order at ?
negative	if you check the website the product is still available with a delivery time of 0 - 00 working_days , this appear to be nothing other than intentionally misleading the customer , i have twice mentioned this to customer_services yet the web_site remains unchanged , so now they are aware it surely becomes fraudulent .
negative	but smartbuyglasses don_'_t care so long as they have your money .
negative	they will post a response to this saying how sorry they are etc_etc that the manufacture is the hold up yet the website wont change as they wont be able to trap more people etc_etc and they will offer a choice of alternative item etc_etc .
negative	well if i wanted a alternative item i would have ordered it to start with !!!
negative	am still_waiting because i want this item but am close to saying enough is enough , which is a shame as i need 0 other frames before_xmas which wont be bought from here , i would rather pay more and get the item .
negative	will provide a update if / when i ever get the item
negative	tried to cancel my account but they said they couldn_'_t find my details .
negative	so i cancelled the direct_debit and then suddenly they could_find my details and it still took 0 months and dozens of phone_calls to get account cancelled .
negative	very very nefarious business .
negative	i ordered a next_day shipment from myhermes on friday 00th_november and paid extra for a saturday collection .
negative	due to a system admin_error the parcel wasn_'_t collected on the saturday and since then the support has_been diabolical .
negative	i have spoken to a few different support personnel and no - one seems to know how to resolve the situation .
negative	i have been promised calls from someone looking into the case but have heard_nothing .
negative	their online support system is confusing and sends me emails with no content .
negative	the whole_transaction is a farce and i want my money back as i have now had to post the parcel to my client via_royal_mail special delivery at significant extra_expense to myself .
negative	their system wont even allow me to cancel the shipment .
negative	i am a very disappointed customer .
negative	i was impressed by their positive_reviews here on trust_pilot so i thought i ' d give them a go but my experience was not a good one .
negative	sales experience wasn_'_t too bad , however post purchase it all went very south !
negative	the items i ordered arrived smashed and so the palette was refused .
negative	i then sat on hold waiting for a customer service rep for an_hour and a half listening to the most dreadful music ever , clearly designed to make you hang up and give up .
negative	the first customer service rep said she couldn_'_t help and would need to speak to her manager .
negative	the second customer service rep said the same , the third said the purchasing department was closed .
negative	all of them said they ' d get someone to call me back .... no one ever did .
negative	i spent a total of 0 hours over the course of a week sat on hold listening to their god_awful music and then eventually the fourth customer rep accidentally cut me off .
negative	needless to say i cancelled the order .
negative	very very disappointing .
negative	don_'_t rely_on these_guys if you are on a tight_schedule .
negative	after having our 0 parcels of christmas_presents for our_grandchildren all of identical size and total weight of 00kg weighed and priced at the post_office we were finally encouraged to go online to get a better deal .
negative	parcel_hero offered competative_prices with a good delivery time promise .
negative	we booked and the parcels were delivered in around the estimated time .
negative	however , we then received an email_saying that we now owed a further £_000 . 00 .
negative	it seems that while in the air , our boxes had not only grown in size , all boxes were now very different larger_sizes , but had increased in weight , now the total weight was a huge 00kg .. my parcels had gained 00kg whilst in transit .
negative	the amount now requested was an increase of 000_% i am now in dispute with parcel_hero who have stated that things are weighed differently en_route !
negative	from 00kg to 00kg .
negative	was somebody standing on the scales !!
negative	i feel i have been conned and would never reccomend parcel_hero to anyone .
negative	i purchased from prc via amazon because of the good reviews .
negative	where should i start ?
negative	i placed the order and received a confirmation , also paying for expedited delivery .
negative	no product now for a week , and no communication .
negative	today i received an email to review the service ( what service ?)
negative	and i still have no product .
negative	however , logging in to amazon to try to find out what is going on , i find the order has dissipated ( lucky i printed it or there would be no evidence :-)).
negative	well_done prc !
negative	i '_m very angry at this time , actually it has never happened before with the other orders , don_'_t know if i have to blame interlink_express but for three_times i recieve a email with " we tried to deliver your order from affordable_supplements limited however there was no one available to sign for the order at the address below "!
negative	it is impossible beacuse it is the address of my office where there is a receptionist long all day !
negative	moreover i have never had problem with all parcel form amazon .
negative	at last i '_m still_waiting for a parcel after 0 days !
negative	i bought a pair of kef q000 speakers for £_000 .
negative	but due to some reasons i had to return the speakers within 00 days .
negative	i had to pay for my own parcel ( delivery to hifi_gear ) on top of that they took 00 days to " assess " the speakers state then they charged me a further 00_% of the total_cost that was about £_00 as a " restocking_fee ".
negative	they provided the refund of £_000 which never showed up in my bank_account for next 00 days .
negative	their tones were completely_different while i was buying from them from the dry tones while i sent the speakers back .
negative	to be honest i would not recommend hifi_gear to any body ...
negative	offer a tyre online and will not not supply because i want to change my car from rf tyres
negative	i arranged for city_link to collect a wheel / tyre in london on the 0th_december_0000 .
negative	their driver never made any attempt to collect & after being chased by the seller we arranged a further collection date for the 00th_december_0000 .
negative	true to form city_link didn_'_t turn_up on the 00th but did on the 00st_december_0000 .
negative	then the parcel just disappeared & i thought that i would be making a claim .
negative	hopefully the parcel will be delivered tomorrow , just one month after i arranged_collection .
negative	i have used city_link regularly over the years , but never again after this experience .
negative	the recent change of ownership seems to have marked a deterioration in their service .
negative	i placed an online order with toolstation yesterday for delivery today .
negative	since i last ordered online , toolstation have switched from royal_mail to comedians yodel .
negative	the order which i required for tomorrow never showed up with yodel today .
negative	i have checked the yodel online tracking which is a joke .
negative	i have emailed toolstation & cancelled my order as i am not prepared to wait_until yodel get around to delivering to me .
negative	i will never again place an online order with toolstation & you out there now also have been_warned .
negative	i asked for the bindings to be placed on my skis , gave measurements .
negative	instead they were sent in the makers boxes with no effort made whatsoever to place them on the skis .
negative	i will now have to find another store in brighton to do this for me , which will probably cost me more money .
negative	it is very unlikely i will by from ellis_brigham again
negative	paul young
negative	my first dealings with this company and the item was badly broken ...
negative	i have just been informed that insurance is for loss only and does not cover damage , so on top of the postage_costs i now have to refund £_00 . 00 for the item i sent .... will i use this company again .........
negative	sorry but no !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	my flowers from my girlfriend were delivered after she had finished work but rather_than call the delivery agent had just_dumped them outside on a busy main street .
negative	and suprise , suprise they got ruined .
negative	any way no contact number to get immediate answers and resolution instead i have had to write emails , post on their facebook and message them on facebook , then wait hours for a response which was we will " investigate " nothing to investigate , they messed_up i '_m requesting a full_refund .
negative	we '_ll see how that goes .
negative	flowers not fit for display let_alone a valentines_gift .
negative	no contact_numbers , nobody responds to customer_support emails ( as yet nothing from wednesday ).
negative	got email from shipping agent on wednesday saying they were out for delivery then !!!
negative	specifically_asked for friday ( valentines_day !)
negative	had to reply to text from shipping agent dpd to say i wanted friday delivery .
negative	they were delivered on time in the end but had either been in delivery depot since wednesday or were picked out of a bin !
negative	no contact so_far after complaint
negative	i paid for next_day delivery and received an email the next_day saying my order was delayed , i wasn_'_t offered a refund on my delivery charge .
negative	will stick with myprotein in future if not resolved !
negative	!
negative	called on the monday chap at other end did not seem to be able to operate the computer properly .
negative	paid for order as told part would be with me on wed . thursday called them to see where item was left message on answer phone as no one answered phone .
negative	did not get a call with explanation as to why item as late finally received item on monday a week_later .
negative	the tiles i ordered and received were a very different shade to the photo on the website .
negative	anyone not colour - blind would have agreed .
negative	i called to complain_about this and was told they could be returned but at a significant expense to myself .
negative	i protested persistently and made reference to my statutory_rights but got nowhere .
negative	i put my complaint in writing , ( noting specifically that incorrect and misleading pre_- purchase information had been used at the point of sale ), made several phone_calls and sent numerous_emails but received no reply or an offer to exchange the tiles .
negative	having to now cease the scheduled installation , i had no option other than to ask my credit_card company to investigate this for me under section 00 of the consumer_credit act .
negative	walls and floors then conceded that my complaint was not investigated properly and at_least had the grace to apologise and agreed that i had a point .
negative	advice to any customers : get samples !
negative	the tone variations can be huge and the photos on the website are not always updated .
negative	advice to walls and floors customer_services : accept the fact that some complaints may be genuine and at first point of call , when an irate customer asks to speak to a manager , don_’_t make inflammatory comments .
negative	ordered a car from a grouping deal and when i went to check out an extra car was added to my order .
negative	i didn_'_t mind cause i though it would be easy to retire the product when i received it .
negative	i was wrong .
negative	i sent it off in the post with the address and a section saying my reason of return on the box .
negative	i waited over a month until i finally decided to contact them a bout the situation and after a few weeks of communication with sto they ended_up saying they haven_'_t received the product and that i cannot get my refund .
negative	i have lost £_00 and the car !
negative	got my design and was happy till i needed a bigger file , was told to log in the their system to get it but no password or user was given and when i contacted via_email and phone to get help , calls were not answered and emails were not returned ...
negative	i have now had to pay for my design work to be done a second time just to get the bigger file for website and stationary ....
negative	wrong cable sent and speaker reflects light , completly the opposite of what i was told , just to get a sale .. still_wating for the correct cable to use the speaker ..
negative	i won_'_t be doing_business again with this company if sales are all they are interested in .
negative	i will never order again from anyone who use this company to deliver !
negative	i placed an online order on the wednesday and paid extra for 0 - 0 day delivery , the package was showing as ' despatched from yodel service centre ' on the thursday , by the friday_afternoon it hadn_'_t updated , on contacting yodel ( automated line ) it said there was a problem with my package and informed me to contact the company i bought it off .
negative	i contacted them and they said there was no problem at all !
negative	on the following_monday the website had updated to ' parcel received at service centre ' and then two hours_later ' parcel out for delivery ', one hour after that i received an email_saying ' on its way and will be delivered within the next 0 working_days '!!!
negative	looking on the website the delivery times state between_0am - 0pm , so that could mean i wait in all day monday and then possible all day tuesday as well !
negative	as it turns_out the package did turn_up , but at 0pm after waiting in all day .
negative	i can '_t understand how yodel in this day and age can '_t keep track of a parcel and where it is up to .
negative	another well_known courier give you a one hour time_slot on the morning of the delivery even on the cheapest delivery charge .
negative	they even give you a link that is constantly_updating to show you where the driver is and how many drops away from you he is , this means you can be getting on with other things rather_than being camped out by the door waiting for your delivery .
negative	it '_s 0000 yodel , invest and make use of the tech that '_s about !!
negative	!
negative	*** updated 00 / 00 /_0000 ***
negative	customer_support is a joke , it has to be the worst i '_ve ever_encountered !
negative	this is the second time i '_ve_used them and the second time that the order didn_'_t turn_up on time .
negative	the first time slow communication was blamed on the owner being out of the country , i gave them the benefit of the doubt on that occasion .
negative	latest order : the items i wanted were all showing as in stock , i placed the order and waited and waited and waited !!!!
negative	i was given three dates for delivery and on each date it didn_'_t show up with no warning beforehand that it wasn_'_t coming !
negative	trying to get hold of anyone at this company is a nightmare , they don_'_t answer the phone , they don_'_t return voicemails , their online_chat is always offline , they take an age to answer emails if at all !
negative	in the end i had to contact my bank for them to get my money back ... which they did !
negative	from time of ordering to time of getting money back = 0 month .
negative	do yourself a favour and order somewhere_else and save_yourself a lot of time and hassle !!
negative	!
negative	this company is full of excuses , stock shortages , dry ice shortage , system update went wrong , new software caused problems ...
negative	don_'_t just take my word for it , read the other bad_reviews on here and also do a search on the company and see bad_reviews on the reptile forums about them ..... they all say the same ... you can '_t get hold of them if things go_wrong !!
negative	!
negative	disgusting service :
negative	they changed the flights dates , then we we called to ask why they cut me off , even the manager put me on hold for 00_mins , when i rang back they said he was not working .
negative	they then changed my flights back but to a different airport , it was only when i googled the directors details and asked to speak to him the sorted the flights out
negative	but saying this they did have the best prices and were easy to book with
negative	very poor .
negative	struggling to get service running despite canceling bt
negative	i placed an order for laminates on 0th_november on their website .
negative	according to the shopping_basket , delivery should have been in 0 to 0 days .
negative	it is 00th_november today .
negative	they have taken my payment which i made by debit_card .
negative	but nothing at all has happened .
negative	i have not received any communication from wood0u , either by e_- mail or by phone , about date of delivery or progress of order .
negative	when i check online in my account , it says " order pending ".
negative	yesterday i sent them a message by filling in their " contact us " form .
negative	i have had no response to it whatsoever .
negative	but they sent me an auto e_- mail entitled " your opinion matters to wood0u ".
negative	so i am giving my opinion !
negative	dear wood0u , you have got my money , but you have not told me anything about delivery .
negative	my comment on your response below : if i had received any communication from you that the delivery would be delayed , i would have been satisfied .
negative	i hope the delivery now takes place as arranged .
negative	if so , then i will put this down to lack of communication , and will withdraw my judgment as expressed in my comment heading above .
negative	i got a quote from you ,
negative	told the customer ,
negative	then you changed the quote upwards hundreds of pounds ,
negative	but when i quote i keep my word so it cost me money
negative	not happy
negative	i ordered a collection for the monday , late_afternoon they cancelled on me , then re booked for tuesday , i spend an_hour on chat trying to explain i was not in tue and they should make it wed but i will be out after 0pm ( that '_s why i booked mon as i was in all day !)
negative	someone still came at_000pm to collect on tue after me saying we were out !
negative	then again someone came on wed !
negative	they said on monday they would upgrade it to a 00 hour delivery so i didn_'_t lose out !
negative	it took 0 days to get there , i called them asking why it wasn_'_t delivered they said 00 hour means 0 - 0 days ?????
negative	surly the clue is in the title ?
negative	00_hours ???
negative	on the thursday i contacted them again asking where my parcel was they said they don_'_t know but will let_me know when they are ready , i said no , i need to know now !
negative	they said we will let you know , i was not happy !!!!!
negative	they never came back and let_me know at all !
negative	stay_away from this company !
negative	unless you want nothing but hassle and problems !
negative	i contacted them again for a full_refund we were arguing back and forth for ages until they agreed to a partial_refund , it just wasn_'_t good enough !
negative	i spend 0 days trying to sort this out , over an_hour a day on the phone and on live_chat !
negative	bad service stick with [_external_reference_] go !
negative	chesstelecom were responsible for delaying our office move by fours weeks , even after we had factored in a " worst - case - senario " 0 month provision .
negative	after that we had three_months of invoice errors and have been waiting four weeks while the matter is investigated .
negative	in a nutshell ; calls are never returned , emails seldom replied to , " account_managers " who could manage their way out of a paper bag and countless broken_promises .
negative	they describe this on their website as award_winning customer service - i beg to differ .
negative	i liked the idea of hiring a long lens for a family safari , but unfortunately chose lenses for hire .
negative	the lens itself was poorly_maintained , scratched and rattled and the results were less_than pleasing .
negative	unfortunately the worst part came after the holiday when threatening emails started to arrive claiming additional_charges .
negative	nearly a year on i am still being chased by them highlighting small_print in their t + c '_s and threatening even larger bills .
negative	avoid like the plague .
negative	bought a phone form them last november and today it wouldn_'_t turn on .
negative	so returned it to my local_store where i purchased it from .
negative	they out right refused to accept it as a faulty return , they gave_me a phone number and said i had to return it myself .
negative	i explained to them that the whole reason i purchased it from a high_street store is because i wanted to be able to return it quickly if anything went wrong with it .
negative	he said that they no_longer accept returns as they cannot do anything with it and blamed it all on the network_provider !????
negative	i spoke to the manager and he said exactly the same !
negative	the phone is still under_warranty and i now have to return it to the manufacturer myself and deal with them .
negative	absolutely_disgusted with them and would recommend to anyone to steer_clear !!!!!
negative	!
negative	first of all you can only log in with a facebook account ?
negative	what is that about ?
negative	when there are many of us slowly eliminating facebook from our_lives , besides that what about the endless amounts of fake promotional profiles as i like to call them ,
negative	fake accounts that are used to promote websites ?
negative	these are then used to rate companies ?
negative	dont sound right to me .
negative	but my actual complaint about trust_pilot is that you cannot tell the truth !
negative	by telling the truth in your review it will be removed !
negative	i have a very genuine case against a very big website yet soon as i rate it 0 / 0 and give an honest_opinion based on my many_years experience with the company it is removed and i am sent an email from trust_pilot asking why i have made this review .
negative	what ?
negative	it s in the review trust_pilot !
negative	!
negative	!
negative	!
negative	!
negative	the review explains_why i made the review surely ?
negative	the worst part is every one else can make a review with out the need for trust_pilot to take it down ask to change then send an email asking why you made it .
negative	its a review site isn_'_t it ?
negative	its an honest review yet you have taken it down and wont let_me re - post or post another review about this company ?
negative	corruption !
negative	corruption !
negative	corruption !

negative	! who_knows .
negative	slander !
negative	noun
negative	the action or crime of making a false spoken statement damaging to a person '_s reputation .
negative	verb
negative	make false and damaging statements about ( someone ).
negative	my website has_been tried and tested and verified safe , we are a registered business and work hard to keep our members happy and safe .
negative	we are verified safe by all the companies that actually test website , who are facebook to make the statement ?
negative	" this website may be unsafe " <<< facebook statement !
negative	facebook are putting up public statements that our sit is not safe !
negative	this is a " false spoken statement damaging to our reputation ". i have sent report after report , suggestion after suggestion called the facebook no service customer service phone number only to go round in circles and told at the end they do not offer phone support !
negative	and sent a letter the ireland h . q .
negative	the customer service is extremely un - satisfactory !
negative	if facebook take peoples money facebook should have a customer service !
negative	facebook have no customer service !
negative	my website is verified registered and verified safe !
negative	alexa – verified | mcafee – verified safe | ssl security – certified | trust_pilot - rated trusted | paypal protection – verified | norton safeweb – verified safe | web stats domain – verified 000_% safe | facebook – ( why is it only facebook that says “ maybe un - safe !?)
negative	facebook is ranked number one in the world battling between google , if facebook makes an un - warranted decision to display an un - justified message then the herd will believe facebook is right regardless of how wrong facebook is .
negative	facebook website is damaging every thing i have taught myself and worked hard for !
negative	i pay them money to advertise my site and now they display a message on my site stating it " may be un - safe !"
negative	this has_been in place for almost 0_weeks now , this is causing massive loss in traffic , engagement and sales !
negative	we are suffering heavily !
negative	thanks facebook !
negative	your rubbish !
negative	bring on [_external_reference_]
negative	sent some good back over a week_ago now and haven_'_t received any contact back from them .
negative	emailed support , over 0 days and all i '_ve had is a automated_response .
negative	lack of phone number makes it difficult to speak to anyone .... wouldn_'_t use this company again .
negative	talk about shooting yourself in the foot .
negative	having placed an order and paid vis paypal there was subsequent confusion about payment and dispatch so i contacted healthspark on 0 occasions asking if they would check the staus of the order ..... needless to say i am still_awaiting a response !
negative	!
negative	took 0 days after order to tell me the fridge i ' d ordered is not in stock .
negative	then to be told they ' d already taken payment from my credit_card and it '_s going to take a further 0 days to the refund processed .
negative	i '_ve tried several time to switch from a cash - back website and eon website seems no to work ...
negative	we were waiting for a delivery that should have arrived two_days ago .
negative	we checked the tracking_info on the hermes , or herpes as we call them , website .
negative	it showed " delivered to porch " two day ago !
negative	we don_'_t have a " porch ".
negative	after a thorough_search of the garden , bins , patio we could not find anything .
negative	hermes /_herpes allow or want contact from their victims as they don_'_t care and their victims don_'_t matter to them .
negative	so we contacted the company from which we bought the item .
negative	one email and three phone_calls in n afternoon later we received a call from the shop .
negative	the lame_excuse they had received from hermes /_herpes was that the " regular " driver was off sick .
negative	the stand in driver had " scanned all their deliveries wrong ", whatever that means .
negative	so they had not in fact delivered the package .
negative	strange how we only received this admission from them after we complained and said we could prove no delivery had been made .
negative	we had checked our cctv for the day in question and no one had attempted a delivery !
negative	it has still yet to arrive , we have been assured it will arrive today .
negative	if we ' re lucky !
negative	in august we used hermes /_herpes to send an item we had sold on amazon .
negative	a the customer contacted us later to say they had not received it .
negative	we checked and found that the hermes /_herpes driver had delivered it by throwing it over a garden_fence !
negative	my wife '_s seller status with amazon was downgraded as a result of hermes /_herpes shabby action .
negative	even_though we had done everything we could to sort it out .
negative	only after a direct email to jeff bezos , the owner of amazon , was my wifes status returned to it '_s former five_star_rating .
negative	we will never use hermes /_herpes again .
negative	we now ask every online seller we buy from who they use for deliveries .
negative	if they say hermes /_herpes we tell them they have lost a sale as a result and we shop somewhere_else .
negative	this uncaring , shabby , third rate , pathetic_excuse for a delivery company don_'_t want to hear from their victims .
negative	their cowardly attitude means there is only one recourse . to tell the sellers who use hermes /_herpes that they will lose sales unless they can offer delivery using a professional courier , anyone other than hermes /_herpes !
negative	if enough people boycott these_cowboys then they will either go out of business or start operating like professional couriers !
negative	whilst i wasn_'_t in for first delivery attempt , the second was cancelled because the driver was running late and on the third day the driver got lost and gave up !
negative	i still don_'_t have my order !
negative	they will automatically renew your domain_registration without sending any reminders and silently increase the price each time .
negative	automatic_renewal is magically turned on without notification , even when you were using one of their many acquisitions that had no such feature .
negative	and of course they won_'_t refund any of these ill gotten gains as they operate on the assumption that their terms and conditions ( which allow them to update them whenever they feel like without notifying you , meaning they are likely unfair ) bind you to the payment .
negative	avoid .
negative	dreams firstly delivered the wrong_size mattress and the correct headboard but with the wrong fittings .
negative	second delivery of headboard still wrong .
negative	i am now waiting for this issue to be sorted by the ' area manager ' but i have heard_nothing and it is almost a fortnight after my issue was raised to them .
negative	customer service department was rude and gavee incorrect information , they also tried to tell me that i would have to pay a second time for delivery even_though the fault was there '_s .
negative	a few_days ago i needed to order 0 - tyres for my car and i decided to purchase these through the national website .
negative	the quoted price was £_00 . 00 per_tyre with a big heading saying " buy 0 tyre , get 0 free " although the total_cost came to £_000 . 00 !.
negative	my first impression was already one of distrust but it was the only place i could_find with a saturday slot for 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	on arrival i went into the reception to find no staff , no problem i thought as they might be busy .
negative	i waited 0 - mins and then decided to go and find a mechanic .
negative	i politely asked if someone could come and talk to me regarding my booking .
negative	" you '_ll have to wait , can '_t you see we ' re busy ?"
negative	said the man .
negative	i responded with an ok and thank_you and proceeded to sit in the reception .
negative	another customer was sitting down and conversed with me regarding her own experience that morning .
negative	apparently her car was about to be seen only for the mechanic to get a phone_call and spend 00 - mins in the back !
negative	we could even hear him shouting at someone on the phone .
negative	he eventually came out with no apologises .
negative	i have now been waiting 00 - mins and still no - one has acknowledged me even_though i '_ve spent £_000 to support these_guys jobs .
negative	" oh mr . mason " said another man who came to reception " is that you ?"
negative	i nodded " someone will see you in a bit "...
negative	when is ' in a bit '??...
negative	the lady said i would miss the whole day at this rate .
negative	00 - mins later the man came back in " move your car in for us would you ?".
negative	i proceeded to drive the car onto the forecourt and without even a thank_you they started working on my car .
negative	i went and sat back in the reception .
negative	another 00mins past and one of the mechanics walked in , started eating his sandwich and then approached me and reached for my car key , which was in my hand , without even a friendly gesture or even asking for my car key .
negative	i handed it over saying " is my car almost done ?"
negative	he walked out .
negative	another 00 - mins past and the mechanic sorting my car walked in and sat down at the desk and started typing .
negative	after 0 - mins he said " oh mr . mason you can go now its all done ".
negative	so off i went to my car with the key left in the ignition , my wipers left on and my lights on full beam .
negative	is this garage for real ?!
negative	are these_guys just some cowboys who have locked the national mechanics in the back and running some shoddy show out front .
negative	extremely unprofessional , unhelpful and rude .
negative	i will_certainly be avoiding this garage and all other national auto centre '_s in the future ... my friends will be receiving the same advice .
negative	kwik_fit gets a lot of flak in the car world ... at_least the service was friendly and it was cheaper !
negative	why would you keep a number of blank_pages in a book , if they weren_'_t being used ?
negative	it doesn_'_t make_sense , it also makes the book look totally unfinished .
negative	the photographs appear grainy ( although taken on a dslr_camera )!
negative	i didn_'_t use the book to give as a gift , i actually threw it away !
negative	!
negative	i use interparcel on a daily_basis , spending between £_000 - 000 a week with them .
negative	when an important parcel wasn_'_t collected by ups i felt_like interparcel were of the opinion it wasnt their issue .
negative	happy to take the money , but their ' value added service ' is non_existent .
negative	i will be arranging for a account with ups directly since the middle_man doesnt_seem to want to work for his money .
negative	asa result of the late collection ( 00hrs late ) the parcel missed its deadline with the client and many hours of hard work were all for nothing .
negative	i politely suggested a good will gesture of refund of the shipment cost (£_00 or so ) would go somewhere towards to repairing the damage they had done yet the seemed to disagree and simply pointed me to the terms and conditions .
negative	disgusting .
negative	ordered a tokina lens and after_reading the review forums decided that they must be placing very large orders with their suppliers in order to get such discounts .
negative	for this reason i was prepared to wait more than the 0 - 00 working_days they state at the time of ordering .
negative	as many others have noted , i ordered because they state that they have stock .
negative	but they don_'_t .
negative	i '_ve followed up the order by email and telephone but just got the standard replies that are posted here with the silly story that when the order arrived with them , my item was defect and had to be returned .
negative	this is clearly nonsense so i will be cancelling my order unless the reply posted here is credible , ie not the same " schwachsinn ".
negative	( look up the dictionary if you can be_bothered ).
negative	update october 00th 0000 : actually received the tokina_00 - 00mm_f0 . 0 lens today .
negative	delivered by dpd with excellent real time tracking_info .
negative	i think the order was originally placed on august 00st .
negative	the lens was original and in full working condition with box and papers so they did manage to deliver eventually .
negative	but i still don_'_t think i can recommend the company .
negative	their communication lacks credibility which makes it hard to trust them .
negative	they could go_bust tomorrow so if ordering , make_sure you use a credit_card for your protection .
negative	good evening ,
negative	the recipient of the flowers was really disappointed with the condition of them !
negative	!
negative	when i placed my order simon at gak told me it would be in stock in 0 days , a week_later he told me the same lies , then again a week_later he told me the same lies , then again a week_later someone_else told me the same lies , they are apparently very sorry but my child is not going to accept that on xmas morning , they actually took my money before even telling_me item was not in stock , now have to wait 00_hours to get my money back which will make it too late to order from elsewhere in time for xmas , total waiting time of 0_weeks is unacceptable do not use this company
negative	what a frustrating , time wasting experience , mis_- selling , sharp_practice , reneging on deals , promises unfulfilled and very unprofessional ...
negative	i haven_'_t the energy to continue quite_frankly .
negative	stay well away .
negative	you have been_warned !
negative	awful company
negative	they didn_'_t even pay out for the phones i sent .
negative	i placed my order on wednesday before 0 pm and i received an email that states it would be delivered on friday or monday .
negative	it '_s friday_evening now and there '_s no news , is this a joke ?
negative	ebay delivers from china in 0 days !
negative	plus , there '_s so many online sports_supplement s websites that provide same day delivery .
negative	ordering on wednesday and waiting till monday is silly , will never order from this site again .
negative	made a mistake once ordering from this company cancellend the order within 00 min
negative	still_waiting for refund and now they have just dispatched the same order again ....
negative	don_'_t bother .
negative	i don_'_t know how this company is set_up but when you get a problem they couldn_'_t care less about helping you .
negative	three_months down the line and still no cashback for a purchase made on 00st february_0000 .
negative	keep chasing them but all they do is resubmit the claim .
negative	now i will probably have to wait another 0 months to see if this works .
negative	you do however always get the same reply from them " please_bear with us ".
negative	my question is , " for how long ".
negative	this should be payable by now and it is not even showing on my account yet .
negative	looking at other reviews this seems to be normal for this company .
negative	i would not get involved with this company at all .
negative	it '_s more trouble than its worth .
negative	i will be closing my account once i receive this cashback .
negative	( not holding my breath )
negative	******** update *********
negative	there has still been no acknowledgement as of 00th_may 00 .
negative	sent another chaser for them to ignore .
negative	my whole_experience with this firm has_been appalling .
negative	having ordered flowers , chocolates and a card on thursday for a friday valentines delivery , i was given a number of options for delivery .
negative	i was also not told until after purchase that delivery could be anywhere up until 0pm .
negative	when ordering i was not offered a guaranteed time of delivery option , not was i offered 0 separate delivery options_depending on the time their couriers could deliver .
negative	my girlfriend finished work at 0 . 00 pm and had been delivered nothing ( not acceptable on valentines_day - if they cannot guarantee morning delivery then they need to either her more drivers or make customers very aware of this on their site before purchase !).
negative	we are yet to see these flowers 0 days after the guaranteed delivery , i have had no response from their customer service team about the non - delivery , and there is actually no phone number to call to discuss how to get my money back after a failed delivery .
negative	i am incredibly unhappy with this service and it seems i am unlikely to ever see the money or products again .
negative	i would recommend anyone that thinks about using this company goes elsewhere - i suspect they are a scam company to be honest .
negative	and unhappy girlfriend , a loss of money and no valentines_gift .
negative	unacceptable !
negative	just wanted the sop .
negative	i submitted an unlock for orange uk ( now ee ) and they said it would be done within 0 week .
negative	0 and a half months later , still no unlock , no contact from customer service and best of all they never answer the phone .
negative	they blamed orange / t - mobile merger for the delays but another phone shop officially_unlocked it in just three_days !
negative	if you want your phone unlocked , do not go here as you '_ll end up paying for nothing - they will not give you a refund either .
negative	they also have a tendency to report real feedback to trustpilot as where all their other reviews are not genuine .
negative	not good service at all
negative	i dropped my car off with the company , all very easy .
negative	they never got me to sign off with any marks .
negative	i had put £_00 pounds of fuel in my tank before dropping it off .
negative	when collecting the car , the drop_off drive joked that the car worked well for the girls the night before .
negative	i then get in and the tank is on empty .
negative	use with caution !
negative	two_weeks_later , still no item , no communication / explanation , nor any response to email .
negative	edit_: in response to what is stated from tredz below and that they understand that i have " spoken to someone ".
negative	no one had been in touch by phone or email at that point .
negative	i got a call today and surprise , surprise they had it problems and it is out of stock / discontinued .
negative	this also proved the lie below stating that the " order had now been dispatched ", because i cancelled the order over the phone .
negative	0 .
negative	don_'_t list items for sale that are not for sale .
negative	0 .
negative	if items run out of stock let customers know within one day , not 00 days .
negative	0 .
negative	don_'_t lie to customers in an attempt to look like you are being a responsible company to the outside world .
negative	0 .
negative	it is also interesting that i got a response to a public post here rather_than my personal email .
negative	rating has_been downgraded to 0_star due to the proven lies and lack of trustworthiness .
negative	my teenage_son is addicted to pizza and over the last few_months we have tried several pizzahuts in london '_s west_end .
negative	firstly they lull you into_believing there '_s plenty of seats by having the visible part of the restaurant fairly quiet .
negative	when you enter they then direct you , dependent on the specific " hut " either upstairs or downstairs , where you then wait in a queue for a table .
negative	you then sit and wait for your order to be taken .
negative	then wait for your drinks .
negative	then wait for your starters .
negative	then wait for your main course .
negative	then wait and wait for the bill .
negative	these places have nearly made me lose the will to live !
negative	i complained to their head_office and got a voucher to use for another pizzahut " experience "... that one was all about waiting too .
negative	there '_s lots more to complain_about with regards to the staff and the staff attitude ... to be fair , the food is reasonable for this type of place .
negative	but the staff and loss of many hours of your life easily detract_from that .
negative	good meat at a good price , but as they use city_link for delivery i won_'_t be buying again .
negative	yet again i have experienced appalling service from this company .
negative	supposed to deliver some food to my house using a next_day delivery service and did not even have the decency to attempt the delivery .
negative	just took the food back to the depot and it looks as though they ' re going to attempt a pointless second delivery .
negative	had i known the company i purchased from used city_link then i wouldn_'_t have bothered as i try and avoid all companies that use city_link for delivery .
negative	other problems i '_ve had in the past include - ignoring rescheduled delivery dates after a card has_been left , arranging to collect from depot then they stick it on the van so it '_s not at the depot when i turn_up , do not answer phone , lying about leaving two cards and returning goods to sender .
negative	use this company at your_peril .
negative	i never received the goods .
negative	no refund and they said it could take 0 months only if goods were returned and then they would deduct the carriage .
negative	it is 0_weeks since i received only part of my order .
negative	i still have not received the refund for the products they didn_'_t have .
negative	mitesh soma , you should be_ashamed of yourself , taking money under_false pretences from the most vulnerable people in society , yes thats right - shame on you ......
negative	slow delivery slow delivery
negative	still no contact from betterbathrooms still_waiting for items .
negative	stay_away if you wish to complete your bathroom .
negative	made the mistake of ordering from wae_+ without researching first .
negative	i needed a particular motherboard to replace a faulty one that would accept my aging components .
negative	this was difficult to source which may have been responsible for my lapse in not googling wae_+ before ordering .
negative	ordered on 00 june for delivery by 00 june that seemed quite reasonable .
negative	the 00 june came and went .
negative	wae_+ website said my order was " awaiting fullfilment ".
negative	it was obvious it wasn_'_t in stock so i cancelled .
negative	wae_+ replied they were expecting delivery within 0 - 0 working_days and would i like to wait .
negative	i confirmed my wish to cancel .
negative	after 0 days i enquired where my refund was .
negative	aftr 00 days i informed wae_+ if i did not receive it within the next 0 days i would be contacting my credit_card company .
negative	the reply was that under their terms and conditions they had 00 days from date of cancellation to refund .
negative	under the distance_selling_regulations refunds should be made as soon as possible and no later than 00 days .
negative	funny that .
negative	i bid my time and waited for the 00 days to expire which they duly did .
negative	after 00 days i informed wae_+ that if i did not receive my refund within 0 days i would initiate a chargeback through my credit_card company .
negative	after 00 days i received my refund and a very polite apologetic message giving the impression my difficulties were abnormal .
negative	the forums tell a different_story .
negative	the message included the following sentence : " we really do value our customers and your custom and look_forward to continuing our relationship in the near_future .".
negative	frankly if wae_+ were the last woman on earth i would turn homosexual .
negative	conclusions : wae_+ advertise products that are not in stock .
negative	wae_+ give delivery dates for products that are not in stock .
negative	wae_+ will delay refunding for as long as possible .
negative	i very much suspect that if i had not paid by credit_card i would still be waiting for my refund .
negative	it appears that delaying refunding as long as possible is part of their business plan .
negative	- good for their cashflow .
negative	do you really want to deal with this company ?
negative	i love talent shows .
negative	why do we have to sit and listen to all the drivel and hype and be spoon fed opinions from talentless know it all judges .
negative	i want to listen to the acts they should be heard .
negative	so i don_'_t watch any more .
negative	change the format before you kill simon cowels golden goose .
negative	who do the judges think they are .
negative	do they really think we are stupid enough to believe these judges know what they are talking_about .
negative	i and others with no musical experience can pick the talent with a lot more creditability than these judges .
negative	lets have a talent show for judges and see how far these four go .
negative	if the adverts don_'_t work they won_'_t advertise .
negative	then no more company and no more brainwashing .
negative	how dare they interfere with my brain .
negative	it is a disgrace .
negative	i take great umbridge to being subjected to these awful television adverts that are only there to imprint those numbers into your brain at the exclusion of other good companies that cant_afford the advertising .
negative	we were meant to have free competitive companies but this company have successfully killed of the opposition .
negative	now we pay for an over priced service that should be free .
negative	dreadful company to deal with .
negative	poor after sales , badly written contracts designed to mislead and hide the pitfalls .
negative	misleading_advertising .
negative	dont_know anyone who has a good experience .
negative	mine was not a good one and would never use again .
negative	avoid_avoid_avoid
negative	i hate the email tricks they play .
negative	sending out offers of free business_cards which turn out not to be free after all .
negative	scammers
negative	disappointed was looking for an_alternative to ebay but this one is worse .
negative	impossible to use the free with with any useful result .
negative	waste of time
negative	throw them in the bin not out of the car window .
negative	foxes and birds get run over and killed trying to eat them .
negative	better still don_'_t buy them .
negative	save your money for something edible .
negative	lousy service lousy food
negative	not worth the bother
negative	yes that '_s what the sign said on new years day at poole branch when i was taking my non working newly purchased laptop back and that is exactly_what my experience of their after sales service became .
negative	wo for me and wow for them .
negative	playing ping_pong with a laptop .
negative	in the end i gave up trying to get them to admit it was faulty and paid for a repair elsewhere .
negative	the last place you should ever shop in .
negative	the laptops might look the same as you buy elsewhere but inside they are built with substandard parts .
negative	beware go_elsewhere
negative	no christmas spirit from them .
negative	no free listings this month .
negative	they now take 00_% of your money .
negative	the poor that sell the poor that pay .
negative	one bad customer and your reputation is ruined .
negative	buyers get protection .
negative	sellers get none .
negative	sellers pay the fee .
negative	buyers pay none .
negative	sellers sell none .
negative	buyers buy none .
negative	ebay gets none .
negative	perhaps then they will review their fee '_s
negative	they used to be cheap and good value .
negative	went there recently intending to fill my shopping_basket with all the items they sold cheaper_than tesco '_s .
negative	not any more though .
negative	came out with only 0 items and then found cheaper equivalent at tesco .
negative	i was amazed as in the past you could fill your basket with gay abandon .
negative	i think they are now trading on that reputation and joining the band wagon of rising supermarket prices which are catching people out because we seem to just accept that prices have gone up everywhere .
negative	well they have gone up a lot at aldi and far more than the others .
negative	i call this sharp_practice and have no confidence to shop there any more .
negative	sainsbury '_s or tesco '_s for me from now on .
negative	this site started off with very well meaning intentions but as time has_gone i feel this site is of little value now .
negative	developed into a cash cow portal for martin_lewis '_s entrepreneurial ambitions .
negative	the content has very little meaningful value and it is not possible to influence this by way of dialogue .
negative	martin is far to busy for that .
negative	searching for answers to real problems results in no practical_advice of substance .
negative	fine till they lose a parcel .
negative	then the nightmare begins .
negative	i will never use again 0 days on live_chat getting nothing but appeasement and lies .
negative	they even apologised for lying .
negative	what a cheek .
negative	lost out big time .
negative	never again
negative	as an update i have now been contacted by [_name_] by phone at parcel0go and given a full_refund .
negative	she was very apologetic and i am going to use parcel0go again but definitely not hermes .
negative	[_name_] said parcel0go are carrying out a full investigation and if they find the parcel as well as the refund they will send the parcel back as well .
negative	this would be a good outcome and i will then remove this review and write a new review that reflects an excellent company that acts in an honourable and ethical way .
negative	for any future problems that are not resolved with live_chat i would recommend mailing direct to [_private_data_] in customer_services , or speaking to her by phoning [_private_data_] this may cost 00p_per_minute .
negative	used this company many_times without to much bother .
negative	i got lulled into a false_sense of security .
negative	now they have lost my parcel and i am out of pocket , lost a good customer got bad feedback spent 0 days so_far trying to sort_out .
negative	customer_services is a complete wind up .
negative	if you think hermes is bad try booking through parcel0go .
negative	now that is the biggest wind up i have ever had .
negative	one bad_experience with either of these companies will fill you with enough hatred to last a lifetime .
negative	don_'_t think " it will not happen to me " because it will .
negative	then you also will experience the nightmare and no what i mean .
negative	i wish i had paid the extra and gone elsewhere .
negative	don_'_t get caught out .
negative	you have been_warned .
negative	as an update i have now been contacted by jenny bowles by phone at parcel0go and given a full_refund .
negative	she was very apologetic and i am going to use parcel0go again but definitely not hermes .
negative	for any future problems that are not resolved with live_chat i would recommend mailing direct to j . bowles @ parcel0go . com in customer_services , or speaking to her by phoning 0000 0000000 this may cost 00p_per_minute .
negative	i have had a nightmare with this company .
negative	firstly i thought it was a uk_based company and it '_s not .
negative	secondly the web_site stated the sunglasses i ordered were in stock , they werent .
negative	money taken .
negative	email_stating that they were being obtained from their supplier .
negative	i also did not take into account any duty implications because i originally thought they were coming from the uk .
negative	i had to cancel the order as i was not prepared to wait any longer for my order to arrive .
negative	i purchased these for my wife as a mothers_day present ....... they said my refund would be with me within " a few_days ".
negative	nothing yet .
negative	i have now ordered from a uk seller ( an opticians ) and ended_up paying £ 0 more and they will be delivered the next_day .
negative	never buy anything from merlin_cycles .
negative	i bought new avid brakes and they arrived leaking brake_fluid .
negative	merlin_cycles tell me that it ’_s normal , but anyone with half a clue about bikes knows that to be rubbish .
negative	they also told me i ’ d have to pay to send them back , but i found it simpler to buy a service kit from elsewhere that solved the problem .
negative	i used this company due to it '_s convenience and had my car collected from work .
negative	car passed mot , payment made and i was advised car would be delivered for 0000 .
negative	0000 came and went , no car .
negative	called the helpline at 0000 to be told by a robotic and non - compassionate advisor that the garage had closed for the day and my car is in the locked compound .
negative	i work in a completely remote_location with no links to public_transport and all my colleagues had left for the day .
negative	after 0 hours of bouncing calls around and getting no where with the unhelpful agent , i had to make my own arrangements .
negative	long_story_short , an_apology was made but no reimbursement for expensive taxi , missed commitments with the family and cancelation of business meetings .
negative	convenience turned into a complete nightmare .
negative	avoid at all costs !
negative	ordered 00 / 00 /_0000 , engineer due out 00 / 00 /_0000
negative	waited from 0 - 0 , no one showed up .
negative	re - booked for 00 / 00 /_0000 , 0 - 0 , received text at 00am on the day saying the order had been cancelled .
negative	rang up customer_services , 00_minutes on the phone banded around between 0 different_departments , no - one with any authority or who could confirm .
negative	turns_out my entire account had been cancelled so i had to create a new account and the stupid guy in sales could not even reference my previous order ..... some bulls_** t about different systems .... whatever .
negative	transferered to another department ...... waited on hold for 00_mins and hung_up .
negative	do not use talk_talk , they will waste your time and are clearly a rubbish company if they cannot connect after 0 months !
negative	my order was placed from your website for tyres to be delivered to ****.
negative	having received notification today from dpd the tyres have been delivered i contacted **** to arrange fitting but they confirmed they have not received the tyres .
negative	it transpires the postcode for **** on your website is wrong rm0 @@@ it should be rm0 +++ and my tyres have been delivered to an unknown location !
negative	i am really very annoyed about this , i feel an immediate_refund should be made to me as i am not about to go hunting for tyres that have been wrongly delivered because the information on your website is wrong .
negative	you can contact me on *******
negative	i have now spoken again with the proprietor of ++++ and he has kindly been out with his satnav to see if he could locate another business the tyres may have been delivered to in the piostcode ???
negative	?, the code relates to private houses !
negative	quite why dpd delivered to a private house when it clarely should be going to a business is beyond me but the postcode came from your website so it is ultimately your problem to address .
negative	i will now have to seek tyres from somewhere more trustworthy , please issue an immediate_refund and confirm .

negative	hello
negative	i '_m looking into it and i '_ll let you know asap
negative	best regards ,
negative	oliver m .
negative	thank_you oliver ,
negative	i need to source tyres now from somewhere_else - i haven_'_t received the ones ordered from tyreleader so please issue a full_refund and confirm .
negative	thank_you .
negative	regards
negative	m
negative	the investigation is under way .
negative	please send over a joint statement with the garage that none of you you have received the tyres .
negative	it might be useful .
negative	please send formal statement at support @ tyreleader . co . uk
negative	best regards ,
negative	oliver m
negative	0 hours
negative	this is preposterous !
negative	i have told you i haven_'_t received the tyres i have also confirmed on here in writing that the fitters have not received the tyres , i can do no more !
negative	i have never dealt_with a more obstructive and unhelpful outfit , this will be put under my comments for all to see .
negative	the way i am being treated by tyreleader is a disgrace !
negative	it is not up to me to sort_out problems you have created !
negative	i repeat - i have not received my tyres , nor has your designated fitter per the ( incorrect ) details taken from your website .
negative	i want an immediate_refund i am entitled to under the sale of goods_act .
negative	regards

negative	mike ,
negative	if you wanta solution to this problem , please send me over a document as requested .
negative	in pdf form .
negative	best regards ,
negative	you know this is not possible , how can i get someone_else miles from where i live to write on and sign a piece of paper for me to then send to you ?
negative	this is your error , i have paid and you are keeping my money under_false pretences
negative	i will now deal with the matter through my credit_card company
negative	your company and behaviour are an utter_disgrace and will be reported - my transript will be available to all .
negative	0_stars would be more accurate .
negative	bought two mattresses and picked a delivery date and then chose to spread the cost on finance .
negative	first one arrives - absolute_rubbish silentnight one where it feels empty and all you can feel at the side is springs .
negative	so can i return it - no because the other one is on finance and the finance can '_t be cancelled then it can but you have to find a courier to return it , but that has to be yesterday .
negative	and can you wait to see the second mattress and return both together .
negative	no because then you can '_t cancel finance .
negative	still_waiting for second mattress .
negative	wishing never ordered .
negative	will never use these_people again .
negative	will be contacting_trading_standards on my rights to return and cancel the order after the second mattress arrives if it '_s not up to scratch .
negative	bought a shower_door for a 000mm exclosure .
negative	the space is a fraction under 000mm , but the door we bought only goes up to 000mm .
negative	there is now a warning on the site , so clearly they have realised this is an issue .
negative	almost all the other doors go up to 000mm , but they refused to exchange the screen for an upgrade as it is over 00 days .
negative	the customer service was shocking with someone_who speaks terrible english and was rather aggressive .
negative	he did helpfully suggest that i sell it on ebay , so that wasw useful !
negative	ordered goods and paid a reasonable delivery cost £_00 for one order .
negative	in the end the goods were too big so we had to return some of them .
negative	the charge for returning was a further £_00 !!!
negative	the fact that we wanted to exchange them , which is not uncommon , didn_'_t mean that we could have collected and redelivered at the same time - no that would be too easy .
negative	you have to pay £_00 upfront for collection and place a new order where you again pay £_00 for another delivery ...!
negative	absolute_rubbish service and reordered from bella_bathrooms , at better prices with free delivery and quicker service .
negative	flowers arrived 0pm after all day spend in box on the van not fresh not as expected rely not recommeded
negative	very disappointed my goods were supposed to be here last_week not very satisfactory !
negative	had an awful 0 month saga with this company .
negative	they had my equipment twice and returned damaged items .
negative	i was also told that the engineers word would be taken over mine even_though what he said was total rubbish !
negative	i took my car to a local rc hobby instead at the weekend & he said my buggy was set_up all wrong and would not run like that .
negative	avoid this company and drive to a [_external_reference_] - you will receive a much_better service !
negative	i went to [_external_reference ].....
negative	thanks [_name_] :-)
negative	i work for a large successful aerospace company & have previously purchased from ccl many_years_ago .
negative	i liked their new website they are competitively_priced and fairly local so i decided to try and do_business again with them .
negative	basically i was flatly turned down for an account without an explanation .
negative	even worse my attempts to discuss the situation were rudely ignored .
negative	i have been buying it products for around 00 years_now and this is by far my worst ever experience .
negative	in my experience ccl are a very unprofessional company and no good at all for business purchasing .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	p . s .
negative	it '_s an old order because they clearly did not want my business but this is a very recent experience .
negative	me : " i have twice tried to book a flight through your website in the last 00_hours .
negative	the payment goes through and the reservation made , and then it gets cancelled a few hours_later and the money refunded .
negative	what '_s going on ?"
negative	bravofly customer service : " i don_'_t know .
negative	there seems to be a technical fault ."
negative	me : " yes , your colleague said that yesterday when the first one got cancelled .
negative	well , what can i do to make it work ?
negative	i need to book this flight before the price goes up and --"
negative	bravofly : " oh , jesus , i don_'_t know !
negative	ok ?
negative	i don_'_t know ."
negative	me : " okayyyy ... so what do you suggest i do ?"
negative	bravofly : " just book with a different company ."
negative	me : " yes .
negative	yes , i think i will ."
negative	both_times , i tried to make the payment through paypal ( because bravofly charge_extortionate_fees for visa cards - £ 0 . 00 ).
negative	there was £_000 credit in my paypal_account — more than enough to cover the £_00 cost of the flight .
negative	looking on other message boards , this " cancellation " seems to be not just common with bravofly , but almost the norm whenever people try to pay through paypal .
negative	could they just be cancelling these flights because they don_'_t get to apply the credit_card mark - up ?
negative	i applied to open a business bank_account at the same time but did not receive any details and the company did not reply to any email communications .
negative	i ordered on saturday , the delivery got delivered on tuesday and then the post man decided to not to leave a card for me to collect my delivery .
negative	very upset by the service and lack of service givin to me .
negative	will look at other_suppliers like indigo - herbs . co . uk and holland &_barrett
negative	if you consider renting a car by rentalcars , check the website of the local supplier first .
negative	rentalcars is by far too expensive .
negative	i sent the following email on the supposed day of the delivery and had no response " our order has not been delivered to us .... i have been in the house waiting , and note that your previous email stated a delivery time between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 ....
negative	this is very poor delivery service and very disappointing .
negative	i have tried to phone you find out what has happened but despite your website giving 00 . 00 as your closing time for a friday your phone system is closed ... also poor service .
negative	all i have remaining is your automated re - delivery service which is simply not good enough when your delivery driver has not been here .
negative	please re - organise delivery immediately by contacting your driver and getting him to return forthwith ."
negative	when i finally_managed to get a phone number for dpd and spoke to their customer service centre they implied that i was lying about the lack of delivery and left me with no option but to drive 00 miles round_trip to pick_up the product so as not to disappoint my wife who was travelling the next_day ..
negative	i was refused an upgraded delivery and offered no compensation for dpd '_s failure to manage their delivery reasonably ..
negative	signed_up with talk_talk over the internet for broadband and telephone on the 00 august and paid £_000 . 00 line rental up front by debit_card .
negative	received a confirmation_email on the 00 august advising me the my service will be up and running within 00 days , 0 september received my september bill for zero , tried to log_onto my account on the 0 september to get an update , could not log on so rang talk_talk and spent 00_minutes trying to explain i could not log on to my account , only to told i had a credit on my account of £_000 . 00 and my account had been deactivated ?
negative	asked to speak to a manager who eventually explained that talk_talk could not provide me with the service , something to do with my local exchange .
negative	ok only 00 days wasted , no email from talk_talk to tell me that they could not provide the service , just please refund my £_000 . 00 back onto my debit_card , sorry_sir we cannot make debit_card refunds , will send you a cheque within 00 days .
negative	so t t take my money for a service they cannot provide , give me every indication that the service will be activated within 00 days , send me a bill , but don_'_t bother to tell me they cannot provide me with the service and then expect me to wait up to another 00 days for a cheque that i have to drive 00 miles to the the bank to pay in and then wait another 0 days for it to clear , so in total tt can hold on to my money for up to 00 days , how many people are they doing this too .
negative	to make_matters_worse i was told i was not forced to pay the line rental in advance , then told i could have the service if i paid for a new line , another £_00 . 00 please , i checked the possibility of this with tt sales and was told it was impossible .
negative	anyway i have dug my heels in and demanded that i have my refund paid back to my debit_card , and was told by tt on the 0 september that someone from the ceo dept will contact me within five working_days .
negative	would you believe it september 00 and no contact , so i call tt again put on hold again , only to be told ceo has a bit of a back log someone should be back to you within the next two_days .
negative	one could be forgiven for thinking this could be a way to make a little more profit , entice potential_customers with attractive offers and discounts if they pay in advance and then hold on to the money for as long as possible if they cannot provide the service .
negative	i run my own business so am used to dealing occasionally with idiots , and people that try to take_advantage , but what about all the people that get bullied into excepting excuses , and fobbed_off .
negative	i await your reply talk_talk
negative	do not go_anywhere_near tthis useless device
negative	it is a large_chunk of plastic that will stop you from snoring only because you cant sleep
negative	if you do fall asleep you will still snore .. or so my wife tells_me
negative	should have returned it .. but was on holiday and too_busy
negative	do not buy under any circumstances
negative	the company ... horrid
negative	ordered an item and never came told to wait 00 days before anything could happen .
negative	waited over two_weeks for order , always misformed about order , paied for saturday service however guy worked there forgot to add label .
negative	online live support un maned
negative	rude staff
negative	part from the price
negative	never again
negative	don_'_t get me wrong i really liked being an e . on customer .
negative	they gave_me good advice which i followed and i did save_money by reducing my energy useage .
negative	however , the price of their gas and electricity just keeps going up and up ; regardless of their baseless press announcement that they were reducing electricity by 0 %.
negative	this only applied to a handful of people as far as i can tell .
negative	the cost of energy is everything and by moving to scottish_power i will be saving £_000 + a year .
negative	the fact that e . on keep phoning me to ask me to stay is a sure sign that their customer churn must now be at unprecedented levels .
negative	parcels consistently not collected .
negative	staff unhelpful and unable to give any indication of whether your goods will actually be collected resulting in disatisfaction / bad feedback from the recipitant .
negative	the re - arrange_collection facility does not work .
negative	you are better off cancelling your original collection and trying again .
negative	attempt 0 to get through to someone in as many days , currently held for 00_minutes .
negative	attempts 0 - 0 i gave up after 00_mins each .
negative	attempt 0 their automated callback disconnected me .
negative	i got through yesterday , but this time their system was down .
negative	been a customer for a week as they supplied our new house , and its been a week too long ; already switching .
negative	if this is an example of what scotland has to offer , good luck to them and the potential independence !!
negative	shocking .
negative	i placed an order on the 00th_feb_0000 .
negative	part of the order were 00 t - shirts with a0 logo on the front .
negative	small left breast logo were delivered .
negative	you then had the t - shirts picked_up the 00 march_0000 .
negative	after sending emails and calling , i still have no answer .
negative	i have only used workwear since starting my business in 0000 and , i '_m really not happy regarding this order and not sure i will use them again .
negative	bought curtain from them , paid all fees online , but got charged 00 . 0vat on delivery ........!
negative	?
negative	to return it , only got 00_% refund ........
negative	this is unbelieveable ......
negative	if u are in uk , do not use them !
negative	!
negative	my wife spends too much time on this site and i cant she why ?
negative	i ordered a switch actuator for a kenwood kettle on 00th_feb_0000 and it promptly arrived a mere 0 months later on the 00th of august_0000 !
negative	( yes 0 months , i know amazingly fast right !)
negative	once i had recovered from the excitement of my delivery i eagerly opened the package looking_forward to admiring my shiny_new switch ... unfortunately my new found happiness was short_lived .
negative	the switch was the wrong_colour ... black instead of white , although after much_deliberation while making a cup of tea i decided that actually i did prefer the colour of the new switch especially in certain light conditions .
negative	after all of these ups and downs with this package the absolute worse thing was that the switch was broken on delivery so totally un - switchable !
negative	i will look_forward to being_able to update this review in another 0 months when the replacement hopefully arrives .
negative	in summary .... worse £ 0 . 00 plus p_&_p ever !
negative	i have tried to contact this company via_email twice and no response , they are trying to charge more money than quoted .
negative	avoid this company !
negative	ordered blinds for our house - ' delivery in 0 working_days '
negative	0 working_days_later no sign so i emailed
negative	0 days_later they called to say that the item (' in stock ') on the website was actually out of stock and would not even reach their warehouse for nearly three_weeks .
negative	no offer to refund so much as the delivery charge .
negative	customer_services seemed baffled when i refused to accept what they offered ( 0 - 0_weeks delivery instead of 0 working_days ).
negative	never , ever again .
negative	product not yet arrived .
negative	my wife and i have been with vodafone for over ten_years , since retiring we were not using the minutes on contract and decided in july to convert to pay as you go keeping our numbers , this worked out fine for me but did not suit my wife , she has_gone back on a 00 month sim only contract , the problems started with the first bill being not correct because the vodafone staff had not taken my bank details and re set_up a direct_debit , this was sorted after many calls to customer_services and i use this term with disdain .
negative	we now have a problem where my wife has no access to her account , if we try her number it just leads to my pay as you go account , over the last five days starting saturday 0th_september , we have phoned and spoken to , susan , ryan , pauline , victoria , carol , tarek , and today jodie , every day we have been promised that the problem would be solved in 00 hour it has not .
negative	vodafone is denying my wife access to her account online and as she is signed_up for paperless billing so has no access to her account !
negative	today we asked to talk to a manager and jodie tried every thing under the sun to stop us doing this , she finally relented and told my wife she would get a call in forty_eight_hours , this is disgusting service from one of the big_boys who do not give a hoot about their customers , pity we could not all withhold payment as a protest , they would soon get the message , people have the power to make or break a company , if i knew how and was forty_years younger i would do this .
negative	update
negative	now over 00_hours and no manager has bothered to phone my wife , i have escalated this complaint at 0 . 00pm friday 00th_september to customer operations director mark bond , we have had an_automated_reply_stating they have received our email complaint , not looking good for vodafone !
negative	will keep you updated for you all to see how long it takes vodafone to do this one simple_task .
negative	update monday 00th_september 0000hrs
negative	this morning my wife while out had a call from natalie from mark bonds office ( he did not phone so you can see how important we are to vodafone ) and was told that she had registered my wife for her account and she would be able to log in when she arrived home !
negative	she arrived home at 00 . 00hr and no she could not log in again , they must think we enjoy keeping up this total farce !
negative	we do not !
negative	going back to mark bond and then to report them to i believe oftel , look out for further updates from this totally_incompetent company .
negative	over priced , uninformative , hard to navigate .
negative	ordered some taps paid next working day delivery they arrived 0 days_later then to find a part missing ring they send out the wrong part for what '_s missing & now still_waiting for the correct_part to be sent out they talk a good job on the phone but give garbage service in the end defiantly would not use these again ends up costing more in the long run after numerous phone_calls & putting plumber off i recommend avoid this site like the plague
negative	you can sometimes buy in their shop products in good prices , that is the reason i bought from them my seagate 0tb green , the disc failed after few_months , and when you try to contact them they made up senseless excuses , they don_'_t even talk correct sentences just senseless words which you later put_together as meaning '' no sorry '' there is no warranty talk with manufacturer .
negative	as they say they are not trained to offer you other product in place of broken one .
negative	as when you loose 0tb precious data isn_'_t enough you will end up with empty wallet .
negative	i agree dabs . com might know how to sell you a product but that is where they finish their job .
negative	and as with every company making business in this way you can read up on their website dozen of comments from supposedly satisfied customers and off course only positive ones how wonderful the company is
negative	i would not recommend this service to family or friends .
negative	the flowers were left_outside of the upstairs flat .
negative	they arrived close to 0 pm but because of where they were left they were collected by me by good fortune at 00 pm they could have been stolen .
negative	the flowers look average and certainly not worth £_00 .
negative	they were a present for my girlfriend who was turning 00 yesterday .
negative	the whole service was disappointing .
negative	i will not be using your service again .
negative	please take my details off your mailing_list forthwith .
negative	ordered £_00 worth of roses to be delivered on valentines_day to my wifes work which is in a prominent west_end location .
negative	at 00pm on 00th_feb received an email_stating :
negative	" we have just been advised by the courier company assigned to deliver your order that the order has_been rejected .
negative	this normally occurs in the event that the address is not valid or if it is incomplete ."
negative	the address was complete and any london courier would know it , failing this why did ' nt they ring me to confirm it ( they ask for your tel_number when ordering ).
negative	none of their numbers work , no reply to my emails or messages sent via their site .
negative	money has left my credit_card , this smells like a scam .... avoid .
negative	they sell the stuff nobody_wants , they offer stuff like ipads at crazy price , but never actually have stock .
negative	waste of time and effort .
negative	sadly many will be_fooled .
negative	they also try to sell by finding an over_inflated guide price , of recent this has_been for android tablets , the price they make an example of is way over the real selling price , trying to fool you into thinking you can buy and then sell on and make something .
negative	do not use these companies !
negative	yes cheap deals , but dodgy as hell and things go_wrong , boy do they go_wrong , oh and should you be treated unfairly , expect to be threatened .
negative	if you say anything bad about them or their products , they will take legal_action .
negative	they also used the same to silence an entire community forum from sharing with you the truth .
negative	pay a litle more use a reputable_company .
negative	i dealt directly with steve digva the company ceo .
negative	two items went wrong in 0 months , reason , ill packaged kit , amp not suitable for the speakers .
negative	initially phoned for a pioneer deal , told not in stock , typical , then an alpine kit , not instock , then given a so called free upgrade , push selling technique , their brand amplifier and audiobahn speakers .
negative	audiobahn are generally good , what is not disclosed is that audiobahn stopped producing these 0 - 0 years_ago , so do not expect any manufacturer support .
negative	there is no mention of this when you get the package .
negative	00p a minute just to register the returns .
negative	palmed off with , voice coils not covered_under_warranty , no mention of this anywhere , underpowered provided amplifier cause of clipping and coil burn , kit never fit for purpose .
negative	then offered just one replacement , but something at half the cost and speck , then sent a replacement , used and damaged .
negative	my old subwoofer returned cut open , advised by mr digva to evo - stick it !
negative	on any replacement , you have to agree to : accept no warranty , accept never to discuss their products or service , or face legal_action .
negative	well there you go , now sue me , if letting people know the truth is a crime ....... i am guilty .
negative	if you think you can treat me like a footballers bit on the side , trying to get a gagging order when you get caught out ...... you thought wrong .
negative	i now have gone to consumer direct , will take to court next if need be .
negative	i will write on every forum / feedback / review site that i can
negative	the delivery arrived on time but that is it regarding the good points .
negative	the toilet_pan had leaves and other unspeakable debris deposited therein .
negative	the toilet_seat had a chipped off piece of plastic that fell out of its packaging .
negative	the other items were dirty and had been repackaged badly .
negative	all the boxes were damp and crumpled .
negative	it looked as if the whole consignment had been rejected , left_outside in shame and reclaimed .
negative	it was so bad that no thought was given to signing for the goods .
negative	it all had to be rejected .
negative	in leaving only one star in no way reflects on the delivery drivers .
negative	they were courteous and acquiesced to my refusal to accept the goods .
negative	the local tyre_fitting facility i selected turned_out to have closed_down .
negative	no notification given , no tracking_info on my tyres , no communication whatsoever .
negative	whilst trying to chase up i encountered numerous log on issues with the tyre_leader website .
negative	there is no number to call or email address , just online dialect with their incompetent employee .
negative	despite politely requesting a refund several_times ( i needed to go_elsewhere as tyres were on legal_limit , and my order had disappeared into the abyss ) they eventually tuned up a week_later at my home address .
negative	now made arrangements to fit elsewhere which is costing more than tyre leaders original quote .
negative	prices were attractive but never again ...
negative	i brought a car sold in large bold letters as a 0_seater ride on car .
negative	when it arrived it seamed small .
negative	i checked and there is a label left by the manufacturer saying ' one seat only ' .
negative	when i email the company they drew my attention to a small note in the add that says ' this is a one seater car suitable for 0 small_children ' .
negative	the car is suitable for children aged for 0 - 0 .
negative	i got this for my son '_s 0rd birthday so he was only just 0 .
negative	my other son is 0 .
negative	they are both very small for there age .
negative	i emailed the company and they weren_'_t interested .
negative	i will be raising this with trading_standards and my credit_card company .
negative	the car was also damaged on arrival .
negative	having paid for both netflix and lovefilm , ive found very little to watch on lovefilm .
negative	they had a few decent tv programme s for children .
negative	however i sold my wii and brought a samsung_smart_tv and all the good stuff dis appeared .
negative	you would think being an amazon company with lots of money they would have rights to a hugh selection of tv and films .
negative	sadly this is not the case .
negative	total_waste of money .
negative	netflix is far better .
negative	poor at best
negative	they lie ( sales / disconections )
negative	they don_'_t offer unlimited_broadband ( lie ).
negative	too many users slow_speeds so you don_'_t always get what you paid for .
negative	tivo_box has no memory , it merely creates a marker and streams it back .
negative	you have no rights to watch something recorded if you drop the channel .
negative	the equipment that is offered as ' free ' is rented to you .
negative	free install means you pay more .
negative	super hub is only super in name .
negative	most equipment they give you is pants .
negative	call_centres in india reading scripts , not helpful .
negative	seriously one to avoid at all costs , i guarantee any item they sell you can buy at_least half price and even more .
negative	don_'_t go there .
negative	terrrible
negative	the pits
negative	awful
negative	avoid
negative	booked my fitting and the tyres were not there & when we phoned the girl from tyre_shopper she couldn_'_t care less
negative	initially i would give five_stars .
negative	the first part of my order arrived very promptly , despite the two bank_holidays .
negative	however , the hifi itself is still outstanding ( awaiting new stock ) and we have received no updates whatsoever unless we contact them .
negative	hopefully this will arrive soon and i do appreciate that things may be out of hifix control , but a phone_call or email would alleviate the frustration !
negative	dale
negative	ordered some christams presants off amazon on 00rd_december today the 00 / 00 / 00 and still no sign of any of the products .
negative	a few items were direct from amazon and its stating asa delivered left in the porch but i have no sign of the delivery , i have contacted amazon about this a week_ago they said we will reply within_00hrs but still nothing .
negative	ordered a second_hand game at the same time from zoverstocked , was told despatched on the 0th which was a sunday so i thought that was a bit odd .
negative	was told delivery will be before the 00th but no delivery today ,
negative	emailed zoverstaocked they said allow unto 00 days after despacth date , nothing arrived so emailed them again so the same email back but this time saying allow 00 days .
negative	shocking
negative	i would have liked to review the quality of the flowers but my order never arrived the tracking_system said they were out for delivery and could arrive any time up to 0pm so wheh this all fell through i had no time to find any alternative .
negative	surely a company specialising in the delivery of flowers should know the importance of meeting delivery commitments and they must have known that 0hey were going to let_me down whattever the reason was , but no one bothered to contact me and give a reason . i can only suggest if you have a special_occasion you want to celebrate with flowers chose a company that cares_about its commitments
negative	all they want is for you to join facebook to reply to any company '_s remarks , have complained about it but they just don_'_t seem care !!!!
negative	do your own reviews jk if you want to know what customers really think of your products .....
negative	halfords in slough mill street
negative	booked tyres on line and found a good price .
negative	chose halfords auto centre slough for the fitting , not the farnham road one as i had experienced bad service there in the past .
negative	big_mistake . i thought that they were all seperate and run as a franchise service .
negative	yhey are one company that i will never use again .
negative	i was kept waiting even_though i was booked in for the tyres to be fitted .
negative	i could see the tyres stacked in a corner of the depot .
negative	they were not touched as job after job was done before mine .
negative	i complained and was given the usual , they will do it next line .
negative	never again will i use any halfords
negative	having wasted the best part of a week trying to resolve an issue with a company , and being met with disgraceful customer service , i initially left a review on the website of the company in question , but not surprisingly i found that it was hidden from view , whilst many thousands of 0 * reviews were promoted .
negative	looking for somewhere unbiased to leave an honest review i found trustpilot , and posted a review here .
negative	i now find that replies left for me by others have disappeared , any other negative_reviews are taken down , and yet again we have a situation where a company is burying the truth about their appalling service .
negative	after some investigation i realise that trustpilot is nothing but a scam , a place where companies can build the kind of reputation they want to project , adding countless good reviews , and quashing any less_than favourable .
negative	yet another disgraceful scenario .
negative	whatever happened to integrity , and companies building a good reputation based on their service .
negative	i have spent the last few_days tearing my hair out at the overall incompetence and disgraceful service i have been receiving .
negative	my parcel has still not materialised at the recipients address , i have been lied to , i have had live_chats terminated without warning , i have had facebook comments ignored .
negative	requests to be called by me have been ignored and at one point i was told point_blank that nobody would be able to talk to me .
negative	i have been told that despite a service being called yodel 00 , it actually means it '_s a 00 hour service , clearing designed to mislead and quite possibly a breach in advertising_standards .
negative	i am astounded at the complete_lack of consideration given by parcel0go to me as a customer , and astounded that any individuals could behave_like this , almost certainly this is a company wide culture .
negative	companies with such disregard for their customers should be shut_down .
negative	still_waiting for goods to arrive .
negative	was not explained to me the photos were going to be smaller than i had ordered due to the different ratio aspect of digital_photos .
negative	i had ordered photos 00x00 and were actually 00x00 .
negative	they looked awful in the photo_album i had purchased .
negative	quick delivery though and customer_support replied quickly when i complained about the size issue but there was no compensation .
negative	bought a 0_seater sofa and arm_chair .
negative	multiple scratches and marks when it arrived .
negative	very unhelpful when it comes to arranging a convenient time for ' service agent ' to visit .
negative	i have just kicked him out of my house , after he decided the best approach was to try and con me and fob me off with repairs such as ' colouring in ' the scratches .
negative	had settee for 0_weeks and it looks 00 years old already !
negative	stay_away from these_clowns .
negative	you have been_warned !
negative	i spent_nearly_£_00 on a photobook .
negative	when it arrived it had my cover but was full of someone_else '_s photos - lots of pages with a full year of someone '_s life .
negative	i let jessops know and they said they would make an enquiry and to assure me they were taking this very seriously .
negative	they offered to do a re - print if i would send them a photo of the book to prove i wasn_'_t lying .
negative	they also added that i wouldn_'_t be charged for this re - print ( how nice of them to not charge me twice for one book ).
negative	i '_ve no idea who is looking at my photos and find it very disturbing .
negative	i followed up with a second e_- mail saying i wasn_'_t happy with their response .
negative	the reply said they were refunding me 00_% as a goodwill_gesture .
negative	this doesn_'_t really cover it .
negative	also i haven_'_t received this so who know where they have sent it to .
negative	so if you value your privacy and want to be taken seriously when something does go_wrong , don_'_t send your images to jessops
negative	i '_ve bought several cameras from jessops including my current slr .
negative	i always found them to be a good store .
negative	maybe its now different with the change in ownership
negative	i ordered a nutribullet form high_street tv in response to an ad i saw in the newspaper , ordering was very quick , helpful straight through to an operator who quickly took my order .
negative	after 0 days my product had not arrived , no i have to call customer service ( as now they have my payment ) so after phoning and leaving a message ( all there operators are busy ) no returned phone_call , eventually after several calls i got through to be told the product was delivered that day .
negative	we are now on the 00th day after ordering and they can not get an answer from their couriers to say where it was delivered and who signed for it , i have now spoken to 0 online operators , 0 managers and the saga goes on .
negative	please do read this long and drawn_out story as it will save you a lot of hassle in the long run ( on the 00th day now and still no resolve , apology or information
negative	i would not recommend this company , the unit quality is actually good but the overall experience was unacceptable which resulted_in us having to find another company to install the units and us being without a kitchen for 0_weeks .
negative	considering the cost of the units there are equal quality at a much_better price available , very expensive mistake all in all
negative	parcel posted on 00 september still not arrived evening 00 september and the tracking service provided by the delivery company states it has never left their sending depot let_alone arrived at my house
negative	accepted my order for nearly_£_000 of perfume .
negative	0 days_later i get curt one line e_- mail - due to ' security issues with payment ' order cancelled .
negative	what rubbish .
negative	if there was a problem with payment - call me or e_- mail me to resolve it - don_'_t just cancel it .
negative	ridiculous - you obviously haven_'_t got the product i ordered and haven_'_t the common decency to admit your shortcomings .
negative	i am furious and insulted and will tell everyone i speak to what a dreadful service this company provides .
negative	you would seriously be a sad state of mind to pay for any program on itv_player , now i like a lot of itv programs but if i miss them on normal tv i just put it down to experience .
negative	the adverts never seem to have a problem .......... think about it !!!
negative	!
negative	the packing of my order was appalling .
negative	the box was about ten times too big for the content .
negative	there was no interior padding so the contents bounced_around and eventually split the box .
negative	the whole parcel was then repacked by the carrier .
negative	the whole episode was both embarassing and unecessary .
negative	thanks for the offer of the possible weekend in edinburgh , but you were no able to supply me with the part i needed , despite advertising them on your web_site , however i appreciated the prompt reply .
negative	regard roger purdy
negative	following a recent_purchase of a shower_tray , a small item - half a dozen small metal spring clips plus screws were missing from the package .
negative	since then and many contacts with a very helpful customer help department i still have not got the missing items .
negative	i keep getting sent a replacement package minus these vital clips / what is so difficult about supplying the right thing ??
negative	no complaint with the main goods and the help dept is great .
negative	i just want these clips !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a couple of items a week_ago , 0 item being a vision battery 0000mah in silver .
negative	despite having both my email address and phone number they decided to assume that it was okay to replace the silver battery with a blue one because apparently they are out of silver .
negative	actually i couldn_'_t care less about the colour , but i can '_t believe the cheek .
negative	they didn_'_t contact me because they have crap on their shelves that hasn_'_t sold which they want to get_rid of it .
negative	good way to get_rid of a customer too .
negative	these are not professionals , there are tons of better retailers for e_- cig products , i don_'_t know why i even bothered with them .
negative	rubbish service .
negative	i was waiting in all day for a driver to collect a parcel , at some point i got a text saying the driver had attempted collection and that i would need to re - book .
negative	no driver ever attempted a collection .
negative	i would never use this service again , they are cowboys .
negative	i purchased a laptop off of laptopsdirect . co . uk just before_christmas .
negative	when i went through to the last page it said my session had expired and that i would have to do it again .
negative	so i placed an order again and it seemed to work .
negative	laptopsdirect . co . uk then informed me that there was a payment problem and that i had to contact their team .
negative	i checked my account and it seemed that they had an authorised payment from the bank , they said they didn_'_t , which was a lie .
negative	thankfully the money went back to my account after 0 days , however the people i spoke to were unhelpful and rude .
negative	i would not trust them again in the future .
negative	i made a purchase from saveonlaptops instead , and that was without an issue and cheaper .
negative	i do not recommend buying anything from them , especially not expensive products .
negative	sent the wrong_size .
negative	total_waste of time using this site .
negative	never again
negative	these flowers were in no way worth the 00 quid paid
negative	bifocals ordered .
negative	arrived fairly quickly ( 0_weeks ).
negative	second day glasses fell_apart .
negative	phoned company - no apology .
negative	did not want to accept_responsibility or have returned for repair .
negative	eventually agreed .
negative	posted specs guaranteed delivery .
negative	company claimed not arrived - despite guaranteed delivery .
negative	took a further 0_weeks of constant emails / phone_calls to chase .
negative	company repeatedly told me glasses had not arrived .
negative	after 0_weeks , suddenly they were found !
negative	so they were trying to fob me off .
negative	glasses returned fixed .
negative	no refund for postage .
negative	no apology .
negative	glasses are cheap product .
negative	side pieces keep wobbling about .
negative	very unsure these will last very long .
negative	poor product / terrible attitude to customer service .
negative	avoid this company .
negative	customer base in india dont understand you , value for money 0_star customer 0_star .
negative	ups are so bad it is barely comprehensible .
negative	imagine a delivery company that turns_up in your postcode , doesn_'_t ring your buzzer , doesn_'_t knock on your door , and then leaves without letting you know they were there .
negative	apparently , on planet ups , this counts as an attempted delivery .
negative	of course , for all of the psychic people in the uk , this is no problem at all .
negative	for the rest of us , this is not exactly ideal .
negative	and then imagine you arrange for them to come on another day , agree a specific date with them , receive email confirmation of this date , and then they turn_up again 0 week before this agreed date .
negative	what are they thinking might happen ?
negative	there are a few things i can '_t fathom about ups : how they can be so stupid , and how they can make any money mindlessly attempting to deliver items .
negative	i will never , ever , ever knowingly use a company that has ups as its delivery company .
negative	first order fine although received a few_days late .
negative	my second and larger order has_been a complete_shambles .
negative	i ordered the same product by in slightly_larger_quantities .
negative	was given a delivery date via_email confirmation .
negative	the delivery date come and went with no communication from them .
negative	a few_days after the delivery date i emailed and received no reply , i used online_chat and was told it is out of stock , i asked when do they expect stock and was told " i don_'_t know i don_'_t deal with online orders " i asked why no one had bothered to call or email and let_me know and was again told i don_'_t deal with online orders ask mike ( i ' v never had any dealings with anyone called mike and had no contact details .
negative	about a week after the delivery date i emailed asking for an update and no reply again .
negative	i re emailed asking for a refund no reply .
negative	complete_waste of time and now have to wait for paypal to refund .
negative	will not be using workwear ( not ) express again .
negative	* in response to workwear_express reply *
negative	a copy and pasted reply is not good customer service , and saying " i will look into what occurred to ensure that these sorts of problems don_'_t arise for future customers " is pointless just reading the first 00 or so reviews you '_ve said this at_least 0 times , so either you '_ve not looked into what occurred as you claim or you '_ve not sorted things out .
negative	its amazing that you '_ve failed to reply to my emails yet within minutes you reply to my review and contact me regarding my paypal_dispute .
negative	if you are in fact sorry as you claim to be give me a refund and learn and take on board what the reviews say instead of simply offering a generic_reply and forgetting about it .
negative	this company is claiming to be based at 000 moston lane , however this is not the case and 000 moston lane is my address , we have never had any dealings with them except the countless people visiting to complain .
negative	avoid this company as any order your place will result in your money being lost and nothing to show for it .
negative	this company is a complete scam , the office address they are using to claim they have a uk office is infact my property .
negative	the police visited today with a warrant as they are ripping_people off selling them container loads of paper at a fraction of the uk retail price however it never shows up and nor do your money .
negative	i am only on my second month with plus net and i '_m on my third fault .
negative	trying to get someone to listen when reporting a fault is like pulling_teeth .
negative	always the same question have you changed the micro filter , router is your phone ok they then say they will run some tests and it could take up to 00_hours .
negative	on all 0 occasion after the 00_hours is up they send an email_saying the support_ticket has_been closed as your internet is now connected .
negative	i have to go through the whole rigmarole again because its still not working .
negative	0 months 0 faults and about 0 days with no connection whatsoever yet they still wont send an engineer out .
negative	i waited on hold for 00_minutes only for the phone to cut_off .
negative	when through their online trouble shooter about 00 stupid_questions in is says sorry there was a problem please try later .
negative	well plus . net i consider you to be in breach of our contract and will now be terminating my services , 00 month_contract or not .
negative	complete_shambles and complete_waste of time run by people who cannot think for themselves only readying auto prompt of their computer screens .
negative	the worst thing you ever did was to sell out to bt .
negative	this is a scam the website offers downloads and installs a tool bar , changes your home page and search providers then puts a popup saying the download you requested is no_longer available .
negative	i have a good anti_virus so have tried on a couple of different files and all do exactly the same .
negative	don_'_t waste your time and risk downloading something you cannot get_rid of .
negative	very poor , been waiting on a delivery for 0_weeks now tracking keeps saying tried to deliver .
negative	we ' re a business open 0 - 0 yet they claim they tried to deliver and left a card .
negative	we '_ve never closed during the day and no card was left .
negative	business should stop using them as their carrier , my supplier has now lost my business simply because yodel cannot do what they are paid to do .
negative	i ordered some stuff from them , which was listed ' in stock ' and was still in stock for a few hours afterwards .
negative	over a week_later , was e_- mailed to say it was out of stock , order had been cancelled and card refunded .
negative	tried e_- mailing during this time and was only replied to a week_later despite chasing them , tried_calling the phone number on the website numerous_times and only ever got put through to the voicemail after several rings - the opening times for the phone number are poor enough as it is - but as they never answer , its not worth contacting .
negative	speedtester works ok , but when tweeting results , the url link to the results takes you to a page not found and the not results page .
negative	i placed an order with this store on the 00th of april_0000 for an item shown on the website .
negative	i received an email on the 00th of april informing_me that the item was out of stock .
negative	i indicated that i would wait .
negative	on the 00th of april i enquired again as to when stock would be available , product still out of stock .
negative	on the 00th of may i enquired again as to when stock would be available , product still out of stock .
negative	i also had to change my shipping address .
negative	on 00th of may i decided to cancel my order and ask for a refund .
negative	i was told :
negative	*************************************************************************** dear richard ,
negative	thanks for contacting us .
negative	as you wished , your order has_been deleted and the refund is in process .
negative	you should get credited within the next 00hours .
negative	best regards ,

negative	*************************************************************************** today 00th of june still no refund .
negative	what exactly does it take to get a refund for something that was not ever supplied ??
negative	?
negative	to make it worse the item is still advertised as being available on the website .
negative	are these_guys for real or is this some con website ?
negative	?
negative	i have emailed yet again and will lodge a dispute with paypal .
negative	all in all don_'_t ever use this website or any of the sister websites .
negative	these_guys are not accountable like sellers are in ebay .
negative	stay_away !!
negative	!
negative	they take your money and don_'_t deliver your goods .
negative	had to recover my money through paypal .
negative	thank_goodness i used them and could get my money back .
negative	don_'_t use them from what i '_ve read else where they '_ve gone_bust .
negative	shouldn_'_t still be trading .
negative	please , please , please dont use them !!!

negative	just seen the reply , 0 its my word vs your word about phone being damaged .
negative	0 you could have damaged it .

negative	had to pay extra 00 pounds to have pedal redelivered , and poor customer service from guitar_guitar {(
negative	badbadbadbadbadbadbadbad

negative	euros !
negative	!
negative	complete_waste of time with a bad attitude thrown in for free .
negative	ps
negative	don_'_t bother going to their customer service as will put you in an online queue for ever and there is no email address either .
negative	i was happy to order my tyres from tyre - shopper as their website is well_structured and the price was good , even_though there was no particularly local fitting_centre .
negative	there was over a week between order and fit dates and a prompt confirmation was received by email .
negative	on the morning i was due to have them fitted i rang the garage to ask what time was likely to be quietest for them and to confirm everything was ok .
negative	the chap at national was very pleasant but said that there was no record of the order on his system so he took my details to investigate .
negative	he rang back shortly and said that the tyres were not available at the moment , being on back order , and that the person at tyre - shopper had said that an email had been sent to me a few_days prior .
negative	he gave my t - s '_s number for me to contact them .
negative	well i guess the customer service people at t - s are not used to dealing_with the customer direct as they came_across as distracted and little interested in the situation .
negative	an_alternative tyre was offered but as i ' d ordered the tyre i wanted , i declined so the lady said she ' d give me a refund .
negative	as i still want the tyre i ' d actually ordered i had to ask whether i could not just leave my order on and be contacted once they were available .
negative	the lady also said that a colleague had sent me an email and an answerphone_message had been left on all the numbers i had left .
negative	i '_m sorry but that '_s completely_untrue .
negative	i checked all my emails including the deleted / junk ones and all phones have an answerphone and there was nothing .
negative	overall , if the tyre '_s in stock i '_m_sure that tyre - shopper are a great way of getting them sorted , but if there are any_problems , their communication and customer service is pretty shocking from the experience i '_ve had .
negative	what a great shame .....
negative	parcels lost or damaged very hard to get an answear ..
negative	lost is lost sorry but £_00 will cover it . never use this company again
negative	we wanted to return an unused computer as it had been bought in error ( the spec was incorrect ) micro care would not accept the return even_though we bought it on a card .
negative	i would never buy anything from them again as i know if i had bought from a reputable_dealer such as [_external_reference_] or [_external_reference_] we would have been refunded .
negative	i have no confidence in micro care and will never buy from them again
negative	i cannot recall anything about this company or service other than they have contacted me by email .
negative	accordingly i would suggest you do not avail yourself of their services .
negative	what started out as a simple one star comment i posted on ekomi '_s customer reviews has turned_out to be nothing more than deliberate avoidance of the facts by ekomi .
negative	i purchased inks from a company who were showing the items in stock , i chose this company precisely because i needed the inks urgently and was supposed to receive them in 00_hours .
negative	as it turned_out i waited for three_days only to find they were not in stock and would have to wait longer , based on the time i had already wasted i decided to cancel the order and buy elsewhere so my money was promptly refunded .
negative	based on this experience i decided to leave comments and a one star_rating on ekomi to publish .
negative	instead my review was automatically taken by ekomi into their ' mediation ' system .
negative	fair_enough you may think , as it gives the supplier a chance to put his case which they did .
negative	correspondence followed with the supplier offering a discount on my next order , this was then later increased to a higher percentage none of which was relevant as i had no_intention of ordering from them again anyway .
negative	i have never asked for or expected any discount or compensation of any sort when i posted my review with ekomi , all i have ever expected is that my perfectly justifiable review is posted as it should be .
negative	despite my constant questioning as to why it was not being published i never had any meaningful reply from ekomi .
negative	i continued asking for my original review just to be published as it should be but never received any response to the question .
negative	finally , or so i thought , they closed their mediation process and found in my favour and stated ' the customer review has_been activated '.
negative	well apparently not !.
negative	i searched for it without_success asked them again where it was ... and guess_what - still no posting but they re - opened the mediation again .... yes ... re - opened a closed mediation .
negative	so i asked them again .. ' i also notice you have still not published my review yet .
negative	i checked every review back to page 000 ( approx 0 , 000 reviews , all of which were 0 or 0_star ) to see if it was posted at it '_s original date ( 0000 - 00 - 00 at 00 : 00 ) and it was not , the nearest other postings were 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 .
negative	what do you intend to do about this .'
negative	.. what was their response .. as you would expect .. nothing !.
negative	they have now closed their mediation again .
negative	in my opinion their entire ratings system is nothing more than deceitful .
negative	it seems to me at_least that 0 , 0 and 0_star reviews are never published , if this were true they would be deceiving the customer who believes their review will be published but will not .
negative	in my opinion their deceit is in their advertising which states it gives genuine ratings and reviews , they cover themselves by using carefully chosen statements such as trust ,... a reliable service .... safe and transparent .
negative	worst of all they were advertising '' 000_% guaranteed real customer feedback .
negative	it would appear they have absolutely no_intention of publishing reviews below 0 or 0_star , despite their claims of guaranteed ' real customer feedback ' - it seems all reviews go before ekomi '_s review team who release the review providing there are no 0 , 0 or 0_star_ratings , if there are it goes to ' mediation '.
negative	when customers look at the reviews a company receives it quite_rightly expects all reviews to be shown , how else can they make a judgement .
negative	if ekomi are filtering out low ratings they are deliberately distorting the true picture of the feedback process , this may well put companies in a good light but i believe it '_s actions not only undermine the entire customer reviews process it distorts the truth and deliberately misleads the customer .
negative	00 months_ago i paid £_000 for a phone that is now worthless and does not work .
negative	this is how it happened .
negative	i bought a samsung_galaxy 0 through amazon_marketplace at end february_0000 .
negative	at the time i was surprised that the supplier didn_'_t provide a vat_receipt .
negative	i queried it and was fobbed with the answer that the only document available was the amazon ' final details for order ' document - which specifically states that it is not a vat_receipt .
negative	amazon customer_services were little help , referring me back to the marketplace supplier every time .
negative	so_far so bad , then last saturday , 0st_feb_0000 the phone developed a fault with the display .
negative	i took it to my local samsung approved repair_centre to be told that the phone isn_'_t covered by the two - year samsung warranty as i had thought because it was made for the hong_kong market and the samsung centre can only repair eu models under_warranty .
negative	it gets_worse , i have gadget insurance so i then called them .
negative	they were sympathetic and helpful but there are two snags : firstly they don_'_t pay for repairs that ought to be covered_under_warranty .
negative	secondly before entering a claim they expect to see a proof of purchase receipt with vat number and imei_number ( neither are quoted on my final details for order ).
negative	i have made a request for special pleading in this case - we shall see what happens .
negative	of course i also went back to amazon .
negative	they insist you should first approach the vendor through amazon , which i did .
negative	i had a very prompt reply to tell me that company is no_longer a marketplace vendor .
negative	so , of course i e_- mailed amazon customer_services pointing_out that they have allowed a vendor onto marketplace which sold me a dodgy product with no warranty and has subsequently disappeared .
negative	amazon '_s response is to wash their hands of the whole business .
negative	buyer_beware
negative	p . s .
negative	the phone itself was fine until it developed the fault with the display .
negative	your car_park prices are far to expensive and have just increased again this month .
negative	the £ 0 drop - off is just not needed , it should be similar to glagow .
negative	free for the first 00_minutes would be a fairer system .
negative	the self_employed courier from myhermes . co . uk has today put three cards in my letter_box one dated 0 / 00 , one dated 0 / 00 and one dated 0 / 00 .
negative	these relate to the apparent three_attempts she has made to deliver the delivery .
negative	we empty our letter_box daily as i run a business from my house .
negative	she has clearly been once and put three cards through on the same day .
negative	is she paid based_upon the number of times she attempts a delivery ?
negative	the third card says that the delivery is being returned to the supplier .
negative	this is not satisfactory .
negative	i am being_conned , and the product supplier is being_conned .
negative	i rang the courier to point out what she had done and she hung_up on me .
negative	probably thinks her commission is safe ?
negative	avoid this company at all costs
negative	as above .
negative	previously satisfied customer , now very unhappy and quite_frankly shocked at how i was ignored by customer_services .
negative	this is the same company as taps0less . com and never send out items nor refund you .
negative	refer to reviews of taps0less . com .
negative	still_waiting for my refiund on a product that was never delivered in july !
negative	for all people who give this company four and five_stars beware , they will get you in the end .
negative	sometimes the room selections in hotels offer meals etc .
negative	but after you have selected , and payed they suddenly dis_- appear from your itinerary .
negative	have used them over the last 0 years and any_problems have been sorted_out quickly , usually by a pleasant lady somewhere in london . but now when things go_wrong , you need to speak with an agent somewhere in asia who can speak_english , but can '_t understand it , and just tells you to wait for 00 days for a further reply .
negative	yes this poor customer_care will cost you in the end .
negative	i made my booking on january 00th for £_000 . 00 .
negative	later in the evening i noticed my account was empty and i was left embarrassed at the supermarket unable to pay .
negative	i went to my bank the next_day and they informed me that there had been 0 charges requested by air maroc .
negative	£_000 . 00 and £_000 . 00 , £_00 . 00 , £_00 . 00 , £_00 . 00 , £_00 . 00 , £_00 . 00 and £_00 . 00 .
negative	the first two are correct , the second two were paid and are incorrect , the remaining 0 were declined by my bank i was left with £ 0 . 00 in my bank .
negative	i called expedia ( 00_minutes on the phone ) and the agent on the phone asked me to contact air maroc who charged me .
negative	air maroc told me to email them .
negative	i received a reply saying " further to your request , we would like you to adress your inquiry to expedia with which you booked your flight ."
negative	i call expedia , another ( 00_minutes on the phone ) and was informed i should submit an email with a bank_statement to prove the charges .
negative	i sent the email summarising the problem again .
negative	i called expedia , another ( 00_minutes on the phone ) and was asked to email the attachment again and then was told there has_been a ticketing error and i had been charged_twice but that there should have been an_automated refund .
negative	the agent iman on the phone said he would call me back in 00_minutes .
negative	he never called me back .
negative	i am yet to be paid the £_000 . 00 i am owed for the over charge .
negative	i am incredibly upset about this .
negative	the flowers arrived at_000pm when valentines_day is over , and when they arrived in a box they were brown and dead !
negative	the chocolates were ok but the message on the card was small writting on the back of a peace of paper !
negative	wont be useing serenata_flowers again !
negative	!
negative	this awful company let_me down in couple of occasions .
negative	couple of time they didn_'_t even left the card , but when i checked online - attempted delivery card left .
negative	but funny think was , that i was home at all time .
negative	so literally the self employees drivers showing the company that they are at work even they are not .
negative	so they just scan a package in the car but they never go to the address .
negative	and after 0 attemps , they will just return package to the depot .
negative	and depot is about 00miles_away from my house :) and phone customer_support won_'_t even give you phone number for the driver .
negative	i have never_experienced worst delivery company in my life .
negative	i would never buy of them again they sent flowers to my aunty with no card and no message , when i got in touch with customer_services who don_'_t have a phone they told me to go away on nice words , all i ask for was another delivery with card so she knew an appreciate the flowers
negative	my words of advice stay_away
negative	we were mis_- sold our stag_weekend to berlin .
negative	accommodation - not city_centre as advertised - it was central eastern berlin .
negative	strip_clubs - promised no rip_off clubs with beautiful friendly ladies - were taken to the exact_opposite
negative	local guide - rubbish - even after complaining they stuck to the same bars knowing we ' d complained .
negative	marcel was grumpy ( given i had complained ) despite him being in the entertainment industry .
negative	i sent a complaint letter to chillisauce - their response :
negative	as previously stated various times , we have responded to the points you have raised and feel there is no error in the sale of this package .
negative	we continue to sell berlin confidently to hundreds of customers and have fantastic positive_feedback accounts from such events throughout the past years .
negative	thank_you .
negative	kind_regards
negative	kimberlee drew
negative	their website looks all snazzy and staff are friendly but the blatantly mislead you .
negative	i have complained to abta as chillisauce are unwilling to accept fault .
negative	having read previous_comments i have also had a poor experience with this company .
negative	i had two samsung_galaxy_s0 '_s that were in very good condition and was lured to this company because of the fantastic price they offered ( they were offering 00_% more than [_external_reference_] or [_external_reference ]).
negative	when they phones were tested that apparently had bad bezel damage , they didn_'_t , and the price offered was a fraction of the original .
negative	haggling occurred and then finally i settled on a price as it was clear i was not going to receive my phones back .
negative	also had a major problem with getting payment as they took down the wrong details and then had the phone put down on me by their customer_services team when all i wanted was to sort_out my details so i could get paid .
negative	please avoid them and go for a more recognised and trusted company , they are just not worth the hassle .
negative	this shower will put every obstacle in your way to prevent you ending a 0 month rolling broadband contract .
negative	if you e_- mail them , they don_'_t answer or cancel the contract .
negative	i cancelled my direct_debit after allowing them 00 days ( not the 00 days , mind you ) to action it and they start a hooting and a hollering .
negative	do not go with this company .
negative	their customer service based 0 continents away is appalling and they '_ve hounded me for money they were simply not entitled to .
negative	i booked with alpharooms , made payment successfully through their website and received an invoice and voucher from them by email .
negative	a week or so later i checked my credit_card online and saw that payment had not been taken .
negative	so i checked my booking through the alpharooms website and saw to my surprise that it had been cancelled .
negative	they did this without notifying_me in any way .
negative	i contacted alpharooms who told me that they had cancelled it because they had not been able to obtain payment on my card , even_though there was no_indication of payment not going through at the time .
negative	by the time i contacted them the price of the booking had gone up by £_000 .
negative	my suspicion has to be that they did not want to honour the booking because the price was going up .
negative	it '_s a good thing i checked the booking before i left - the inconvenience had i turned_up at the hotel expecting my booking to be honoured would have been substantial .
negative	alpharooms ' terms and conditions_state " once the booking is confirmed we will issue you with your invoice .
negative	this is confirmation of your booking ".
negative	they are in breach of this - they are claiming that their confirmation of my booking was not confirmation .
negative	very frustrated and i '_m seriously thinking_about taking_legal_action .
negative	you only get one chance to impress on valentines_day and unfortunately seranta let_me down big time .
negative	i upgraded to the grandissimo size , 0 extra roses for £_00 , but the whole bunch arrived unbloomed and still all closed , not very pleasing on the eye , and now they have started to bloom , most are dropping heavily .
negative	£_00 down the pan and complaint email now going in ...
negative	ordered a bouquet for nearly_£_00 (£_00 . 00 ) including delivery for delivery on valentines_day : comparable to other_suppliers prices , however i really liked the picture on their website so decided to use them rather_than one of the more established suppliers - a mistake i never intend to make again !
negative	terrible quality of product ( had i have bought these from a garage_forecourt , i ' d have taken them back and complained !)
negative	which looked nothing like website image at all .
negative	absolutely nothing like it .
negative	i dont normally complain_about things , however this was such a poor service which disappointed me and my partner so much i feel urged to write to avoid anyone_else experiencing such upset .
negative	tiny arrangement ( despite ordering extra large !
negative	), broken_stems , half_dead_roses , discolouration on the flowers ( very noticeable , even at a distance !)
negative	far from ' prestige ' wrapping ( cheap plastic , wrapped in selotape !!
negative	), really poorly arranged bouquet ( i could have done better and i '_m a long way from being artistic !).
negative	card messaged printed not hand_written ( despite_being charged extra for a premium card !
negative	- something i dont recall choosing so i suspect i didnt see a devious ' opt_out ' box on their website !)
negative	i showed the bouquet to my local_florist ( who i had to go and buy an arrangement from to make up for the embarrassment that was this prestige '_s delivery , paid £_00 less for and received an immeasurably better product ) and they were shocked and aghast at the poor quality of the flowers and the awful arrangement (" it looks_like a child has rearranged it " was their comment - it was still wrapped as delivered !
negative	).
negative	delivery did arrive on time , ( although in a tatty box which was unceremoniously delivered by royal_mail ).
negative	complained to customer_services , very slow to respond , and when they eventually did ( the following_day ) despite acknowledging signs of damage , the company refused to rectify the situation , aside from offering a discount on another arrangement - i can_assure you i '_ll never use the company again and , i urge you to heed that advice . their " 000_% satisfaction_guarantee " is a complete_joke .
negative	this company harks back to the bad old days of faceless unaccountability of online suppliers and a reliance on having no physical shop front for people to complain to as excuse for providing terrible quality products and service .
negative	please avoid at all costs .
negative	happy to supply the pictures if you ' d like .
negative	thanks .

negative	i have been with this compony for two months i was told when i switched my payments by dd would be 00 pound per_month i was paying 00 per_month with m & s energy i just been told i have to pay double per_month i wished i had not switched as soon as i can i will go back to southern energy don_'_t go near first_utility they are crap i am havering to go on to a prepayment meter so i can pay my energy_bills never again
negative	not normally one to review , however , on this occasion i felt it necessary to warn_others of the extremely poor customer service that will likely be forthcoming when ordering from fitness_superstore .
negative	my experiences include : item arriving several days_later than_expected when paying for delivery on a particular day ; the item arriving damaged ; no response from fs to numerous_emails sent regarding a replacement part for the item ; phone_calls being forwarded to voicemail rather_than to an operator ; finally upon speaking to a representative being told they would need to speak with a manager and would get back to me , however subsequently receiving no further contact .
negative	in view of the miserable experience i have had with fs , i have requested the faulty item be returned .
negative	hopefully i will receive a response this time or i will be taking up the issue with my credit_card provider under section 00 .
negative	my honest advice would be to look_elsewhere for fitness equipment .
negative	ordered a tv online and was told the delivery would be between 00 . 00am and 0 . 00pm during the week , so i had to take an afternoon off work to make_sure i was in the house to accept the delivery .
negative	i arrived at home just after 00 . 00 .
negative	as soon as i got home i got a call from my partner saying that the delivery man had been and gone .
negative	it had come to our attention that the delivery man had tried to drop_off our item outside the agreed time forcing us to arrange a new delivery date a week_later !
negative	this is extremely frustrating as i had to take the entire afternoon of work for someone_else '_s incompetence .
negative	we decided to cancel the product and ask for our refund which was over £_000 .
negative	they said we would be refunded within 0 - 0 working_days , but after a week of nothing , we decided to call again .
negative	apparently the refund request hadn_'_t gone_through , so we had to request it again , waiting another 0 days until we got our money back .
negative	firstly , my home hub kept dropping connection , so i had to call to get a replacement .
negative	you ' d think this would be a straight_forward task , but after much_deliberation with customer_services , they finally gave in and accepted that it was indeed a fault with the home home a week_later .
negative	i got a new one , but then my bt_vision stopped_working .
negative	again i had to jump_through_hoops to get this resolved ... but it never did .
negative	to add_insult to injury , i moved_into a new home with my partner who is also a bt customer .
negative	you ' d think it would be easy to merge our accounts .
negative	nope .
negative	they charged me £_000 + to cancel .
negative	thanks bt .
negative	but wait , there '_s more .
negative	when i did move in with my partner , we wanted to get set_up with our existing services for our new home .
negative	this was the final_straw .
negative	after agreeing to an installation date , bt phoned us and cancelled , rearranging a date for a week_later !
negative	they also charged us £_00 for a month without_any service which we tried to get refunded .
negative	after calling customer_services and being on hold for a total of 0 hours , i finally got through to the right people and by this stage i was happy to cancel our account all together .
negative	it '_s an_absolute_joke and should be criminal .
negative	goodbye bt .
negative	hello sky .
negative	my order has not yet arrived , i have asked where it is but have had no response since i completed the order not recived form , i have e_mailed again so we will see what happens .
negative	dissapointed
negative	i ordered flowers for my mother .
negative	i had email confirmation to say they arrived - they didn_'_t arrive and 00 days_later i still have no flowers or a refund .
negative	apparently it '_s yodel '_s fault - yes they use yodel to deliver .
negative	this is the reply i got after i complained : " we are really very sorry , as we have just been advised the driver whom delivered your order has since left the company .
negative	please let us know if we can help you further ."
negative	-
negative	seriously ?
negative	can they help further ?
negative	yes give me my money back at_least or deliver some flowers to my mum who actually deserves a birthday_present .
negative	do yourself a favour - avoid serenata !
negative	ordered a set of knobs .
negative	got one .
negative	told the rest would come waited 0_weeks - contacted them .
negative	00 days_later i received a reply telling_me i needed to send it back for a refund .
negative	then i can place another order .
negative	lots of calls still not sorted .
negative	go somewhere_else !
negative	bad customer_relations if you get in trouble !
negative	i experienced your service on one previous occasionand that was an unmitigated disaster from_start to finish .
negative	i vowed to give you one more go and this time you have now delivered to the wrong_address and i have no idea where the goods are .
negative	emails have been sent to customer service and i '_m still_waiting for a reply .
negative	i will never used your shop again and will advise others also to shop elsewhere .
negative	disgraceful .
negative	so many problems with ebay i sell and buy elsewhere now .
negative	so much hassle with these_people , they have you over a barrel too as you cant do much on ebay with out paypal .
negative	ordered 0 items ( all marked as in stock ) for the start of the season - 0_weeks_ago .
negative	£_00 odd_quid .
negative	after 0 days with no_indication of dispatch i called the 00000 000 000 number and chose option 0 for customer_services - was on hold , in position 0 in the queue for 00_minutes .
negative	when call was answered , the computers were down and person wasn_'_t sure what the status of my order was , said they would call back ( sounding familiar ?).
negative	no call back so after the bank_holiday i called again , was told there was a problem at the warehouse and was promised another call back ( didn_'_t happen ).
negative	called again today and apparently there is a ' problem ' with one of the items , however the other items are due to be picked_up by hermes today ( just received email notification ) saying delivery in 0 - 0 days but could be longer ... was offered an ' upgrade ' on the problem item and said will call back with options ( 0 hours ago ).
negative	on balance - i think this company is best avoided
negative	i have used lastminute on many occasions but never again .
negative	i booked a hotel , received the confirmation_email and turned_up at the hotel only to be told that lastminute had made an error and that there was no room available .
negative	apparently there were five people in a similar_situation and i actually met one of them who had been there for three hours trying to get a resolution .
negative	i then spent the next two hours either on hold or finally talking to people who did not have the seniority to help me .
negative	the only alternative i was offered was a hotel around 0 miles_away - i had booked a central_london hotel because i needed to be in central_london , not to end up in wembley !
negative	while i was waiting , i found a number of hotels with rooms available and at around 0 . 00pm decided to book one of them myself as lastminute had failed to find a suitable_alternative .
negative	the ultimate insult came when i asked to speak to someone_who could authorise paying for the room i booked only to be asked whether it would wait_until the morning !
negative	i am still chasing them for a refund - they are quick enough to take my money but it will take 0 - 00 days to return it - and i am still_waiting for the promised email about how to complain_about their appalling customer service .
negative	i and my boss ordered two mobile_phones , my boss ' order went through ok whereas mine was blocked .
negative	i called them to resolve this , but despite the website advertising delivery within 00_hours , after 00_hours neither order had been processed .
negative	my boss ' phone eventually arrived this morning , opened and used .
negative	i have immediately submitted a returns request and have cancelled my order .
negative	they may have the best prices , but it '_s balanced by dreadful and dishonest service .
negative	this company passed my order straight to another supplier who sent the goods direct to me - along with a copy of their invoice which showed the goods , packing and postage cost mytub half what they charged me .
negative	arrived in faro on 0 / 00 / 00 after booking return transfer to olheo , at airport informed that the carrier would be greenbus .
negative	one girl dealing_with a number of bemused and impatient travellers , eventually after an_hour we were transferred to our resort .
negative	not to bad you may think , however we were issued with a telephone_number to call 00_hours before departure to arrange pick_up .
negative	after approx 00 calls a girl answered and stated that they were having computer problems and would call back ( didn_'_t happen ).
negative	obviously concerned i called the next_day and again after approx 00 calls i eventually spoke to a girl who said that we would be picked_up at 0000 hours the following_morning ( 0 hours before our flight and some 00_minutes from the airport ! )
negative	told girl that this was not acceptable .
negative	no further calls from the company no pick_up from the company at 0000 hours and as such a local taxi picked us up at 0000 hours and deposited us at the airport at 0000 without_any hassle .
negative	avoid this company like the plague !!!
negative	!
negative	such a shame i have been a lovefilm member for a number of years and really loved the service , the site was easy to navigate and user_friendly .
negative	since the amazon switch over it has_been dreadful and they have basically destroyed what was once a fantastic service .
negative	films i returned being sent straight back to me and probably the world '_s most confusing web_site that i can no_longer be_bothered to navigate .
negative	surely when you buy out a company you are buying an existing client base , so why would you think changing everything would be a good idea .
negative	looking at the comments on here it seems they will be losing all the customers they once had .
negative	hvis_du tænker på at skifte dit nuværende forsikringsselskab ud til topdanmark , så vent med at træffe din beslutning til du har hørt min historie om , hvordan det_gik for mig da_jeg_skulle skifte .
negative	som vip kunde i danske bank blev_jeg spurgt om_jeg_ikke ville modtage et tilbud om at samle alle mine forsikringer og flytte dem til topdanmark .
negative	to gange udeblev konsulenten fra vores aftalte møder uden at give besked .
negative	det kostede mig to tabte arbejdsdage .
negative	da_de langt om længe kom den trejde gang , efter at danske bank højt og helligt , lovede mig at det_ikke ville ske igen , så kunne jeg langt om længe - og_vi taler om mere end et år - mødes med_en konsulent .
negative	han var utrolig serviceminded , men_det viste sig hurtigt , at de fremsendte forsikringer ikke levede op_til det lovede .
negative	nu , 0 måneder efter besøget , er_der stadigvæk problemer_med mine forsikringer .
negative	jeg_er_ikke et sekundt i tvivl om , at jeg_ikke vil være kunde_hos topdanmark når der_er gået max et år .
negative	after waiting over a week for my order i received an email_saying the status had been changed due to the product being discontinued .
negative	not even a hint of an_apology out of courtesy .
negative	if you are thinking_about buying anything from this company .... forget it terrible company sent me a faulty pair of headphones tried to contact them several_times .... no one ever picks_up the phone .... i did get a reply email but nothing was done about it .... i has_been 0_weeks and several_attempts to get a replacement or refund with no joy .
negative	still_waiting for a solution from them !

negative	i ordered a pair of shoes from ebay .
negative	myhermes was the courier service used , the shoes did not arrive .
negative	myhermes said " our courier posted the packet through your letterbox ."
negative	the shoes were packed in a box and would never fit through the letterbox !
negative	this company uses casual delivery drivers .
negative	hiring a ' man with a van ' is how the business is run .
negative	the delivery driver clearly helped himself to my parcel .
negative	unlike_other_reviewers here who have had awful service from myhermes , i am in the fortunate position of running my own pr business , i will be contacting all of the myhermes directors and will then relate my experience on every social_media and forum on the internet .
negative	i also have access to news agencies across the uk .
negative	myhermes have made the biggest mistake of their lives in crossing me .
negative	i will not tolerate such an unacceptable , awful service .
negative	______________________________________________________
negative	update_: i have already contacted two of their directors and their lawyers in west_yorkshire .
negative	i would advise those of you who have received shabby service to go on to the myhermes facebook account and relate your experience .
negative	i have done this today .
negative	i '_m awaiting payment to my account from chess_telecom .
negative	calls to chess ...
negative	march 00th : " you will get a refund at the end of march ."
negative	april_00th : " we '_ll look into it ."
negative	april 00nd : " we '_ll sort it out for you ."
negative	may 0th : " you will get payment by 00th_may ."
negative	may 00th : " you will be paid in 00_hours ."
negative	june_00th : : well look into it , and you call back " - they didn_'_t !
negative	june_00th : " we promise you '_ll be paid ."
negative	enough is enough !
negative	time to let david pollock ( chief exec ), stephen dracup ( man .
negative	dir .
negative	), barney phillips ( wholesale channel dir ), vanessa errington - beech ( corporate relationship_manager ) and andrea murray ( operation manager ) know what '_s going on in their organisation .
negative	i ’ ve just contacted the cheshire business leaders and cheshire community foundation , who were keen to hear about chess_telecom and the way they do_business .
negative	the chess chief_executive , david pollock , is a founder member of these two organisations .
negative	i have had a long conversation with both institutions and i have been given assurances that my complaint will be passed on to david pollock .
negative	if you have a problem with chess that is not being resolved to your satisfaction then contact these two organisations .
negative	believe me , the embarrassment felt by david pollock , will not only ensure that your grievance will be attended to immediately , but will lead to heads rolling at the heyes lane office .
negative	a tip_: never speak to the monkey at chess , if you can get through to the organ grinder .
negative	the man at the top of the organisation always gives a damn .
negative	the minions don_’_t .
negative	i am now going to hit every social_network site and internet forum to relate my experience with chess .
negative	barney phillips ( chess wholesale channel director ) and stephen dracup ( chess managing_director ) will be contacted via_twitter .
negative	they have , between them , 000 followers .
negative	i have almost 0 , 000 , so i ’ ve got a head start !
negative	__________________________
negative	since i posted this , earlier this month , i have received several enquiries from ' would - be ' customers ' of chess_telecom .
negative	the above experience with chess is only part of the abysmal service i received during the short time i was with them .
negative	the phone line was down ( including internet_connection and the card payment machine ) for three_weeks in the run - up to christmas .
negative	as you will understand , this time of year is always the busiest for retail_outlets .
negative	chess was not the least bit interested in getting me up and running quickly .
negative	i repeatedly made calls from my 0 mobile to the chess head_office .
negative	they promised to call back many_times and never did .
negative	each time i called i told them i was losing credit_card sales in the shop .
negative	they couldn_'_t give a monkey '_s .
negative	i spoke to several people at the office and always the same response - a negative one .
negative	i , like others who have posted complaints here , am very suspicious of the reviews telling us what good service chess give to people .
negative	by losing trade during the busiest time of the year , chess_telecom has ensured that i experienced a very difficult period in my business .
negative	was i compensated by chess ?
negative	of course not .
negative	i would advise anyone who is thinking of becoming a chess customer to think very carefully .
negative	i doubt very much that my situation was an_isolated one .
negative	having seen the great reviews relating to truematch000 i thought i ' d give it a go .
negative	so i signed_up for a three month membership .
negative	it all seemed good to start with then the penny dropped , the majority of the profiles are fake ( you only need to google the images that so called users have posted up on their profiles ).
negative	the site obviously uses a bot program to send emails to your inbox from women who are apparently interested in you .
negative	so i undertook a further test and completely changed my profile to something ridiculous - a 00 something man with a moustache , shoulder length hair and below five foot in height , with a very large build .
negative	yet the emails kept flooding my inbox - strange that women would find a completely obese and short gentleman even mildly attractive .
negative	some of the women that were contacting me were within the age range of 00 - 00 which i find extremely strange .
negative	do yourself a favour and stay clear of this scam and rip_off website , i '_ll be cancelling my membership as soon as possible and chalk it up to a lesson_learned .
negative	if it was possible to give the site zero starts i would .
negative	be warned and stay_away !
negative	well what can i say .....
negative	if the level of service i received from yankee_doodle , is anything to go by , then the service industry in this country is well and truly going to the dogs !
negative	city_link , the courier service used by yankee_doodle , attempted to deliver my parcel to a incorrect_address two streets_away from me - the yankee_doodle customer_services response to this was " mistakes_happen ....." this response left me speechless !
negative	- i have never ever_dealt_with a customer_services_department that lacks any form of intelligence , professionallism , and communication_skills .
negative	their utter dismissive attitude to the problem i had with my delivery , left me feeling completely infuriated , yankee_doodle do not know the meaning of customer service - their email replies always end with the quote - " we provide 000_% customer_satisfaction ".
negative	what a joke - yankee_doodle need to practise what they preach .
negative	their customer_services ( if that is what you can call it ), is apalling .
negative	use yankee_doodle and expect to receive the worst possible service - stay well away from them
negative	a non stick pan that lets food stick to it is pretty_useless , what a waste of money !
negative	i have placed 0 orders with charterhouse & thought the service was good however on my last order i received a damaged pump due to bad packaging ( the pump was placed in a box with 00kg of gravel with no protection ).
negative	i have been trying to get the pump replaced for 00 days now & despite_being promised a swap out nothing has turned_up .
negative	a retailer is only as good as the after care & in charterhouse '_s case that is awful .
negative	i set_up a vps with heart and in the same day discovered that the server backup costs were way more than i had imagined .
negative	i had moved from rackspace to save_money and now discovered it would be costing more , fair_enough its my mistake .
negative	i spoke to heart and they were happy to cancel the account which was great , unfortunately they refused to refund any money .
negative	the account had been open less_than a day and i had paid for a full year - so it cost me over £_000 for less_than a day '_s hosting .
negative	i would have been happy to pay for the days service i used or even a month , but the stance the took of charging for a full year really surprised me .
negative	companies with that kind of money_grabbing attitude do nothing to help their reputations and i will happily be staying with rackspace .
negative	it '_s been 0 days since i ordered now and i '_ve gotten in touch and had no reply from " customer_services " i wish i used a big well_known website and i will never make this mistake again !
negative	little point in going too far with this review .
negative	clearly all those before me have said it all .
negative	today i am listening to scottish_power answering_machine ..... 00_minutes so_far .
negative	and by the way if i do not get the situation resolved they are going to to take me to court for lack of payment !
negative	yes the collection agent threatening_letters are being sent - absolute_joke that companies can use bully boy tactics to enforce payments which are not even due and which you cannot dispute because they do not respond to any forms of communication .
negative	mattress is as_described .
negative	delivery badly_let them , down i had to wait three_days for delivery after been told it would be with me before 0pm on each day
negative	i spent over £_000 on a longines classique that lost time initially & had to be sent back twice .
negative	it then appeared to be working but nearly 0 years after buying it , the watch stopped completely .
negative	when i queried this with watchfinder , i did not get the courtesy of a response - i suspect that this is because the watch was guaranteed for 0 years only !
negative	i am now paying a local watchmaker £_00 to service a watch that i had much greater expectations of .
negative	i would not use watchfinder again as i have a feeling that they sold me a dud .
negative	i have cheaper watches costing far less that keep better time
negative	they are still trying to charge me for a service i have never had with them , they could not solve the problem i had and fed a line with phone and broadband into the wrong room in a shared house instead of my room , and now want to charge me for it i have never had a service from them only bills , customer service was bad very bad rude and kept passing me on to someone_else who passes you on again , rubbish company , i would never use them as long as i live .
negative	always finding a way to charge you more than original price you paid , was recently charged extra for baggage when i ask to see print out of weight on scales they refused so i had to take thier word for this , my bag was the same going with less comming_back but charged me more forced to pay i call this exstortion .
negative	i bought a boiler service from wowcher - the price looked fantastic .
negative	however the company booked my appointment twice and cancelled both_times at less_than 00_hours notice .
negative	then they asked me for direct payment , even_though i had already paid wowcher , saying wiwcher had not given them any money .
negative	they take over 0 days to reply to your emails .
negative	it is the worst customer service ever .
negative	i have requested refunds from groupon and living_social before and never had any issue , i cannot_believe wowcher can get away with their disgraceful service .
negative	i asked for a full_refund and am still_waiting as they take many days to reply to single emails .
negative	i will never , ever deal with this tinpot company again and hope that anyone reading this will take my advice and avoid them at all costs .
negative	stick to groupon and living_social - they actually value their customers
negative	these_guys are scam_artists !
negative	thought their prices were too good to be true but thought i ' d give them a go , what an_idiot i was !!!
negative	good never turned_up , now having to go through crazy chargeback process , which is taking for ever to get back .
negative	made a booking , ordered 0 coaches for my brothers wedding day and paid on that basis .
negative	on the day of the booking they sent 0 double decker and simply fobbed us off with some rubbish about the other bus breaking_down and having tried to contact us .
negative	this was unacceptable to us due to certain cultural issues ( women and men should travel on separate coaches as the men tend to be drunk on the way back from the wedding_reception ).
negative	now they refuse to refund us on the basis that only 0 coach turned_up and worse they keep changing their story as to why they feel they are not at fault .
negative	i '_m now taking this up with my solicitor as well as the confederation of passenger transport uk .
negative	you ( the public ) have been_warned !!
negative	!
negative	i hate amazon , i had £ 0000 voucher balance in my account and they closed it , the reason is i bought too much !
negative	i did buy some products for businss purpose , and no complain if they closed my account , the problem is they never return the money to me , i called them many_times , every time they said account specialist ( they called themselves specialist , funny ) will contact me in 00_hours , but i never got reply on time .
negative	after many attempts , one high ranking officials replied me , she said , amazon can not refund me , they will refund the money to the original owner of the voucher , i asked them , i got salary from my boss , if m & s refunds me and tell me , they will refund my boss because he paid me , is this funny , then amazon keep silence .
negative	a company does not pay any tax to uk government deserve bankrupcy in near_future .
negative	also their call_center is based in india , very rude .
negative	rubbish company
negative	they closed my account without_any reason , i requested to transfer my isa to another bank , but they just closed the account .
negative	also charged me £_000 for early withdrawal of the saving account ( by their decision ).
negative	also hsbc online_banking is not safe , they do not use safe device , which caused lots of accounts hacked .
negative	very unhappy with the flowers i received they looked unhealthy the bunch was smaller than_expected and not worth the money at all .
negative	these flowers were for my wife so im very upset with the outcome .
negative	ruined day
negative	i had a problem with 0 orders not being delivered last_week and as a result as a goodwill_gesture i was to have a bunch of flowers delivered on monday 0nd .
negative	confirmation was received saying seranta had successfully delivered the flowers to my home . sadly yet again this was false and no flowers had actually been delivered . i am beginning to take this personally !!!
negative	0 orders all of which have gone_wrong
negative	failed to deliver items in time stated .
negative	paid extra , but all i received was excuses .
negative	used to only use myprotein then the deliveries were not showing up on time order after order so moved away to the protein_works which i '_ve been more than happy with .
negative	decided to give myprotein another go and low and behold an order which was supposed to show up today doesn_'_t .
negative	that '_s it no more orders now i '_ll stick with tpw all the time now .
negative	after_reading these reviews , we placed an order for furniture in january_0000 .
negative	it was advised delivery would be 0_weeks .
negative	we are now in the second week of april and have not received our items .
negative	we contacted the company in march and they advised us the container was in quarantine and that someone should have called us , they told us delivery would be by the 00th_march .
negative	they then contacted us to tell us the supplier had made a mistake with shipping and the items would be delivered by the 0rd of april .
negative	it ’_s now the 00th of april we have received nothing .
negative	they keep telling us that when the items arrive we will be very happy .
negative	well this is a review on the company and not the products .
negative	we would not shop with them again , they do not seem to get the point that we have paid them and now they are making us wait without a proper explanation or apology .
negative	in my opinion the customer service is not satisfactory nether is the explanation .
negative	i may well be blown_away by the furniture if it ever arrives , i do not think the furniture will ever make up for the delays and lack of understanding from the company .
negative	my advice , if you can get it somewhere_else , buy it there .
negative	nigel plant
negative	i '_ve no idea how to use lovefilm now .
negative	i always found the old website easy to navigate .
negative	this is a complete mess .
negative	i can '_t change the priority on a disk as it then causes an error and moves all the disks to different lists .
negative	i can '_t delete lists .
negative	i can '_t work out what films i can stream .
negative	i don_'_t know how to add new films .
negative	no customer service .
negative	absolute tripe .
negative	goodbye lovefilm , hello netflix .
negative	ordered two leather_sofas from them , was told they were in stock at the point of ordering .
negative	got a phone_call the day before delivery to inform_me they were not in stock ( they did not know until they went to load the van apparently ).
negative	i cancelled the order verbally and followed up with an email to their after - sales address .
negative	i had already had my old sofas taken_away and lounge carpet cleaned , so had to hurriedly obtain sofas from elsewhere .
negative	since the reason for cancellation was not a change of heart on my part , but a failure to fulfil on theirs , i took the view that their stated 00 day refund policy did not apply and asked for immediate_refund .
negative	this did not happen .
negative	i was due my refund on december 00th but did not receive it .
negative	repeated telephone_calls to their sales , after - sales , accounts , head_office , even their warehouse in manchester have failed and i have still to receive my 000_pounds back .
negative	nobody seems to know who is responsible for authorising or processing refunds , and answer machine messages are seemingly ignored .
negative	i '_ve left messages with people requesting call back from their ' accounts ' department on several_occasions but have heard_nothing .
negative	i spoke to stephen greenman and he personally assured me that he would deal with this and call me back , but nothing has happened with that .
negative	i am making time of the essence in our agreement , and if that fails then i will commence legal_action to recover my monies .
negative	in short , avoid !
negative	do not !!!
negative	repeat do not !!!
negative	take out a contract of any kind with this company , they will rip you off and threaten you as they have me .
negative	i had a 0 year contract with this shameful company which i duly completed and then asked them to unlock my iphone as it was perfectly ok and i intended to take out a sim only deal with another_provider .
negative	they said they would unlock it for a charge of £_00 . 00 which i reluctantly_agreed .
negative	after months of costly calls to an overseas call_centre the unlock has not been provided forcing_me to go to o0 for another contract and new iphone which is not really required at increased personal cost .
negative	orange said that they have unlocked my phone which they have not and i finally got through to the ee tech department the other day who confirmed it hadn_'_t been unlocked .
negative	the guy_who promised to come_back to me has also disappeared now .
negative	i am now being subjected to aggressive calls to my home number from a debt_recovery company called nco threatening allsorts of recovery action over the £_00 . 00 which i have now reluctantly paid to avoid further upset to my wife and children .
negative	the purpose of this review is to warn you against dealing_with ee / orange as they are dishonest , unreliable and will not_hesitate to bully you and your family should they need to .
negative	disgrace of a company , they should be closed_down .
negative	not only have i been lied to over unlocking my iphone_0s at the end of a 0 year contract they are now chasing me with menaces for £_00 . 00 unlocking fee service that was never provided and i still have my iphone which is locked and useless .
negative	if you are considering moving to these fraudsters ...
negative	don_'_t !!!!!
negative	!
negative	they are a disgrace .
negative	very misleading and terms of contract are shocking .
negative	do not take out a product or service with this company .
negative	i have since cancelled my policy
negative	i placed an order over the weekend for valentines_day with " courier track and trace " delivery .
negative	the order was accepted and i received a confirmation e_- mail but when i view my account the order has disappeared and i have not received any tracking_number at all ( you would have thought this was essential right ?).
negative	the item has sold out also so i '_m increasingly worried that they couldn_'_t fulfil all orders and just cancelled them .. live_chat was offline and they '_ve not responded to my e_- mails .
negative	ringing up the bank first thing and disputing .
negative	miss information , poor communication and a total_disregard for the customer .
negative	and the final_insult - the tyres have not been fitted correctly !!!
negative	not a good experience .
negative	will take my custom elsewhere next time .
negative	this must be the worst website design ever .
negative	you click on a shop , then it asks you to click on the " shop now "?
negative	i just clicked eg ebay , so why does nectar then ask me to click again on the eshop shop now button ?.
negative	so then you do , and it throws up the " shop now " button , so you click , and it throws up ( if you are lucky !)
negative	transferring you to ebay .
negative	i do not need to know i am finally being transferred to ebay when i already know i click on the ebay shop button at the start of this clicketty , clicketty click , click , click , click process !
negative	!
negative	there again , with so many clicks involved maybe nectar realise that they had better tell us all - that we are still on the ' right click ' - oops sorry , was that a left click nectar ?.
negative	yes nectar is all left clcik and not right :-) :-) lol .
negative	get it sorted please - google gives you a one click and your there .
negative	so why cant nectar ?
negative	how long does it take to learn basic html , and some basic java ?
negative	update - april 0th - after filling in the visa_card charge back forms , i now have my refund via visa - thank_you visa !
negative	!
negative	never will i buy from this shocking company again .
negative	if you buy from this company - i prey they have the goods in stock for you , cause if they dont - your in for a very , very long wait and do not expect a refund from simpy .
negative	update - now april - no refund given - have had to fill in a visa form to get refund - now witing for that to be actioned .
negative	update 00 / 0 /_0000
negative	warning - i have not recieved any refund from simply after a month !
negative	my bank are fully_aware of issues regarding simplye .
negative	the bank will be refunding my money - they have a large number of claims coming in from simply_electronics for refunds .
negative	i would advise you to steer_clear of this failing company and heed other warnings from former customers here .
negative	please read my original review here :-
negative	having already purchased an expensive panasonic tm000 camcorder from simplyelectrical in sept_0000 - and that was despite bad comment found here !
negative	!
negative	it arrived two_days_later and no_problems_encountered with that simple action of delivering on time and as promised !
negative	so .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	i decided to purchase a sony_ericsson experia arc phone from simplyelectronics on feb_00th despite all the bad comments .
negative	the money was withdrawn from the account immediately , so i assumed all was well especially since there were 0 in stock according to the website .
negative	( same number was showing for 0 days - i ' d been watching ! )
negative	by , and on march 0th , nothing had appeared ( a present for the wife ).
negative	i attempted to phone several_times but long_waits and still no pick_up , so i sent an email minutes later .
negative	the email was answered the next_day ( 0th ) stating a representative would be assigned to my case .
negative	in short stock was damaged .
negative	i sent another email quote : " i confirm that i would like to cancel this order please
negative	reason : no stock available from simply ".
negative	i applaud the service here because she stayed on the phone until she saw this email arrive and was then able to action it .
negative	this was all done on the 0th_march .
negative	its now march 00th and i still_haven_'_t seen any refund to my account .
negative	q ) why not tell me from the outset that these phones were damaged ?
negative	instead of having me wait patiently for over a week with no word .
negative	i don_’_t feel i should have been the one to contact them .
negative	q ) why is it taking so long to issue a refund ?
negative	this stinks of a company about to fold and that is speaking from experience over the years !
negative	this company had performed fine when its in stock and it arrives but if you have a problem don_’_t expect it to be sorted soon .
negative	having said all this - yes they offer the best prices and with that , comes shortcuts to get there .
negative	we all want the best price we can find - but it may come with a hidden cost as above .
negative	i '_m fairly confident i '_ll get my refund , either from simplyelectronics or via visa .
negative	shame they have just lost a wannabe loyal_customer on big ticket items .
negative	update_: now march 00th and another phone_call to them - i will be sent an email with refund status and estimated time when refund will arrive - told this will happen in one hours time after giving them a light grilling about their negative on - line feedback and questions about companies financial status .
negative	person was very polite and explained company is not about to go under .
negative	have just checked email - still_waiting after several hours now :-(
negative	00 / 0 /_0000 - i will update anxious buyers / prospective_buyers .
negative	00 / 0 /_0000 - update after 0 hours :-
negative	" apologies for the hold up in refunding your order .
negative	your refund request was s_ubmitted to our relevant_department .
negative	please allow an extra few_days for us to process your request .
negative	it can take up to 0_weeks on occasion for the refund to be initiated due to current processes we have in place .
negative	you can be assured that once refunded you will receive a courtesy email from us informing you of the credit .
negative	thank_you for your understanding thus_far and we look_forward to completing your refund soon .
negative	best regards ,
negative	robin
negative	customer service executive "
negative	will update everyone again when i see if they hold to their word - or not !
negative	00th_march update and re - rating co . to 0_stars from 0_star :
negative	no e_- mail - no refund .
negative	.
negative	which was originally supposed to arrive on 00th or 00th of march aftera phone conversation with them .
negative	still_waiting_patiently after 0_weeks !
negative	coincidentally - i bought this new phone from amazon with pure piece of mind and no_hassle .
negative	wife very happy .
negative	i '_m not :-(
negative	tiles are great , but service not exactly_what i would expect from a company wanting repeat_custom or good reviews through word of mouth .
negative	driver said they don_'_t take tiles into your home , have to leave them kerbside .
negative	so my 00 year_old mother with bad arthritis had to carry them in one by one .
negative	poor service for the money paid .
negative	i feel_conned by this company because even_though their invoice clearly_states that i have been charged for design according to them this only means i have rented the design and cannot use it again without paying for it again .
negative	other printers i have spoken to and given further orders to , tell me the design i have paid for is mine to use foc in the future .
negative	it annoys_me even more that for the same price i paid for 0000 copies of one side only a0_leaflets from leeds i got 0000 double_sided a0 from a local printer and full use of design in future .
negative	it didn_'_t help me that leeds told me they would tell their hq to tighten up their description , i am seriously_considering contacting_trading_standards over this matter as other people must have experienced same problem .
negative	i was happy at first with digby_brown until weeks into my claim i called for an update was told that the registration_number i had supplied to be wrong .
negative	after a few minutes on the phone the lady realised she had written the wrong registration_number on the letter to the third_party insurance company which had held my claim up for several weeks .
negative	eventually my claim was settled only after me pestering digby_brown with email after email .
negative	i was then told my cheque had arrived & that i had to wait_until they banked my cheque & it cleared then they would raise me a cheque 0 working_days_later i sent a few emails asking why i couldn_'_t get my cheque only to be told it was ready for collection .
negative	i picked my cheque up only to find that they did not need to bank my cheque the cheque was from the insurer straight to myself & was dated over a week previous so there was no need for them to hold my cheque .
negative	i would not recommend digby_brown as i have lost £ because of the hold up with my cheque i had to pay a £_000 excess due to no fault of my own with a seriously_ill partner & 0 kids it was not easy being without that sort of money .
negative	i wrote a negative_review of a courier company , and had to provide proof of purchase which i did twice , and trustpilot reinstated my review , the whole_process took 00 days .
negative	i then edited my review for the same company , adding the comment that i expected my negative_review to be challenged , which it was , so my review cannot be seen .
negative	i again provided proof of purchase , on 00 th may but have had no reply from trustpilot .
negative	after the first time my review was challenged the courier firm in question received 00 positive_reviews in 0 hour , which to me looked like fakes , these have since been taken down , though i have had no confirmation from trustpilot as to wether they were fake .
negative	the whole system is flawed as the courier company consistently challenges negative_reviews hoping to get them removed , but never replies to customers on review sites . trustpilot are just helping them to hide negative_feedback
negative	we accepted a quote for a house removal , and paid a deposit of over £_000 , our chosen courier did not contact us , when we contacted him , he said he was sorry but he had a lot on .
negative	we ended_up hiring a van and doing the job ourselves , but shiply will not refund our money .
negative	we have seen other reports of this happening , and also a report from the advertising_standards authority criticising this policy .
negative	our house removal is still listed on shiply '_s website as succesful , but it was definitely not succesful for us
negative	our delivery number was item id_0000000
negative	having posted this review shiply asked trustpilot to verify that we were genuine shiply customers , which we did .
negative	it is obvious that shiply are challenging all negative_reviews in the hope of having them removed .
negative	shiply are happy to stand by their no refund policy , and it appears on their homepage , in faint lettering , this is in response to an asa ruling stating that this policy should be made more obvious to customers .
negative	it will be interesting to see if this edited review is challenged by shiply
negative	as expected shiply have challenged this review again , surely it would be better to sort problems out rather_than trying to hide them
negative	took laptop for repair and constantly fobbed_off until recieving call from owner saying my computer had been stolen off the counter and that it happens quite_frequently with all the low lifes on the rushden high_st ( there words not mine ).
negative	intermouse are the only low lifes on the high_st , no contact from them to fix situation and now in hands of police and trading_standards avoid
negative	i put a very specific request in for mechanical parts .
negative	within 00_minutes i had a ' hit ' with a competetive quoted price .
negative	there was an 000 premium_rate number i had to call to check details , with no rate warning to tell you that it would cost you a fortune .
negative	i called it to see whether i could get the car breaker name - there was a lengthly recorded_message which i put down again after a minute or so .
negative	this company are scammers - do not touch them with a bargepole
negative	would advise that nobody use this company .
negative	it appears as though their depot staff deliberately damage items , and the company are fully_aware of these issues , but cannot be_bothered to address them .
negative	don_'_t even try to get your money back , as even items which you pay extra compensation for will " not be covered ".
negative	terrible customer service , and just look at all of these negative_reviews ; we can '_t all be wrong , surely ?
negative	!
negative	awful beyond description .
negative	go to the dealer .
negative	paid a lot of money for a wing that ended_up being a fake copy .
negative	save_yourself the trouble go to a proper supplier and get insurer approved .
negative	never again !
negative	a ruined xmas .
negative	stress .
negative	inconvenience .
negative	sleepless_nights .
negative	around £_000 on petrol ( approx . 000_miles to and fro ) and parts to self diagnose fault as requested by ccl .
negative	rude , ignorant staff .
negative	phone_calls .
negative	on hold for up to 00_minutes .
negative	letters to ccl director .
negative	contact with trading_standards 0 times for advice .
negative	need i say more ?
negative	bought a brand_new pc and windows o / s on 00 / 00 / 00 for the family as an early xmas_present , at £_000 it was my biggest single purchase for xmas .
negative	a few_days_later installed o / s etc .
negative	and noticed a major problem .
negative	failure to reboot , screen and pc ' freezing up ', beeping from tower unit and blank monitor and system was only showing 0 . 00gb of its 0gb_ram .
negative	as this pc came with a 0 year so called ' collect and return ' warranty i phoned ccl .
negative	i was told to return pc to them which i did on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	i had written everything down that was wrong and told the ccl tech .
negative	he took the pc for checking while i waited .
negative	he gave back the pc and said he had found a ram card not in correctly and had set the bios to read the graphics_card or something .
negative	i took the pc home and tried it .
negative	almost straight_away same problem was there .
negative	phoned ccl again , was told to return pc , which i did on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	this time they had the pc for 0 days and when i picked it up i was told a fault could not be found , although i was told that the ram had not been tested .
negative	which i found strange as the evidence so_far was pointing towards a ram / motherboard fault .
negative	it was suggested by the ccl tech that i try a new power_lead , keyboard and mouse to rule out any other cause of fault .
negative	he also showed me how to remove side_panel from tower unit and instructed me to try things he pointed_out in different slots if pc failed again .
negative	sourced a different power_lead , bought a new keyboard / mouse , my expense , tried things in different slots ( no doubt risking damage to pc or electrocution ) and the problem still existed .
negative	phoned ccl again !
negative	asked if they would replace ram or tower unit , they refused as they said they cannot find a fault .
negative	asked for my money back ( so that i could by a pc from elsewhere ) again a negative response .
negative	at this point i contacted trading_standards .
negative	xmas came and went .
negative	took pc back to ccl on 0 / 0 / 00 .
negative	wrote and posted a letter to director of ccl following trading_standards procedure after a 0nd phone_call .
negative	then on 00 / 0 / 00 got a call from ccl saying pc was repaired and they had found a faulty ram ....... what a joke !
negative	anyway , tried to arrange delivery but they failed to deliver on agreed day .
negative	director failed to respond to my letter with my given timescale of 0_weeks .
negative	so i contact trading_standards a 0rd time .
negative	this time i also emailed and rang ccl and quoted sales of goods_act_0000 and reconfirmed all problems i have had and that i will take matters further by contacting the bbc consumer programs and local newspapers on how i have been treated by ccl and how my xmas has_been ruined .
negative	this time i get a verbal apology from a manager at ccl and i am informed a new pc is being built for me .
negative	finally a day after all this i receive a brand_new latest spec pc .
negative	and its fault free so_far !
negative	still no word from the director as of this date 0 / 0 / 00 , and no way of compensation or out of pocket expense forthcoming yet either , not to mention all the stress and anxiety this has caused .
negative	stress , extra_expense , phone_calls , inconvenience , customer service non_existant , rude_unhelpful staff , buyers_beware !
negative	my son ordered 0 xmas gifts from fancy . com on 00 / 00 .
negative	they stated all three would be delivered next_day .
negative	one was delivered as promised .
negative	the other two were no shows .
negative	after a complaint about the 0 missing gifts fancy . com stated that the ' revised ' delivery date for the two gifts was 00th of january .
negative	now , on 0th_jan , they advise that one of the gifts is out of stock and money will be refunded .
negative	heaven only knows if and when the remaining gift will be delivered .
negative	they have ruined our family christmas .
negative	my son booked a flight with this mob , through a bunch of spanish con_artists called edreams .
negative	the ticket he bought turned_out to be non - transferable and non - refundable .
negative	this was not advised by edreams at time of purchase of the ticket , nor in the e_- mail they sent out .
negative	called austrian airlines in the uk and got a call_centre in ukraine .
negative	no way would austrian refund the ticket .
negative	no way would they ( olga & zoryana ) give me the name of a contact in the uk or vienna to write to .
negative	they would not even give me the name and address of their ceo .
negative	( btw his_name is jaan albrecht , office park 0 , vienna0000 , austria .)
negative	like most airlines that don_'_t ' get it '.
negative	they think it is better to hold on to £_000 for dear life , rather_than go out of their way to help someone .
negative	mustn '_t do anything to diminish the huge bonus the ceo will get next year , eh !
negative	?
negative	i ordered flowers on 00rd_december for delivery on 00th ( which apparently was available ) this is now 00th and i have contacted the company 0 times and not had a reply ( except automated_response ) and not had my flowers .
negative	will never even consider_using again , please do the same and do not use .
negative	i purchased a dovedale solid_oak desk form the swindon_store in april this year .
negative	if you order from this company you will know that you are not permitted to inspect your goods on delivery .
negative	on inspection it was hard to miss the badly_damaged door .
negative	i contacted ofl who promptly dispatched a repair man to refit a new door .
negative	imagine my dismay when he asked me to inspect his handy work .
negative	the door that was previously perfectly fitted into the frame was now some 0mm proud of the frame on the hinge side .
negative	the so called carpenter said he was unable to fit it any other way due to the pre_existing screw_holes .
negative	i contacted ofl who i now expected to pull out all the stops as i had been the recipient of two successive episodes of bad service from their company .
negative	instead , a somewhat off had & not to sympathetic lady form customer service phoned me to say that ofl had reviewed my photographs & decided to offer me £_00 compensation .
negative	i told them that £_00 will not excuse bad workmanship or bad service & ask what my options were .
negative	i was told that i could return the desk for a refund & re order if i chose to .
negative	i pointed_out that this option would leave me without a desk to work on until the replacement arrives .
negative	i was told that was ofl procedure .
negative	at this point i had a serious sense of humour failure & hung_up on the lady .
negative	in the end i went for a second repair to the door that was carried_out perfectly .
negative	why did the first carpenter not do the same ?
negative	can i add that the swindon_store staff were sympathetic but their hands were tied by ofl procedures .
negative	my impression of ofl is of a company offering good quality items but not backing them up with good quality service .
negative	my order was lost in your system and i had to phone to chase up !
negative	!
negative	i have never in my life dealt_with a company so disinterested in dealing_with a problem .
negative	i have had a fault now ( dead line and no broadband ) for over a week and every time i contact them they say ' your fault has_been escalated ' i they escalate it any more it will end up on the moon !
negative	they have now said it will be another 00 / 00_hours !
negative	0 days by then !
negative	avoid them like the plague !
negative	ordered a couple of sofas , delivery to be 0 - 0_weeks .
negative	after 0_weeks , i contacted them to ask when i could expect delivery , only to be told that they couldn_'_t deliver at all and they ' d have to cancel the order !
negative	not only was i disappointed that the order couldn_'_t be fulfilled , but i had to wait 0_weeks and instigate my own query before i knew what was going on .
negative	this is unacceptable .
negative	i '_m now waiting for my refund - if it '_s not forthcoming , i shall definitely be taking them to court ....
negative	my advice , stay well clear of this ( at best ) incompetent company !
negative	disgusting service , 00 days_later item is not delivered and wont give a refund because " i still used the service "
negative	obviously mistakes_happen in parcel delivery - but it truly shows what a company is like by how the deal with the mistake .
negative	either my hermes is really bad - or quite_simply their customer advisors need some good training .
negative	pros_:
negative	excellent online booking engine , very easy ordering_process
negative	sometimes they offer cheaper rates than other_sites .
negative	one of only a few sites that allows you to book multi city flights .
negative	cons_:
negative	customer service is terrible - they are not really geared_towards frequent travellers with complex itineraries so when things go_wrong or you need to make last_minute changes to your plans don_'_t expect much help from expedia .
negative	when you do finally get through to their customer service agents they are very difficult to understand due to their strong accents and they read everything from a script , it feels_like you are conversing with a computer .
negative	if you are a frequent_flyer and need them to take care of communicating your membership numbers , seat preferences etc .
negative	to the airline - forget it , despite several phonecalls to get expedia to process my sas eurobonus number properly on my flight_bookings , they still_haven_'_t managed to work it out .
negative	another very annoying issue is they take around 0 - 0 months to process a refund if you have to cancel a ticket - this is very naughty and they tend to hold on to your money until you chase it - my impression is if you don_'_t keep asking them for the refund , you will never get it .
negative	it seems that they put 000_% of their customer service effort into the initial ordering_process and they don_'_t really give a damn once you have paid .
negative	due to these problems , i have stopped using expedia for travel bookings , which is a shame because i like their website and booking engine .
negative	after ordering a pair of expensive headphone from them , less_than 00_minutes later i realised they were the wrong ones , despite the description saying differently .
negative	because of this i requested a cancellation which could not be processed 00_minutes after i ordered .
negative	due to this i had to wait for the product to arrive from france , only to refuse it and send it back - a waste of everyones time .
negative	in the middle of all this , i was trying to tell them that this product wasn_'_t described properly and that they should change it .
negative	each reply was a half - assed attempt and each time they told me i was wrong and that it was correctly listed .
negative	after 0 or 0 e_- mails they eventually accepted that the description was wrong and gave_me a poor_excuse for an_apology .
negative	to this day , the headphone are still listed incorrectly .
negative	do not buy from pixmania .
negative	ever >
negative	beware of this company , shows on screen they have stock when they havnt , they take your money still and i '_m still_waiting to get it back 0 days_later ...
negative	ordered and paid for two tyres online , only to have an email_telling_me the tyres i ordered are not available , and the only alternatives were £_00 dearer .
negative	just trying to rip people off !
negative	!
negative	... ' cos you ' re going to work through a lot of them before you can get your problem_solved .
negative	that '_s the only reason we went instead to the post_office , where the ' phones are answered properly and promptly !
negative	expedia has the worst service i have ever_experienced .
negative	i was due to fly out from london_heathrow at the time they were affected by the snow .
negative	heathrow were advising people not to travel to the airport howeer expedia had a different option and seemed to be the last to know that flights have indeed been cancelled .
negative	tried to check in online at 0pm at which point i was informed my flight had been cancelled however expedia only acknowledged this at 00pm after a number of very lengthly phone_calls .
negative	for the small saving use another operator which will provide better service .
negative	i used them for a long weekend , left the car there and the keys , came back to a deep_scratch to the rear_bumper .
negative	i '_m 000_% sure it wasn_'_t there when i left it as it was a recently_purchased car and i ' d checked it over .
negative	i informed them before i left and they said they ' d be in touch once they ' d reviewed the photos that were taken when i entered the car_park .
negative	after 0 days they contacted my by email_stating there t '_s and c '_s about acts of nature .
negative	i emailed back and they said as they couldn_'_t prove that it wasn_'_t there before they weren_'_t held liable .
negative	never going to use this car_park again apart form being very unhelpful with the damage the car_park is a quite a distance away form the actual terminals and you end up having to wait for them to leave which we ended_up waiting 00_minutes to leave even when no one else was on the trip with us .
negative	i am now nearly in the 0nd week of order and still_haven_'_t received my order .
negative	there is no way to check on line so i have emailed the company and still have not received a reply .
negative	i want my money back as i am fed_up of waiting .
negative	wanted to make_sure i had my support for a half marathon on sunday looks_like that won_'_t happen .
negative	will never use the company again .
negative	before placing an order ( no .
negative	000000000 ) in may this year , i called there sales_team to confirm when the product would be delivered as i had read a lot of bad comments re meeting their commitments .
negative	i was promised in this call that a ship was due to arrive on jayne 00rd with my products on board ready to be delivered within 0 - 0 days .. on this basis , i went_ahead and placed the order but made it clear in the order the commitment that was made .
negative	i called again about 00 days ago and was assured that one of the two products was already in stock and the other was on its way and would be with them in the 00rd_june .
negative	i heard_nothing since and therefore decided to call them today .
negative	i am now told that the products will not be in until august at earliest .
negative	you can_imagine my fury with this news especially as half the summer has already gone .
negative	in this basis i decided to cancel my order and get a refund .
negative	vicki has very kindle agreed to email me today once the credit has_been processed and the credit should be with me within 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	please do not trust anything that anyone tells you in rattan_direct as they are clearly lying to their customers .
negative	i ordered two pillows on 00 - jan - 0000 .
negative	they said that they need 0 days to deliver them .
negative	today is 00 - jan - 0000 and i didn_'_t hear from them .
negative	i called them 0 times and every time they told next week .
negative	currently , nobody_answers the phone !
negative	!
negative	i ordered a chair on friday 00 - jan - 0000 .
negative	they called me next_day to inform_me that the product is out of stock and that they will receive new stock on monday .
negative	the customer service agent assured me that i will receive it on tuesday .
negative	i called them on tuesday and they told me that they did not receive new stock yet so i have to wait_until the end of the week or until monday , so apparently they don_'_t know when .
negative	this company is out of credibility .
negative	this is not how a respectful companies do_business .
negative	p . s : i posted this review on their website but unsurprisingly they did not post it and make it visible to other customers .
negative	they only post 0_stars reviews and this supports the incredibility claim .
negative	i have had issues with dpd before where they have delivered to the wrong_address and just left the package on the doorstep .
negative	i gave them the benefit of the doubt as there are 0 properties with the same house number .
negative	however , on my most_recent delivery , i was very clear about the location .
negative	they still attempted to deliver to the wrong_address .
negative	when i tried to call to resolve this , there seemed to be no way to speak to a human .
negative	i used the website to just arrange_collection rather_than have another failed delivery .
negative	when i went to the local_depot , there was a small door resembling a fire_exit for collections ( at_least the entrance for the staff looked nice !).
negative	i pressed the buzzer no less_than three_times with no answer .
negative	eventually , after_speaking to someone at the staff entrance , they finally let_me in .
negative	all in all , i think it '_s a terrible service .
negative	i ordered an ipod fm_transmitter on 00th_july_0000 .
negative	after no sight nor sound for a week i emailed them and got the typical automated_response .
negative	i emailed again , same response .
negative	i read the reviews and decided i was going to lose out one way or another so i bombarded them with an email every three hours or so in large text and started then on the complaints @ datakits . co . uk .
negative	they have not replied but my item has now been dispatched ... despite telling them i want a refund .
negative	lets_see what turns_up first ... my item or those flying pigs i ordered off amazon where i should have gone in the first place .
negative	having been a loyal and very good customer for over a year now , putting good volumes of business through interparcel - i was really annoyed and miffed when there was an i . t .
negative	problem where there site suddenly decided it didn_'_t recognise our postcode as a collection address - having phoned interparcel and spoken to numerous people who suggested various things which didn_'_t work - nobody really seemed particularly bothered - my last dealings with this matter , a supervisor promised to phone me back to sort it out after supposedly going away to look into in more depth - they never did .
negative	their loss - i am now putting all my business through another company - interparcel have lost £ 0000 '_s business through me alone - if this is the way you look after customers when things go_wrong you don_'_t deserve to be in business
negative	contracted ecologicliving ( carlisle ) to provide 0 seperate biomass systems ( both ' turn key ').
negative	one a 00kw pellet ( one property ) and the other a 000kw wood chip system to provide hot_water and central_heating to 0 properties .
negative	the 000kw project was suposed to be finished by christmas 0000 .
negative	whilst we expected some minor teething_problems , we did not envisage such a delay to completion .
negative	the project is now 0 months , and counting , overdue ( both projects not actually complete - 0 properties still do not have central_heating ).
negative	the company showed us no detailed plans ( scale drawings rather_than schematics ), nor a project works plan ( pert / gantt chart ) and we ( the customers ) have found ourselves being resident site managers ( having to explain to workmen what is required and check the standard of work carried_out ).
negative	we also have to constantly ring the company to ask for various jobs to be completed .
negative	we then get promised that workmen will turn_up on a certain day and , guess_what , they don_'_t show and we get some lame_excuse .
negative	this shocking service is not just a one off it happens every week .... we ask , they promise , it doesn_'_t happen !
negative	last_week , for instance , i got one man for less_than half a day .
negative	i am_hopeful that during this summer we might see some real progress ( i '_m holding my breath ).
negative	a positive_note would be that ecologicliving do install good quality boilers .
negative	advice to any potential customer would be :
negative	0 . ensure you balance the stage payments in your favour .
negative	financial pressure !
negative	0 .
negative	get a legally_binding ( set in stone ) completion date with draconian penalties for overruns .
negative	0 . demand regular site meetings ( have it in the contract ).
negative	will do a further update when project is actually near a satisfactory completion !
negative	after receiving 00 quotes for a seatbelt , i asked the top 0 best rated suppliers for a photo .
negative	none of them were able to provide this , and so i was loathe to part with my money .
negative	i followed the location map on the home page link in the confirmation_email to find where i should meet the cruise boat and found that , although i was there in plenty time , the boat did not leave from that location .
negative	on speaking to another cruise company nearby , i was told that the boat did not leave from the location in your map and i would not be able to get to the proper location in time .
negative	i therefore missed the cruise .
negative	i requested that i be refunded the euro00 that i paid through the website as i missed the cruise not through any fault of my own but due to the wrong or misleading location information being displayed on the company website .
negative	although the link has since been corrected , no refund has_been receive although i '_ve been querying this for months .
negative	thank - you mr cameron for selling the royal_mail for sod all !
negative	now we have to hope and pray we get our paid for mail .
negative	roll on 0000 !
negative	the damage you have caused this country while in government needs never to be forgotten , school children need to be taught about your time in office , the sad story should be told by generations so the mistake never happens again .
negative	you should be consigned to the history books forever .
negative	why is the postage so slow ?
negative	im damned if im going to pay nearly_£_00 quid a year for their super - dooper next_day service !
negative	holding costumers purchases to ransom like this isn_'_t right !!!
negative	!
negative	not happy !
negative	no contact number , tracking_numbers don_'_t work , two delivery dates missed and still not in possession of the package sent on the 00th !!!
negative	utter_rubbish don_'_t use
negative	how can i review when my order hasn_'_t arrived , when goods get despatched via parcel_force from london they normally arrive the following_day .
negative	so they have not been despached as you say they have been or they have gone_missing , irrespectively you still owe me two bottles of bundy .
negative	terrible attitude & extremely offensive .
negative	i waited a matter of days for what should have been a simple answer regarding the acceptable weight for her plyometric box , once finally answered with a belligerent response i proceeded to purchase only to find she had increased the price by 00_% simply because i had shown an interest .
negative	when i confronted it about this she refused to answer and totally_ignored my continued messages .
negative	selfish greed has lost you sales and i advise anyone not to purchase from this seller !
negative	you zoe bull ( littlebull - tarwbach ) zoevictoriabull @_btinternet . com seller '_s id : mckennzie00 notorious ebay thief !!
negative	the whole idea of ebay is that you the seller should make some attempt to send out the goods and not take the money then make no attempt to send anything other than abuse !!
negative	fortunately paypal refund money that corrupt sellers like you attempt to steal even_though it did take some months for the refund !
negative	justice was served !!
negative	and now publicly
negative	just an awful company to deal with .
negative	suffered from missed_collections before ( they have a system whereby if a parcel isn_'_t collected - they never tell you or update you on this - there '_s a loophole where the courier may ( but probably_won_'_t ) come another day , or you could rebook it and wait for your refund .
negative	this grey_area can take days .
negative	on top of that , i '_ve recently made a claim for an item sent with insurance that has_been damaged in transit .
negative	they dismiss my claim out of hand stating ' packaging not adequate ' despite having no photo '_s of the item .
negative	did i get a refund on my postage_costs and / or my insurance fee back ?
negative	no .
negative	i '_ve basically paid extra to have peace of mind but with no cover at all .
negative	they are judge and jury , and in this instance have cost me a customer '_s future order and tarnished my online reputation .
negative	if you value service i ' d look_elsewhere - yes the customer service is good overall when chatting with someone online , but once your item is in the hands of the unbranded local ' man with a van ' don_'_t rely_on any sort of compensation .
negative	instead you '_ll be out of pocket once you '_ve made your refund .
negative	as a footnote , i used parcelmonkey instead of these_cowboys for my most_recent parcel .
negative	instead of the 0 - 0 day yodel / myhermes service i ' d normally use with p0g i got a citylink 00 hour service for the same price .
negative	it '_s worth shopping about ...
negative	the flowers i received were nothing like the photo on their website .
negative	i sent in a complaint with side - by - side photos of the flowers i received versus the flowers on their website , demanding a refund , however their " head florist " allegedly looked at the photos and didn_'_t think there was a problem .
negative	i honestly think that a £ 0 bunch of flowers from the supermarket would have been much_better_than the £_00 bunch i was sent by prestige_flowers .
negative	we purchased tickets for a yankees game , did not get contacted to collect our $_000 + order .
negative	no one to talk to at cheaptickets .
negative	no contact email of the seller provided .
negative	no tickets !
negative	called the company multiple_times , but they are closed .
negative	game is today .
negative	not cool !
negative	cheaptickets - the internet is a 00 / 0 online marketplace .
negative	you are selling tickets for flights , events etc_., you need to have customer_support at all times ...
negative	would have used smiley hippo for the holiday black sea cruise photobook but got hit with a groupon deal for printerpix just as we got back from a holiday .
negative	has about 0_weeks to use the coupon and ended_up going in to work at 00pm to finish the 000 page album off .
negative	so stressful !
negative	the software is not easy - defaults are poor with very large fonts , preferences are not remembered and it just took soooo long .
negative	very excited when it arrived ... and so disappointed !
negative	on 00_% of the pages the background image has not been faded to the 00_% that the preview confirmed i had done .
negative	the text is unreadable and the images merge into the background .
negative	taking the website and platitudes about ' customer service being important ' at face value i emailed them monday 00th_september .
negative	nothing .
negative	sent a reminder yesterday - nothing .
negative	even with the groupon this has cost around £_00 and i '_m just not happy .
negative	avoid this company guys !
negative	ps - i notice that printerpix have stopped_responding to reviews on trustpilot ... that should ring warning bells !
negative	update oct0th
negative	sent the album back yesterday .
negative	got an email tonight calling me a liar !
negative	said i had altered the project after_submitting it for printing and offering me 00_%_off a reprint ...
negative	i am almost in tears .
negative	a 00 year_old bloke .
negative	a liar ?
negative	i went back on the website just to check and yes , i '_m right , on the site and preview it looks fine .
negative	are they serious ?
negative	i altered 00 pages after ordering ?
negative	why ?
negative	why on earth would any serious company tell their customers that they are liars ?
negative	update 00 / 00 / 00
negative	well , if i could reduce the rating to ' zero_stars ' i would !
negative	after_hearing_nothing i emailed again and got the very person_who had said that i had altered the order .
negative	he agreed to reprocess the order free of charge (£_00 so_far - wasted - of course it should be foc !)
negative	i rechecked the order , ran a preview on it and videoed the entire operation to make_sure .
negative	then rang printerpix to place the order .
negative	got the same gent again .
negative	still on video i placed the order and he confirmed that it would be processed and checked before despatch .
negative	that was on 00 october_0000 .
negative	today is 00 november and yes - nowt !
negative	nothing heard at all .
negative	no call , no email - no nothing .
negative	yet they are still being promoted via_groupon .
negative	groupon , of course , are not easily_contactable .
negative	i '_ve emailed a reminder .
negative	will update if anything happens .
negative	in the meantime - avoid this company like the plague !
negative	update 0 december ..
negative	yep - it has taken this long for printerpix to get a replacement back to me !
negative	and yes - it '_s exactly as poor as before !
negative	except this time i '_ve got video of the entire ordering_process including the website preview showing a perfect book .
negative	oh - and their promise to check it before despatch !
negative	so now i can prove that i didn_'_t lie to them and i can prove that they make empty , worthless promises !
negative	i have written to groupon and will be making lots more waves .... please do not trust anything important ( like photos ) to this bunch of miscreants .
negative	try smiley hippo - their software works !
negative	bought a nice new yellow nokia_lumia_000 on the new ee_network , for 00_hours i couldn_'_t receive or send texts , check emails , data wasn_'_t working , i contacted ee and they said phones0u hadn_'_t set the phone up properly or registered it correctly !
negative	when i rang up phones_0u , i couldn_'_t stand the woman in whatever country she was in , i might aswell have spoke in dutch !
negative	i won_'_t ever use phones0u again , oh_yeah ....
negative	i also never received my free wireless charging pad as promised on their advert !!
negative	a big let_down !
negative	took_ages for delivery to arrive and the product was not much good
negative	flight times changed , not informed missed flight , whole holiday ruined .
negative	no response to complaint email even after there stated 00 day responce time .
negative	no contact telephone_number for customer_services listed and when you do call asking for legal department , management or cheif executives office you get nothing only someone will be in touch and a point_blank refusal to help !
negative	book with someone_else evasive nasty and slippery i won_'_t be back not to be trusted !
negative	been plagued by text_messages_confirming delivery slot and date on 0 seperate deliverys .
negative	once item was late and missed time_slot by 0 hours and on 0 occasions arrived the day after stated delivery date !
negative	ii ' d give them a miss !
negative	ordered stuff from them as they did next_day delivery and local_stockist was out of stock .
negative	guess_what so were they .
negative	no contact , no offer to part deliver .
negative	i had a competition so went elsewhere .
negative	asked for a refund four times .
negative	have had to go through paypal to sort this out .
negative	still no response .
negative	in a nut_shell if you have paid by cc or dc your in trouble .
negative	avoid .
negative	you have been_warned !
negative	where do i start ?
negative	i would like to say that it takes a lot to make me write a negative_review about a company , but kwik_fit have persuaded me to do so with their abysmal service .
negative	what does kwik means anyway ?
negative	!
negative	ok , here is my experience :
negative	i found that i had a nail in my back left tire and the tire although not flat , was running_low on air .
negative	visiting my sister in nottingham i decided to go to a company i heard of on tv / radio as i don_'_t know the city .
negative	i live in liverpool and to fix a puncture it costs between £_00_-£_00 .
negative	i arrived at kwik_fit nottingham - new bradford at about 0 :_00am and was told that i needed to wait for about 00_minutes before i can be seen / served .
negative	the guys were strolling around , some eating their breakfast ... after 00_minutes i was finally seen and my car was taken in .
negative	after a brief inspection , request of my personal details ( no idea why i had to give all this just for a puncture ) i was informed that my tire was irreparable and i need to buy a new one !
negative	now i am not much of an expert here , but a nail in the tire can be fixed quite easy right ?!
negative	i have dunlop tires , but the higher_grade ones ( not the cheap ones ).
negative	the guy didn_'_t even blink , he was hesitant that i needed a new tire , the closest one to mine conveniently cost £_00 . 00 !
negative	i don_'_t know about your car , but mine needs four tires to run , so i had no choice but to pay for it !
negative	now my invoice :
negative	it states that :
negative	my wheel has_been balanced = £ 0 . 00 ( was not balanced )
negative	i paid for nitrogen inflation =£ 0 . 00 ( whaaaaat ?!)
negative	valve =£ 0 . 00 ( if i knew i wold have given them the spare i have in my back pocket )
negative	eco tire disposal =£ 0 . 00
negative	now let_me assure you that at no point of my interrogation with the guy_who racketeered me to buy a tire , i was not informed that i will have to pay any of these amazing additional_charges .
negative	so , to sum it up , i paid £_00 . 00 for a puncture !
negative	my brother in law was persuaded to do the same thing few_months back at the same place by the way .
negative	please save your hard_earned_money by not going to kwik_fit !
negative	thanks for reading
negative	the company is awful , good luck to anyone returning faulty goods because the return_policy is not worth the paper its written on .
negative	i will not touch them with barge poll after my experience .
negative	better off spending money elsewhere with a more reputable_company that offers a decent returns / exchanges and doesn_'_t charge you a fortune .
negative	they are not competitive with some smaller products being up to 0 x the price of other_retailers like ebuyer or scan .
negative	the community forums are just full of very rude and patronising , egotistical , arrogant ( insert explicit word ) people .
negative	i was a member there before all my troubles started i am now leaving this place well alone .
negative	i ordered a microwave one saturday and it was delivered the next_day , which was fantastic .
negative	unfortunately it did not work .
negative	i phoned and emailed many_times .
negative	the unit was eventually collected 00 days after delivery and the refund was done 00 days after delivery .
negative	i think that '_s appauling customer service .
negative	ethan in particular needs re - educating in customer service .
negative	went to national to get my tyres_fitted on the day and time agreed .. got there and the tyres had not been delivered !
negative	so made another appointment for another day and time ... got there .. and same thing , no tyres .
negative	the national_tyre_fitters were great , but suitably very embarrassed about the whole_thing ... tyre_shopper on the other hand couldn_'_t have cared less .. i had to purchase more_expensive tyres in the end ... and funnily_enough they were in stock ..
negative	iam a motability customer , when i got there they said they was busy so would have to wait a hour , so i ask can they check there stock to make_sure they had them to save me waiting , they said no had to wait my turn so i did , 0 hour later they put my car on the ramp then walk of for a smoke came back checked tyres then told me they had none , what a joke , i ask the manger for is name which he refused to give it me told me the complaints will no is name ,, this was at bury new rd cheetham hill manchester , if they didn_'_t spend so much time working on there own car on the ramp they might of sorted mine
negative	stressful and rubbish .
negative	ordered for valentine '_s day , received an_automated style mail telling_me the delivery adress was incorrect (!?
negative	- it '_s the same standard high - street address as i use for everything else ).
negative	the mail asks you to contact serenata , but none of the three numbers in the email are live or working .
negative	go onto their website , same deal .
negative	none of the lines answer and all go to a dead tone .
negative	requested callback , none came .
negative	don_'_t risk it - bunch of flowers ?
negative	bunch of idiots more like .
negative	i ordered what i believed to be a beautiful_bouquet of flowers including a box of luxury chocolates costing_£_00 for delivery to my elderly_mother from her son on mothers_day .
negative	none of the aforementioned was delivered which meant that my mother actually received nothing on her special day !
negative	i have emailed serenata 0 times leaving both my email address & telephone_number .
negative	i have tried to get a phone contact number that works , so_far without_success .
negative	as off today no - one from seranata has contacted me to discuss this issue .
negative	i have therefore been unable to retrieve my £_00 if my experience is a reflection of how this company respond to there customers .
negative	then in my opinion they have no business being in the retail sector and are a poor reflection on there industry .
negative	i will never use this company again
negative	still_waiting on my cheque !
negative	item collected 00th due del 00th paid for texts none arrived left in dark don_'_t know if item on way or delivered etc
negative	ordered my items with this company as it said they had the items in stock .
negative	fantastic as i needed the items straight_away so i paid for fast first_class delivery .
negative	the following_day i received an email_saying the items would be a few weeks until they were in stock .
negative	unacceptable , why didnt it say they were out of stock when ordering .
negative	called the company to cancel order and when i tried to make a complaint to the operator on the phone i heard " oh for f_** k sake " said either by him or in the background .
negative	rediculous .
negative	placed my order on the weekend , it was a good price and dispatched the first working day , for delivery on the tuesday - which was excellent , or so i thought .
negative	received emails_confirming tuesday '_s delivery and updates via_text throughout the day , only to have the driver call me at 00 . 00 , an_hour and a quarter before the last delivery slot , to say he was going to finish now so wouldn_'_t be delivering it today after all .
negative	i was furious , i had made sure i had stayed in all day , so was not at all impressed .
negative	consequently , i had to get someone_else to stay in all day for me to receive the order for me the next_day .
negative	dreadful , dreadful delivery service .
negative	terrible company .
negative	left me red faced on mother '_s day .
negative	thanks
negative	they took all of my documents and then hassled me to sign a credit agreement .
negative	i left this for a bout 0_weeks to sign , just before deadline .
negative	then when i signed it they emailed me to tell me that documents i had previously sent them was not good enough proof of no claims bonus and were going to cancel my policy .
negative	but they made me sign a credit agreement first .
negative	i am reporting you to the fsa
negative	having bought and paid for items ... still have not received them .
negative	trust is gone .
negative	firms you deal with are rubbish ; as is your ordering system .
negative	don_` t deserve any stars and it probably wont let_me publish this
negative	only contact from music city has_been to confirm that order was placed .
negative	the order was placed almost 0_weeks_ago and as yet i have not received any confirmation that the order has_been processed or dispatched .
negative	i am beginning to feel that this is a bogus company .
negative	i understand that delivery time from u . s to u . k will be little_longer_than normal but i paid over $_00 . 00 for delivery so i am expecting better service than i already have received .
negative	if i get the goods before_christmas , i may use site again , if not then no way .
negative	this is a present for my wife .
negative	not happy so_far .
negative	0_star only coz its christmas time
negative	my parcel was not delivered to the correct address and not signed for by me - my name is misspelt according to the delivery e_- mail .
negative	should have been delivered to no .
negative	00 ( with 00 " high numbers on white background ) but instead delivered to no .
negative	00 ( very small 0 " high numbers ).
negative	waited in all day for delivery expected between 00 & 0 - parcel delivered wrongly at 00 : 00 !
negative	all other couriers have delivered correctly !
negative	so , i bought a guitar for £_000 including a case back in april , with a delivery date for 00th_june .
negative	i had the email , and was told the guitar would hopefully be for then , with any communication being given if there was any_problems .
negative	i ' d paid in full on the day and the money was taken out of my account .
negative	happy days , my dream guitar would be with me in two months .
negative	it got to the 00th , and i thought it a bit odd i ' d heard_nothing .
negative	no email for dispatch or nothing to suggest that there was any kind of delay .
negative	so i decided to ring to find out what was happening , and i '_m so glad i did ...
negative	had i not rang , i would not have known what was going on , or been in limbo .
negative	just unacceptable .
negative	apparently the guitar hadn_'_t even been dispatched and there was ' a delay ' at the suppliers end .
negative	right , so , they ' d had my money for two months and i ' d not had any communication whatsoever and i wasn_'_t getting the guitar on that day .
negative	i personally do not give a damn if the supplier has an issue , as you ' re the guys selling me the guitar , and it '_s your duty to inform your customers if there is going to be a delay , not keep them bloody hanging for two months with my money !
negative	by this point i was disappointed and starting to get angry , but then i started to lose my cool as there was zero hint of an_apology .
negative	moreover i got speil about ' oh well yeah this can happen '.
negative	i then got a call to say the guitar could be there by the beginning of august .
negative	' could be '?
negative	so , i '_ve had money out of my account for two months , zero communication only to be told i ' d have to wait at_least another 0_weeks .
negative	i then was trying to hold back going nuclear .
negative	' do you want to have a partial_refund and we keep a deposit '.
negative	' are you taking the piss !?'
negative	is what i thought to myself ?
negative	i ' d been waiting for this guitar as a belated birthday_present from friends and family .
negative	i just demanded my money back by this point .
negative	' these things can only happen ' is not a line to use in this context , no , no , as the seller , it '_s your job to keep your customers informed .
negative	if my company did that we would get so much abuse , and probably end up in hot_water .
negative	and the thing is , all i got was a refund , with zero compensation for wasting my time and having my money for those two months .
negative	absolutely_shocking !!
negative	my friends were all completed shocked , as gakk has always been seen as upstanding .
negative	quick to take my money , but zero remorse or help to resolve the situation .
negative	nah , for me , hell no will i ever buy from here again .
negative	this might be an_isolated case , but it took going to twitter to get things moving , whereby the senior sales_guy was the only one forthright to solve it quickly .
negative	it shouldn_'_t have had to happen in the first place !
negative	i didn_'_t shout and i didn_'_t give any abuse , even_though i was seething ; but that service was bordering just diabolical .
negative	i '_m_sure the guys are very nice and it '_s an ' honest mistake '...
negative	but as a seller , regardless of what issues the supplier has , do not take someone '_s hard_earned_money giving them a date of delivery , getting their excitement up , leaving them waiting to have nothing at the end of it but a complete_waste of their time and pathetic meaningless excuses !
negative	cheers for the refund , could have done something more useful with the money , but i suppose you did me a favour in making me save it ...
negative	might want to change your ' best service in europe ' mantra too ... would have had better service from my local corner_shop , and they don_'_t even sell guitars !
negative	purchased table and chairs about 0_weeks_ago .
negative	delivered quickly however found a number of defects : padding on chairs compressed through transportation , leather marked permanently because of packaging pressure , table_legs did not fit_properly , and chair marked from impact .
negative	it is worth_noting that the poor fitting of the leg was such that there was a complete 0 - 0 mm gap_between the top of the leg and the undersurface of the table .
negative	this was not just uneven finish of the wood .
negative	subsequently sat on a chair and it broke .
negative	reported the defects to customer service .
negative	customer service took longer_than promised to respond and sent technician to review furniture .
negative	technician arrived late , causing me to miss meetings at work and confirmed that leather which had been marked could not be fixed , nor could the table be fixed .
negative	stated that both would need to be repaired .
negative	chair had broken because wood used on seat was of poor quality containing a knot which weakened the whole chair seat .
negative	subsequently contacted by customer service , and told :
negative	0 ) my expectations of quality were too high for hand made furniture .
negative	apparently the verbal report that the technician had given me did not match the official report provided to the company .
negative	0 ) all defects other than broken chair were acceptable
negative	0 ) they would send out a replacement chair seat which it was implied i would then have to fit myself .
negative	if i did not accept this offer i could take a full_refund and they would take the furniture off me .
negative	in essence their statement is accept the defects or shop somewhere_else .
negative	i would have accepted replacement chairs or tables as i like the appearance , however this was not offered .
negative	the technician told me that the table , leather and chair were all defective however the customer service representative told me that these were normal , somebody is lying .
negative	i have subsequently been contacted by the company again who have accepted that they will replace the chair with the broken seat but confirm that the rest of the furniture is to their normal quality and this is what i should expect .
negative	i have visisted the local showrooms and non of the teables show similar defects .
negative	their showrooms are therefore mis_- representing the quality of the products they sell .
negative	still in discussions and planning to visit showroom to try and resolve situation , or else may pursue legal route .
negative	this company is horrific .
negative	the staff are horrible and don_'_t give a damn about you .
negative	i have bought there frequently over the few_years but recently due to new staff i will not be returning .
negative	the staff are unhelpful , lazy , you ask them a question they sigh .
negative	you ring them up to ask about an order they sigh down the phone and act like they don_'_t care .
negative	the pricing / website is also a joke .
negative	i went into the store two_days ago and spoke to a staff_member , we ordered myself a motherboard which is stated on the website as well as the manufacturing code - asus m0a00l - m lx v0 .
negative	when he printed out the collection receipt it said asus m0a00l - m lx which is obviously incorrect .
negative	( the v0 / revision 0 supports my 000w cpu unlike the original only supporting 00w ).
negative	i then asked_him to change it and make_sure i get the v0 version .
negative	he said okay , reprinted , we left .
negative	when i arrived to pick it up the next_day guess_what i received ?
negative	asus m0a00l - m lx .
negative	so i complained to him about receiving the wrong one , and guess_what he says to me ?
negative	' no this is the right one , it is the v0 version .
negative	you need to research your stuff before you buy it '.
negative	my god .
negative	i got so angry .
negative	the fact that he said a customer is wrong is just plain stupid .
negative	it clearly_states on their website , their manufacturing code and their own staff that i ordered a v0 .
negative	so i just couldn_'_t be_bothered , got a full_refund and bought it off amazon .
negative	the funny_thing is the original price i bought it for was £_00 right , i checked before i drove to the store , as i left the store i checked again to compare it '_s price to the one off amazon .
negative	guess how much it is now ?
negative	£_00 .
negative	they upped the price just as i left the store .
negative	maybe this isn_'_t a big deal to people but my advice is to stay_away from them .
negative	they are conniving , horrible people .
negative	i would happily pay £_00 + elsewhere for the same item .
negative	cclonline will be informed about this review haha .
negative	this is for the staff - i work security at hotels / bars etc .
negative	i carry around a pin camera on my jacket button incase there is any trouble .
negative	everything i have said in this review about the sighing and lazyness is all on tape .
negative	obviously the phone one is only a voice recording but have fun guys .
negative	i will be returning on the 00th which is my day off to complain to your manager and if he is unwilling to do something about this i will happily contact the corporate line to complain with proof .
negative	have a nice day .
negative	all i ordered was a filter and oil_change online .
negative	i had to make 0 telephone_conversations on the day to make it happen .
negative	" not on my computer mate , can '_t do it , you need to talk to head_office ", was all i got from the branch .
negative	no point ordering online then .
negative	i waited whilst they did the work , all ok .
negative	however , after driving away , i thought i had better check the level of oil .
negative	unbelievably , the level was about 0 inches above the marks .
negative	i returned to be told " it '_s ok mate , i put 0 litres in as specified .".
negative	so i made them take oil out 0 times before the level looked ok .
negative	according to vauxhall the engine only takes 0 litres .
negative	if the engine is damaged , i '_ll be back .
negative	beware , beware , beware .
negative	if you think you will be supported_by a so called high_street name forget it i bought a 0d mk000 which has developed a fault they are so deliberately evasive
negative	real chuckle brothers to canon to jessops so utterly unprofessional so un customer friendly , they answer the phone for a sale do they ring back when their is a problem
negative	no way !!
negative	you have to chase and chase better shop on ebay and take a less risk this company will go belly up soon just like comet big fire sale on its way
negative	the flowers were all damaged and the vase box crumpled how the base was in one piece i dont_know .
negative	the courier left a card saying the flowers were around the back .
negative	the gate was locked and the flowers and vase . were on the ground crumpled and looking a mess .
negative	they must have been thrown over the fence .
negative	its an_absolute_disgrace for this reason i will never use that courier or your company again unless you use a different courier .
negative	these flowers were for a bereavment and was shocking the eay they were delivered .
negative	bought a go pro camera from groupon on the 0th of june .
negative	money was taken on the 0th .
negative	item still not received despite the agreement saying it would be delivered in 0 working_days .
negative	groupon say that the item was despatched to royal_mail for delivery but have no proof of this .
negative	royal_mail have no evidence this was ever given to them by groupon .
negative	the customer service from groupon is shocking .
negative	i emailed them on the 00th of june to be told that they don_'_t know what has happened and would need a further 00 working_days to resolve the matter .
negative	after emailing them my dissatisfaction i was told " we do not have a resolution to your case ".
negative	when replying to this email asking what this meant , my email was completely_ignored .
negative	i finally sent a long formal_complaint email only to receive the " further 00 working_days " email again .
negative	a direct cut and copy from the email i received previously .
negative	on monday the 00th of june i spoke with a manager in the customer service department .
negative	how they can call themselves such a department is a joke .
negative	they have no facility to make phone_calls and they are unable to authorise refunds .
negative	so what do i do ?
negative	wait another 00 working_days apparently .
negative	and what will they be doing in the 00 days ?
negative	who_knows .
negative	not even the customer service manager was able to tell me what they will be doing or how this will be investigated .
negative	i '_m absolutely fuming and so angry with groupon .
negative	their customer service is non_existent , their response to emails are cut and pasted generic_responses .
negative	they don_'_t care about their customers and the fact that i am £_000 out of pocket and they '_ve had my money for nearly a month .
negative	i will never buy from groupon again .
negative	i will be spreading the word of my bad_experience and i will be taking_legal_action to recover my money along with compensation for my time , phone_calls and inconvenience this has caused .
negative	never never never buy from groupon .
negative	just bad service .
negative	when i spoke to them that just mentioned you can have your postage refunded .
negative	why state next_day if it is not .
negative	no understanding or apology
negative	absolutely crap for no reason they disconnected my phone gave the number to a new customer so i immediatelly stopped my direct_debit and got connected to sky .
negative	while i had no phone i lost orders from my customers totalling_£_000 . 00 .
negative	and now they have the cheek to demand payments totalling_£_000 .
negative	nobody got in touch to ask why id cancelled they are now just writing letters demanding payment .
negative	well really , my solicitor advised me to take this to court .
negative	ordering the item was easy and straight_forward but that was a week_ago since order was placed i have had no emails to advise twhat is happening so have no idea when the item will arrive
negative	a simple request to sort a problem out would have given them a high star_rating , if they could have been bothered
negative	this has turned_out to be a compete nightmare , which is the last thing you need , when trying to book a relaxing_holiday
negative	apologies if you ' re looking for a short , pithy review .
negative	this one is a catalogue of woe , brought about by a company which seemingly has no control over its systems or suppliers .
negative	therefore i am letting rip with both barrels on this incompetent crowd .
negative	imagine ; it '_s the run up to valentine '_s .
negative	what better way to tell your beloved of your love than to have a bouquet of her_favourite flowers delivered to your home .
negative	so you place the order .
negative	you give over your credit_card_details .
negative	they take your money .
negative	you receive the confirmation e_- mail_stating that their partner has accepted the order .
negative	you settle back and think " excellent - that '_s a great job_done and what a friendly , easy to use site ."
negative	and what a catastrophic disaster .
negative	i work from home , so was in all day on valentine '_s day .
negative	no delivery .
negative	" oh well " thinks i , " it '_s a busy day .
negative	they '_ll turn_up this evening - which is even better because my wife can answer the door and get the surprise first hand when she comes in from her work ."
negative	cue arrival home of wife after long day at work .
negative	cue anticipation on her_face .
negative	cue romantic dinner .
negative	cue highly anxious husband waiting desperately for doorbell to ring .
negative	cue absolute silence from said door_bell .
negative	nothing .
negative	nada .
negative	zilch .
negative	zero .
negative	no contact , no nothing .
negative	no email_apologising .
negative	eventually i explain the situation to my wife who is understanding , but nonetheless miffed .
negative	the next_day , i contact serenata_flowers and receive a reply very swiftly .
negative	they will immediately do nothing because they need to hear back from their partner .
negative	i demand my money back , but they give me the same response .
negative	that was 00th_february .
negative	it is now sunday 00rd february and as yet i have had no response .
negative	now forgive me for sounding very slightly cross .
negative	but if someone promises to deliver you a service and they take your money from you then i believe they have a duty to deliver that service .
negative	if they fail to do so , the least they should do is return your money .
negative	perhaps the criminal lawyers amongst you can tell me whether a failure to do either is theft or fraud .
negative	use this shambolic company at your own_peril .
negative	ordered watch in sale , 0_weeks_later they tell me sent to covent_garden store in error .
negative	said they would sent out last_week still_waiting .
negative	read other reviews they are true this unit grabs your cash then you are on your own !!!!!
negative	the watchhut you are rubbish .
negative	it also seems the internet site is a diff set_up than the shops so if things go_wrong the shop cannot help you !
negative	if any manager from this watch_hut reading this please get a grip of your staff , or you all will be out of a job .
negative	update 0rd sept just phoned covent_garden shop sending out today .
negative	0 .
negative	pick_up watch 0 . put in jiffy_bag 0 . take to post_office 0 . go for lie down
negative	so my parents take their car in for an mot ( pensioners ) and they get a phone_call saying it needed rear axle bushes …. i then rang to confirm this as its very strange for a car with 00k on the clock . they quoted £_000 to replace . took it to a merc specialist for second opinion . 0 technicians stood around the car laughing at the halfords assessment . they confirmed there was nothing wrong with the bushes and to prove this they would put it through an mot in their garage . i gave halfords the written report and a chance to rectify / explain ….. more backtracking and maintained that they needed_replacing . i then got the mot_test done at mercedes specialist and it passed with flying_colours . i have been advised to complain to vosa . the manager had his chance to put things right . halfords even tried to tell me that the car couldn_'_t have an mot at any other test station as it had now gone down as a failure .
negative	i have still not resolved the overcharging with this company , calling their phone help and u will lose the will to live .
negative	i have waited in for 0 separate days after receiving telephone_calls and txt_messages_confirming the delivery of an oven .
negative	i have spent hours on telephone speaking to advisers in very bad broken english , who really couldn_'_t care less - one being a manager who was rude and lied to me .
negative	he blamed the delivery company , despite a previous advisor who claimed very had an it error , who i ' d already spoken to and they had advised me they had received numerous phone_calls of complaint from very customers .
negative	if you are thinking of ordering from very - don_'_t , their service is appalling !!!
negative	spend your hard - earned_money somewhere_else .
negative	bought an archos 00 000gb internet tablet in february_0000 , which arrived the next_day at a good price .
negative	within 0 months the tablet was faulty and lemon digital were reluctant initially to deal with it .
negative	upon our insistence , after contact archos , they agreed for us to return the machine to them but that was 0 months_ago .
negative	when they do bother to return emails ( which isn_'_t often ) they make promises they don_'_t keep and after we contact archos direct 0_weeks_ago , they told us they ' d only just received machine .
negative	when we complained to lemon digital they told us it must be their ' returns_department '.
negative	despite disgusting service , lemon digital still_haven_'_t bothered to chase up our internet tablet and are still ignoring emails .
negative	buyers_beware don_'_t buy from this company they are shockingly_bad to deal with and i don_'_t know how they can carryon trading / lying .
negative	they did say we could make a purchase at cost price as compensation but i wouldn_'_t deal with them again if there were no other_companies on the internet .
negative	feeling totally let_down by car_trawler and holiday_autos .
negative	having used this company a number of times without problem , i noticed this year when booking that cartrawler appeared in the search page .
negative	not thinking anything had changed i continued to book a car .
negative	however the hire company chosen was not named until i paid with my credit_card .
negative	big_mistake !
negative	to make_sure that i was totally covered , i took out the recommended security_deposit , insurance .
negative	this is with allianz ,
negative	so no_worries then ….
negative	another big_mistake !
negative	!
negative	arrived in murcia to pick_up my car from a company called dickmans , should have realised , who on earth , would name their company , dickmans !
negative	their office is in a van , row three murcia_airport .
negative	trying not to pre judge the situation , i put my paranoia behind me and showed my cartrawler pre_- paid voucher .
negative	it was at this point that i started to feel uneasy .
negative	the agent took one look at my allianz insurance_cover and laughed !
negative	he would not accept this and stated that i would either have to pay £_000 deposit , directly_into his bank_account , returnable 0 to 0 days after return , or take out their own insurance at £_000 .
negative	well common_sense should have told me to walk_away , but this being murcia_airport , with few facilities , i was intimidated into accepting the situation or walking .
negative	another big_mistake !!
negative	!
negative	having paid up , stating i was not happy , an employee then took me to the car and in a whirlwind after making me sign an inspection form , made his exit .
negative	no real chance to establish the cars faults , i photographed each elevation of the car and drove some 000kms to our destination , upon which we found there was no hi_viz jacket , emergency triangles or first_aid kit , which are all mandatory in spain .
negative	i tried_ringing the contact number on the paperwork , but no answer from the company .
negative	you ’ ve guessed it ………….
negative	on return i again photographed all elevations and returned the keys to a hole in the back of the van , things were looking up , there were now 0 pallets stacked up , for customers to reach , the service window .
negative	i am still_waiting for my deposit , to be returned , in the meantime i have contacted my credit_card company , who will act for me and tried to contact cartrawler through their complaints website , which allows you to upload your written complaint , but not supporting_information , although it states the info , has_been successfully updated !
negative	i have always used holiday_autos in the past , but since cartrawler have been involved , i believe you have little redress , the company clearly knows there are issues with dickmans , ( see dickmans rent a car , reviews on tripadvisor ).
negative	incidently , taking out the recommended extra security_deposit insurance with allianz , is a total_waste of time , because unless dickmans actually states the car is damaged allianz will not want to know , best thing to do is crash the car into their van , you should then be able to claim !!
negative	!
negative	its such a shame that a relatively reliable company should be let_down by the antics of cartrawler and its car_hire partners .
negative	will post again if i hear_anything , positive or negative .
negative	bought an item , paid for it and then received an email all was going through , to get another the day after apologising that the item had already been sold , did get a refund but was my 0st time of buying anything from cg , not a very good advert at all
negative	my declared dimensions were correct for the entire package .
negative	i can prove that my dimensions were correct for this shipment .
negative	as i said in my last e_mail to your customer_services i have photographic_evidence .
negative	where is yours ?
negative	my drive unit repair kit is still undelivered as we converse and was ordered six days ago so we are waiting with the garage still unlocked !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered goods on 00nd_september , partial delivery on october 0th .
negative	rest of order remains undelivered as at 00 october
negative	company failed to respond to e_mails requesting updates .
negative	i '_ve said all i need to say .
negative	i won_'_t be using you again , sorry
negative	i ordered a gaggia espresso maker from this company which arrived in terrible condition - box was torn , had obviously been opened before and several of the shiny plates / plastic panels were scratched .
negative	i sent it back requesting a new one and the one which arrived was in a similarly bad condition .
negative	sent this one back saying it was unfit for purpose and i wanted a refund and with no explanation was given money back with a significant reduction over what i paid .
negative	when i queried this i was told that the reduction was to cover the postage of both units to myself .
negative	upon trying to point out to him that under distance_selling_regulations he should be giving me a full_refund because the goods were not of satisfactory quality ( of which i had photographic proof ), he just started shouting then hung_up the phone .
negative	worst customer service i '_ve ever come_across , avoid like the plague .
negative	never received the goods .
negative	orered before the cutoff point for xmas and still not received the album .
negative	00 / 00 / 00 ( lower marsh branch , waterloo , london )
negative	the previous day , i shopped at the brixton branch and didn_'_t realise i have been charged 0 times for 0 items until i was about to throw out the receipt today .
negative	i decided to go to my local_branch at waterloo to rectify this issue only for me to be treated_like a criminal there .
negative	i explained the situation to the manager and she blatantly refused to refund my money citing a refund from another store would affect their store figures and for me to travel all the way back to the brixton branch to get my money back .
negative	brixton is quite a distance from me and i was there the previous day for other reasons that ended in my decision to pick_up a few items from iceland .
negative	her attempts to pawn me off as another store '_s problem was incredibly obvious .
negative	it is not my responsibility as a customer to care about the internal politics of iceland or their figures and it shouldn_'_t be used as an excuse to deny me my money back .
negative	i have been a loyal_customer for over 0 years , and have never had a single_complaint about any member of staff .
negative	but i am shocked at the level of customer service i received from the manager herself , who is supposed to be at the forefront of and a shining_example of customer service .
negative	needless to say , i will never shop there again .
negative	in addition , i will be ringing / emailing their head_office to make an official_complaint .
negative	hooefully , somthing can be done about the terrible service i received from the manager .
negative	hi , i am very disappointed by yur service .
negative	i ordered a serious mass , and the packaging was bad .
negative	i open the box and the protein was all over .
negative	it has hole in the package .
negative	do i get a new one ?
negative	?
negative	never bother using them .
negative	the slightest mistake cannot be rectified without costing you more than half what you paid .
negative	do anything_else but use this pathetic_excuse for a company .
negative	the staff were polite , but the best staff in the world can '_t save you from being chewed up and spat out by horrible business_practices .
negative	i am not very impressed with the service from ups and their attitude , i arrived an collection time between 00 and 0 today .
negative	i had to go out before 00 but was back at 00 to find that they have already been .
negative	i tried to arrange pick for the same day but apparently i have miss cut , which is not my faulty , the next available time is next monday which my affect my refund .
negative	seriously not happy with ups !!!!
negative	!
negative	i keep on getting nuisance calls from a foreign call_centre which is ran by vodafone .
negative	i have never had any products through them and do not know how they got my details .
negative	i have asked them to stop contacting me and remove my details from their system but they persist !
negative	i purchased their xl broadband package wanting reliable and fast internet access .
negative	when watching programs on the bbc_iplayer i sometimes get a message_stating ' insufficient bandwidth ' which i was assured would not be the case .
negative	very frustrating .
negative	00_% of the programs broadcast by itv are complete rubbish .
negative	it seems as though they are attempting to dumb down the nation .
negative	bbc documentaries like the attenborough series ' are far_superior to anything made by this ' broadcaster '.
negative	i was trying to find a new shirt using their website and gave up after 00_minutes .
negative	it is utterly rubbish .
negative	luckily i was passing by a shop so could pop in - they have a good range and reasonable prices for ok quality .
negative	it '_s just the website doesn_'_t seem to show all items they stock in store .
negative	received a card from moon pig the other day and thought to myself how impersonal it is having a typed message .
negative	what is wrong with hand writing out a nice message ?
negative	i cant beleive this horror story myself at times .
negative	i called into evans_cycles at the chill factor manchester to order a nice new bmc tmr frame £ 0000 .
negative	i also gave them a build sheet with all the parts i require .
negative	( the frame in stock on the web_site , late february ).
negative	the sales / bike builder guy was great and excited_about the build using the top of the range parts .
negative	i phoned back 0 day later to see if the frame had been delivered so i could have a look .
negative	this is when things started to go_wrong .
negative	he informed me that his manger would not let him order the frame without it being fully paid for , ( i was a bit annoyed that he had not called me but thought ok ) i said i will pay over the phone and he told me he could not take payment over the phone .
negative	i said it will come in the following_day and pay cash .
negative	this is what i did on the 0th_march_0000 .
negative	a week_later i had heard_nothing so i called in the shop .
negative	this is when i was informed that the last frame had been sold but there were some on there way in a week or two .
negative	( 0 months down the line and im still with out frame and my £ 0000 .
negative	i have had excusses after excuss , extended dead line after extended dead line .
negative	i have watch the frame come in stock then go out of stock on the web_site during this time .
negative	i can get the frame from america in 0 days , but they cant send it me because evans is the sole importer in the uk .
negative	do i have to go out side the uk to get this sorted come on evans_cycles what are you doing ?
negative	( i ask what would you do if you got this service what would you be doing )
negative	( please dont_think im made of money , i have saved hard with a family of kid and sold my car to get this dream bike ) which is turning into a nightmare .
negative	the flowers i ordered were for a special birthday .
negative	i also ordered a card with my flowers .
negative	the flowers were nothing like the picture on the website , and the card was damaged with significant spelling_mistakes .
negative	after the gross errors made by serenata i contacted them and i was offered a 00_%_discount .
negative	i felt this was an insult as the card and the words would have meant a lot to the recipient if the card was undamaged and correct .
negative	the professionalism of their customer service team is questionable .
negative	i would not use their services again .
negative	garage contacted me to bring my appointment forward , i arrived early and all appeared well , until i got home & realised that the tyre_fitter had fitted the new tyre the wrong way around on the rim & had also damaged the edge of my alloy_wheel .
negative	i contacted the garage and they were less_than willing to resolve .
negative	contacted blackcircles and they kindly arranged for me to visit a different garage who refitted the tyre correctly ( without charge ).
negative	well what can be said about alpharooms …..
negative	fairly cheap ?
negative	well yes .
negative	but at the same time uncommunicable could also be said and '; you get what you pay for '.
negative	mainly just one thing should be said in particular do not under any circumstance book with them !
negative	i have never ever_dealt_with a more unprofessional company … don_'_t ruin your holiday for the sake of a few_pounds off .
negative	it '_s honestly not worth it .
negative	i made that mistake … twice .
negative	neively originally booking a cheap trip to ibiza in 0000 where alpharooms placed us in a room with two single_beds ( after requesting a double ).
negative	on our return i complained and received a 00_%_discount .
negative	so seeing an opportunity for a cheaper trip i decided to use it on a trip to new_york with a transfer at reykjavic from london .
negative	big_mistake .
negative	not only did it take more than several phone_calls and emails to alpharooms to actually establish our travelling vouchers and baggage_allowance ( we were told two bags for the hold and then just one , then two again ..) encountering a range of ' customer sales representatives ( 0 out of 0 were english ), the rest were foreign who could barely understand , nor speak_english fluently themselves ( great idea for customer service placements ).
negative	but when we finally arrived at the airport we were told curtly by the iceland air representative that the sales_person i ' d spoken to at alpharooms who ' d wished me and my girlfriend ' a happy holiday together ' had booked us several rows apart on all our flights !
negative	he politely did his best to rectify this and booked us together on our main flight at the back of the plane to new_york from iceland - but for our 0 hour flight to iceland from london we were sat over 0 rows away .
negative	my girlfriend was hugely distressed , especially as it was her_birthday too .
negative	it was simply awful .
negative	on our arrival in america i emailed and complained to alpharooms .
negative	i received a curt reply saying they had ensured we were now seating with each other again on the journey back ( so admitting they had booked us apart ) but even more amazingly then then blamed me saying it was something they couldn_'_t guarantee and that it wasn_'_t their fault !
negative	simply unbelievable
negative	needless to say i came back and emailed them .
negative	its taken a further 0 emails to finally get to a senior customer sales_representative .
negative	they '_ve all rudely passed responsibility away from themselves .
negative	so i '_m not seeking_legal_action_against them .
negative	what kind of travel company decides to book a party of two several rows apart on a flight , after you '_ve stated you ' re travelling together .….
negative	clearly not a proper one .
negative	but operates by filling planes like buses with no thoughts to the customer .
negative	please_please_please i implore you … give these_guys a wide_berth and go with well_known booking agents such as expedia , thomas_cook , trivago … anyone would be an improvement !
negative	they ended_up pretty_much ruining two holidays , don_'_t make the same mistake we did !
negative	_______________________________________________________________
negative	my reply > to alpharooms reply_below
negative	as you '_ll see alpharooms has since responded to this email in much the templated way that they contacted me when i raised these issues with them .
negative	they '_ve done this on several review sites .
negative	so for fear of any mistruths i '_ll simply state my reply here
negative	___________________________________________________________
negative	the simple matter of the fact is alpharooms , i did state we were travelling together , several_times .
negative	so the fact you have the audacity to blame me for not specifying this ( when i did and your staff_member said ' oh that sounds nice ' before seeing fit to sit us several rows apart ) is sheer madness .
negative	as i '_ve already stated i '_ve started legal support for this matter and i will be getting my money back .
negative	along the way also ensuring that any other potential_customers don_'_t have to suffer in the way that i did with such a company as yours .
negative	i ordered these flowers for my girlfriend for valentines .
negative	i wanted a vase to go with it thinking it will look better .
negative	firstly i found the website difficult to understand .
negative	i want flowers , this is the message , deliver to this address , and pay .
negative	i couldn_'_t find where to put the message , because it looked like i needed to pay for a message with the flowers .
negative	the flowers came with a card saying ' no message required by sender ', which i was upset with thinking that there wouldn_'_t be a message if i chose not to pay for it .
negative	the flowers arrived in a box .. containing the flowers and the vase separately .
negative	i believed that for that amount of money they would deliver it by hand , in the vase .
negative	not in a box .
negative	i was highly disappointed by this .
negative	if i had know that this is how they deliver the flowers i would have gone and bought it myself from sainsburys .
negative	the flowers also didn_'_t look anything like the image .
negative	very small pink_roses , but the red_roses looked nice .
negative	overall i now know not to order flowers online .
negative	you actually don_'_t know what you will get .
negative	even paying this inflated price , you will be disappointed .
negative	con no : zdbysw000000
negative	i ordered a large_amount of furniture from home discount website .
negative	i received an email from them on the 00st oct just at 00 : 00 saying they '_ve dispatched my goods , but it didn_'_t mention which courier .
negative	on the 00nd , i contact home discount at 00 : 00 to try and find out the courier and they came back quickly saying it was xdp and gave_me a consignment_number which i looked up .
negative	on the tracking_information , it said : 00 oct_0000 00 :_00am 000 delivery out for delivery - route 00 - eta : 00 :_00am to 0 :_00pm .
negative	so i had to rush home from work , taking a taxi to get back in time , which cost me £ 0 and greatly irritating my boss .
negative	getting home at 00 : 00 , i breathe a sigh of relief as the tracking_info stays the same , there '_s no card , so i sit_down to wait .
negative	this was bad service because the company had not bothered to contact me to let_me know they were even delivering on this day .
negative	so i sit .
negative	and i wait .
negative	00 : 00 goes by .
negative	0 : 00 goes by - i am ringing to find out the problem but the phone is engaged .
negative	engaged .
negative	how on earth is not a proper phone system to taken calls ?
negative	i am literally just ringing a landline .
negative	ridiculous .
negative	the girlfriend gets back at 0 : 00 so i taxi back to work for the afternoon ( another £ 0 ).
negative	i continue calling and finally get someone at around 00 : 00 .
negative	he tells_me that ' there has_been ' an incident ' in portsmouth ', so the van driver has decided to do his round backwards and to disregard the eta information .
negative	that the delivery will be delivered by 0pm without_fail .
negative	so from 0 : 00 onwards , with no delivery , i am watching that tracking_information like a hawk .
negative	refreshing the window every 0 seconds .
negative	at 0 : 00 , up comes the status 00 oct_0000 00 :_00pm all barcodes 000 exception carded .
negative	i am running down the single flight of stairs to the front_door of my block of flats so fast it freaks my girlfriend out .
negative	there is no card .
negative	there is no delivery van .
negative	there cannot be a card put through my door because there is no letterbox .
negative	the delivery van has not visited my road because it is a no - through road which takes about 0 minutes of cautious reversing to get a taxi out , nevermind a delivery van .
negative	so i ring the depot , there '_s no answer .
negative	i leave a message explaining the issue .
negative	it '_s strongly_worded but no shouting or swearing asking for someone to call me back .
negative	it '_s now 0 :_00am on the 00rd oct and no - one has bothered to call me .
negative	so yesterday , i was not contacted to be advised a delivery was taking place , the driver apparently decided to change his route and therefore failed to deliver it , and subsequently recorded a false entry in the database .
negative	i am £_00 down , my boss is annoyed at me , my girlfriend has had to wait in all afternoon yesterday and again all day today , and i have not had a single communication from this company .
negative	terrible , terrible service .
negative	by contrast , dpd have been keeping_me appraised of another delivery of audio_equipment i ordered through amazon , just like they always do , and should be arriving today between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 , and i am sure they will - they usually call me 00_minutes before they are popping round .
negative	currently , my consignment has this status 00 oct_0000 00 :_00am 000 delivery out for delivery - route 00 - eta : 0 :_00pm to 0 :_00pm .
negative	i have absolutely no confidence this will arrive and my girlfriend has resigned herself to waiting in all day because we cannot trust this company .
negative	placed an order with toolstation earlier . screws , brush cleaner and white_spirit .
negative	got a ' phone_call saying that i needed to prove i was over 00 as the white_spirit was an age restricted item .
negative	now before i have ordered saws , blades , knives and probably other " dangerous " items so when was this nonsense introduced .
negative	i told them to stick the order as i was so irate .
negative	do not ever use this company .
negative	it is terrible .
negative	customer service is as bad as none_existant , i paid an extra £ 0 to get it delivered in 0 - 0 business days , it has_been 00 days and still not come !
negative	brilliant !
negative	was supposed to be delivered friday but didnt arrive until monday and tuesday .
negative	will not use again .
negative	i thought a collection of a parcel would be as simple as abc .
negative	i booked a collection on tuesday for 0 day delivery .
negative	sat home all day no collection , called in was advised it '_s up to the driver to collect the parcel or not , was surprised a courier driver could make this decision .
negative	was then told to stay home another day and wait for the collection .
negative	i asked if this would happen again as taking time off and collection was confirmed between 0 :_00am and 00 : 00 .
negative	no consideration taken for me being aggravated or price reduction due to now being 0 days .
negative	guess_what no collection after being confirmed with a team_leader and a 0 hour phone_call on a premium number .
negative	called in again and now the blame game was with city_link the courier being that they have a new software system
negative	and all the rest of it .......!!
negative	finally the collection was on friday but still took until monday_evening to arrive .
negative	not quite 0 day as i paid for , royal_mail the name says it all a little more_expensive and a lot less aggravation .
negative	i feel strongly now about cheap budget , cheap service keep that in mind when spending your cash mate
negative	we were accused by the manager of our local_store of being shoplifters despite a total_lack of evidence .
negative	when we complained to the store . experience team they told us that the store manager could expel us if she liked .
negative	we disagreed with the manager '_s assertion and subsequent messages to the store . experience have vanished into the ether .
negative	queries to the online waterstone '_s message board have , through the online intermediary , revealed that they have no_intention of continuing the conversation .
negative	shocking !
negative	after a week i have to send message to check where is my order , no reply for 0 days , after a phone_call two_days_later they manage to post it .
negative	did they forgot my order ?
negative	bad service , no single sorry for delay , no updates on the website .
negative	if you desperate for your item i will not recommend this company .
negative	brought a screen_protector that was faulty and failed to stick on two sides .
negative	when i complained i was told it was my own fault as i had fitted it half a mm off center .
negative	found myself argueing over £_00 via_email .
negative	receiving one_sentance replies .
negative	what a joke .
negative	in the end i was offered £ 0 of a new one .
negative	i found this laughable , considering the poor quality of the first one and the fact that the first was only 00hrs old
negative	i had in the past purchased a number of these protectors which out of fairness were excellent , however the customer service i experienced has left a bitter_taste and will not buy from them again .
negative	stupidly i '_ve now twice tried to use this company .
negative	the offer price is nothing more than a lure to get you in .
negative	they then attempt to knock the price down significantly for any minor reason .
negative	on the latest occasion i showed them a car that was in wonderful condition for its age / mileage .
negative	their initial offer was a little low as usual , but acceptable for a quick sale .
negative	however they then tried to knock the price down by nearly 00_% due to very minor_damage which was perfectly in keeping with the age / mileage of the car .
negative	i walked_away and i '_ll never use them again .
negative	i suggest you only consider them if you are absolutely desperate to sell quickly and be prepared to receive an actual offer which has no_resemblance at all to the one they initially gave you .
negative	waited in all day and arrived early evening ... no good .
negative	just of the phone to these cretins " if wit was a sh # t , they would be a prize t # rd " , details came through for some person in my address , and a letter from bt saying that they were sorry to lose me , 00 sec call to bt sorted_out my end .
negative	trying to stop mail coming through to my address a whole different kettle of fish .
negative	after_speaking to cretin number " in customer service " employee of the month goes to the woman not uk_based who asked for details and then of the account .
negative	i said the persons name the envelope came through with and she then said you are not this person , i said no this is my address stop sending mail here .
negative	she then said on my system is down you will need to call back later .
negative	i said i ain '_t calling back you write the details down and sort it when your pc is working .
negative	i cannot do that i am not allowed to , i said ok let_me speak to your supervisor , i can only do that if there is a problem .
negative	i said there is and its me , so let_me speak to the supervisor silence ..
negative	i said hello think i had been transferred .
negative	i can '_t be helping you pc not working , i said again .. look i work in customer service if i write things down that are confidential it can be shredded ... why can you not write something , do you have a pen , i can '_t be answering that question ... end of call arrrghhh ... call 00 . 00am this morning and talk_talk like i said on the phone i am busy have things to do , if i have to call you again i will charge my admin_fee of £_00 . 00 per call
negative	i tried signing_up for talk_talk home phone and broadband and got booted off the line 0 times .
negative	i gave up .
negative	my nan was unfortunate_enough to get through and sign up and she '_s had problem after problem and also reports the customer service is lousy .
negative	they may claim to be cheap but i would recommend anyone to ...
negative	avoid at all costs !
negative	sound went on my htc_desire , called htc and they didn_'_t want to know .
negative	i went and got an iphone 0 and now have the 0s and no issues .
negative	not impressed !
negative	roses i have had before for 00 quid just before valentines_day a few_years_ago were lovely .
negative	this time thought i was mortified to find that even_though i paid extra i got a standard bunch of flowers and the message in the card was not added so it simply said ' no message required by recipient ' in the card !!!
negative	my girlfriend didnt even know they were from me !!
negative	waste of 00 quid !
negative	try another online flower shop there are plenty of them !
negative	also the wrapping could have been done better by a 0 year_old !
negative	it looked like it was rushed and they couldn_'_t be_arsed to wrap them properly i would like my money back .
negative	looking for a replacement xbox_000 wireless controller for my son .
negative	this site was the cheapest at £_00 . 00 delilvered , so i ordered .
negative	after starting reviewing then on the t ' interent and was not good .
negative	i thought i would be clever and call them but just an answer machine , so i emailed , may be after 0 - 0 times no response .
negative	thankfully i ordered by paypal put in a complaint , they had 0 days to respond , did not so i got a refund .
negative	i am unsure if this company / site is a scam or just really rubbish , either way i would suggest all to avoid from my own experience .
negative	i am yet to receive a yodel delivery that is on time - in fact it is so bad that i research who the online_retailer uses as a courier and if it is yodel - i avoid them !
negative	i ordered a fridge_freezer to be delivered on the 00 / 0 / 00 as this was for my father in law and he was currently in hospital i arranged for someone to be at his address to take delivery .
negative	they were there from early morning only for me to receive a phone_call at 0 : 00 pm to say they could now not deliver as their driver had gone sick by the roadside ( funny some years_ago when i ordered from this company i was given the same excuse when the item did not arrive .
negative	the agent who called me promised that that they would deliver the fridge_freezer between 0 :_00am and 00 : 00 on the 00 / 0 / 00 without_fail .
negative	i again arranged for some person to be there to accept delivery who was none to happy after the day before .
negative	by 00 : 00 no delivery and after begging the person to stay the fridge finally arrived at 0pm .
negative	if you need an item delivered for sure on a certain date or have to make arrangements then can i suggest you avoid this company at all costs i for one will never ever use them again .
negative	i ordered a bed for my 00 year_old father in law who was in hospital ( we had to get_rid of his previous bed for reason i will not go into ) i chose this company simply for the next_day delivery as we were not sure how quickly he would be discharged from hospital .
negative	the bed arrived the next_day ( tuesday ) and when we went to assemble it found that the side_bars had no holes for the slats to fit in .
negative	i contacted worldstores and after they contacted their supplier informed me they would try and get replacement parts out by the end of the week i explained the situation and that the end of the week was not good enough as i even if they were was not prepared to have a 00 year_old come home with no bed .
negative	i also explained that i needed some kind of confirmed timescale as there was no one at his home and i would have to arrange family to be there to accept delivery .
negative	after several more calls i was told that they would try and get the parts sent by special delivery for the thursday this did not happen .
negative	they called me on the friday_morning i was told they were out for delivery that day and arranged for someone to be there when by 0 : 00 that night i had not heard they had been delivered i phoned the depot and they spoke with the driver who said he rang the bell and no one answered and he had left the parts in the lobby ( ground_floor_flat ) i know there was someone there lucky after_contacting the person waiting they went to the lobby and found the parts there .
negative	customers service each time i contacted them seemed to want to help but in short wanting to and actually doing is two different things considering that as i say a 00 year_old frail person could of come out of hospital with no bed then i think the directors of this company should hang their heads in shame .
negative	great quality but watch out as the size are way too small .
negative	i have now return the vest hoping to get the correct_size .
negative	after wairing 0_weeks , there is still no sign of the vest .
negative	very desappointing customer service .
negative	!
negative	after the worst experience with a courier ever , i would not recommend this mess of a company if they where the only one that remained in the world .
negative	tracking said that the parcel had been collected , but was still sitting by my front_door .
negative	live_chat is hopeless .
negative	call them & costs are 00p_per_minute .
negative	avoid at all costs , which will be passed on to you as the customer .
negative	pay the extra pound or 0 to use a company that does what it says .
negative	i ordered a worktop , booked the fitter , told the customer , everything turned_up except the worktop .
negative	they ' d lost it , we all lost time and money .
negative	unreliable
negative	do not ever sign up to this rip_off company .
negative	they do not listen , never admit fault and basically are becoming a complete monopoly .
negative	i try never to purchase with online companies that use this firm and have started up an anti - paypal group amongst friends and colleagues .
negative	hello ,
negative	i recently ' brought ' a dell inspirion mini laptop from the mitcham store , instead of being delivered a laptop i have instead been sent a numark cd mixer .
negative	the company haven_'_t even bothered replying to me or answering there phone , astonishingly poor customer service .
negative	stay_away .
negative	they regularly don_'_t turn_up for collections or delivery and claim some useless excuse like ' there was nowhere to park ' or ' there was no response '.
negative	they would have to actually attempt delivery in order to realise the fact that there is an almost permanently empty parking_space on my drive and the road is wide enough with no markings to pull up for a prolonged period .
negative	on top of this , my workplace is on a business park with enough space to pull up , let_alone park , for an entire football_team .
negative	they claim all_sorts of excuses but fail to realise that all the delivery locations i have specified have cctv so can easily prove that they are lying .
negative	it is only because of the suppliers that these issues have been sorted .
negative	how can a company with such a poor reputation from across the country detailed so much on the internet possibly receive business ?
negative	cost .
negative	pay_peanuts ...
negative	i can however say one thing , they are consistent , but it is consistently useless .
negative	i ordered some ray - bans on the 00st of july_0000 with the promise of there 0 - 00 days delivery by the 00st of august i still had not received the glasses !
negative	i first contacted them around the 0th of august wanting answers as to when my glasses would be delivered i received no reassurance all i got was something completely_different that didn_'_t answer any questions !
negative	they couldn_'_t even guarantee that my glasses would even turn_up !
negative	they should at_least state that all orders are drop shipped !
negative	so i promise you this smartbuy sunglasses ( not very smart at all ) you haven_'_t heard the last of me !
negative	i will be taking this further !
negative	i have only recently received the refund which seemed doubtful at the time !
negative	so order from this company if you want to order from a company which is registered and hosted in australia , the stock comes from_hong_kong and they have a uk unit where the returns are sent to !
negative	who don_'_t even have a contact number just a pre_- recorded_message which just irritates me even more !
negative	poor_excuse for a business !
negative	bad_practice and even worse customer service !
negative	i went and bought the sunglasses from a opticians that sell them !
negative	and i sugest others do the same for the sake of £_00 it isn_'_t worth the risk !
negative	booked car_hire through holidayautos for one week on the algarve and ended_up with the dreaded international car_hire at faro_airport .
negative	first offering had an illegal bald tyre on the rear and the second no aerial so no radio reception .
negative	foolishly got caught out on the full to empty_fuel_policy when we all know it '_s impossible to return a car empty .
negative	more_importantly was charged 0 . 00_euros_per_litre when the going rate on the algarve was 0 . 00 .
negative	reported all this to holidayautos on my return and they said they could do nothing about the condition of the vehicle and hid behind the small_print in relation to the fuel_policy .
negative	they almost seem to condone the 00_% mark up in fuel_costs which i think is outrageous .
negative	definitely worse customer service since the takeover by cartrawler backed by eci partners and guess_what no reply from international regarding my complaint .
negative	steer_clear of both holidayautos and international .
negative	wish i had never purchased from fireplace 0 life !
negative	!
negative	fire arrived damaged , phoned 0 times & e_- mailed various contacts on the thursday , told each time i would get someone call me back by return !
negative	saturday_morning finally had a call back , but as it was weekend they could not help !!
negative	emailed everyday the next week & am being totally_ignored now !
negative	the fire is for our elderly_mother as her old one broke 0 days before !
negative	she has_been without heat for a week now , they just do not care !
negative	as per tel con this item is nothing like the photo !
negative	i was expecticting a bright_red interior which stands_out against the white but was so disapointed & had to phone as soon as they arrived .!
negative	such a great turn_round , with me the next_day , shame about the quality , just can not use them !
negative	no offer of taking them back ?
negative	i made a claim for a parcel which was damaged in transit and collect_plus agreed to settle the claim and send a cheque within 0 days .
negative	despite many emails and phone_calls from me , 00 days_later guess_what ??
negative	?... no cheque !
negative	!
negative	not good , not fair and certainly not acceptable .
negative	ordered an item debited my card two_days_later informed me no stock - then promised a money off voucher as an_apology - this was never emailed to me will not use site poor service
negative	poor , poor , poor .
negative	my items still have not arrived after two_weeks .
negative	they have routinely left very expensive parcels on my door_step .
negative	have left parcels with neighbours but not put the correct information on the note , and on on occasions when a parcel was left apparently left on the door_step , but wasn_'_t there when i got home , they had no record of who the parcel had been sent by on their system .
negative	if you are a retailer please have more respect for your customers than to use this service .
negative	rude , impatient and offensive
negative	i was just trying to track an order i placed on amazon on tuesday or wednesday that i thought was dispatched , for a lg monitor / tv .
negative	i had an abrupt conversation with someone at ballicom hq who fobbed me off to the factory .
negative	there i find out the model is discontinued and i '_ll get a refund , wtf ?
negative	this has to go down as probably the worst and most pathetic service i have ever used online .
negative	no offer of any deal they can do on another similar model , simply go away and get another one ….
negative	yeah_right .
negative	… that was my first and last dealing_with ballicom
negative	i was very disappointed with the item .
negative	i paid for the item to have the programmes to watch films and sport .
negative	i paid the price requested on the web_site and did not get what i paid for .
negative	a poor service .
negative	i tried to change the arrival time , which they agreed , then i was told by the person receiving my car that i would have to pay extra as i hadn_'_t arrived at the right time .
negative	they gave_me the wrong directions to the car_park , causing a lot of stress .
negative	coming_back , we had to pay £ 0 extra to get out of the car_park .
negative	all in all , a very poor service , which is surprising , considering all of the competition these days for airport_parking .
negative	i was contacted by orange to sign up for landline and broadband .
negative	i explained that i was already in a contract with another_provider for another 0 months .
negative	orange said they would pay the outstanding_balance to the other company in order for me to move to orange .
negative	i said i wanted to keep my number .
negative	no problem was there reply .
negative	simply contact your existing supplier two_weeks prior to the switch to get the existing landline ported across .
negative	i did as instructed and was asked by my provider why i was moving considering i had £_000 to pay for cancelling my contract .
negative	i explained orange had agreed to pay the balance .
negative	my current_provider said that orange had been saying this to customers but in truth they only pay up to £_000 .
negative	i had been mis_- sold the deal and contacted orange to cancel the switch .
negative	orange said they would cancel the switch immediately .
negative	however they didn_'_t .
negative	instead they switched my landline and broadband to them anyway . they had also given me a new landline_number .
negative	i contacted them immediately .
negative	they told me that the girl who cancelled the instalation did not know that she had to cancel the instalation on two computers and this is why the switch had went_ahead .
negative	as a result i was left without a landline or broadband for 0_weeks until orange could switch me back to my previous provider .
negative	i lost my phone number and this was a major inconveience .
negative	the orange customer service were rude and although i was promised phone_calls from supervisors they just didnt_bother .
negative	they did however send me a cheque for £_00 after i had wrote several complaint letters to them .
negative	this was pathetic considering the major inconvenience i had suffered .
negative	all in all orange are liars and cheats who offer the worst customer service i have had from any mobile or telecommunications company .
negative	i will never use them again .
negative	damaged goods .
negative	no protection in packaging .
negative	no effort to resolve the situation .
negative	poor customer service .
negative	order was placed on 00th_august , their website states 0 - 0 days to despatch goods , items were marked as dispatched on the 0th day , they advise 0 - 0 days for delivery , and website advises if items not arrived after 0_weeks to contact them and they will re - print .
negative	so after 0_weeks nothing was here , called up their abysmal customer service to be dealt_with by a very argumentative advisor with the worst attitude , blaming royal_mail , telling_me to wait longer , to go the sorting_office , anything to detract blame from themselves .
negative	i asked to speak to supervisor , told one was not available .
negative	i stated their website advised that they would reprint this after 0_weeks , she stated they would do this ' reluctantly ' - ( reluctantly , really !)
negative	wow !
negative	and there would be no additional_charge ...
negative	wow thanks so much , you mean you wont charge me to send something you have not provided me with in the first place !
negative	attitude was argumentative and sloppy , and not helpful at all , this is not my fault bonusprint , its yours , if you are charging me £ 0 to deliver a package then why are you not sending it tracked ?
negative	that '_s what tracked mail costs , you are probably just overcharging to boost your profits for an extra few_pounds by being so cheap and not tracking your post .
negative	a truly_terrible experience , i think your staff need to learn some manners and good customer service .
negative	avoid bonusprint at all costs .
negative	placed order for 0 tyres on 00th_feb . payment taken straight_away .
negative	no sensible emails received fro m company .
negative	two_weeks_later get email_telling_me my fitting date was 00thfeb .
negative	fitters had received nothing .
negative	today 0th_march my tyres have been fitted .
negative	almost one month to get my tyres .
negative	fitting_centre fine and no_complaints .
negative	what sort of a company takes your money and doesn_'_t have the courtesy to tell you that the tyres are not in stock .
negative	tyreshoppers owes me the interest
negative	on over £_000 which they " borrowed " for nearly four weeks .
negative	tyreshoppers deals with problems by silence and ignoring the customer .
negative	will go_elsewhere next time .
negative	alans
negative	i ordered a bunch of 00 roses to be delivered on valentines_day for the missus .
negative	price was competitive not amazingly cheap , they arrived on time on valentines_day in a large box .
negative	the missus opened the box to find 00 roses , 0 of which were broken and one which didn_'_t have a head and nor was the head in the box meaning that the rose must have been headless when they put them in there !
negative	i complained and was assured that this is not the usual quality of their products , they sent out a new set .
negative	when we received the new set we again only received 00 roses which all looked like the cheapest battered roses money could buy .
negative	another complaint and 0_weeks_later i am still_waiting for my money .
negative	my advice - don_'_t use them at all costs more hassle than its worth , get friendly with a local_florist same - day delivery and two_weeks_later the flowers still look amazing all for only £ 0 dearer_than iflorist !
negative	i ordered with this company for the first time and was told that my items would be received by 00 december at the latest .
negative	they never arrived and i contacted asos who intially did nothing .
negative	then i got an e_- mail saying my order had been returned to them and queried why i hadn_'_t completed the returns_slip !
negative	i was then told that my order would be cancelled and if i wanted the items i had to re - order them but they are now out of stock .
negative	i asked if they could send the item that they sent originally and was told they could not do that !
negative	the item was a christmas_present ( which i made them aware of ) and now i have to find an_alternative at the last_minute .
negative	do not order from this company if you need your sunglasses this year !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a pair of prescription ray_ban rb0000 wayfarers polarized ( size 00 ) from sbg on 0 april .
negative	it took them 00 days to tell me that the frame was not in stock and would take between 0 - 0_weeks ( but maybe longer ) before they available .
negative	great !
negative	they offered me alternative frames (' click here for our huge_range of in stock items ') and a 00_%_discount .
negative	i made an_alternative choice the same day .
negative	three_days_later , they told me my alternative choice wasn_'_t available , but was available in a different size .
negative	unfortunately , the size they told me didn_'_t exist ( they said a size 00 was available , but the website showed size 00 ).
negative	i said i ' d be happy with a size 00 frame and , lo and behold , two_days_later they have asked me - ' to avoid mistake and confusion ' - whether i want to go back to my original order or choose another completely_different frame in a different size !!!
negative	aarrgghh !!
negative	!
negative	basically , sbg don_'_t have a clue what their distributor has in stock or when it will be available .
negative	their phone is never answered and it takes days to get even a simple response ( although not a particularly helpful one ).
negative	update 00 april_0000 - two_days ago , they offered an_alternative that i accepted ( same frame , different lense colour ).
negative	i told them this and they cancelled my original order and , without telling_me , placed a new order for a totally different frame that was not acceptable !!
negative	unbelievable incompetence - it is now nearly a month since i placed my order and they have no idea what is even available to deliver !
negative	i ' d give smartbuyglasses zero_stars but i '_m not allowed .
negative	a truly , truly desperate service !
negative	0_star is 0 too many !
negative	i sent 0 bouquets of flowers to my aunt , unfortunate incident of 00_hours stuck in a bath , and my mum going to help look after her who ended_up tripping over and needing stitches to her cheek .
negative	both more aged ladies that would have really liked a lovely_bouquet of flowers to lighten the mood and put a smile on their faces - serenata_flowers failed .
negative	it started with a mail that said " thank_you for your recent order however we are only able to provide one card per order and therefore if you require multiple products to be sent to multiple recipients you would need to place one order per person ."
negative	- so i chose to send 0 in one order , and they can '_t even put 0 cards !
negative	they followed up with " please ignore the previous email sent as we have organised for an individual card to be sent with each bouquet .
negative	apologies for any panic caused ."
negative	so after i alert them to the fact that the flowers have not been delivered , they advise yodel report leaving them in a shed .
negative	my aunt lives on the first floor of a flat , and there is no shed in the flat area at all .
negative	no doubt yodel driver fancied taking them home for his mrs and blagged something that can '_t happen .
negative	if you want a link to google_maps street view so you can see for yourself no shed , please let_me know
negative	awful service , i will never use again , and i will be insisting on a refund too - such a nice thing to send 0 lovely_ladies who had an awful incident on friday , and serenata screwed it up !
negative	thanks for nothing !
negative	terrible service at edinburgh waverley station .
negative	i booked a few_days in advance but the staff kept me waiting at the office while they did address checks , etc .
negative	why this wasn_'_t done in advance i have no idea .
negative	they also kept me waiting while they processed the extras that i had pre_- booked .
negative	i reserved 0 child_seats but was only given one .
negative	i was told there would be a staff_member at the car_park with the 0nd seat .
negative	i waited 00_minutes but there was no sign of this staff_member .
negative	a few_days_later i found that they had charged me for some extra cover that i did not ask for .
negative	i am still_waiting for this to be resolved .
negative	i will be using hertz next time .
negative	i wish i ' d read all the negative_reviews beforehand .
negative	i placed my order and paid by bank_transfer on sunday_night .
negative	on monday_morning i called to confirm that they had received the money and i was assured my order would be delivered the next_day ( tuesday - i paid extra for next_day delivery ).
negative	it is now 0 :_00pm on wednesday , i don_'_t have my item and nobody is answering the phone at technextday .
negative	this is simply not acceptable .
negative	i will not be shopping with these_people again .
negative	update_: i got my refund 0_weeks after i cancelled the order .
negative	shockingly_poor level of service , the worst i have had in over 00 years of online shopping .
negative	there were numerous_calls in between .
negative	on 0 occasions ( a week apart ) i was informed that the item had already been dispatched , and yet it never arrived .
negative	i will avoid this retailer like the plague .
negative	if it was possible to give zero_stars i would , but unfortunately 0_star is the minimum .
negative	my latest order has not yet arrived .
negative	have emailed twice enquiring when i can expect delivery - no response .
negative	consequently not impressed with my treatment with lampshoponline .
negative	easy to give good service when all going well .
negative	reaction to problems sorts the good / not so good companies .
negative	not working now lasted about three_weeks then died again
negative	this company sold me a tap that was badly manufactured and needs_replacing with one that is not faulty .
negative	instead of saying sorry for your trouble here have another one that isn_'_t faulty they make it very difficult by asking you to send photos and then more photos and even more photos .
negative	meanwhile days go by and i still don_'_t have a functioning bath .
negative	after all that bending over_backwards they then tell you it '_s not faulty !!
negative	unbelievable , i would never deal with this company again and i advise everyone to stay well away .
negative	***_update **** one month later i have had a refund - yipee .
negative	guess_what ?
negative	the tap was faulty !!
negative	such nice people but such poor customer service .
negative	what amazes_me is that people read these reviews , then buy from vic plumb and then wonder_why they have problems with customer service and quality of products .
negative	remember , you could be that half a person_who has a problem and not the 0 . 0 who get a great service .
negative	with superb slick marketing , this seemed like a fantastic opportunity to save_money to overseas clients .
negative	then i experienced nothing but a nightmare .
negative	following the guidelines as the website suggested , i was presented with the necessity of providing a vat certificate when transferwise does not charge vat but more worrying asking for shareholders names and addresses for id purposes when my company is not plc etc .
negative	upon chatting to the live_chat , " kevin " is nothing but an_idiot , and the other guys went back and forth changing goal_posts in my account set_up .
negative	00 hr later my money was still not paid to the recipient due to reasons which were opposite of what i was told the previous day .
negative	again going out of my way to provide the said documents , deleting the initial payment as requested by one manager , to then having to input the details for a third time .
negative	i then encountered even more poorly_designed logistical processes for the end user which resulted_in then another employee to suggest that i was " not co - operating " at the same time .
negative	i then received a rather brash automated email questioning why i had cancelled the first payment request which confirmed by belief that although this interface may work , there is no plan b or c for people who dont meet specific criteria and then it goes spectacuarly wrong .
negative	joe cross - excellent marketing for the company - to whoever designs the workflow and website - do a running jump off a hill , your work is shocking .
negative	i didn_'_t like the item i purchased and took it to my nearest superdry store in birmingham bullring , i asked kindly if i were to have a refund a member of staff then rudely spoke to me and told me to ' ask him ' and pointed .
negative	they told me i could only have a voucher worth the item i returned however i didn_'_t like another item in your store .
negative	i then returned back to the store a week_later and asked for the manger , i asked_him if there was any chance of changing it for cash he then was extremely rude and gave_me a number to call after refusing to deal with the matter over phone he then told he couldn_'_t help me further .
negative	i had no option but to buy from your store that i didnt like or either want .
negative	felt the service was poor and they forced me into doing something i wasnt willing to do .
negative	i ordered several products but have waited months now and still not received anything .
negative	i think this web_site is a scam as i have received loads of junk_mail since .
negative	i would rate zero_stars if that were an option .
negative	do not waste your time .
negative	great choice of stock .
negative	good website .
negative	quick delivery .
negative	however one of the 0 items i ordered was missing from the delivery and despite various emails i have had no response .
negative	i also tried to contact them via telephone but could not get through .
negative	showed item in stock so i ordered it .
negative	then told me item would be in 00 days_later .
negative	00 days_later told me they didn_'_t know when it would be in , if at all .
negative	don_'_t bother trying to call them .
negative	phone number is a waste of time also .
negative	they are however quick to refund .
negative	they still show the item being in stock .
negative	feel sorry for who ever orders it next !
negative	never again , as i value my time .
negative	i ordered two battries one of which is completely dead , should i send it back it doesnt_seem worth while
negative	poor poor poor
negative	only ordered from this company once and will be the last time .
negative	ordered a timber pergola on the 00th .
negative	of june this year , cost almost £_000 . 00 .
negative	payment was taken from my card on the same day .
negative	to date not received item yet ( 00th .
negative	of july ) have sent 0 emails requesting up date and 0 tel . call to steve yesterday who promised to phone back but hasn_'_t .
negative	flap on seal was rigid and when i fitted it , which required me to cut it to size , the door on the shower would not open
negative	wished i had paid more and purchased the genuine_article !
negative	!
negative	i brought some glasses from glasses_direct due to a web offer but am bitterly dissapointed by this company .
negative	they are much more_expensive than specsavers but offer no customer service , no personal fitting and the glasses took two_weeks to make - only after complaining_about where my glasses were did they agree to send them out .
negative	they would appear to offer no benefit over some of the high_street_opticians and i would advise everyone to give they a wide_berth .
negative	i am extremely surprised how uncompetitive , lackadasical and pricy they are .
negative	bad communication
negative	slow delivery
negative	average value
negative	wish i could give a good rating but sadly , in this case , i can '_t .
negative	overall a very bad customer experience .
negative	been waiting for my delivery for over a week now .
negative	after hours spent speaking with yodel customer_support who stated that the address was wrong , when it couldn_'_t have been more correct ( we had included every piece of info possible ).
negative	they made an attempt last night at 0pm to a very clear business address !?
negative	!
negative	now sat here waiting for another attempt , but judging on the time i am not expecting it to arrive .
negative	what a waste of time .
negative	contacted these_guys for a quote for my 00 ford transit front_bumper assembly .
negative	received ( amongst_others ) a really competitive quote for the bumper ass , ( which was brand_new unlike all the other quotes ) and i was really keen to purchase the goods but i could not fathom out how to purchase the kit - there was no buy now button or shopping_basket button , the telephone_number costs over a pound a minute , you are warned not to contact the supplier direct ( which 00p a minute & probably involves loads of waiting and listening to various_options whilst the minutes add up etc ) i found these_guys an_absolute_nightmare , complete_waste of time , i still_haven_'_t got my parts !
negative	sent away for goods ... did not arrive . no contact phone number to ring , no answer to numerous e_- mails , non - existent customer service , and worse ... no refund !
negative	do not use under any circumstances !
negative	theft / fraud / appalling attitude ... why - oh - why take the risk ?
negative	apt name for company - they are a " swiss " ... and you are a " tool " for using them !"
negative	only giving a star for the sheer bloody nerve of them !
negative	i wanted to make others aware of the dangers of dealing_with this company .
negative	i placed an order before_xmas after a call with them confirming they ' d deliver in time for xmas as it was a present .
negative	i kept checking the website and noticed the date slipping out , until finally the date said it would not be dispatched until after xmas .
negative	i had no communication from the company telling_me this .
negative	at this point i called them to cancel my order - they were not happy and made that clear , but did agree to refund and cancel .
negative	they didn_'_t , and after repeated_emails and a further call i '_ve had to resort back to my credit_card company to process a refund .
negative	even after the mails and the calls , they still decided to send me the product which was rejected when delivered .
negative	during this time i had no reply to any email , the phone manner was unpleasant when i did speak to them and overall a very poor service .
negative	i wish i had searched on this company before purchasing , it is clear from other comments on the internet that the service i have received is not uncommon .
negative	when i moved_into my property in december_0000 i looked around for the cheapest tarrifs .
negative	first_utility came up on price comparison_websites so i chose to stay with this company .
negative	i am now getting statements for an overdue payment for when i didn_'_t live in the property , when i spoke to fu i was advised to ignore any statements for the dates from july - november_0000 which i have done .
negative	when i recieved statements showing how much my balance was it turns_out they were still billing me for these months .
negative	i have had to send in copys of my tenancy_agreement and also covering_letters and was told somebody would get in touch but still nothing has_been resolved .
negative	this has_been gogoing on for months now and it is a complete_joke .
negative	when i phoned them to see if they habe received my cheque i was told this they didn_'_t accept cheques by 0 advisor bit was advised by somebody_else that i could pay by this method .
negative	i have also had problems submitting meter_readings to fu and when i have managed to do this they " havent " recieced them .
negative	can '_t wait to pay off my bill and move to a respectable company .
negative	i now have my gas supplied by n - power and i have to say the staff there are so helpful and understanding i can '_t wait to have my electric supplied by them . avoid fu phoned fu today 00 / 00 / 00 and have been on the phone for over 0 hours trying to sort_out their diabolical mistakes .
negative	after been passed from pillar to post and been told that they don_'_t have an account for me i have to ask
negative	0 , if there is no account and i don_'_t exist on their system , why the hell am i receiving bills ?
negative	0 , why can 0 person find me then other people can '_t .
negative	i mean for god sake the only thing u didn_'_t ask me for was blood .
negative	0 , why get me angry then try arugeing with me down the phone .
negative	when all i wanted to do is sort_out this ridiculous account .
negative	don_'_t take it out on me if your having a bad day !!
negative	!
negative	0 , why do i need to be transferred to a change of tenancy department when i moved in to my property nearly 00 months_ago when all this was done in december_0000 ?
negative	?
negative	this service is the worst i have received by any means .
negative	this company needs shutting_down if all they do is rip people off .
negative	sick of fu completely now .
negative	i would recommend people to stay_away from this company unless u enjoy getting poor customer service and incorrect bills .
negative	wouldn_'_t it be good if this company was on don_'_t get done get dom !!!
negative	wander how they would try and cover that up .
negative	no response when phoning to drop of car .
negative	no one there to meet us .
negative	had to make alternative_arrangements to park our car .
negative	have tried_phoning and emails but can '_t get a response .
negative	it '_s not so much the money , i just don_'_t want others to be caught out and left in the lurch .
negative	you have been well warned as with other reviews ..
negative	ordered a courier at 00 . 00 .
negative	the website then said the courier would arrive that day between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 .
negative	by 00 . 00 after waiting at home for hours i went into live_chat with interparcel .
negative	they said sorry and sent me new papers for the next_day .
negative	i have relabelled the packet and now have to stay in all day again for the courier to arrive - or not .
negative	this is bad service .
negative	there is no one i can talk to and no info at all .
negative	i am wasting all my time .
negative	hours and hours of it .
negative	this is the second time i have used tyre_shopper , the first time was fine no_problems , this time i had to phone them up to get my email conformation of time and date the tyres we ' re going to be fitted , when i arrived at the garage , they didn_'_t have the tyres , after waiting over an_hour for someone to phone the garage back , i was told the only tyres i could have would cost an extra 00 pounds , and in my option { they wasn_'_t interested , no explanation , no apology , just 00 pound or refund in 0 days , with no tyres on my car and only 00 pound left in the bank , i had no choice
negative	it is amazing the difference in prices at every time i need printing !!
negative	!
negative	though i would try this company out as i have a few numberplates on our other cars and just pick_up our offroader and decided to put one on it .
negative	looking on the net came_across speedyreg and found a number_plate we liked and could not belive_how cheap it was ( to good to be true ) so we sent the deposit off stright_away the paperwork came like with in two_days wow but as i work away did not get it sorted_out till the weekend when i got home sent the cheques off and all the paperwork and though no more about it
negative	then a few weeks_later the wife says we had another letter of them and i thought great must be my transfer paperwork how wrong was i !
negative	it was a letter saying they had canceled my reservation of the number i had ordered as they had not recived my payment or documents and the money i have payed is non_refundable ( wonder_how many time this happens ) so i phoned them up and got told that if i payed more money thay could hold the number_plate for me as the though i did not want to go threw with the sale ( why would i have payed the deposit if i did not want it ) so not only do i have to now pay for a replacement log_book and mot but have to pay the again for the number_plate think not as i have 0 plates from other_companys and never had to send them any documents off just payed for them and got the paperwork threw post then a trip to dvla and hay_presto number_plates changed so all in all it not aways the cheapest the best all i was saving was fourty pounds than a other site i have used in the past but now its cost me my deposit the cost of a replacment log_book and mot
negative	i used this service & cex sent me the wrong item when i tried to contact them via a email about sending the item back but i still have not received any reply so i hope that once the item has got back to them they will give me a full_refund & include extra for sending it back by post also i will not use them again & i won ` t inform my friends to use there pathetic service no wonder_why there is no contact telephone_numbers available for cex at all !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	part of my order was delayed but there was no explanation .
negative	the first i heard the delivery was incomplete was when it was delivered .
negative	there was then no communication_regarding when the remaining goods would be delivered .
negative	overall levels of customer communication poor and well below that of the competition .
negative	i have said this in an email directly to the customer_services team but i have had no response .
negative	i would give trustpilot a zero_star_review if i was able but unfortunately i cannot .
negative	to put it simply , trustpilot is flawed .
negative	any user can report any review at any time at a drop of a hat .
negative	this means if you don_'_t like a company , you can destroy its reputation easily by reporting all positive_reviews .
negative	the excuse trustpilot give is that they are an open platform that allows any user to report a review they believe is " false ".
negative	bought into the sales_pitch of 0 for 0 specs but only received one pair .
negative	not what i ' d_hoped .. they clearly saw me coming !
negative	if you are looking for a new mobile_phone i cannot emphasize how important it is for you to forget about even walking into an o0 store .
negative	they provided inaccurate information about tariffs meaning calls cost 0 times as much as quoted resulting in incredibly high charges after just day one ..
negative	when asked for a refund was told that it isn_'_t possible because " they didn_'_t do anything on purpose " and that they " can '_t give refunds anyway ".
negative	the customer service staff available online , in the call_centre and in the store are all absolutely incompetent , have zero customer empathy and are more than happy to speak to you in a highly sarcastic and derogatory way .
negative	once they '_ve got your business they could not care less .
negative	my grandma never received her flowers over xmas .
negative	i had to chase the company to find out why .
negative	it was nearly 0_weeks late .
negative	i was given an upgrade which after_speaking to my grandma was actully worse them the original order .
negative	not happy
negative	there is some fantastic kit advertised , barbour_jackets etc - but there '_s very little stock .
negative	i managed to get one item .
negative	i can '_t comment on ' returns ' because i '_ve never received any more than one order in 0 / 0 .
negative	the one i did receive i was happy with .
negative	but i '_m so fed_up with being told ,' we no_longer have this item in your size ' i '_ve decided not to waste my time on this site .
negative	there are other_places which provide a much_better service .
negative	customer service is excellent at apologising .
negative	i feel sorry that they must have to do that every day .
negative	the software was a bit of a learning_curve .
negative	took my wife forever to put the photobook together .
negative	the price went up rapidly as you entered more and more pages .
negative	the delivery cost , which you have to pay for as there is no local shop to where i live , on top of the product which i have just paid a fortune for and with no means of tracking , except for leaving the printing press ..
negative	a birthday_present which has no chance of arriving .
negative	amazon can deliver within two_days of ordering when paying for the same price delivery .
negative	two chests of draws ordered as part of a set of bedroom_furniture
negative	one chest has issues with the handles .
negative	the other chest of draws has issues with a wonky foot , cracked woodwork in a draw , damaged top and side surface and a draw that was not machined square .
negative	oakland_furniture refused to replace the goods mentioned .
negative	customer_support took a very aggressive / unhelpful approach .
negative	my experience of dealing_with plumbnation was similar to other reviews ( e . g .
negative	see the one by mr rutherford ) - delivery date indicated was incorrect and no update was given to the contrary so waited in all day .
negative	rang plumbnation to chase at 0 :_00pm and waited 00_minutes (!!)
negative	to get through only to be told that the courier company closed at 0pm so no update would be available until the next_day .
negative	had to chase again the next_morning ( despite promise of a ring back ) and was told that they were trying to locate stock even_though the order had been placed 00 days before .
negative	i was then given the option of driving 00 miles to the courier depot the next_day as long as the boiler had arrived but had lost all confidence by then so had to phone round and locate one from stock .
negative	pity as i ended_up compromising on the boiler i wanted and if i had been given a realistic update in the first place i could have had more time to locate the item elsewhere .
negative	0_weeks !
negative	0_weeks i waited_patiently !
negative	after 0_weeks i spoke to '[ name ]' ( yeah_right ).
negative	he told me i would be better off cancelling my order as he was not sure when they would be able to dispatch the canon_lens i ordered .
negative	all the while , they were ( and still ) have 0 in stock !!
negative	!
negative	during the process , there were numerous promises to send the goods - they even added a free_gift by means of apology .
negative	i also called and spoke to [_name_] a week before cancellation - he apologised and told me the item would be sent the next_day - it wasn_'_t !
negative	when i called later - he denied the conversation - blatantly lying to me by telling_me he wasn_'_t in the week before .
negative	i despair of this company - please see and take_heed of the numerous online warnings about this shambles of an organisation !
negative	if you don_'_t believe me , believe the people who have taken the time to set_up their own facebook pages - here '_s one ...
negative	[_external_reference_]
negative	i now await my refund of £_000 - will it ever come ?
negative	awful_awful_awful !!!!
negative	!
negative	nespresso ( coffee_machines ) have unfortunately chosen these_clowns for their warranty repair pick_up service !
negative	first , i had to listen to their pick_up man effing and jeffing for at_least a minute as he could perform the simple operation of opening a plastic box .
negative	he then took my coffee_machine , ragging it around with no care as he tried to shove it in the box .
negative	after ( he ) trapping my finger as i tried to help the imbecile close the box , i endured a further minute of his profanities .
negative	0_weeks_later , with no forewarning ( this i blame nespresso for ), they attempted to redeliver on the 00rd of february .
negative	they also slipped another card ; they claimed had been for the day before through the door .
negative	i know they had only attempted the delivery once as the one dated the 00nd , they had left the barcode tear off at the bottom of the card ( they would normally scan this and take it away to prove their driver had attempted delivery ).
negative	this meant they had saved money by not having to attempt re - delivery the next_day .
negative	i tried to call , but their " award_winning call_centre ” phone line , said there " was a fault ".
negative	as it was out of their office hours , unlike the phone line was saying , i was unable to speak to a member of their team .
negative	i went online ; their website also said there was a fault .
negative	the next_day , i called .
negative	i followed the automated_system for collection .
negative	it gave_me the option of thu / fri / sat / mon for collection .
negative	none of these days were possible due to work / commitments .
negative	as the card said the item would be returned after 0 working_days , i felt under_pressure to commit to a collection date .
negative	i went online to see if i could_find an address for the local_depot - nothing .
negative	i found a number for their customer_services - after 00_minutes queuing , i realised none of the call_centre awards were for efficiency and gave up to continue with my day .
negative	later on , i found a list of depot addresses and phone numbers ( from a complaints website , listed by a distressed customer ).
negative	i called them the next_morning .
negative	the man i spoke to said he could only look into this if i had my consignment_number ( i find this hard to believe that a delivery company can '_t find you from an address ) but fair_enough , i thought i ' d take number with me to work the next_day .
negative	i called next_day with the number " no , we ' re just a depot , we don_'_t deal with collections , i '_ll put you through ” i was put through to a lady , who said " i '_ll put you through to customer_services ".
negative	another 00_minutes on hold , during my break , i gave up .
negative	it was now friday so we went away for the weekend and have just returned .
negative	i tried the phone system again hoping now the pickup dates available will have shifted forward " please hang on while i transfer you to a member of our team ... sorry , our opening_hours are monday to ..." i then logged on to the website to try and sort .
negative	this threw up the result ' your package has_gone for re - delivery '.
negative	i suspect it has_been returned to nespresso - dpd will no doubt charge for this and charge for nespresso to re - deliver .
negative	a shocking attempt to make money out of their large contracts .
negative	this is basic stuff .
negative	royal_mail leaves a card telling you where your package is and how to collect it .
negative	i intend to call nespresso on monday and complain_about this appalling company .
negative	the person_who gave them a 0_star_rating ; possibly severely mentally impaired or a dpd employee ( or perhaps both )!
negative	seriously though , i have never felt so strongly before that i have felt it worth taking up my time to warn_others of such poor service – beware !!
negative	!
negative	i have used them before with no_problems however on one occasion i sent a parcel which some how ended_up being delivered to a completely_different address .
negative	i was fortunate_enough to be contacted by the person_who received it and they had spoken to hermes regarding re delivery .
negative	hermes stated they would redirect however they never collected the parcel !
negative	i contacted them and they said they would investigate and let_me know .
negative	weeks passed and still no delivery , i had received an email_stating parcel was lost but their tracking stated it was at their distribution_centre awaiting further postal info .
negative	i contacted them again to be told that they had made a mistake and would resolve the issue .
negative	i later find out that my delivery label had been covered with another label and this was why it had gone to wrong_address .
negative	i contacted them again telling them where to collect parcel from and correct delivery address which they said they would do .
negative	however i received a claim_form for lost parcels and was told they couldn_'_t fulfil my delivery as parcel was lost !
negative	but i gave them the details of where it was !!!!
negative	i am_disgusted with this service and wait to see what compensation they offer if any !
negative	in the meantime i have had to pay for another courier to redeliver for me .
negative	waste of time and i will not use again steer_clear .
negative	i ordered a piece of software from proviation that was , and still is , advertised on their website as " in - stock " .
negative	my money was taken swiftly taken and then ....... nothing ................ until i added myself to a lengthy list of dissatisfied_customers on a forum that cannot be named ; and then made a " one - last - try " attempt to contact them via the live_chat on their website .
negative	now for the first time in over 0_weeks i have had a response !!!
negative	.
negative	my previous multiple emails , telephone inquiries and even live - chats have been completely_ignored , now i am assured that my goods have been dispatched ( to a " blank " post_code ) so only time will tell if the goods will turn_up .
negative	btw i did cancel my order and ask for a refund , but it appears that that request was ignored along with all the other queries .
negative	never again :-(
negative	it would appear that a refund is in process ( awaiting confirmation ) .
negative	a " reply " from the advertiser of the goods i wanted stated words to the effect that i was contacted and to confirm this , they also stated they were sending me a copy of the email that they claimed to have sent ; not a great surprise to note that nothing was received in either case .
negative	pp disputes need to be raised withing 00 days so that is the path i took .
negative	i would suggest that any would be purchaser does a thorough_search around the internet and i would add further that they might inquire why so many reviews are taken down so quickly for spurious reasons .
negative	a company that seems to spend most of its time defending itself from negative_feedback has more problems that it cares to admit to in public .
negative	often absence of delivery to russia , but where it is , there are huge tariffs on it
negative	thought i would use them as they had the best price for my tyres and i thought it would be useful to have another option in the future .
negative	the 00hr free delivery turned_out to be five days .
negative	they delivered ( clearly ) the wrong tyres .
negative	i have used their online customer service application and after four working_days i have hear nothing even_though they say they will always reply in two_days max .
negative	my car is now beached at the dealer and i can '_t reorder tyres as i don_'_t know if they are going to replace the incorrect ones they sent .
negative	if i had realised there was no option to talk to a human i would not have used their service .
negative	i have learned the hard way .
negative	as the last time i used ukmail to buy an apple product , the status will show fail to deliver .
negative	i was staying at home all day waiting for them , no calls no bells .. after they " fails to deliver " three_days , i visited them personally and got my parcel ,... this time they sent me a message said it will be delivered between 0 : 00 to 00 : 00 ..
negative	i waited another morning , obviously i '_m being stupid again .
negative	nothing delivered .
negative	i decided to go out and do my own business at 00 : 00 , when i '_m away from my home , the mailman called me at around 00 , asking me to go out to the gate for the parcel , i was in a rush running back home he showed a massive impatient and unfriendly face to me .
negative	yesterday i used curry '_s / pc_world web_site to reserve a tom_tom 00 sat_nav for collection from my nearest curry '_s outlet where it was shown as in stock .
negative	i duly received an email with a collection reference_number to collect and pay for my item .
negative	on arrival at the store i was kept waiting 00_minutes whilst staff searched for my sat_nav only to be told eventually that they hadn_'_t got any after all !
negative	so valuable time and petrol wasted in a fruitless and frustrating episode .
negative	not to be deterred i checked online availability at another branch and again the item was in stock and it allowed_me to reserve it for in - store collection .
negative	i duly received the confirmation order with my collection reference advising me to collect .
negative	this time as i was literally walking out of the front_door to collect the telephone rang and it was the branch saying don_'_t bother coming we haven_'_t got any !
negative	!
negative	what terrible service this represents - customers booking online for later collection must have an assurance that the goods actually exist .
negative	i shall not deal with curry '_s / pc_world again .
negative	got the same sat_nav same price free delivery off amazon , don_'_t waste your time i won_'_t again .
negative	background :
negative	0 windows incorrectly measured by surveyor ( one too big and one too small ).
negative	photographs were taken of the large_gap .
negative	we stated we would withhold the cost of one window until rectified ( legal right ).
negative	this resulted_in threats by 0 of the directors of supaglazing , where they both stated they would remove all the newly fitted windows and threatened the 0 nice / competent fitters with the sack .
negative	0 other snagging problems have been fixed , but the tone of gary left on the phone at the “ eleventh_hour ” was unacceptable ( recorded on answerphone ).
negative	supaglazing were emailed with a detailed list 0_weeks before he finally phoned us .
negative	further installation problems – still not fixed despite many email – we contacted cab and trading_standards who have documented details of the issues .
negative	internal plastic moldings are becoming loose on many windows on this installation .
negative	this as affected my decoration that will have to be done again . kitchen window left hand top hinge faulty ( gap of 0 . 0mm towards the top ).
negative	i hope this is not due to being measured incorrectly by the surveyor , that subsequently had to be cut down to fit the existing hole !!
negative	holes and uneven silicone application to bedroom 0 sill , needs to be removed and applied correctly .
negative	we still_await the guarantee certificate and fensa documents for our the installation completed in august .
negative	i had to contact fensa myself , it was disclosed supaglazing had forgot to submit the request to fensa !
negative	!
negative	conclusion_:
negative	we were going to have a conservatory made by supaglazing , thankfully we did not sign the dotted_line .
negative	ordered a present 0_weeks before_xmas , pcw sent wrong item .
negative	had to wait for wrong item to be returned to pcw before they would despatch the correct item .
negative	still_waiting .
negative	communication a joke !
negative	!
negative	have cancelled order , never order again pcw
negative	flowers was bought and ordered on the 0th_june for a delivery date 00th_june_0000 for my mothers_birthday , thay was not sent at all i had email them 0 times to get a answer finally thay admitted it was a big_mistake on there side , my mother was not happy with the service and she was very upset as u can imaging on her 00rd birthday no flowers from her son who_lives 00000iles away in auz , i would never buy or recommend this outfit to any one
negative	i don_'_t understand_why a parcel company cannot deliver a domestic oven ?
negative	and when the reject they can '_t even recommend a service that can .
negative	i called customer_services before placing my order .
negative	my prescription was unclear and i asked " does the line above the cyl number mean the number is negative ?"
negative	without_hesitation i was told " yes ".
negative	it was neverr requested to send a copy of my prescription if in doubt .
negative	on receiving the glasses , it was obvious the information given to me was incorrect .
negative	the company then insisted that i pay for their error to have my glasses re - made .
negative	they where not willing to enter into a discussion over the matter or pass my complaint to a more senior person .
negative	my replacement glasses took over 0_weeks to produce ( 00th_sept - 0th_nov ).
negative	this is unacceptable , especially_considering my complaint .
negative	it is obvious that the company knows that they make extra income on order errors by not requesting a copy of the prescription with the order .
negative	i also requested that the reading part of my bi_- focals be smaller , as i only use it for labels etc .
negative	they said they would do that .
negative	however the glasses i received did not have this done .
negative	the company are now spaming me with emails about their special_offers .
negative	take my advice - go to a high_street shop and save_money and time .
negative	i have used xendpay now for sending regular monthly_payments to thailand to my fiance for the last 0 months .
negative	twice_now i have found that the money has taken more than twice the length of time to arrive than what you advertise !
negative	even now ( tuesday ) i am waiting for money to arrive after it had been ordered - before_lunch - last thursday - and it still has not arrived !
negative	this - and previous_occasions - has resulted_in costing us money !
negative	this time particularly as we have some who has traveled six hours to collect money owed to her and she has had to stay in a hotel and still_waiting for the money to arrive !!
negative	!
negative	tomorrow will be the sixth day since i placed the order !
negative	we have lost credibility not only with the bank but also other creditors - all as a result of your company '_s inefficiencies .
negative	after ringing and asking what is being done 0 hours ago !
negative	- i am still_waiting for someone to contact me and tell me what the hell is going on !
negative	!
negative	i do not have a credit_card and do not want a credit_card if you are the same don_'_t waste your money on booking a car here , as when you get to your destination you cannot have your booked car and are left with the headache of sorting something else out .
negative	not recommened
negative	i ordered a rucksack from trekkinn on 0 / 0 / 00 , paying in full through paypal .
negative	there was no suggestion that the item was not available for immediate delivery when i purchased it .
negative	i got an emal saying delivery in 00 days .
negative	on 0 / 0 / 00 i got another saying it was due to be delivered to their warehouse on 00 / 0 / 00 , with no information about when i would receive it .
negative	on 00 / 0 / 00 , i got another email , this time saying it would now be delivered to their warehouse on 00 / 0 / 00 , again with no information about when i would receive it .
negative	then on 00 / 0 / 00 i got yet another email , now saying it would be delivered to their warehouse on 00 / 0 / 00 , again with no information about when i would receive it .
negative	i have tried to call them , but the customer service is shut ( perhaps due to the time difference_between uk and spain , although it is a uk support number ).
negative	they have not responded to my email message requesting a cancellation of my order and a refund yet .
negative	so i am left , after nearly 0_weeks , with no product , no idea when ( or even if ) i will get it , and no response from the company to my request for a refund .
negative	my next step will be a complaint to paypal to see if i can get my money back that way , if i don_'_t get a response very soon .
negative	my conclusion - don_'_t use this company , you might save a few_pounds , but at what cost ?
negative	there are lots of ecommerce stores that actually care about their customers , so use them instead
negative	on posting this review , i was amused ( if that is the right word in the circumstances ) to noticed , on the right hand_side of the review page , a series of statements about tekkinn , including ' most of our products are shipped within 00_hours ', yet there are a whole series of reviews , mostly from uk customers , showing problems with long delays and poor response from customer_services .
negative	you live and learn !
negative	absolute_rubbish .
negative	paid for the vouchers was told to wait for the codes .
negative	by the time the codes arrived ( many days_later ) most of the sizes of the item we had bought the vouchers for had gone !
negative	!
negative	ok we thought , we '_ll get a refund .
negative	process is to email them .
negative	a week_later no reply .
negative	in the mean time we have read that apparently a wowcher refund isn_'_t a refund at all , it '_s a credit_note which has to be used in a short_period of time !
negative	!
negative	in the end we just had to take the hit and order items we didn_'_t want , just so we didn_'_t lose the money .
negative	even then the fun and games weren_'_t over .
negative	we had 0 vouchers , however it wouldn_'_t let us order all in one go , so we had to order each item separately and pay for postage every time - called wowcher customer_care , was told that '_s how it is - unbelievable
negative	honestly it is a waste of time and money with these_guys .
negative	all in all we have saved very little over rrp , ended_up with items we don_'_t particularly want and spent literally hours sorting all this out .
negative	never again !
negative	i booked an appointment online for a saturday_morning and paid nearly_£_000 upfront to have 0 bridgestones fitted .
negative	i was going on holiday that day so i booked the earliest appointment i could for 00 : 00 .
negative	i arrived at 0 : 00 and the staff took my keys and told me to wait .
negative	after over an_hour i was told that they didn_’_t have the tyres in stock and it was going to be another 0 hours to get them in .
negative	i couldn_'_t wait that long and questioned_why i was able to book an early appointment in the first place , they were very rude and told me it was my fault for not booking further in advance .
negative	i only went to halfords out of a sense of brand loyalty having previously bought a full set of tyres , discs and pads .
negative	i complained to their head_office and was eventually offered a free wheel_balance as compensation but by that point i ’ d already got a cheaper quote for the same tyres with wheel_balancing thrown in anyway .
negative	i won_’_t be using them again .
negative	the item that i ordered was never delivered .
negative	i work away from home all week and needed the parts so that i could do a repair at the weekend .
negative	mail order is the only answer .
negative	plumbnation refuses to leave items without a signature , even_though i clearly indicated in writing that i would take_responsibility for it .
negative	i use mail order a lot and it has_been a number of years since i encountered such intransigence .
negative	most suppliers are able to use their common_sense but not plumbnation , apparently .
negative	ordered washing_machine which looked a good deal was given delivery date all was fine partner had day of work to wait for delivery loosing a days pay but our washing_machine was broken so had to be done .
negative	come 0pm still no delivery contacted ao to be told order had been cancelled and money refunded my partner had missed call from a 00 number but did not think anything of it they confirmed order by email and text so why they could not of cancelled same way i do not know .
negative	this episode has caused all_sorts of problems and still we do notknow why was saying how good ao was but now will not be recommending to anyone very dissatisfied .
negative	i have been waiting for 00_minutes now to speak to someone in customer_services .
negative	this company is absolutely abysmal .
negative	the flowers were due for delivery on monday 0rd_march , i received a phone_call at 00 . 00pm on tuesday 0th_march to say the florist couldn_'_t find the address and had phoned the landline_number i had given ..
negative	there was no message left on the answerphone of the attempted delivery , the address is not hard to find and is clearly_labelled and no contact was made to myself till lunchtime the following_day ..
negative	the person i spoke to at customer_services ([_name ]) was less_than apologetic and less_than helpful in trying to understand my disappointment of the missed delivery and was only prepared to compensate myself as the payee and not the receipient who is receiving the delivery a day late ..
negative	i am very disappointed at the service and only hope the flowers are better_than the service received ..
negative	problems ordering internationally for the second time .
negative	poor !!
negative	!
negative	i paid £_00 to have next_day delivery and didn_'_t get my parcel for another 0 days , i was told im not aloud the £_00 refunded and the quality of the product was absolute throw_away rubbish .... i would not recommend this to anyone its was a joke to say the least .
negative	it was not delivered on first request .
negative	i was only advised this when i enquired .
negative	to compensate for the non delivery , i was given the equivalent of £ 0 credit against a £_00 order .
negative	no reason given for non delivery either ?
negative	just very disappointed , definitely will not be using them again
negative	game was missing received only emty box , bord was not the one i looked online i pay for . board did not work and was badly_scratched . when i call shop from where was dispatched i heard them laughing when heard who i am , so i can only conclude it was done on purpuse . i was promised they will send city_link to collect . i waited from tuesday till friday_night , no collection .
negative	after sending them email and promising them opening of paypal case and returning goods by royal maill and copy of their return_policy - they organised collection on monday .
negative	unprofesional will newer use again .
negative	rather pay more and get what you pay paid for .
negative	the item was not delivered in the advertised time and i had all the usual problems with yodel .
negative	avoid .
negative	i booked flights and hotel to venice , the flights confirmed but no hotel confirmation received for 0 days , on contacting ebookers they simply stated " oh it hasn_'_t worked , we will try and book your hotel for you now , they did but it cost me an extra £_000 appx
negative	not happy , unlikely to use again , beware
negative	tried to buy a tv , recieved conformation of order and then nothing , no reply to emails and phone no is to an orange answer service to whitch no - one replies .
negative	after 00 days i have not got a single reply , all i want is to know whats_going on . looks_like i will have to cancel my credit_card just to stop the transaction .
negative	they may be cheap but its not worth the hassle .
negative	ordered a drill with next_day delivery garaunteed waited in all day for it as needed it for work the following_day at 0 . 00 pm still no news on time of delivery so rang up tooled_up .
negative	com they investigated the whereabouts of drill and told me won_'_t be with me till the next_day as it wasn_'_t sent out the same day as the order as they had a load of fans being sent out due to the hot_weather and these were main_priority
negative	ordered a pool_table and paid it fine 0 days_later requested men to set it up when they brought it it was . nt till then i was told they could not deliver up to our area as it was to far .
negative	but they could deliver it as far as glasgow and for me to hire a van and come and get it from there ?
negative	how stupid ?
negative	painfully annoying to buy on here , will never use again , avoid at all costs .
negative	and you can '_t verify yourself to make a review using your email .
negative	ordered through_quidco where i saw their advert
negative	claim rejected .
negative	it might only be 00p but there is a principle at stake
negative	did not receive delivery , spent a lot of time trying to speak to someone from serenata but they have no customer service phone number .
negative	eventually i got an email_saying they were trying to track down order .
negative	then silence for a day .
negative	i had ordered the flowers as a present for someone and they were finally delivered at00 at night by a delivery driver who scarred the daylights out the recipient by banging on the door andringing the bell repeatedly .
negative	all in all an unpleasant_experience and a mistake i will not make again
negative	first and last time i '_ll use them .
negative	waited in all day to collect my parcel , didn_'_t turn_up .
negative	you also have to wait_until 0pm at night before you can question whether anyone is actually going to come for the collection - by then it '_s too late to make alternative_arrangements .
negative	the only thing you want from a delivery company is reliability and they failed .
negative	when you speak to chat representative they just offer to reschedule your collection .
negative	offered good price online
negative	sent in phone
negative	they said screen was scratched and revised to 00_% original quote
negative	( it was in mint_condition and packaged well )
negative	given option to accept or reject
negative	if rejected , £ 0 to return phone
negative	if ignored , defaults to acceptance after a week
negative	chose to email to get photographic_evidence showing imei_number on screen
negative	got an email bounce due to some shoddy forwarding they use
negative	received 0 chase emails to accept / reject and replied to each cc - ing as many addresses as possible
negative	no response
negative	today they paid 00_% original quote
negative	very annoyed and frustrated
negative	am convinced this is a deliberate scam .
negative	beware .
negative	i did not get them at all
negative	the first time i bought these cartridges they seemed to work fine but a recent batch are not working in my printer , although the proper cannon cartridges are working fine - so loks like a false_economy .
negative	these are the people who put all the " fitted blind " adverts in the cheap - end - of - the market magazines .
negative	beware , give your phone number to a conservatory or window company and they '_ll sell it on to this bunch who will then cold - call you in the evening .
negative	judging_by the amount of advertising and telesales they do , the products they sell must have a mark up of 00 +%... you pay for their dodgy marketing_strategy .
negative	got a quote from britelite windows , gave them our details .
negative	asked explicitly for reassurance that they wouldn_'_t pass on our phone number .
negative	they gave_us that assurance .
negative	a few weeks_later , got cold - called in the evening by thomas sanderson ( the blind company ), trying to sell us their blinds .
negative	they stated that they had got our number from britelite windows who had sold them our number .
negative	i will be contacting britelite to express our disappointment and needless to say will not be using them for our work .
negative	the website invites customers to review their products .
negative	the reviews are then submitted for " moderation ".
negative	surprise , surprise , give a bad review and it is never published .
negative	i have submitted a number of poor reviews ( as have others i know of , judging from forums ).
negative	this is obviously deceitful and i would expect better from such a company .
negative	waited in all day for a guaranteed next_day delivery ( 0am - 0pm ) and the idiot from yodel . co . uk didn_'_t bother delivering despite having my goods on his_van .
negative	no aplogy , no explanation , nothing - just a premium 0000 number to phone !!!
negative	pathetic .
negative	you pay_peanuts , you know what you get !
negative	put in a big order with another bunch of muppets ( carphone_warehouse ) for guaranteed next_day delivery .
negative	despite my order being on their van all day , they didn_'_t deliver it .
negative	no excuse , no apology .
negative	stayed in from 0am til 0pm as instructed so very p * ssed off .
negative	company supplied me with cushions that they stated measured 00cmx00cm .
negative	when they arrived they only measured 00cmx00cm .
negative	i sent them back at my own_expense , they then refused to refund postage stating that the cushions are 00cm square or 00x00cm and that this measurement refers to a diagonal from corner to corner !!!
negative	this is obviously nonsense and a lie , why describe them as 00x00 ?
negative	?
negative	when i phoned them they claimed that the cushions are only 00cmx00cm when unfilled .
negative	the quality of the goods was very poor as well .
negative	the customer service absolutley disgusting .
negative	ordered before and no trouble .
negative	so ordered £_00 worth of goods over a month_ago and money took out of my account immediately .
negative	still no sign of goods .
negative	e_- mails unable to be delivered as recipient not found .
negative	phone_calls not answered .
negative	i have been ripped_off .
negative	do not use this company
negative	i used to be a customer for freedom0surf and never really ran into issues that required me to use their customer_services .
negative	however , after i was no_longer a customer , i was still receiving marketing emails and emails reminding_me about payment for services i had terminated a long time ago .
negative	i contacted customer_services who were really unfriendly about the whole situation .
negative	they were rude and did not respect my choice to be removed from all their marketing / newsletter information .
negative	there is no need for rudeness of this nature and i will not be using this company again .
negative	in fact , i have since persuaded 0 friends from not using freedom0surf when they were considering using them for this very reason .
negative	i '_m_sure that those friends will also pass on my experience and thus freedom0surf has lost a lot of potential business from me and my sharing of experience .
negative	hdnl is the worst delivery company i have ever come_across .
negative	unfortunately some companies i order from do not specify which courier they use and i often have the unfortunate luck to have hdnl for some of my orders .
negative	about 00_% of the time , i am left infuriated with how the parcels are left at my house .
negative	i '_ve parcels containing electric items thrown over my 0 foot garden_fence , parcels wedged into my gas_meter box , parcels left in my recycling_bin which was 0 / 0 full with garden cuttings and rotting vegetables , one time my wife had forgotten to lock her car and the parcel had been left in the drivers footwell ( this is something i '_m completely baffled about , do delivery drivers go around checking whether car doors are open for the houses they are attempting delivery at ??
negative	), i '_ve had parcels left with complete strangers ( it '_s amazing that delivery drivers think that just because they live a few houses away , that they can '_t be strangers ), i '_ve even had a parcel left_behind my car and without having a note left ( car had been unused for a number of days and only after moving it did i find the parcel there .
negative	the parcel were chocolates which could have been ruined as they were out in the rain ).
negative	i really hate hdnl and make it a point to complain to the company i order from ( e . g .
negative	amazon , john_lewis etc ), whenever they use hdnl .
negative	hdnl '_s customer service is ridiculous as they have no quality control and the delivery drivers do not seem accountable to anyone .
negative	ordered an item , paid for it , waited for it to arrive , it didn_'_t .
negative	i had to contact them to find out where item was , they said item had been sold in store on saturday , i bought item on the previous friday .
negative	they were not in the slightest bit bothered , just said my money had been refunded , no apology , no alternative , no concern .
negative	good luck with treating future customers this way .
negative	was told order would be delivered monday , rang monday am to confirm , they had no record of the order but had my money .
negative	have no bed now as we expected delivery on monday , they now tell me after 0 calls that the items i ordered are not all in stock , so would we accept an_alternative , when agreed to they inform_me that they cannot get the order to me until tuesday .
negative	wasted day monday and now having to wait in for them again on tuesday as they cannot tell me what time they will arrive .
negative	very poor customer service , i got the impression that their system errors were not their responsibility and therefore i could like it or lump it .
negative	we ordered from decuisine over a month_ago .
negative	when the goods were not delivered i googled & saw all the bad feedback .
negative	i phoned & was given a long plausible tale indicating delivery would be in a week .
negative	no delivery so we asked for a refund .
negative	no refund so i have my credit_card co chasing for the money back .
negative	don_'_t believe their tales .
negative	they are rogue_traders !
negative	buyer_beware .
negative	nb_: i '_m a real_person , not as they will tell you some competitor trying to ruin their reputation .
negative	i used to use the f0_autocentre in swindon all the time - they always carried_out good work for a good price and i always felt they honest !
negative	however , the last few_times i have been , my opinion has completely changed .
negative	my car failed its mot and the bill to get it to standard was over £_000 - something they didn_'_t mention on the phone , they just said it needed a few bulbs and a few minor bits ( to be fair they did explain what those bits were - but they gave the impression it was very minor ).
negative	a whole week_later , they finally finished these minor bits - i had to phone them daily for an update , and allegedly they were waiting for a part to arrive .
negative	no communication was forthcoming - i had to keep chasing them !
negative	then 0_weeks after the mot i had to take the car back in because the bearings had gone - after dropping it off , they phoned me an_hour later to tell me that it needed a lot of work or iit wouldn_'_t pass its next mot and when the was the mot due .
negative	when i told them this surprised me because they had done the mot just 0_weeks previous , they suddenly decided the extra work needed wasn_'_t that urgent after all !!
negative	!
negative	complete con .
negative	i ordered a fridge_freezer that was delivered in time , but it was damaged and getting them to pick it up has_been a nightmare , over two_weeks_later they managed to collect and after a further 0 days i got a refund , i reordered from appliancesdirect and withing 0days a perfect appliances arrived from two friendly drivers ,
negative	decided to try waitrose '_s online delivery service .
negative	had booked a one hour_slot first thing in the morning .
negative	it didn_'_t turn_up .
negative	nobody got in touch to say that it would be delayed .
negative	a call to the customer_services team at 0 : 00 am wasn_'_t much help .
negative	they didn_'_t know where the driver was and so didn_'_t know when the delivery would arrive .
negative	i had to leave for work so they promised that someone would be in touch to rearrange same day delivery .
negative	i received no call .
negative	i chased again and found that actually they couldn_'_t deliver and that they ' d be offering me a refund .
negative	no alternative delivery times were offered - just a voucher for my next shop , which seemed a bit of a joke given all i wanted was my shopping to arrive on time and without_any fuss .
negative	what a shambolic waste of time waitrose .
negative	we enjoyed a family holiday in october in el gouna , approx .
negative	00km '_s north of hurghada on egypt '_s red_sea .
negative	i had pre_- booked online via resorthoppa . com .
negative	the outward_journey was fine , apart_from being initially dropped at a hotel in hurghada instead of el gouna - i needed to call the number provided on our paperwork and ask them to send the driver back to pick us up !
negative	on our journey back to hurghada airport , the driver was clapping to his favourite song on the radio , taking his hands off the steering_wheel whilst driving , he also took us on a short - cut , which initially went across a bit of desert on - route to an unfinished stretch of road , he then decided to drive on the wrong side of the road ( dual_carriageway ) against oncoming traffic for approx .
negative	0km '_s , he also drove over a couple of speed - bumps much too quickly , as a subsequence my wife banged her_face ( had a nice bruised nose as a memento ), my son banged his head !
negative	i complained to resorthoppa '_s customer_services a couple of weeks ' ago , however , i am waiting for their response - i won_'_t hold my breath ..!
negative	one guitar cable ordered on 00 / 00 , one guitar lead delivered on 0 / 00 - and it was sent recorded delivery , first_class .
negative	no excuse for such a slow dispatch time , won_'_t use again .
negative	i should add they '_ve also sent the wrong guitar lead .
negative	accordingly downrated from two stars to one star .
negative	made several purchases exactly as they say and my purchases dot get tracked .
negative	claim tickets have been stuck on waiting for merchant for over 0 months now and 0 emails i '_ve sent them have been ignored .
negative	don_'_t even waste your time .
negative	scam site !
negative	hi john ,
negative	fourth email sent to contact @ topcashback . co . uk on the 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	as with my previous emails sent , this one has also been ignored .
negative	just a quick search on forums shows many unhappy people in my situation being ignored .
negative	the companies who send parcels by this company should be_ashamed of themselves .... yodel is not fit for the purpose .... 0 cards were left and each time we went to their depot but was told we needed a tracking_number , but we didn_'_t have one so we couldn_'_t give one . on the 0th visit we were told it had been returned to sender .. the manager refused to talk to us ... the sender has not received it back even after 0_weeks and yodel does not know where the parcel is .. reading other reviews i can believe they still exist .... i would be_ashamed the even admit i worked for this company , thats if i did work for them but i dont .....
negative	i personally detest this store .
negative	it '_s bland , depressing and traumatic to shop at .
negative	i don_'_t rate the quality of their produce nor think much about their chauvinistic staff - akin to police who murder and practise double standards .
negative	for a genuinely nicer experience i shop at independents ( health_food stores ) or waitrose where the price is comparable and the quality and service superior .
negative	impossible to make meaningful ( or any ) contact with this diabolical company .
negative	the website is hopeless to say the least and collections don_'_t happen .
negative	if you have days to waste waiting in for collections then this is the company for you .
negative	don_'_t imagine you can complain though because they wont be there .
negative	it would be cheap if it wasn_'_t so completely and utterly unprofessional and useless .
negative	ordered 0no . welsh shirts with welsh water_bottles !
negative	shirts were ok but bottles were union_jack
negative	i phoned and complained only to be told thats what they had in stock so thats what you got
negative	i told_him i didnt want them and to send me what i ordered , but he wanted me to send the others back first which im not happy with !
negative	told the guy i wouldnt order with cyclestore again , but i dont_think he cared
negative	this site is probably the worst site i have dealt_with .
negative	their communication is absolutely atrocious .. the only contact i have with them since thursday is a automated email response and the contact_numbers they have are completely_useless no one ever picks_up ..
negative	i purchased my ticket on thursday and within 0 hours i was notified that my cc may have been misused by an_automated email .. i followed their directions of the things they wanted for proof ( still find it very strange since no other site has done this ) and have yet to hear back from someone .. that information was sent friday around noon i have yet to hear from them and its saturday_evening ..
negative	my only solution now is to book my return flight with someone_else
negative	would also like to add that i found out from my visa that you cancelled the transaction .. the same day i made the purchase .. thanks for the notice you guys are completely_useless
negative	i '_ll also make_sure to pass on to everyone i know to never use your services
negative	i hope anything you '_ll buy to this company doesn_'_t fail in a few_months , they will ask you a " technicians report " ( sure you have to pay for it ), all in english_language , and doesn_'_t help you .
negative	very bad attemption and no solutions .
negative	si algo no funciona bién , de garantía nada de nada , son unos estafadores como los chinos , mucho cuidado con ellos .
negative	robot like email responses .
negative	inflexible attitude
negative	avoid if you can people , there are other choices that treat you like a valued_customer , not an_idiot
negative	i was looking for the 0together railcard on the android_app .
negative	apparently there '_s a secret upgrade to the app that allows this railcard .
negative	they haven_'_t notified it automatically via the google play store .
negative	that can only be because either :
negative	0 they stand to lose money from this new railcard or
negative	0 their app developer doesn_'_t pay attention to detail
negative	neither seems to be quality service .
negative	the online service employee was excellent
negative	i posted a review of a company on trustpilot three_days ago .
negative	the review was contested by the company i reviewd an dremoved .
negative	i have asked trustpilot for the right to reply as i can support my statements with correspondance .
negative	of the first 00 reviews of the company concerned 0 have been contested !
negative	i have heard_nothing from trustpilot .
negative	i would not use airparks birmingham again .
negative	we were made to queue outside the check - in portacabin in the rain with no cover over us .
negative	they had asked when we booked what time we would arrive which is what they ask everyone so they should have a reasonable idea how many people will be arriving and when .
negative	of the 0 or 0 check in desks available only 0 were open meaning customers like myself unable to fit into the cabin and queuing in the rain .
negative	neither of the ladies were particularly welcoming either .
negative	having finally checked in , were again made to queue outside in the rain wth no shelter while we waited for a bus .
negative	the whole_experience was an awful way to begin a holiday , i would rather pay the extra and park at the long_stay car_park at the airport .
negative	the bus was horribly overcrowded and we felt_like_cattle .
negative	with a baby and a five year_old as well this was truly a dreadful experience .
negative	think_twice before using it !
negative	!
negative	i ordered good from them never received it . they are con_artists beware !!
negative	!
negative	recently booked an flight through travelsupermarket --> crystal_travel .
negative	paid the amount , instantly received an email about booking with their booking number and itinerary but they didnt send me an e_- ticket .
negative	after appr .
negative	00_hours , i receive a call from them saying that my payment hasn_'_t gone_through but they still need confirmation of cancellation from me in writing ( email ).
negative	how did i receive a confirmation_email from crytsal travel if my payment didnt go through ?
negative	if my payment didnt go through , why do they need my confirmation for cancellation ?
negative	not booking with them ever ..
negative	i just want to complain_about the service i have been receiving with regards to their repair and protect washing_machine package i bought 0 months_ago .
negative	their engineers come with one part and then leaves my house in 00 - 00_minutes apologizing they couldn_'_t fix and then i have to wait 0_weeks for next to come .
negative	all i think is happening is ' hit and trail '.
negative	they come with new part , try it , that don_'_t work and go back .
negative	00th_sept , 00 was icing_on cake as your engineer didn_'_t turn_up .
negative	i was sitting at home whole day waiting for engineer but no communication , nothing and when i checked my status of repair , it was saying repair complete .
negative	no doubt , knowhow '_s facebook_page doesn_'_t allow user to add their comments as people don_'_t have much nice to say about the service they get i suppose .
negative	worst company i have come_across .
negative	stay_away
negative	my shorts have not arrived
negative	brought an item of ebay , was meant to be 00 hour courier .
negative	package was despatched next_day but delivery is now 0 days late !
negative	they tried delivering it twice , note was left on door and neighbour was happy to accept parcel .
negative	second time i was in the house the whole day , i was down stairs next to my drive window and no vans arrived yet tracker said consignee could not be reached !
negative	phoned customer_services who simply said they will deliver tommorow !
negative	doubt i will ever get my parcel and reckon the yodel employee who was meant to deliver it went and saw his mates instead of delivering anything .
negative	if its delivered by yodel i am not buying it .
negative	join this campaign on [_link_]
negative	followed up with central customer_services to let them know the £_000 ultrabook i had bought was given to me with a generic power_cable , not the samsung original .
negative	also pointed_out in the email that i would be prepared to ship them the incorrect one if they could ship me a replacement .
negative	i received a response saying i had to go to the store , but that the store manager would be made aware of the issue .
negative	i replied to let them know that the salesman had attempted to mis_- sell ( trick ) to me when i was in store , and that the staff were atrociously non - customer_focused and that i would not step back in the store , and that they shoudl either ship me the correct_part or have the store manager call me to rectify their error .
negative	the response ?
negative	' sorry we can '_t help you this time '.
negative	that '_s it ?
negative	did not address my request , no accountability , no desire to resolve the issue , no desire to take on board feedback , and completely_ignored my comment about being mis_- sold ... there is a very very bad culture within this customer that is so_far from customer_centric it does actually amuse me , i wonder_if the chief compliance officer reads these reviews .
negative	eventually companies that operate like this always fail .
negative	it is a question of when not if .
negative	would not recommend this company to a friend . they sent faulty goods to me after i had paid up front in advance . express delivery through royal_mail special delivery has now waisted my money as the goods received were faulty and could not be used when i wanted to use them . felt as if i was not believed when i said the goods were faulty to customer_services . i want a refund and compensation , very poor 0_star_rating is too good .
negative	not as_described in listing , cant attach to tank .
negative	no refund , waste of money
negative	at the end of my current_contract with the carphonewarehouse i was sent text with a link for upgrade deals .
negative	i quite liked the galaxy_note 0 and there was an offer via o0 for free handset at £_00 per_month (£ 0 off per_month special deal ).
negative	the handset arrived along with an invoice to say i had been charged £_000 .
negative	when i checked back on the upgrades page the offer had been removed and was showing as £_00 per_month but still with a free hanset .
negative	called customer_services and they said there was no record of the deal being offered .
negative	spoke to a manager who said they could look into the issue but would take up to 00 days by which time i would be obliged to honour the contract .
negative	no one from the company at any point has explained to me what the £_000 charge was for .
negative	i was asked at the time of ordering online for card_details which they stated would be used for age_verification purposes only !
negative	as a result i am going to return the handset and get my money back .
negative	i feel totally conned and will not ever deal with these shysters again .
negative	moral is never believe everything you read especially on the carphonewarehouse website .
negative	have phoned and emailed , no reply , no confirmation , no idea where i stand with this booking !!
negative	!
negative	it was all a rush , pushing through as fast as you could go to complete the sale !
negative	at the end of the process you are pushed onto someone_who only wants to take your money .
negative	on the day of delivery , when what you purchased and paid for and it does not happen - driver had no paperwork for delivery and install but that was paid for !
negative	i called very and was told not their problem contact this number !
negative	me i asked ?
negative	yes , you will have todo it .
negative	but i said my purchase for the whole package was done through and monies paid tovery ?
negative	makes no difference i was told !
negative	then the number given turned_out to be bosch service !!!
negative	they bosch didn_'_t even know i ' d purchased this washing_machine !
negative	what were they going todo to install it ?
negative	i will not touch very again and i will and do tell all my friends + anyone_else that i over hear thinking of buying from them .
negative	we ordered some wallpaper on 00 / 00 / 00 , value £_000 . 00 .
negative	everything seemed to go through ok , including on screen provision of order acknowledgement and order number .
negative	however , the promised email confirmation never arrived .
negative	there was a pending payment to homebase on my bank_account for this amount so i rang homebase to find out what is going on - turns_out they have no trace of my order !!
negative	it seems that they have had " website " problems and the person we spoke to was unable to resolve the pending payment issues and / or reorder for us leaving us to sort_out with our bank ourselves - just spent 00_minutes on the phone to barclays sorting_out - apparently this is a regular_occurrence with homebase !
negative	very disappointed both that things went wrong and with the lack of customer_services appetite to resolve their end .
negative	jo harris
negative	can '_t wait_until my contract_ends and i can switch .
negative	been complaining direct and via_twitter , just get the same rubbish reply to run silly tests .
negative	when in the office or at home i get 0 - 0 bars signal , but i get no calls or texts and most of the time i can '_t dial out .
negative	then suddenly i get several texts all at once with varying timestamps up to hours before the current time .
negative	tried my sim in other phones .
negative	same thing happens .
negative	rubbish .
negative	i '_ve had sky for a long time , i have an hd_tv package .
negative	recently they upgraded my local exchange so i decided to more my phone and broadband to them as well
negative	this was at the start of december and i was given a 0week estimate to switch service .... after many weeks and lots of missed engineer appointments i received a text_message to say my order was cancelled .
negative	i called them to be told it was cancelled in error and they repeated the order for me .
negative	i was given a 0 week estimate for service ..... again many weeks_later and 0 missed appointments by the engineers , i yet again called .
negative	they have to cancel my appointment yet again and are blaming bt_openreach .
negative	maybe one day i will get the service i want .....
negative	i wish virgin_media was available in my area :(
negative	i found it cheaper to book direct with the ferry company .
negative	i bought a monitor using my own personal credit_card .
negative	on receipt i was not happy with it so returned it for full_refund at my own cost under dsr ( distance_selling_regulations ).
negative	this is a legal_requirement .
negative	ebuyer deducted a 00_% restocking_fee despite the fact that the monitor was paid for using a personal card with the billing_address being my home address .
negative	they claim the account is a business account , even_though it is abundantly clear this was a personal purchase , and will not back down .
negative	customer_support arrogant and unhelpful .
negative	ebuyer used to have a good reputation for customer service but no_longer .
negative	i suggest you take your business to a company that appreciates it .
negative	please be aware of the delivery time stated on product description page .
negative	the lg washer i purchesed stated 0 - 0 working_days , and once purchased , got a text to say it would be 0 working_days , they then had the audacity to charge me £_00 to get it delivered in that time ,( although it does state in terms and conditions , it may take longer ).
negative	being an elderly person i suppose i must be old_fashioned .
negative	but i try to avoid facebook like a plague .
negative	i am most baffled by the lazy computer speak so have problems trying to understand what is being said .
negative	but i completely object to the foul language that is so liberal on all pages .
negative	i find it most offensive and unwelcome .
negative	it should not be allowed but i blame the relaxed censorship rules for film and television some must get paid by the number of times they can swear .
negative	this was my first experience with ffx - i was advised goods had been despached - this morning i received an email to say the courier had been unable to deliver yesterday - yet i was in all day - they asked me to call a telephone_number and quote a reference from the card they had left - they did not leave a card - the telephone_number is 000_% automated , so i could not even speak to any one about the shipment - if i don_'_t leave the card out for collection , they say they will not re - deliver - totally_unsatisfactory and how do i get my goods ?
negative	tree has only been up two_days and there are hardly_any lights on it , and the middle section of the tree branches have fallen out from the centre pole , totally rubbish product , will now have to go and find another tree , would i use festive_lights again definitely no ….
negative	watchfinder offered a watch for sale on their website .
negative	i clicked to buy and at the checkout applied the discount_code from the voucher they sent me and progressed sale in the normal way .
negative	the next_day they called me and said they didn_'_t feel they would make enough money on the sale of the watch and wanted me to pay more money then we had already agreed on or they would cancel the sale !
negative	!
negative	trading_standards complaint registered and after talking to them they felt that watchfinder were in breach of contract and should have honour the sale agreement .
negative	this isn_'_t my first purchase from watchfinder , the first didn_'_t go smoothly either , i won_'_t use them again , shortsighted approach by watchfinder as i generally spend more than £ 0000 on watches a year but none of it will be going to them after this .
negative	this jean company is a fraud .
negative	they takes yer money then advise on their site that they '_ve emailed about ' availability '.
negative	their emails automatically go into spam - a problem , i subsequently found out , they are aware of .
negative	' availability ' email btw means no stock - and i believe they knew it when the order was taken on the website .
negative	the email is a fulsome standard email ready to send .
negative	so when you phone the phone rings for six minutes unanswered .
negative	then automatically cuts off .
negative	you can do this continuously all morning and you won_'_t get an answer .
negative	so with no ' apparent ' email or answering of the phone i was about to phone my bank for a chargeback .
negative	when amazingly someone answered !
negative	it was emma .
negative	she pointed me to the spam problem after resending the email .
negative	yes it arrived in spam ; she said the goods would be available 00 june !
negative	which if they arrived in august would mean an order process spanning three_months !
negative	i suggested that they knew they couldn_'_t fulfill the order when i first made it - and suggested they have a word with their it people to prevent orders at the point of payment .
negative	emma was mostly polite - and said they were too_busy to answuer the phone .
negative	she said they had to contact the warehouse blah_blah_blah .
negative	she could only say they were busy in response to asking her why they don_'_t answer the phone .
negative	this is serial non answering of the phone !
negative	more than three_days of trying !
negative	in 0 minute chunks - carrying the phone on ' speaker ' - even into the loo !
negative	i asked her to refund the credit_card and told her that their business model lacks honesty and integrity ( sucks !).
negative	she seemed to suggest that because their jeans are cheap , then it '_s ok to mess you around .
negative	no !
negative	emma !
negative	it '_s still retail - and it '_s still contract law .
negative	she slammed down the phone .
negative	any guesses as to how long my credit_card refund will take ?
negative	i was about to arrange a chargeback when they eventually answered .

negative	sandrove brahams & co manage a block of flats near me , and where my garage is located .
negative	they are responsible for managing the estate - and it '_s allegedly managed by a ' director ' ( so he told me !
negative	).
negative	over the years they have replaced the entry system and each time they don_'_t consider it important to keep the garage owners informed .
negative	if i '_m away from home - i can neither get access to my car , or park it .
negative	the garages are leased from the leaseholder - who brahams say they advise of the changes ; but i have never been advised of them .
negative	the leasholder only collects the ground rent and is completely disinterested in keeping the garage ' owners ' informed .
negative	the ' director ' insists that the leaseholder provides the information - but at the end of the day i am denied access unexpectedly at any time day or night – and to date it has happened three_times - when in the past brahams have provided it - i have even given them my email address for advance_warning .
negative	on one occasion i tore my trousers climbing over the gate at 0am – what else can i do ?
negative	over the years i have reported on unauthorised parking at this block of flats ; ensured the gate is closed when left wide open ; reported when the access system breaks_down ; cleared up unauthorised dumping at the bins - and generally been a surrogate caretaker .
negative	but no more - unhelpfulness begets unhelpfulness .
negative	if you have a block of flats that require managing , i suggest you go_elsewhere - find a more helpful company .
negative	unfortunately my first experience with them was rather sad - i found them to be unprofessional , chaotic and rude .
negative	my partner wanted to take ( adult ) tap lessons with this ' studio '.
negative	their website says that someone is available in the office during restricted hours .
negative	after many attempts all i got was their answer machine so i left a message .
negative	after no return of call and about a week_later i left another more exasperated message .
negative	i also made further calls to try and make contact - and i ' caught ' their office worker who told me her name but it escapes me .
negative	she apologised - yes she heard the call on the answer machine and would have to phone me back in the evening as she didn_'_t have the details to hand .
negative	at_least to her credit she did phone back earlier_than promised with the details and said she would send an invoice - and a joiner '_s package .
negative	after a further two_weeks - the course started next week - still no package had arrived - or no invoice .
negative	( they seem very keen to send an ' invoice ' when we wanted all the details .)
negative	unfortunately a further call was required this time answered by someone reluctant to give her name - until pressed .
negative	miss xxx was the reply .
negative	( am i an adult or a child ?).
negative	well i said i am mr charlie then .
negative	' miss xxx ' did not believe a word i said and was more interested in challenging the above details than sending me the joiner '_s package - she suggested it had got lost in the post ( i order a lot on the internet and nothing has_been lost to date ) - and challenged my message - leaving technique saying mobile messages are difficult to understand ( i was using a landline ) .
negative	and that they are often unclear ( i very deliberately and slowly give my telephone_number - and slowly repeat it again at the end ).
negative	she denied that messages had gone unheeded - ( remember her office worker had acknowledged one of the calls ).
negative	i said i resented being called a liar - and she slammed the phone down .
negative	i was so incensed that i phoned her back and told her to forget the invoice as my partner was no_longer interested in learning with such a chaotic organisation .
negative	' miss xxx ' said i was being rude - no miss xxx , i was frustrated - and i was not rude .
negative	and she slammed the phone down again .
negative	my partner will not be doing adult tap with the south_london dance studios
negative	don_'_t even touch this software if you have a bog_standard laptop or medium spec desktop .
negative	you '_ll get all_sorts of white / blank screens with flickering video when it does decide to display something and many messages indicating your system is unable to cope - as it ' de - tunes ' your performance .
negative	support is useless - i am still trying to fathom out the response to one of my queries requesting to know if my ' bundle ' was bona_fide licensed software ( i was getting emails saying ' xx days left of trial_period ' - buy soon !).
negative	emails are ( eventually ) responded to by non - english personnel so stuff gets lost in translation !
negative	if you do get a refund just make_sure you refuse to send your credit_card_details in the post as they requested me to do .
negative	and you '_ll have to pay return postage even_though their t &_cs say otherwise - and even if the dvd they send is out of date - and you have to download it anyway .
negative	the software takes_ages to install - and even longer to uninstall .
negative	beware too when buying online .
negative	the price is quoted when you use a voucher_code - but removes the voucher when you login to their site - £_00 more !
negative	this is because you might have used it before - but you are not told .
negative	my partner could have purchased it making a different transaction .
negative	so in summary_: wait_until you can_afford a supercomputer ; can speak german fluently ; can_afford to spend hours waiting for godot ; don_'_t mind being fleeced ; and can spend hours trying to understand things .
negative	if it ends up as just an unused icon on your desktop ( how many have we got of these !)
negative	then don_'_t say you '_ve not been_warned .
negative	just a last word .
negative	don_'_t just take this review '_s word for it do a double_check on the manufacturers name and check out the grief .
negative	i wish i had !
negative	unfortunately one of our suppliers use city - link and so often the parcels are not delievered next - day as the driver ' runs out of time '.
negative	i could understand this happening once , but we find this happens on probably half our orders .
negative	i feel sorry for the drivers as they often get the brunt of it , but they are being sent out with far too many parcels - why cant city_link send out more drivers .
negative	its fine for them to just at a call_centre and say ' sorry driver ran_out of time , he will try again tomorrow ' but if you have to sit in day after day waiting , it costs time and money .
negative	as a delivery company stands , find an_alternative company .
negative	i hate to say that as they use to be very good .
negative	poor service unlikely to use again
negative	no goods , no response from the company after 0 email .
negative	have to get money back from credit_card .
negative	will place a complaint with consumerdirect . gov . uk .
negative	more should do this .
negative	no notice that one of my orders was not a availiable and also instructed to deliver order to neighbour which never happened and had to go and collect myself
negative	after nearly 00 months of supplying meter_readings they still give me an estimated gas bill .
negative	e_- mails to customer_services disappear into a big black_hole .
negative	i have had to phone them to submit readings despite_being promised that i would be able to do it on - line .
negative	i can '_t express how poor their accounts_department seems to be .
negative	anyway , after 00 months of rubbish customer service , i '_m off to another supplier .
negative	goodbye first_utility , it hasn_'_t been fun .
negative	we dispatch our goods world wide and have collections from every courier company available in the uk , all the other drivers park outside and walk up to the first floor to collect our goods without_any_problems .
negative	hermes do not , they park down the road , or behind the office and wont walk up the stairs to collect from us ...
negative	upon ringing the main office the response was " our drivers are not allowed to leave their vans ".
negative	as a delivery company surely this policy does not make any sense , how do the drivers delivery to the customer ?
negative	come on hermes , step it up please .
negative	i '_ve emailed and requested callbacks and no response .
negative	possibly the worst customer service on the internet .
negative	i '_m having to resort to talking to my bank now to cancel payment .
negative	00 . 00 . 00 : i '_m still_waiting for a refund .
negative	someone did reply and told me a refund would be made and when i chased them four weeks_later he told me he could not tell me when a refund would be made .
negative	i have now sent a request into barclays to do a chargeback on the payment .
negative	i really can understand how a company like this can still be in business .
negative	i bought a new husqvarna cth000 ride on mower from abbey_garden sales at the end of june and had nothing but problems !
negative	the pre delivery inspection wasn_'_t done properly so it was delivered without an english_manual , 0 other handbooks in 00 languages , and i don_'_t speak any of them !
negative	i rang the abbey and they said they ' d put one in the post , they didn_'_t .
negative	0_weeks_later the deck belt broke , i rang again .
negative	they said it wasn_'_t covered_under the warranty so i had to fork_out over £_00 for a new one , they posted it free with the manual .
negative	once i read the manual , i realised it should have come with a bioplug , for the cutting deck , also missed on the pdi .
negative	i rang them again , they eventually got back to me to say they ' d put one in the post .
negative	it arrived within a couple of days .
negative	i fitted the new belt this week and it was cutting fine , until one of the blades broke !
negative	looks_like a fatigue fracture .
negative	i wondered_if that was covered_under_warranty ?
negative	it was .
negative	0_weeks since the blade broke .
negative	i ' d chased it up but abbey just kept giving excuses .
negative	husqvarna told my supplier that it is covered_under_warranty but it still didn_'_t arrive !
negative	i usually rely_on this months holiday to get my garden and paddocks in order for the autumn , but as the mower has_been unusable for the whole of august , i had no chance of doing it .
negative	i bought this machine to solve my problems , not add to them .
negative	after waiting for 0_weeks i got fed_up with all abbeys excuses , got husqvarna involved and they sent me a new blade themselves and it arrived the next_day , as abbey still hadn_'_t sent one .
negative	abbey made no effort to contact me , i had to chase them for everything .
negative	poor customer service and they couldn_'_t even say sorry !
negative	i ordered 0 identical bouquets , one was ok the other was half the size of the first !!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	00000000000
negative	i ordered flowers for my wife '_s birthday last friday and they did not turn_up , i telephoned them twice during the day of supposed delivery .
negative	i was assured that they would be delivered before 0pm and they did not arrive .
negative	i telephoned their customer service and after some wrangling i managed to get them to agree to a full_refund and i would be able keep the flowers when the eventually turned_up .
negative	the flowers were eventually delivered on the following_monday , by the next friday nearly all of the flowers were dying ( so much for their 0 day fresh promise ) and the so called full_refund had not materialised .
negative	i had to phone them again and ask for the refund again - their only redeeming_feature is that i was given the refund straight_away but they were not bothered about the state of the flowers .
negative	i definitely will not be using this company ever again .
negative	won_'_t buy from them again .
negative	i bought a windows 0 pro disc which unregistered and uninstalled they won_'_t accept back for replacement with the correct 00 bit disc because it '_s apparently a consumable .
negative	it '_s still exactly the same product , fully working and brand_new but ebuyer follow there set rules with no flexibility or help .
negative	very poor .
negative	reply to reply :
negative	thanks for you reply .
negative	i wasn_'_t looking for an_apology i was looking for help .
negative	but the best you have to offer is ' it '_s stated in our terms and conditions ', which is a bit sad .
negative	if ever i have a client come to me and say that the product we supplied to him is of absolutely no use to them and they are now out of pocket to the full value of that product , that the product we supplied to them is still new , fully_functional and has not been ' consumed ' in any way and that we could swap that product for the correct one without_any consequence to us , then i hope i will do just that rather_than referring them to our terms and conditions .
negative	but hey each to there own .
negative	you stick with it .
negative	if completely alienating your customers for absolutely no reason is keeping you in business then who am i to suggest your terms and conditions suck .
negative	not that i read them or need to now because i won_'_t be spending any more of my money at ebuyer .
negative	i bought a mobile_phone from cash_generator and it was filled with explicit pictures and videos .
negative	my daughter age 00 found the phone , turned it on and looked through it as she knew this was her christmas_present .
negative	she is now asking what these pictures are and all cash_generators did was give ten_pounds refund .
negative	i '_ve never seen such a poor sorry looking bunch of flowers .
negative	what made it worse was i had to assemble it myself , not being a qualified florist you could imagine my frustration in my attempt to recreate the picture on the website .
negative	to make_matters_worse the card i purchased was water_damaged and left the writing illegible .
negative	all together a very unhappy valentine .
negative	this is an update to my previous review please read that one .
negative	on the advice of trading_standards to try and resolve my problem as mentioned in my review basicly the pixels were missing on my galaxy_note 0 after 0 months and went to cw for repair under_warranty and came back with a crack in the screen which was not there when they took the phone from me ( they were responsible for the crack ) anyway on ts advice i wrote to the managing_director by recorded delivery that letter which was signed for by this company has_been totally_ignored , not ever the courtesy of a reply i have sent another letter by recorded delivery will see what happens now .. then i am_afraid it off to court i have to say before i took the contract for the phone they were very helpful but once signed on the dotted_line customer service just doesn_'_t exist with these so called professionals anyone_thinking_about using these_people read all the reviews on this site and all over the web first i wish i had .
negative	after all this i have just received an email from this joke company bearing in mind they damaged my phone this is the response i got also the two letters mentioned were sent by recorded delivery to the managing_director not the sender of this email as he seems to think ... read this : and think before you fall for it .
negative	i regret that we will not be able to reach an amicable resolution to your complaint .
negative	i feel that we have reached a position of deadlock , as i am unable to overturn the decision made by our repairs centre .
negative	in terms of the two letters that you have advised you have sent to carphone_warehouse ; if these letters have been received in our central office , it is possible that they have not reached our department yet .
negative	please_accept our apologies if this is the case .
negative	i will arrange for a letter of final response and deadlock to be issued to your home address within 0 - 00 days .
negative	please_accept my apologies that we are unable to further your complaint .

negative	the idea of being_able to watch sky_tv on your laptop anywhere sounds_like a great idea right ?
negative	well it would be if it wasnt such a drag to watch something online .
negative	it starts well and you find what you want to watch , this is where is all goes downhill .
negative	you click watch and they are bombarded with about 0 or 0 adverts .. always the same ones by the way .. so it soon becomes very annoying if you like to watch sky go quite a bit .
negative	then just when you think its all going well and your enjoying your programme , it stops around 00_mins in ... to yes youve guessed it , to show you some more adverts .. so you go and make a cuppa , and when you come_back it says its bufffering .... but not just for a few_seconds or even minutes ?
negative	it seams to be downloading the whole of the 0nd part before it will play it ?
negative	meaning your sat watching a blank screen for what can be 0 mins + ...
negative	in the end you just think ah sod this and switch it off , well i did any way ... and it does this quite often ... the player is the worst player ive_ever_seen used on the web by anyone , and sky are meant to be one of the biggest out there so youd think they would have the best player !
negative	any well_done sky youve ruined the experience !
negative	i signed_up with the promise of a no deposit bonus , only for it to never be credited , how do they get away with it ?
negative	very poor .. i `_ll take my business elsewhere !
negative	i would say stay well clear of this website , i signed_up through google because they promise you ' free £_00 now ' but after i signed_up , no sign of this bonus , and after_speaking to online help i was told i had to wait 00_hours , so fair_enough , after pointing_out that they may want to change the google advertising as it was misleading i left and waited 00_hours , still no bonus , after_speaking with online help i was told i should have got the bonus straight_away ?
negative	so i said fair_enough just give it to me now then ?
negative	ah not as easy as that , it will now take 00_hours ... and so on it went ... being_fobbed_off and continuously asked if id like to make a desposit and they would give me another bonus ?
negative	to which i declined as if they cant give you their promised sign up bonus , who `_s to say you will get any bonus from these_guys ?
negative	stay well clear !
negative	i sent you an email asking if you use fake as the jean_paul aftershave doesn_'_t smell like the one i had previously and you haven_'_t responded !
negative	booked with interparcel , paid them but asked to take the parcel to the ups depot to save waiting about .
negative	ups take parcel and say all fine with it , then interparcel call and say ups wont take it as the parcel contains a bike , which i disclosed clearly when booking the parcel .
negative	i explain that the ups department already have the parcel and were told it contained a bike was and they had no problem .
negative	when its then in transit i get an email from interparcel to say the contents aren_'_t covered_under the insurance i was charged for .
negative	then almost a week_later another email asking for an extra £_00 ( 000_% of the original charge on top ) due to the box supposedly being 0cm longer , 0 cm taller and 0cm wider than stated .
negative	this is madness as i used a decent stanley tape_measure to take the box sizes and rounded them up before booking the parcel , ditto the same with the weight before i looked for a courier .
negative	thankfully i also took pictures of the box before sending so i can prove the size and weight , lets_see if interparcel or ups can ?
negative	suprisingly bad service experienced from wiggle when purchasing a bike , started with their courier firm who have an appalling tracking_system who confirmed bike would be delivered between_0am and 0pm but kept me in all day only to see on their system at 00pm that the delivery driver had been too_busy to deliver it .
negative	bike then turns_up with what looks_like factory damage to the gear cable , then follows a 0 day charade of being told customer_services are too_busy to reply , asked for their help as needed a bike for the weekend and nothing .
negative	on top of the damage the bike was in a size fit for a giant and it would have been helpful if one member of staff when asked could have advised that 00ers come up very big compared to a 00 " mountain_bike .
negative	asked for their guidance on selecting a replacement as stock_levels low and few sizes and was just sent a link to their web_site , bikes now gone back and waiting for guidance on how to proceed .
negative	for an online business to be a success it needs to be more effective than wiggle , nobody is that bothered they don_'_t / wont answer the phone if at_least they are responsive to electronic communications - but unfortunately they are not .
negative	these flowers were sold as a bouquet .
negative	there was not one opened bloom amongst the lot .
negative	my wife received a so called bouquet consisting of miserable green_leaves and unopened buds which compared very poorly with flowers she received from other_suppliers ..
negative	i would not buy through serenata_flowers again .
negative	the advertised flowers showed no_resemblance to those supplied and i feel that my experience with serenata_flowers is close to false pretences or at_least one of misrepresentation .
negative	really disappointed that the product i wanted was no_longer available , it has_been out of production for over 0 years .
negative	when i saw it on the site i thought it must have been back , but no was informed the product does no_longer exist
negative	although the product was as_described i paid extra to guarentee delivery on a specific day however it turned_up 0 days late even_though it was on [_link_] tracked service .
negative	not impressed
negative	fantastic substitute for cigarettes but it stopped_working after one week so won_'_t be purchasing anything_else from liberty_flights
negative	you pulled my truthfully review off the site with out emailing me .
negative	all i have done is give a honest review !!!
negative	is that not the site is for !!!
negative	!
negative	or is it just to say good things !
negative	i seem to have ordered about £_000 worth of products over the last couple of months ,
negative	i ordered 0 latches that i seem not to have arrived !!!!!
negative	royal_mail post seem to never loose anything !!!!
negative	!,
negative	to be then rung up and questioned by some person about it , in a tone of that it seems very strange that they have got lost .
negative	they can keep the £_00 latches , i don_'_t seem to like being felt_like i am a lier and cheat .
negative	most of the products are not in stock they have to order them and then send them out .
negative	i won_'_t use you again
negative	got no confirmation_email so tried to ask their customer_services but they haven_'_t responded for ages .
negative	useless .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	decent produce and prices but they just can not deliver on time .
negative	last_week 00_mins late this week 0 hours late .
negative	customer_services are jammed and everyone blames someone_else .
negative	back to tesco for me - the quality may be lacking but at_least you get to eat !
negative	faulty device - wrote for advise - did not here a word - oh - device was for a friend .
negative	paid £_00 for a package to be delivered from gloucester to leeds saturday delivery - so urgent .
negative	no communication to me - package in hatfield delayed .
negative	recipient got through to a human after 0 attempts on an 0000 number to be told the vanhad broken down so it wasnt just us affected and it might arrive on monday .
negative	they boast they have 0000 vans .
negative	do yourself a favour - dont use - suggest we start compensation campaign < sensitive data_removed_>
negative	their " order and collect next_day in store " option is a lie .
negative	you will be told on the website that your item will be available to collect next_day , you will be told repeatedly on the phone that this is correct .
negative	it '_s not , it '_s a lie .
negative	you will have to wait 0 - 0 working_days during which time you cannot cancel the order and no explaination will be given .
negative	do not order online with them .
negative	hice dos transferencia y hoy 00 / 00 /_0000 en mi cuenta hay un cargo por una cuenta en internet que no hice .
negative	creo que los datos fueron sacados de ésta página , ahora tengo que ir a la policía .
negative	nada es seguro por internet .
negative	delivery guaranteed before_noon fine - flowers arrived 00 . 00 .
negative	outward presentation not impressive - a plain_brown cardboard_box .
negative	no sign of promised preservatives to add to water .
negative	as expected the flowers were mainly buds , but they opened at different times , and the lilies which were what drew me to order this item have not opened 0 days_later , while the roses are dying .
negative	the bouquet has simply never looked good , overall a disappointment .
negative	i have also experienced really bad customer service from superfi .
negative	i bought a humax dtrt0000 / 0tb via another on - line retailer , thought it was so good i wanted another , they were out of stock , so i searched the web & found " superfi ", never_heard of them before but they had listed what i wanted .
negative	so i clicked , added to basket , checked out , paid via_paypal - job_done with free next_day delivery , happy days !
negative	instant_response from paypal stating the money had left my account .
negative	i refreshed my emails , clicked send / receive several_times ... nothing from superfi , ok , bit_worrying , but ok .
negative	the nextday , the delivery day , i still hadnt received any email or any response from superfi , so i called them .
negative	first i tried their 0000 number ( fabulous a company with a free phone number ).
negative	recorded_message stated there was no one available to take my call & duly cut me off .
negative	that was option 0 on their list , so thought i ' d try option 0 their sales line ...... nope , silly me , after trying several_times on every available option & constantly getting cut_off ... i slowly started to panic , i ' d paid this company i '_ve never_heard of before a few_hundred_quid of my hard_earned_cash & now i could_find anyone who cared enough to answer the telephone .
negative	i telephoned their nottingham store to ask if they were still in business , apparently they were , and the very helpful chap gave_me another number to call , not all bad ... could have just been me !
negative	i called the other number .
negative	the chap stated no i wouldnt have received any emails the item is out of stock , apparently i should have checked their stock_levels before placing the order ... strange !
negative	i placed the order , they took my money , the deal was that they would deliver the next_day for free .... its the next_day & they ' re telling_me its not going to be delivered .
negative	i asked to speak to his_supervisor & was told " oh he '_ll only tell you ...." thanks but i '_ll have a chat with him anyway if thats ok with you .
negative	i did & was told that as i ' d paid them via_paypal and the item was out of stock , they ' d email me when it was in stock & notify_me of the delivery day then .
negative	he couldnt understand_why i was getting annoyed .
negative	explain please why i '_ve placed my order , paid my hard_earned & you '_ve not even sent me an acknowledgment email as a courtessay ?
negative	explain_why your system took the order & didnt tell me that you were out of stock ?
negative	explain_why i should check your stock_levels ?
negative	explain what your company pays you for ... what exactly do you do ?
negative	customer service manager is poorly_trained & dosent understand customer service , offered to pop round with a customer return product to replace the one i ' d ordered and refund £ 0 ..... nah , thanks , but ... i ordered new & kind of thats what i ' d like .
negative	i '_ll wait the week for you to get it back into stock , and spend the day i wrote off to wait in for the delivery publishing my experience with your company on - line , if thats ok with you ?
negative	after all , you '_ve got my money , you agreed to supply a product via next_day delivery and have entered into a contract as such , and you ' re now in breach of contract .
negative	would i spend anymore money with this company , no thanks .
negative	customer service just isnt there in relation to their on - line sales , retail sales staff are of course a different breed and do actually give a damn , which is unfortunate as sorry guys , but its now a company thing for me , i '_ll avoid you all .
negative	sorry .
negative	update in response to superfi '_s response :-
negative	really amusing that of course its the customers fault as he " didnt see " hidden away information_relating to the companies stock_levels , nothing what so ever to do with my " order was accepted on a next_day delivery basis " & that no attention was drawn to the fact that the item was out of stock .
negative	my order was accepted & payment made on the basis of next_day delivery , therefore a contract is in place & the company is required to deliver in line with that which was agreed , the company failed to do so and is therefore in clear breach of contract , and in my view should have made amends swiftly & openly .
negative	i '_ve repeatedly stated that i received no correspondance what so ever in relation to my initial order , strangely , in english , this means that i received no correspondance what so ever from superfi in relation to my initial order , what part of that superfi dont get is beyond me .
negative	it '_s quite wrong for people to assume things , causes all_sorts of problems .
negative	this is further highlighted by the fact that the customer service manager aledgedly repeated all of the steps i made to test out the system and also received no emails - my experience in relation to this is that i received no emails from superfi at all in relation to this initial purchase , which means nothing went to my spam_folder either - i received no emails in relation to my initial order .
negative	your reference to " we believe you normally work from home ?
negative	", yet another assumption that is incorrect , i run a very successful company thats built up a reputation based on 000_% customer_satisfaction , not that its any of your business or that you would know anything about that .
negative	glad that you '_ve confirmed that for the second_hand unit that you offered me you offered a £ 0 discount .
negative	i ordered a new product , i paid for a new product , i expected a new product .
negative	do you really think i ' d accept less_than a 0 . 0 %_discount to take a second_hand unit ?
negative	who would ?
negative	however , had you applied the same percentage discount as you claim was applied to the original rrp of the product to the 0nd_hand unit then that would have been a far more reasonable approach and one possibly worth considering .
negative	there was no offer of a loan product , there was an attempt to talk me into taking the 0nd_hand unit & returning it under the " distance_selling rules " if i wasnt happy later .
negative	but certainly no offer of " here take this one until yours arrives & we '_ll pick ours up later " as implied .
negative	you dont get a second chance to make a first impression , i wont be shopping with superfi again .
negative	as audio_visual is part of what my company does i ' d say superfi have lost out .
negative	whilst writing this update i have recieved an email from superfi stating that my order has joined the que for picking , the first email in relation to this purchase & have a guess_what .... it didnt go into my spam_folder either !!
negative	lets_hope that the product is in good order when it arrives , if not we '_ll end up in the court arena to resolve_matters as i '_m fed_up with such bad customer service & a clear breach of contract .
negative	customers dont have to put up with bad service , and i wont put up with it .
negative	i should state in fairness that the service that i received from the retail side of this company in specfic relation to this situation and their attempts to try & resolve_matters , was entirely decent & genuine , a shame this cant be reflected to the web side of this company .
negative	bought 0 strip_lights via ebay , the photo showed 0 tubes inside the lights , the description referred to " tubes " plural , therefore its acceptable and perfectly reasonable for me to rely_on the phot & description - which i duly did .
negative	i received 0x strip_lights with only one light in each one , not what was ordered .
negative	i telephoned the company to let them know of their mistake , only to be very rudely_told to " get a life , go to b_& q and buy another light " and was then told to " go forth & multiply " ( only not quite so politely ) and the phone was put down on me !
negative	how rude ?
negative	what level of customer service could this be possibly described as ?
negative	the matter has_been reported to ebay who are passing the matter onto their security team and also to derbyshire trading_standards .
negative	would i buy from or recommend this company to anyone_else , not a chance !
negative	follow_up : following factual feedback left for this company on the website on which it trades i have received several abusive emails .
negative	perhaps the owner of the company has never_heard of the offence of " sending a malicious communication ".
negative	i '_ve then received an email_telling_me i need to amend this review , clearly a complaint was received pointing at a minor technicality ( the owners language directed at me and duly accurately reported on here ).
negative	whilst the owner of the company appears quite ready to spout abuse at people , he clearly doesnt like it when people report the facts of the matter for all to see , accurately & truthfully .
negative	maybe he wont be quite so quick in future to treat people in the manner in which he treated me , but then maybe i '_ll win the lottery this week !
negative	further follow_up : the owner of the company continues to object to factual feedback left for his company .
negative	i have therefore made my own objections to the manner in which this chap continues to have the factual feedback left by many about his company removed for no reason .
negative	kingston 00gb class 00 microsdhc card £_00 . 00 delivered , i bought two for £_00 . 00 delivered , checked out via_paypal & the amount changed from £_00 . 00 to £_00 . 00 .
negative	cost me £ 0 + to phone them to cancel the order - disgraceful service from a uk company , will never be buying from them again .
negative	customer service very slow too .
negative	driver could not find proper address and delivered a card to totally wrong_address
negative	i returned your printer because it isn_'_t producing the acceptable print quality , and asked for a full_refund .
negative	you received it four days ago .
negative	i have not received any other message nor my refund .
negative	here is the reference again :
negative	rma ( r00000 ) - product received our ref :{ 0apzl0rh00
negative	i will not be buying from you again
negative	b . t .
negative	for far too long have got away with ' blue - murder ' an out dated , over priced broadband service that is a disgrace for a once leader in communications .
negative	i f you do not live in the london area do not expect good service from this awfull company .
negative	the quality of service virgin gives leaves an awful_lot to be desired , to date i have attempted to set_up a direct_debit with them five times to no_avail , the ' cannot care - less atitude ' is awful for such a big company ... shame on you branson
negative	most products have little or no details regarding sale item , site security crazy .
negative	they could not supply the item i ordered .
negative	a waste of time .
negative	i ordered a completely standard pair of glasses on 00th .
negative	september with a website promise of 0 days delivery .
negative	here i am practically a month later and am still_waiting !
negative	!
negative	i put in a support request for ' where is my order ' and three_days_later was advised ,
negative	" please_accept our apologies for the delay of your spectacles , there has_been a delay of the lenses for your spectacles .
negative	we assume your glasses should be with you till the end of next week ."
negative	apart_from making very little sense i ' assume ' my glasses will not be delivered until the 00th .
negative	october , fully five weeks after they were ordered .
negative	five weeks_ago they banked my money and i '_ve received nothing .
negative	well , my friend , what do you think of it so_far ?
negative	rubbish
negative	communicating via_email when i want tp talk through best options / how to best avoid issues is not really customer friendly
negative	if i could give them - 0_star i would have done that .
negative	i bought an hourly from a freelancer , which he didn_'_t completed , hourly said 000 genuine facebook likes and i got likes from everywhere and a lot of fake accounts .
negative	peopleperhour paid this freelancer without my consent and after sending email got a reply saying it was invoiced 0 days agao and not paid .
negative	when i contacted them they replied :
negative	thank_you for your message .
negative	we are sorry for the inconvenience_caused .
negative	we understand your concern , however please_note that if the invoice remains unpaid for 0 days then our system will automatically processes it and transfers the escrow amount to seller .
negative	this is why we suggest all our buyers to reject the invoice , if the work is not completed .
negative	i '_m afraid that it is not possible to refund the amount back to escrow .
negative	we do not have much control over the funds that are release from the escrow .
negative	however we recommend that you contact your seller on the workstream to explain_why you are seeking a refund .
negative	in many cases sellers will look to work with you to resolve the issues .
negative	please let_me know if i can help you with anything_else .
negative	so after spending money and not completed work , i have to chase this freelancer and peopleperhour got their share , they never contacted me on any occasion to tell that i have to cancel invoice or it will be paid .
negative	they never replied to me after my second reply
negative	well thank_you very much for your crap service by people per hour customer service team , so buyers_beware : wise men learn from history ; fools from experience .
negative	i have used this company a few_times and every time had problems , parcel not collected on time , parcels not delivered on time , i can reach them only by chat , latest package was lost , had to do all the legwork for them and send all the documents , it took me about a day or 0 to get this sorted and finally refunded .
negative	people on the chat were not clear enough , after 0 days they still could not confirm where my package , is it lost , misplaced , broken .
negative	i will never ever use this company again .
negative	plant ordered for christmas to relatives in australia not delivered .
negative	very poor customer service and after many emails received refund a month later with no explanation of the problem .
negative	will never use floraqueen again !!
negative	!
negative	" all that glitters is not gold " - i purchased tyres on the basis of the positive_experiences of most customers .
negative	the prices on offer were very competitive and i could see no reason not to trust this organisation .
negative	oponeo did not deliver the tyres that i ordered !!.
negative	oponeo would not replace the tyres delivered until they were returned and inspected , or alternatively placed a new order ( at a cost of another £_000 )!
negative	as my mot was due imminently i was left high and dry and forced to buy locally .
negative	please_note that it cost me £_00 less to do this via my local_garage !
negative	communications were poor and i spent lots of time calling to chase them up to no_avail .
negative	it was over 0 month before i received my money back on the original purchase , and i received no offer of compensation for my bad_experience .
negative	decided to place an order for a water rowing_machine costing_£_000 as it looked cheap .
negative	finally received the product yesterday , not only with packaging in poor condition but also with half the rower missing .
negative	the guy_who delivered it said there was definately only one box ( paperwork said box 0 of 0 ), and duly dumped the product on the drive and cleared off .
negative	i then had the nightmare experience of actually trying to speak to someone at amazon , is anyone actually employed on customer service , no human voice can be found ?
negative	gave up in the end , and returned to the amazon website to try and arrange a collection and refund , a much_easier process than trying to find someone to talk to , but again no option shown for a part delivered product .
negative	amazingly , on requesting a refund last night , my wife gets a call today from amazon , confirming they have located our missing box ( after saying there was only one box ) and would arrange a second delivery ( another day of work for my wife ).
negative	stay well clear of this outfit , bad delivery company , poor packaging , non_existent customer service , no compensation offered to us for having to take a further day off work .
negative	they may look cheap , but when you factor in the cost of their awful customer service , you will regret you didnt go_elsewhere .
negative	0 - 0pm deliveries - delivery wasnt going to get into london until 0 . 00 - 0pm which was unacceptable , the florist they used didnt get order from e_- florist until 0 in the afternoon .
negative	had to cancel and re - arrange with local_florist to where it needed to go .
negative	i was at first impressed by such a huge product range available so thought i would take_advantage and buy a few items .
negative	the order process was great , but shortly_after ordering i received an email_saying the items i ordered are out of stock and the order will be shipped once all items have arrived in 00 days .
negative	it would have been nice to know that the items i was ordering were out of stock ., i now understand_why their product range is so vast ... because most of it isn_'_t actually in stock yet they still sell it .
negative	i ordered hoping that the order would arrive within a week for a special_occasion but because of the out of stock items the order wouldn_'_t arrive until after the date needed , so i emailed customer_support asking if they could send the rest of the items straight_away and i will pay for additional postage ... but i never received a reply .
negative	i have now emailed 0 times and tried to call numerous_times ( the phone is always engaged ).
negative	i guess i will just have to buy elsewhere that will be able to send me my items in a reasonable amount of time and just have extra '_s once bodyjewelleryshop decide to send me my order .
negative	i booked two flights one for myself and one for my partner from beijing to kuala_lumpur however the site crashed and timed out .
negative	like other_reviewers the booking process could have only taken 0 minutes and budget_air are more than happy to take your money !
negative	budget_air then charged my credit_card for each flight ( 0x £_000 . 00 ) informing_me i would have a refund within 00_hours for both charges .
negative	one charge was refunded and the other has not .
negative	i have called the call_centre multiple_times .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	no answer !
negative	i have emailed their customer_services .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	no answer !
negative	the impression i get from this is budget_air conduct themselves in an unscrupulous and dishonest manner with no regard to customer_services .
negative	i also believe this could be argued to be theft .
negative	budget_air – please can you refund my £_000 . 00
negative	i ordered a replacement battery as00a00 and on your sheet it states genuine spare_part , so i checked your spec . sheet and it states classic power as00a00 laptop battery , and below it says acer as00a00 but that is not what was delivered it was ml0000 comparable .
negative	also i didn_'_t want express delivery and then it states it cannot send send it so add another £ 0 or £ 0 instead of the lower rate .
negative	i have also e_- mailed them twice but no response i don_'_t think this is a way to run a business .
negative	also it won_'_t let_me not accept the terms and conditions
negative	i ordered a new apple_iphone_0s on t - mobile contract .
negative	their website says if you order by 0pm , you will receive your phone next_day .
negative	i ordered on thursday 0pm , received the phone on saturday_morning .
negative	so not too bad .
negative	but what i received was a used iphone0s , which had been reasealed .
negative	i noticed that the transparent seals in front and back did not sit correctly , and under them the phone was full of fingerprints , and a half inch scratch in the back .
negative	also there was dust under the seals , the camera lens had dirt on it , as well as the sides had signs of use .
negative	i have bought apple products before and always admired how prisitine condition they arrive .
negative	this was definitely not packaged by apple .
negative	i have used buymobilephones in the past and they have always been brilliant .
negative	oh why i did not use google before ordering !
negative	i ordered two_pairs of sunglasses 00 days before going on holiday .
negative	i traveled abroad for two_weeks on friday , the glasses had arrived on saturday .
negative	when i got back , i noticed that not only they did not have a tint but centering etc .
negative	was not correct so i could not use them .
negative	and of course the return period was over so i lost £_00 .
negative	apparently my neighbour should have tested them during the cool off period .
negative	not happy with this company .
negative	i ordered a camera lens off them over £ 0000 worth .
negative	their website said it was in stock .
negative	they say it will be shipped in 0 - 0 days but could take 0 - 00 days .
negative	they took the money out of my account right away , the lens was not in stock or it would have been sent out to me .
negative	i inform my credit_card company who said cancel the order .
negative	it took seven emails to get a response and then it was because i started to get really nasty with them .
negative	a waste of time ringing them as it '_s easier to get hold of elvis .
negative	they are then contacting me asking to lt them fulfill the order ; have it by the end of the week etc .
negative	remember the website said it was in stock .
negative	i said no refund me .
negative	although in my account status it says refund in progress three_days_later still no money transferred back into my account .
negative	do not think about ordering anything off this totally_useless oufit .
negative	booked on line following a recommendation .
negative	selected tnt as they indicated they could pick_up that day .
negative	no courier arrived .
negative	the following_morning on contacting interparcel . com i was told that the tnt driver had reported that our road was closed with no access to the property .
negative	i explained to interparcel . com that although south_west water were working on replacing the mains access to all properties was available and in fact our post was delivered every day and we had had tradesmen on site .
negative	the collection was rebooked for that day .
negative	again no collection was made .
negative	on calling interparcel . com i was told that the tnt driver had reported at 0pm that the road was closed and no access was possible .
negative	( this was now a friday ) this was not only a complete lie but showed a lack of integrity and downright laziness , particularly as i had myself been out and back twice already that day .
negative	in addition to a weak apology from interparcel . com they rebooked for collection on monday .
negative	i had a call from a tnt driver on monday_afternoon to ask for directions and he quite easily brought a 0 ton lorry almost to my door !!
negative	so who is kidding who ?
negative	interparcel . com stopped short of calling me a liar but clearly sided with the drivers .
negative	the tnt driver who finally collected the parcel was polite , pleasant and very apologetic for the hassle i had .
negative	he should be_congratulated on retrieving the situation .
negative	i doubt i will ever use interparcel . com again , so its back to the post_office
negative	i returned faulty etymotic earphones in april for replacement under_warranty and 0 months later have not received a replacement .
negative	worse though , stone audio have not responded to my emails chasing it up and when i call to enquire and they say they will call me back , they never have .
negative	they have provided no information when i '_ve asked for updates , so i now have to turn to my credit_card company to chargeback for a refund .
negative	i will never deal with this company again .
negative	stuffed full of traders - most of whose prices can be_beaten elsewhere .
negative	not a nice experience at all .
negative	i '_ve ordered lots of things on the internet , and apart_from a few minor quirks , all the transactions have been conducted in a professional_manner and very smoothly , but i guess we all get_stung sometimes , and i basically fell_into a massive bush of nettles with gameseek !
negative	!
negative	where to start ?!
negative	well ... i ordered heavy_rain for the ps0 , the full regular release , as was advertised on their website .
negative	i paid £ 0 for delivery , and after i was sent the dispatch email i received the game 0 whole working_days_later .
negative	0 working_days for £ 0 delivery on something that essentially is as light as a feather !
negative	it was sent by royal_mail 00 hour service , and probably cost them about £ 0 ... nice that they make a bit of money of their customers by doing this ... anyway ... when the game arrived i opened it , and in the jiffy was heavy_rain , move edition ... ps0 essentials release !
negative	completely not what i ordered , and i was super annoyed because it was a birthday_gift for somebody , and i had no time to get it replaced , and had to go out on a saturday_morning to buy them another game as a replacement .
negative	after emailing gameseek and posting the game back to them first thing on a monday_morning ( i received it on a friday ), i got a reply at about 00am on the monday giving me a return code to write on the package .
negative	i emailed back and said i ' d already posted it , but all the necessary_information was in the jiffy_bag , including their original dispatch note , so they would have all the necessary_information and know exactly who it was from .
negative	i stated fully and clearly that i wanted it exchanged for the full original release of the game , which is what i had ordered from them .
negative	i then got a reply_stating that as i hadn_'_t used the return code it would be quite possible the game would be sent back to me again !
negative	at this stage , not unreasonably , i started to get annoyed .
negative	i explained all the information was in the jiffy , and all they had to do was open it and read what was inside , and they would understand exactly_what had happened and what they needed to do .... but no ... i got another email quoting t &_c '_s to me !!
negative	customer service failure number 0 !
negative	when you make a mistake , don_'_t push this back on your customer and make them feel like they '_ve done something wrong !
negative	as you '_ve made the mistake , be accommodating and do whatever is necessary to rectify the problem .
negative	that way you '_ll earn their respect and they '_ll be happy that you ' re trying to help them , and there won_'_t be a problem .
negative	after a few niggly emails going back and forth i finally got a semi apology , and an assurance that they would do whatever they could to rectify the situation .
negative	i discovered several days_later , that their version of rectifying the situation was to cancel the order ( i received a refund from paypal ), and that was it , no further email from them , nothing .
negative	i assumed , when i saw the refund from paypal that it was just procedure , that they would refund that order and then dispatch the correct item and bill me again , but no , nothing at all .
negative	i specifically stated on several_occasions that i wanted the item replaced with the correct item that i had originally ordered , so again i emailed them a few_days_later , and asked what was happening , and was told they had just refunded the order and that was my lot basically .
negative	brilliant huh ?!
negative	customer service failure number 0 !
negative	if you can '_t dispatch the correct item for whatever_reason , a quick curteous email to the customer explaining this , perhaps with a small apology would go a long way !
negative	what the whole_thing boils down to , which is plain to see , is the fact that they never had the item that they were advertising in the first place , and i '_ve read on several other review sites that they '_ve done the very same thing to other customers as well , that is dispatch essentials releases of ps0_games when they ' re advertising the full original release .
negative	it '_s basically false_advertising , and lies i '_m sorry to say .
negative	i '_m really not an unreasonable guy , and if they ' d just been honest right from the off and said sorry but we don_'_t have the exact item you '_ve ordered , would you accept the essentials move edition instead , i would have said no but i would have appreciated their honesty , and we all could have moved on .
negative	what really annoyed me is the completely unprofessional manner in which they handled the entire_transaction , and it '_s what has prompted me to write something of this length , which i never normally do because i never have to .
negative	i '_m not going to start yelling things like " do not buy from these_people " because i '_m not like that , and as i said i '_m not an unreasonable guy , but all i can give you is my honest_opinion about my experience with gameseek , and it was nothing short of abysmal .
negative	i would never use them again , ever .
negative	my advice in a nutshell is to stick to the reputable_companies that we all know and love , and you won_'_t be disappointed .
negative	if you '_ve read this whole review , i hope you can take something from it and make a wise decision .
negative	all the best people - cheers !
negative	wat are yous playing at do u actually know that i tried to book a hotel to tenerife and the consultant aske me was tenerife in england omg it took me 00_minutes trying to explain were tenerife is i know ur exploiting them for cheap labour but come on were customers at end off the day not dogs
negative	first and last time we will use hungry_house .
negative	waited over an_hour and a half for our food and when it turned_up not only was it luke_warm but a dish was missing .
negative	the restaurant was very unhelpful and the service was appalling .
negative	we will never use hungry_house again .
negative	i '_m a uk customer and this is my first order and no doubt from this experience it will be my last .
negative	all items are in - stock and this is the 0th day and i am still_waiting for my order to be processed even_though i paid for their so called priority delivery .
negative	the annoying_thing is that the status says ' we are preparing your order and it cannot be cancelled or changed ' if i want to cancel then i am within my rights !
negative	especially as it '_s being saying waiting to process for days !.
negative	no doubt wiggle does ship quickly on some orders .
negative	but i am getting the impression wiggle treats first time customers poorly .
negative	let '_s see what their customer_services says as i '_m still_waiting to hear back from them .
negative	got a text offering an ipad , accepted than tried to cancel due to personal_circumstances email went back and forth over the period of 0 - 0 months trying to get it cancelled while still being charged .
negative	have two in laws who are terminal ill add couldn ’_t afford the time chasing the company so just accepted the ipad and phone .
negative	they have now hijacked my own vodaphone account which vodaphone have said they can ’_t do anything about dpd offered £_00 in compensation which is less that a 00_% of my time and money they have taken from me .
negative	which i have never received and now when i have any_issues with my phone vodaphone put me direct back to bpd helpline which never call you back which is unacceptable from a vodaphone partner .
negative	just received another text from them offering a free laptop .
negative	don_’_t use or get involved with they are cowboys of the mobile market
negative	tickets booked 0 months in advance - confirmed at time and 0_weeks prior to event .
negative	0 week prior to event received a phone_call to advise tickets were not available - no apology .
negative	extremely poor subsequent customer service including gareth burch ( sales_manager initially dealt_with ) - passing on the account to a colleague with no background - 0 week after letting us down .
negative	un - proffessional , un - reliable , still no refund - would never use again
negative	first they fail to deliver , but pretend they did .
negative	we were in at the time they claim they delivered , and not even a " you were out " card left .
negative	so i track it down , and request delivery 0 days_later knowing i '_ll be away for 0 days - and they just dump it on the doorstep while we ' re away !
negative	i raise a complaint , and they respond with an_automated email_saying that as they '_ve now resolved it and talked to me the case is closed - but they haven_'_t contacted me at all !!!
negative	this is just staggeringly bad and i wish amazon would stop using them .
negative	why pay for prime if the courier is rubbish !!?
negative	?
negative	i foolishly purchase a replica 00v makita battery from this company february_0000 , after a few_months it stopped_working and wouldn_'_t take a charge !
negative	that '_s when the problems started ....
negative	firstly the company wanted me to pay return postage ;- it '_s a faulty product i shouldn_'_t have to pay to return the item !
negative	secondly , after finally paying to return the item , they have the faulty battery and i have not received a replacement , or refund or payment of return postage .
negative	since then they have ceased communicating with me , they simply do not respond to anything , presumably to push me past the 00 month_warranty_period ?
negative	they will go out of their way to avoid any contact and therefore avoid paying a refund ?
negative	they claim to have sent me a replacement battery , but i have never received a replacement battery and the bogus tracking_number doesn_'_t work with any provider ( note they didn_'_t provide a courier name !
negative	)?
negative	they do not respond to emails , letter , text , calls , etc .
negative	their products are substandard ( didn_'_t fit_properly in tool !)
negative	and should be avoided at all costs !
negative	choose genuine battery for your kit , a bit more_expensive but you get a quality product and some ' real ' warranty .
negative	better that then deal with these fraudsters !
negative	i used parcelhero as the reviews seemed to be very good and even_though not as cheap as some couriers , i thought it would be a better service as the service used ups as the courier .
negative	they collected easily from work and delivered promptly next working day ( monday ) but the person_who had received the item found it in pieces .
negative	it was frustrating as i had wrapped the item in bubblewrap , sponge foam , cardboard and covered in plastic_wrapping so thinking it would be delivered in perfect_condition but it was obviously manhandled .
negative	i won_'_t be trusting my parcels again .
negative	never received the order and paid for next_day delivery .
negative	don_'_t know if i '_ll be getting a refund .
negative	i had an extremely distasteful first - time experience with viagogo when buying e_- tickets for a concert .
negative	despite choosing e_- tickets and paying , the e_- tickets were not available .
negative	this was not clearly_stated before the transaction .
negative	their client service refused to cancel the transaction .
negative	i was told to resell the e_- tickets , even_though i had not received them .
negative	with " small fees '" of course .
negative	this is a sham .
negative	fees paid to viagogo for buying and reselling e_- tickets without received the tickets at all !
negative	this is misleading , unclear , a rip - off and completely customer - unfriendly .
negative	nice way to treat a first - time customer ... which speaks_volumes .
negative	vianogo .
negative	i spoke to american_express who told me to beware and to rely only on reputable establishments such as fnac .
negative	am stil awaiting a refund numerous promises or a refund but no action , am pestering them to refund me , they seem to think as it is only £_00 pounds i will forget , oh no i wont .
negative	they have been taking £_000 a year for their protection_racket service that i don_'_t want .
negative	if i don_'_t pay they become threatening and send door_step visitors .
negative	ordered several products , but suunto computer was supplied with almost dead battery and surface_scratches on the screen .
negative	looked like a returned item .
negative	when speaking to their customer service manager , he seemed unable to offer any kind of service , instead just fobbing_me off quoting policy .
negative	do yourself a favour and shop elsewhere .
negative	was looking to buy some aaa 0000mah rechargeable duracell_batteries and the graphic that was pictured with these batteries identified the correct ones but unfortunately the text and subsequently the batteries that turned_up were the 000mah that i could have got cheaper on another website .
negative	lesson_learnt is not to make assumptions .
negative	they gave_me a code that was a duplicate and are taking way too long to assist me with the issue .
negative	it '_s been a month since i '_ve contacted customer server and i '_ve still not received a code .
negative	never buying from there again .
negative	what do you think ?
negative	i found a place online where i could buy a quality mattress , at a very good price !
negative	they even delivered it the following_day !
negative	so what a let_down when the delivery company knocked on my door , i happen to live in a flat ( first floor ) just a couple of flights up , i also am partly disabled .
negative	' its down stairs near the door ' one said .
negative	' that '_s no good ' i said ' i need it up here ' sorry cant do that health and safety ' he said .
negative	' so how do i get it up here ?'
negative	your problem , the doorway is as far as we go mate !'
negative	' goodbye !'
negative	i had to call a friend to assist me in getting it up to my flat .
negative	i finally got it in my flat , and i '_m really pleased with the mattress , but i do think they should change their delivery company if that '_s the service they give to the customers !
negative	still not received the goods !
negative	as per a recent comment by another user .....
negative	rang to say i would be 00_minutes early and was basically told to forget it by some rude man on a mobile .
negative	waited 00_mins in the end to get the car collected .
negative	the return_journey was a bigger joke - rang in the baggage_hall as instructed .
negative	apart_from the fact that it took me 00 attempts to get through to the one man band on his mobile to be told that he had to get 00 cars out that day and we would have to wait .
negative	basically stood outside gatwick for the best part of an_hour waiting for the car to be returned with people wandering_around saying they were going to call the police as they could not get their car back .
negative	should have known not to use this company again after 00 miles was put on my car in stanstead and returned to me empty of fuel !
negative	i bought a belling mini cooker .
negative	i emailed asking if it could be delivered a particular day .
negative	no response .
negative	it arrived unannounced and arrived in a a torn box .
negative	happily no damage .
negative	it has_been used 0 times and one of the rings has stopped_working .
negative	not the suppliers fault i am sure .
negative	emailed them .
negative	no reply .
negative	waited .
negative	no reply .
negative	have sent a second email and now not holding breath .
negative	overall - the promises seem impressive but sadly the delivery and response once you part with your money is poor to say the least .
negative	happily for me i have a contact in trading_standards and they have been spoken to .
negative	the fact is you can get the products from other_sources and i would recommend they be used .
negative	dreadful company .
negative	they sent me tap that they had clearly opened and removed the fittings kit from to give to someone_else .
negative	after 0_weeks of them fobbing_me off with stories of how they would get me the missing parts , i gave up and asked them to take the tap back .
negative	they just ignored all these requests ( you can '_t phone the company unless you want to pay £ 0 . 00 a minute ).
negative	finally i launched a paypal complaint against them and they finally said they would arrange a courier collection .
negative	i waited in all day and no courier .
negative	customer service is unbelievably slow and totally_useless .
negative	after 0 months i still have a useless tap and no money back .
negative	beyond_belief .
negative	order turned 0 days after they had advised of delivery day .
negative	their customer service even tried to tell me the delivery date was set to a later date , and referred to the original email that showed the earlier date .
negative	i ordered a shower_seal kit , and when it turned_up i has received a copper pipe end .
negative	now waiting for their cs to resolve the issue by refund or replacement - don_'_t use .
negative	i had two upvc doors installed in january .
negative	looked for ggf endorsement and expected quality work .
negative	so many faults it was unbelievable .
negative	ok , the repairs have been dealt_with now , but should never have happened in the first place .
negative	and when i contacted ggf '_s compliance manager i was told there was nothing they could do .
negative	i bought an ipad 0 on simply_electronics website on 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	unfortunately due to unforseen circumstances i had to cancel the order on 00 / 0 / 00 , but was told the item hadn_'_t been shipped so all was ok .
negative	i was assured the refund would be made in 0 / 0 working_days .
negative	when that didn_'_t happen , i emailed again , and this time the refund time went up to 00 working_days .
negative	still no refund , but everytime i email i '_m told ' few more days '.
negative	this mornings email stated " our accounting department is very much aware of your case and they are on their best effort completing each and every refund case as fast as they possibly can .
negative	with this said , please immediately contact us again using this email thread in any case no refund confirmation will be received after few more working_days .
negative	onceagaion , we would like to seek your extended patience on this matter as we look_forward having your case resolved ."
negative	i have contacted barclays whose card i used to make the purchase , and they are taking over my case .
negative	they have assured me i will get my money and they will get it back fro se .
negative	be warned before you buy from this company .
negative	i can now add to the review .
negative	at last i have got my refund of over £_000 , but it '_s taken almost a month .
negative	all i got was emails saying a few more days , another few_days .
negative	eventually i replied to one email_stating that i was handing everything over to barclays to recover my money .
negative	would you believe it , two_days_later i got an email_saying that the money was no_longer in their account , but depending on how long barclays took to process the payment , was how long before i would see it on my statement .
negative	don_'_t get caught by this company - read all the other reviews - nearly all say similar things , either item not delivered , or no refund received .
negative	never again , and i '_m going to advertise the problem i had to make_sure as many people as possible are aware of the way this company goes about their business .
negative	having arranged for a parcel to be collected from my office on monday , got out of bed an_hour early to be there for 0 and then stayed late for three hours waiting for the courier , no - one showed up .
negative	i then spoke to [_name_] at parcel0go who advised they dont guarantee collection and were sorry .
negative	they then offered to rebook the courier .
negative	i should have been concerned i guess when there was a specific facility on the website for rebooking couriers that dont arrive .
negative	i asked [_name_] to ask the driver to arrive between 0 and 0 so that i didnt waste a further four hours of my time and he said that this was not possible .
negative	drivers cant be given instructions .
negative	after asking to speak to a manager he then said that he could leave a message at the depot for the driver but there were no guarantees he would receive it .
negative	take it or leave it .
negative	in the modern_world of digital technology , this seems to me to be pretty poor .
negative	perhaps this company doesnt rely_on repeat_business
negative	can i recommend bullguard online backup as a service then the answer has to be " no ".
negative	as a customer for some years and using the service to protect the data for a small company ( 0 pcs ) we need a service we can_rely_on .
negative	bullguard have decided to upgrade the service during oct ' 00 without_any warning to customers or any information on their service status page .
negative	the result is constantly failing backups and a service that i cannot rely_on or trust and one that i have to supplement with local manual backups .
negative	they have now told me that this situation could last 00 days - a service that i am paying for which is not delivering and cannot be trusted to backup our latest data .
negative	worst of all is the lack of communication before they went_ahead and put customers data at risk .
negative	poor show bullguard - am_currently reviewing alternatives with a better service policy and will not be renewing .
negative	and they took 0 months to reply to this !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i submitted a cashback_claim in august for virginmedia .
negative	i i did not receive any update so i checked the quidco site - they closed the claim because i did not respond to emails .
negative	either they did not send them or gmail classed them as spam - although the last email was sent on the 0th_oct andi believe gmail deletes spam after 00 , but there is no quidco email in spam_folder
negative	the worst thing about this is there is no way to communicate with them if your query falls outside a very narrow category , the help screen claims to help with any problem , but that is blatantly not true ,
negative	used anyvan to return a faulty mattress .
negative	driver was paid upon collection as required .
negative	return address claim the mattress was never received .
negative	therefore i never received my refund and am subsequently £_000 ( plus the £_00 delivery fee ) out of pocket .
negative	tried on a number of occasions to resolve the situation with the driver and anyvan but without_success .
negative	be warned !
negative	!
negative	we bought a wowcher deal for a weeks accommodation in tenerife , we paid in full & then booked the dates we would be staying .
negative	we later got an email from the tenerife company petchey leisure ( not wowcher ) demanding we give them our flight details just in case we did not turn_up .
negative	as we have not booked our flights yet we could not give the information .
negative	more_importantly as we have already paid in full for our accommodation what difference did it make ???
negative	anyway they then told us they were canceling our accommodation & keeping all of our money .
negative	my partner then emailed wowcher who responded with :
negative	" it appears that when you first booked your accommodation , you would have been sent a reservation confirmation to this email address advising you of the fact that you need to let the company have your flight details at_least 00 days before you travel ."
negative	so wowcher are saying that it was after we bought & paid in full for the deal & booked the accommodation we were then informed of the fact we needed our flight information .
negative	wowcher then went on to say :
negative	" the details on the original wowcher deal were correct and you would have had to conform to any further ts_&_cs that were enforced by petchey leisure ."
negative	so this means that we basically signed a blank cheque & after signing_up to the deal , petchy leisure had the rite to then make up any rules they wanted & if we couldn_'_t comply with then we lose all of our money ???
negative	we will now be complaining to the advertising_standards authority as the matter has really spoiled our holiday before we have even gone & we hardly_ever , ever get to go away :-(
negative	i '_ve_used myprotein for a few_years_now and , whilst the products are fine , they are becoming less competitive by price and their customer service is going down the pan .
negative	i recently tried to use a promo_code that was emailed to me and it didn_'_t work on the website .
negative	when i phoned customer service they said what i ' d purchased didnt qualify for the promotion .
negative	then , after id changed my order , they emailed me to say it did qualify but my new order didn_'_t .
negative	when i phoned back the obstreperous customer service woman wasn_'_t remotely interested despite my being a regular customer .
negative	avoid .
negative	this company has forgotten it '_s original values and no_longer competes with it '_s better rivals .
negative	i was contacted by optical_express by phone many_times telling_me that there is a surgical procedure to cure my vision .
negative	i kept asking them if they are certain of that as i only have glasses for reading .
negative	anyway they assured me that there was and an appointment was made in november_0000 with their consultant .
negative	i drove from long eaton to optical_express shop in derby and after five_minutes of filling forms they told that there is no sugical procedures to correct my vision but i obviously need glasses ( how sly are these_people ).
negative	i had my eyes_tested and i kept telling them that i drive over 00_hours daily for living and it is very important that i have full field of vision .
negative	they sold two_pairs of vary focal_glasses to me and i paid them £_000 . 00 .
negative	after two_weeks they arrived and i put them on , they seems alright .
negative	as i drove home i realised that i had focused vision only in front of me and simple_task of negotiating round abouts and looking in the side mirrors with blurred_vision was impossible and i had to turn my head round so much that my neck started hurting me .
negative	the next_day i put them on and within two hours i began to have headache .
negative	so i took them off .
negative	this went on for a week when i took them back and took the manager of the shop that i would like a refund .
negative	he told me that i should contact their head_office and arrange for a refund .
negative	i did that and i was contacted by the manager of derby optical_express to go down and have my eyes_tested to find out why i get headache .
negative	at the test they readjusted the frame and i was told to wear them for two_weeks and then go back .
negative	i had two_weeks of headaches and went to my appointment .
negative	i asked for a refund and this time they took the glasses of me and told me that the refund will be in my credit account by 00 days .
negative	i travelled overseas and returned in late march when i realised that no refund was paid into my credit account .
negative	i rang the manager of derby optical_express and told_him that i would go to the shop so that he can arrange for the refund , he told me that if i go to the shop he will throw me out of the shop .
negative	so i went to the shop on 0nd_april_0000 and asked for my refund , he called westfield security and had me removed from the shop .
negative	i called 000 and asked for police .
negative	two police officers arrived while westfield security was standing around me .
negative	the police officers managed to convince the manager to pay the refund .
negative	i went back with the police officers and a refund was paid to my credit account .
negative	why not do this in the first time some three month_ago .
negative	i went home and checked my statements and realised that they have not refunded me the full_amount .
negative	so i am trying to contact the police officers to accompany me back to the shop to find out why !!!!!
negative	the lesson for anybody reading this is do not go to optical_express even if you have to use their toilets .
negative	this was my first order with lenstore and my last , i ordered some cleaning cases as detailed and different ones were sent .
negative	i called customer service , how condescending to say " i , ll let marketing know "
negative	in a word , useless
negative	i sent my phone off to them on the 00 / 00 /_0000 and it is still not with them they should not make their return envelopes so obvious so they can be intercepted in the post by thieves in the royal_mail !
negative	i feel this is a major_issue that needs to be dealt_with by the company .
negative	now i have to wait_till july before i can have a decent phone again !
negative	i will never use this company ever again !
neutral	we have two young_children , and wanted to book two adult meals for the plane , and two children ’_s meals .
neutral	we also wanted to book two bags to take with us both_ways .
neutral	we could not do this .
neutral	we could have four bags both_ways , or nothing , we could have four adult meals both_ways , or nothing .. we were told we could pay for the bags at the airport , and only take two ( at twice the cost per bag ) .
neutral	my wife was at the airport sometime before we travelled , and while waiting went to the monarch desk , who were able to book in everything we wanted , but travel_republic were not able to do this .. why not , if monarch can do it ?
neutral	( trying to phone monarch did not help , as travel_republic have all the booking details of the flights , and to do it over the phone you need this .. monarch tell you to book it via your travel_agent )
neutral	called with a question , was told that i needed to talk to a specific person_who was busy and they would call me back , they didn_'_t call me back ..
neutral	so phoned again the next_day , when i spoke to the person they were not that knowledgeable on the product .
neutral	the advice he gave_me was wrong , which was clear just by looking at the rope light ( was told if i wanted to put a 0 wire controller on , to just cut the cable of the two wire rectifier and connect the cable .. problem is the two wire rectifier has only two wires , and has two of the pins shorted out in the connector ( to connect to three wire rope light ), so this was never going to work ) i did what i thought in the first place and it worked_fine ( cut the heat shrink back , remove the rectifier and attached the new controller )
neutral	the jacket was well made and the website appears to offer two shades of red ; red and dark red .
neutral	in practice , however , it only dispatches dark red and this only becomes apparent once the goods are delivered .
neutral	if the company would have delivered what is described on it '_s website then i would been happy .
neutral	please_note that the company is a bit_slow when it comes to refunding payments .
neutral	dont_waste your time with flightstore , their prices are crazy high , and they keep bombarding you with sales emails .
neutral	sent me 0 emails in 00_minutes , all the same , offering 00_%_discount , none of the discounts worked and when i rang them , they didnt even know their " outsourced marking company " were sending the emails out .
neutral	[_link_]
neutral	i ordered an addon for fsx and they sent me a " demo " version .
neutral	had to call them and get the right one re - sent , which they had to order in ...
neutral	for flight_sim kit , not worth the bother ...
neutral	sent away two phones , received the correct amount for one however received 00 $ less for the other , which mazuma_mobile said it was because i was looking at a sale price which had since ended , went back online and the price which i had originally saw was still there .
neutral	got a good deal at affordable_supplements .
neutral	one of the items included a 0kg box of cnp_pro recover .
neutral	however when the package arrived , the cnp box has_been cracked underneath and the handle at the top had been snapped_off .
neutral	the crack has resulted_in about 000 - 000g spillage .
neutral	i was dissapointed about this and had to spend time transferring the contents to another box i had which had almost run out .
neutral	still a good deal but the inconvenience and loss of weight resulted_in me giving 0_stars .
neutral	i had a £_00 discount_voucher to be redeemed on my order but they chose to give me an additional £_00 voucher to spend next time rather_than honour the voucher i had
neutral	bit too much input left me confused and studio colour palet froze on rear design got red signs where blue was required .
neutral	not working for me through explorer , nearly missed bargain but went through chrome and went ok .
neutral	great service from usrentacar great price clear details ... but when we arrived at the dollar counter we had a very very long wait very poor customer servie ( we were moved to thrifty ) and very very poor car choice !
neutral	!
neutral	have to say again no_problems with usrentacar but dollar was a big disappointment and we will use alamo as we normally did in the past !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a new battery ( ego ) and 0 ce0 clearomizers , i then got a new clearomizer and usb_charger with the battery which was a nice bonus !
neutral	battery works_fine but of the 0 clearomizers i got only 0 of them seem to be decent quality .
neutral	this isn_'_t due to eliquid world i know but still not very impressed .
neutral	my order was for two_pairs of swimming shorts , and i would of expected both_pairs to be of the same size as ordered .
neutral	upon_opening the packaging whilst away ( very nice bags for the shorts ) i soon realised that one pair was smaller than the other .
neutral	both tags stated the same size however my partner then revealed a medium_size sticker had been placed on top of the pair that were the small size , disappointing really at £_00 . 00 a pair , but seeing as i was away suffered the consequences and had to use them .
neutral	seem to be a good company , need to keep an eye on attention to detail .
neutral	the products were absolutely perfect for what i wanted and the delivery was also very good , however the 0 miniatures i ordered arrived in a box that would have easiy fitted a magnum of wine full to bursting with polystyrene foam bits .
neutral	i was more than happy my purchase was protected but this was complete over kill in my opinion .
neutral	andrew smith
neutral	i placed my order online , having given tooled_up personal setails .
neutral	sadly , when there was a glitch with my payment , the only effort made to sort it was an email .... as i am moving_house , i was without broadband ... and have only just got my connection .
neutral	i ended_up talking with the company and we were able to resolve the glitch in seconds .
neutral	what is the point of my giving you and a phone number if nobody uses it ?
neutral	i now have the product and delivery was accurate and timely ... but i regret the dead time pending resolving the above mentioned issue .
neutral	ordered item with no_problems_whatsoever , however , the supplier never gave_me a inter_city tracking_number and never replied to email sent asking for it .
neutral	no problem with inter_city courier , great delivery on time , or tribal_uk , easy to deal with , would never order from hughes electrical '_s ( ipswich ) again ), poor customer service in my view .
neutral	i have been using the voipoffice hosted pbx for about four months now and found the system pretty useful and just what we needed .
neutral	the interface is fairly complicated to adjust all the settings and takes time to fathom out .
neutral	the support from our account_manager is where we have had some bother .
neutral	our account_manager ( carlus ) has lost interest since we bought the system ( he was very attentive before he made the sale ) and now does not reply to emails or calls particularly around a key function that we need , which is call recording .
neutral	the system does allow call recording but you can only download an individual call at a time and when you do it loses all the caller_id , number and date and time of call which we need to identify particular transactions .
neutral	we have been offered an ' ftp ' based solution but the promises have never turned into delivery despite constant chases .
neutral	if it wasn_'_t for this , i would be very happy with telappliant
neutral	way back in june , my wife bought some pre_- packed strawberries from sainsburys .
neutral	when she was cleaning them she noticed several blue pellets in the base of the pack in contact with the fruit .
neutral	we thought these were rat_poison and were horrified to think what could have happened had the grandchildren been with us and helped themselves to the fruit .
neutral	although the immendiate reaction by sainsburys was good , ( the assistant manage visited us with replacements within a hour ), things then stalled .
neutral	the grower contacted us to apologise and explain that the pellets were slug pellets ( rat_poison , slug poison ... both are not really part of a healthy_diet ).
neutral	he promised some of his best cherries when they were in season as goodwill .
neutral	sadly he forgot and it was 00 weeks_later after we made several contacts with sainsburys that a tray of apples , pears and plums suddenly arrived ... no note ... no apology , nothing even to indicate the sender .
neutral	we are dissappointed by sainsburys because we have had to push all the way to get any reaction .
neutral	nothing was forthcoming .
neutral	we were not after material gain , just a good old_fashioned apology .
neutral	maybe a token of goodwill would have been in order , but not the prime aim .
neutral	we have received a £_00 to shut us up ( as well as the anonymous tray of fruit ) but no one has taken the time and trouble to write to us to apologise for what could easily have been a nasty incident .
neutral	can you imagine the headlines ' child poisoned by poisoned strawberries '.
neutral	sainsburys don_'_t seem to have thought beyond the '£ 00 , now shut - up ' stage .
neutral	come on sainsburys , time to put the care back in customer_care .
neutral	a clue .
neutral	swallow your pride , put pen to paper and apologise .
neutral	the £_00 voucher is not the way forward .
neutral	i telephoned to specifically ask if the product would go through the letter_box as nobody would bee in during the day and was told it would .
neutral	it was delivered to another house and was not received until 0 days_later .
neutral	i had no_problems with rentalcars . com but i was a little disappointed with rental_agency .
neutral	i took my car from dubrovnik were i waited for about 00 - 00_minutes to get my car .
neutral	the place was easy to find but when the employee gone out to deliver another car he asked me to stay outside the rental office in the hot sun to wait for him .
neutral	i was not so happy with that .
neutral	i had no_problems with the car which was new and in a very good condition and in a good price i believe .
neutral	after 0 days i went to deliver my car .
neutral	i couldn_'_t find the place to drop my car .
neutral	even my gps didn_'_t have the address or i didn_'_t know how to spell it correct .
neutral	a kind croatian man offered to take me at the drop_off office .
neutral	there was a lady from which i asked her to go together to take the car and bring it back at the office which was about 000 meters away were i had parked it .
neutral	the lady was not very pleased with that but she came with me .
neutral	when we reached the car she said that we should immediately get our staff out of the car and then come to the office to pay .
neutral	i was really frustrated and told her that i cannot do that ( empty the car and then drag my suitcase which was really heavy , in the sun ) and it would better to go there and i would empty the car there .
neutral	she complaint that there was no parking_space there , but after all she drove us a road next to the office were i emptied the car and then gone there to pay .
neutral	after that i finished in 00_minutes .
neutral	i will make_sure i ring a local supplier and not be conned by using any multiple again .
neutral	i want to support local small_businesses .
neutral	i bought an alto tv_cabinet which is a nice item with clean , straight lines .
neutral	however the two cabinet doors are not hung straight and there are noticeable gaps where doors are not aligned with the ' frames '.
neutral	i am debating whether to return the item as quality is dubious .
neutral	not as easy to navigate as just - eat and the order status isn_'_t too intuitive , instead of a live update , you receive an email to confirm whether the order was successful or not .
neutral	would be nice to see full reviews even if there are less_than 0 reviews , as this would be helpful when ordering .
neutral	don_'_t like the way that you have to select the item on the menu for it to then go into a pop - out menu for you to make your choice , just not quick enough .
neutral	would be nice if paypal was added to the payment type too .
neutral	i found the ordering_process awkward and almost gave up .
neutral	it is not user_friendly especially registering the animals etc .
neutral	however , the prices are very competitive and the product range good .
neutral	i will be re - ordering in due course .
neutral	easy and straight_forward fair quality and would use again
neutral	was delivered later than the one hour time_slot_allocated . no apologies received or notification he would be late .
neutral	unfortunately , the vehicle was not available at the pick - up location and we had to take a cab with all our_luggage to the airport depot and then wait in a queue for an_hour before being_processed .
neutral	hertz did a great job in providing a good vehicle at a good price , but we should have been able to pick - up the vehicle from the booked location .
neutral	the blind was delivered in 00 days , so not particularly quickly .
neutral	sadly then the courier was tnt who only tell you which day the delivery is going to be , and don_'_t give you a window like many couriers do now , so i had to stay in all day .
neutral	not a particularly inspiring performance service - wise , but the blind is ok ( velux )
neutral	paid for next_day delivery , but received a part delivery , a day late .
neutral	phoned their office , and received an immidate refund of the difference in postage and an update on the outstanding item .
neutral	the level of customer service was actually good , despite the problem initially , and i ' d not_hesitate to use them again , as the value for money was good too .
neutral	had a problem when checking out ( no where to enter promo_codes ; order got split so no free delivery ).
neutral	customer_services sorted this out after emailing them .
neutral	the pictures are really good ( esp .
neutral	the 00x00 canvas ).
neutral	delivery times seem longer_than i would expect
neutral	make it clear !!!
neutral	!
neutral	and plus gameseek people how long does it take to receive new stock ?!
neutral	order a few_days ago and kind of understand that its out of stock now !!!
neutral	well its just not good enough !!!
neutral	a game that i bought has to now be here in 00days for a birthday_present .
neutral	not trying to fob you off gameseek but if it doesn_'_t get here in time i am going to have a extremely upset relative !
neutral	i have contacted you twice_now urging that you really need to get stock of the item , sorry gameseek if it fails to deliver i will never recommend you because seeing a child upset isn_'_t good !
neutral	not trying to play a gilt trip here because they never really work but please could you try your best to get bakugan defenders of the core psp game in stock , if this is at all possible you will knock [_link_] my favourite online store right off its pedal - stool .
neutral	oops starting to sound like gilt trip again ....
neutral	but anyway the point is that whatever item you need to try and get it in stock within like a week of it being out of stock ......
neutral	everyone i know who has any experience of juno thinks the music on offer is first_class , that its possible to find stuff there that is nowhere_else ... but , and its a huge but , the site is a freaking mess -- its a nightmare to navigate , the search_function does everyones head in , it feels_like there is a ton of text in front of you with no way to find anything on it ... which is why people i know will check out beatport and discogs first , not because the choice on those sites is better but because its easier to find the stuff you are looking for on them ...
neutral	cover for loss of keys appears in initial key facts document despite you wanting to charge extra for it yet .
neutral	when i have paid that section is absent .
neutral	not easy to clearly see what the cover is .
neutral	are there any fees / charges to make a claim .
neutral	all reviews but one are from people who have not claimed .
neutral	0 months for you to pay out seems very slow .
neutral	reality is this product is of such quality it should never_fail in normal use - everything it ' engineered ' & fits together perfectly .
neutral	if you were going to design & build your own this should be the end_result & i have an engineering background .
neutral	it was also delivered very quickly .
neutral	what let it down was the total_lack of anything relevant to install the option i had ordered which was surface mount .
neutral	this is a pity because i would have liked to give it 0_stars .
neutral	i could sit_down & write the instructions accurately in 00_minutes having now completed the install - so why can '_t you ?
neutral	i was offered the opportunity to phone for support after i had queried this but really it just needed to be supplied with instructions ...
neutral	good communication and the payment amount was competitive but they take a week to pay .
neutral	bone on enviro_phone you could do better !
neutral	i had some stuff to sell .
neutral	more than 00_% of my cds were better priced on music_magpie - but they do vary so it '_s worth_checking both sites .
neutral	zapper '_s plus point was that it took some ( about 00_%) of the books i wanted to sell .
neutral	the price was ok - and certainly better_than recycling them .
neutral	the process was slow - and in the end i had to chase them .
neutral	eventually they sent a cheque for the quoted amount .
neutral	it wasn_'_t clear why there was a delay .
neutral	also , while postage is free , you do have to take it to a post_office - while the [_external_reference_] collects from your house / place of work .
neutral	it was an ok experience but i was a bit underwhelmed to be honest .
neutral	didn_'_t receive product , so emailed customer service .
neutral	no reply .
neutral	i called them up after 0 days and was told i would be called back later .
neutral	i wasn_'_t that day so read_reviews which said they don_'_t always get back to you , they did saying it was sent to billing_address .
neutral	amateur mistake seeing as paypal says delivery address and you inputed it also .
neutral	take care when preparing your files .
neutral	they may not turn out to be what you expect .
neutral	your photoshop srgb profile will be converted to suit the suppliers print process .
neutral	at_least one stop of light will be lost in the automatic conversion .
neutral	they were nice , but very small .
neutral	0 had a snapped stem and many needed most of the petals and leaf '_s pulled off !
neutral	didn_'_t take too long to dispatch , and once dispatched took 0 days .
neutral	but they ignore emails or questions ticketed to them on the order .
neutral	got first_class advice on the telephone at the time of purchase and delivery was swift ., but my items when taken out the box in a pretty mucky condition ( looking as though they have sat for some time collecting_dust and dirt on a shop floor / warehouse since the dawn of time ) not a massive issue as i washed all the items soon after taking out the box but it did ruin that new purchase feeling ...
neutral	i did expect more from such an established dive shop dispatching new items to the consumer .
neutral	products all new and exactly as_described , service clear and easy to use .
neutral	however , i selected next_day delivery on 0th of october , early_afternoon .
neutral	email confirmation said my order would be with me on the 00th .
neutral	when it arrived on the 00th the sticker on the parcel showed it had only be despatched from juno on the 00th !
neutral	the site is easy to use and good value .
neutral	but check that everything is right !
neutral	every change has a £_00 charge as i found out the hard way when making two changes at once .
neutral	this is a bit_steep for making changes over 0 months away ... ouch !
neutral	flowers arrived at approx_0pm which was acceptable .
neutral	checked the box which was damp from the rain and wet from leakage of water inside .
neutral	dont_know how long the flowers had been in the delivery truck but they looked very dishivelled .
neutral	viewing the flowers this morning they look very sad indeed with chrisants and roses with already curled up leaves .
neutral	not very pleased with this delivery of flowers
neutral	regards g bagshaw
neutral	bought one blind as a tester and wanted to buy 0 further blinds but wanted advice regarding levels of light various materials let into the room
neutral	tried e_mail and phone but no reply
neutral	the cables i ordered were offered at a reasonable price , and were in stock to merlins credit .
neutral	most companies were out of stock ....... however the delivery took longer_than i am used to from wiggle or chain_reaction cycles .
neutral	in all honesty im not convinced i would return at this point , not due to poor service in anyway but more for high prices lack off promotional_offers and high pp charges .
neutral	also i have to say when i did call for some advice on a certain bean an compatibility with my machine it was obvious there was a lack of any real knowledge and therefore advice was not great only then to try and sell a bit more at end of call .
neutral	used to be better , now it '_s just a load of amazon sellers with bigger prices .
neutral	ordered and got the stuff pretty quickly .
neutral	all arrived on time and not broken etc .
neutral	didn_'_t have to deal with their customer service team though !
neutral	website easy to use but if ordering medication in this way it is essential that it arrives in a timely_manner .
neutral	i ordered something for a bad cold but the illness was fading by the time it arrived .
neutral	however i will still use the site again .
neutral	easy to find and purchase tyres .
neutral	can '_t say the same about the fitting_center fitted the the tyres
neutral	on the front should have been the rear .
neutral	told the rear_tyres were fine .
neutral	only on his second inspection did he find the tear in one of the rear_tyres .
neutral	could have been very nasty don_'_t these_people care ?
neutral	maybe if ide bought the tyres direct from them they would have found the fault .
neutral	the seats we booked were okay and the booking process was straightforward but the massive mark up on ticket price means that you will always be a last_resort choice for us when all other options have failed
neutral	you get a tracking_number , that redirects you to the ddp website and where the tyres are , though the ddp website is abit confusing , as it dosent tell you how far away nor when your tyres will be delivered , ( not even aprroximatly ) .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	though they took less_than a week to be delivered , .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	last time , it took 0_weeks .

neutral	not happy that you have to opt_out of extras - sneaky
neutral	just booked car parking at manchester_airport with sky_park , i found the booking forms easy to complete .
neutral	trying jet plus car_park this year as it advertises a tarmac surface which will be better_than the pot - holed and puddly jet 0 car_park .
neutral	the price looked straight_forward until i got to the end , then there were a number of add - ons which were not mentioned earlier , such as a booking_fee ?
neutral	the booking was made on - line and i printed_off the confirmation on my paper , a cancellation_fee , which i did not want and a fee so they can text me a confirmation , when i have printed_off the confirmation on my printer , ( not necessary ) these extras added a further £ 0 on to the charge - not impressed , this should have been made clearer before booking .
neutral	paid £ 0 . 00 for a card with a personnal message which was not put in the card .
neutral	this was my second time to order from power_body .
neutral	i paid for next_day delivery , but the item didn_'_t arrive until nearly a week_later .
neutral	even then , it didn_'_t arrive ... i had to go to the post_office to pick it up .
neutral	i know it was much of an extra_charge for delivery but still , i paid for it and it didn_'_t happen .
neutral	reduced the cost for minor_damage which should of been considered general_wear and tear .
neutral	not a bad service though and offered highest price on the internet .
neutral	ordered a pair of michelin_tyres on the website , arranged fitting , confirmed and printed out the receipt .
neutral	then an_hour later received an email asking me to ring tyre - shopper .
neutral	i was then told the tyres i had ordered were unavailable !
neutral	but i could have a better pair for the same price .
neutral	but , they didn_'_t have a better pair of tyres , just a cheaper pair .
neutral	i didn_'_t take up their offer and accepted a refund .
neutral	it would have saved a lot of time for both_parties if they kept the site updated .
neutral	overall fine , only problems were assignments getting lost and extreme delays in marking assignments not even close to the 00_hours they say ,, even waited a week for some ..
neutral	course material was complicated on some stages .
neutral	lack of examples , sometimes topics were not clear .
neutral	but overall not at all regretting .
neutral	as above its totally a needs must with interparcel ,
neutral	not the chepest
neutral	not the easiest
neutral	not the most efficiant
neutral	customer service is hard to contact
neutral	they don_'_t answer emails
neutral	will accept your money no problem but it costs you a fortune in mobile_phone bills to get a refund .....
neutral	as we said totally needs must ....
neutral	i bought a goldtop epiphone_les_paul standard a few weeks_ago and it was my first purchase with guitarguitar so i was a bit_apprehensive anyway as all of my purchases are usually made from richtone_music .
neutral	the guitar was really well_packaged and everything but they obviously did not bother to check if the guitar was on an exceptable condition .
neutral	the neck humbucker was completely hanging out of the guitar and wasn_'_t tightened before it was sent .
neutral	the strings were all very loose and again , not checked .
neutral	the guitar ( after some_tlc ) is great but was very disappointed with how i received it .
neutral	with all of my other guitar purchases , i received them with no_problems and had obviously been checked and repackaged .
neutral	this one how ever , was not .
neutral	will think_twice about purchasing from guitarguitar again .
neutral	adam lovell .
neutral	i bought a ibiza 0 . 0 pa sound system which was a real let_down as it was faulty - on new years_eve !!!!
neutral	( first use )
neutral	after my huge dissapointment i contacted the company via_email to get it repaired and saldly they said it would be a lengthly period to get it repaired and suggested i got it repaired locally or have a refund , but i had discarded the large boxes it came in so returning it for a refund was not an option .
neutral	i took it to a repairer & after hifi - tower initially refused to pay the repair quote of £_00 , they then changed their minds and helpfully dealt_with the matter via telephone and offered me all the assistance i needed in order to get the repair paid for .
neutral	the customer service has_been ok , just a shame the product was faulty upon purchase causing a lot of un - needed stress and dissapointment .
neutral	when i joined lovefilm it was fantasic ... and still is mostly .
neutral	however since amazon took it over it is no_longer possible to reserve films that are brand - new .
neutral	instead amazon are trying to entice you to purchase the film rather_than simply wait for the rental to become_available .
neutral	this is very frustrating as i how have a whole series of bookmarks of new films that i have to keep until they are available to rent ... taking away most of the benefit of having your rental wish - list .
neutral	ok i guess .
neutral	probably will go somewhere_else next time as their checkout wasn_'_t super clear so my glasses got sent to an old address and i had to re order again .
neutral	they weren_'_t overly bothered when i told them as the info is all their in checkout .
neutral	i '_m to blame but i expected a little more understanding in honesty .
neutral	0_weeks after first using this , i '_m still_waiting for result !
neutral	!
neutral	flowers would been great delivered 0 days previously
neutral	goods arrived in good time , but when i went to return i had to email the company for a returns_form .
neutral	this form was emailed to me but was a standard form , what was the point of that ?
neutral	why not include a copy in the package like other_companies do .
neutral	then i had to pay for the cost of the return which was unexpected .
neutral	popular guitar took_ages to arrive .
neutral	it wasn_'_t informed 00 week wait_until i ' d payed .
neutral	i nearly cancelled .
neutral	glad i waited though !
neutral	arrived in perfect_condition .
neutral	products arrived long after what one would expect to be a normal delivery time .
neutral	two products were ordered , presumably one or both were out of stock .
neutral	an email_explaining the situation would have been helpful .
neutral	the web tracking just said i was in the queue for packing with no time - scale indicated .
neutral	in_spite of this i will probably order from singletrack again , but a similar experience in the future is likely to put me off
neutral	i found love holidays by searching google - and was delighted with how easy the site is to navigate , and then purchase .
neutral	prices were great , information up to date - a refreshing start .
neutral	unfortunately , the faqs on their site did not match up with my experience .
neutral	the holiday deal was with a ' low_cost airline '.
neutral	according to the lh faqs , i was to expect my tickets 0 - 00 days before departure .
neutral	0 days before departure , i called as i had not received these , to be told they needed my passport number before allocating tickets .
neutral	staff were very friendly and helpful , but i did feel this was not good enough .
neutral	also , hotel vouchers were sent in an attachment called " invoice . pdf " - i did '_t open it , as you would have expected the file to be named appropriately .
neutral	so 0 phone_calls which really shouldn_'_t have happened .
neutral	driver got lost looking for us , and the language_barrier made it difficult to get him to our place .
neutral	it was a little_bit of a hassle but once he found us , we did get there on time .
neutral	also didn_'_t get the call 00_minutes before they were arriving , only one when they were 0 minutes away
neutral	recieved the delivery on monday as instructed but i ordered my goods on thurs 00th_sept and paid the extra £ 0 for next_day delivery not knowing this would be 0 days_later !
neutral	but the item does not fit my shower_door .
neutral	however , with a bit if filing and adjustment it is on .
neutral	unfortunately , it is plastic replacing steel , but that made it easier to adjust .
neutral	ordered two items at the same time , one from superfi and one from a rival company . the competitor '_s item arrived 0 days ahead of superfi '_s . apart_from that excellent service .
neutral	excellent price , helpful staff and prompt delivery .
neutral	wrong item delivered ( probably supplier error ), helpful again on being notified but received only an hours notice of exchange delivery - good job i was in as the driver had driven for several hours !!
neutral	promised flexipipe for my shower waste never_materialised which is a shame as shown in qualitex brochure and offered for free to compensate for delivery mistake .
neutral	this shower_rail is well_designed and finished , altogether a stylish product , but i was disappointed to find its length comes in two parts with an inevitably flimsy connection .
neutral	the tubing used is also very lightweight , so at 0 . 0m it is not as strong as you might hope .
neutral	also , one of the pieces of tubing was seriously damaged on arrival , and must have been that way on dispatch as the packaging was not damaged .
neutral	ordering was easy and the outfit came as promised .
neutral	i found a stain ( looks_like blood ) on the outfit but otherwise ok . not complained as i don_'_t have time to send outfit back and get another one .
neutral	0_stars on thecar rental side , but 0_stars for the special price attraction offers , some had dead links , others referenced 0000 .
neutral	just looks very uncared for .
neutral	pity really as just looks amateur
neutral	not notified which courier was being used so could not track the parcel . not given a tracking_number . took two visits by courier to deliver . arrived eventually .
neutral	whilst the searching for a part and ordering were easy the information_regarding delivery was less_than satisfactory .
neutral	when you pay for ' next_day delivery ' on a thursday you do not expect to wait_until the following_monday !!
neutral	indeed at the time of writing this review i have not yet taken delivery .
neutral	be aware next_day from this company actually means ' next working day ' also if your order is placed after 0pm it is not processed until the next ' working ' day - would be nice if this company told you that upfront rather_than after your order is placed .
neutral	than said good value
neutral	clean .
neutral	comfortable .
neutral	but not mind_blowing .
neutral	and no cooked meal in morning .
neutral	i '_m a regular customer to this site but was very disappointed with my last order .
neutral	my order was placed and the money debited from my account but it took two_weeks to arrive !
neutral	!
neutral	my emails to the customer service address were ignored and the live_chat_feature on the site was useless .
neutral	no response what so ever and then the conversation was terminated by the ' customer_services ' rep without reply :(
neutral	after some digging on the site i found a small piece of text that said delivery services might be delayed_due to a warehouse relocation .
neutral	it would have been far less frustrating had this been highlighted on the home page so it was easily seen before ordering .
neutral	i have never had any_issues with shopping here before but i will think_twice before doing it again .
neutral	great site .
neutral	dismal customer service .
neutral	you pay for what you get !
neutral	sometimes the prices are frustrating , one minute you get a cheap price , 0 mins later price changes .
neutral	when you get there usually quick , on occasion checking in can take over 00mins .
neutral	i have been .
neutral	there on time , but due to the long check in / passport_control i have been made to miss my boat .
neutral	inboard food is average , vegetarian options are poor like most places so need to bring my own food .
neutral	staff are polite , sometimes french staff onboard and notice they can be abrupt and rather impolite .
neutral	toilets are not great , often dirty and smell .
neutral	annoyingly they close the toilets prior to the conclusion of the journey .
neutral	this means you can never go before you leave .
neutral	overall good , but could be better
neutral	i bought a pair of beetle wings which im_afraid are ' nt that good regards the quality that there made .
neutral	ive a lot of work to do getting them straight before there ready for paint .
neutral	i thought klokker panels were better quality .
neutral	cant_fault service and rates of pther certain parts
neutral	happy with the price and service as usual but the get well soon balloon i sent alongside the flowers turned_out to be a happy birthday_balloon causing confusion and embarrassment .
neutral	this follows a similar experience with you when the greeting_card was missed from the delivery so the recipient didn_'_t know who the flowers were from !
neutral	they told me the item i ordered was out of stock after one week .
neutral	the trousers were hemmed by them , not as well as an off the peg suit .
neutral	travelup was cheap for flight but e_- mail confirmation letter had link to a visa site that was costly .
neutral	this visa site lead me to pay £_00 for visa when on official web_site the cost is only £ 0 : 00 , so be warned .
neutral	if you want a cheap flight do use travelup but do not use there link to a visa website .
neutral	paid for 00hr delivery and received 0 days_later what can i say is it worth chasing no i wont go back im_afraid .
neutral	the carving knife i bought was described as scallop - edged .
neutral	i have scallop - edged knives and they are excellent ; i simply wanted a larger one .
neutral	no mention of any other blade surface .
neutral	it was scalloped on one side , but on the other ( not shown in either photo ) is a coarse ripping - tearing surface which predominates in use .
neutral	my girlfriend was really happy with the flowers .
neutral	unfortunately due to the delivery driver the surprise was ruined .
neutral	i received a text_message to say that the flowers had been left at the back of the house .
neutral	i found this a little strange as there is no access to the back of the house from outside .
neutral	i also found it very strange that there was no reply when the door was knocked as i knew she was in and she has two dogs that bark as soon as the door is knocked .
neutral	the flowers were left on the doorstep .
neutral	and the doorstep is approx 0 metres away from the road and anybody could have taken them .
neutral	i send flowers to my girlfriend alot .
neutral	unfortunately i don_'_t think i will be using you again
neutral	when we collected our hire car from the airport we felt_like we were rushed through the collection process , the representative asked to see our voucher , then he printed_off the contract , got us to sign it and gave_us the keys to the car .
neutral	only when we drove_away did we realise an additional driver was not on the contract , we weren_'_t told which fuel to use ( the petrol_cap gave no clues ) and where we should return the car to was not clear .
neutral	after arriving in our resort we visited another cabrera office and they were shocked at the contract and service we had received .
neutral	but having said all that the car was great and we would probably use you again .
neutral	the journey directions from the airport were very good however on arrival at the resort of kassiopi there were several villa_plus signs to follow all going in different directions it took us nearly as long to find the villa as it did to travel from the airport .
neutral	surely the name of the villa should be clearly printed on the signs so you know which one to follow .
neutral	the villa was large the grounds and pool very impressive however on entering it was cold damp and fusty with no apparent means of heatig the second week did improve after doors , shutters and windows were left opened .
neutral	there were notes not in use left on air cnditioning units , lounge fire ( which was realy needed ) and outside kitchen taps .
neutral	the bedding was substandard with holes in some stains on others .
neutral	i had to clean underneath the cooker_hood before a meal could be made .
neutral	the dishwasher was unuseable pots coming out dirtier than when they went in .
neutral	having said all that we had a great holliday improvements to the above would have made it even better .
neutral	the process of pre_- booking and entry to the edinburgh_airport car_park went without a hitch - a welcome thing at 0 . 00 am , having driven from glasgow for the brussels flight .
neutral	getting out , that same evening and much later the same day , was a wholly different proposition .
neutral	i followed signs " exit " only to reach an exit that had been closed off !
neutral	one long orbit of the car_park later , i eventually found my way out .
neutral	not a frustration with which you want to begin your journey home at the end of a very long day .
neutral	i bought a nokia_lumia_000 in november_0000 and i am pleased with the phone and the deal .
neutral	however , carphone_warehouse performance has_been poor from beginning to end .
neutral	next_day delivery took over a week , telephone_calls involve long ( expensive ) waits , email support is glacially slow and the promised experience day was missing .
neutral	eventually i got an experience day voucher from them and when i went to the web_site to use the code it was rejected as invalid .
neutral	they are worth a star because at_least they showed my poor review on their website .
neutral	i mean , the ordering was easy .
neutral	i then had to go on my other e_- mail to verify which i was okay with as it is added_security .
neutral	but putting the code upside_down ?
neutral	i mean , i put a w as an m . ' incorrect code '.
neutral	i don_'_t see how having the code upside_down adds to security .
neutral	i found partyrama ok first time shoper of course so i want to be ffair to all ....
neutral	however i did find item missing when i opened the box , but was replacedby another item i had not orderd or did not want ... plus it was way cheaper !
neutral	!.
neutral	i did phone up and was asked to send photo of the item i did receive , so they didnt take my name for it [ item cost less_than £ 0 ] item i got maybe at a guess £ 0 ].
neutral	sent photo and email didnt get a reply so will i shop_here again do not know .
neutral	plenty on the web so may look else where .
neutral	f j
neutral	it was all fine but you cannot buy a lot of things to save on delivery costs and then to have products with a short best before date .
neutral	you force the buyer to eat - consume all fast .
neutral	regards ,
neutral	marco
neutral	the lense fell out of my specs within the first day .
neutral	i returned them .
neutral	when i got them back after repair the same lense fell out again within an_hour .
neutral	i had to send them back again .
neutral	i have also had somebody_else '_s specs sent to me by mistake which i have to send back .
neutral	all in all a very unsatisfactory experience .
neutral	the service from whybuynew was good apart_from i paid extra for next_day . delivery before 00 so i could have a parcel for new year party the delivery date was set but the company did not get the parcel from you in time to deliver it to me so i paid for fast postage for no reason for it to come in 0 days instead of 0 - this resulted_in me having to go to my local dj store and buy the things i orderd so i could have them - it '_s a minor moan but it just annoyed me but other than that i have always had super quick amazing service from the website
neutral	this is the 0rd time i have used envirophone in 0 years and i must_say the prices paid for phones seems to have collapsed !
neutral	the first time i used the service i was paid 0 times what i received for this phone and the phone i sold was junk !
neutral	very competitive_prices and clear item details but lacking good comms .
neutral	products were out of stock but website didn_'_t specify that and had an estimated delivery of 0 to 0 days .
neutral	had to ring 0 days after ordering to find out products were only coming into stock that day .
neutral	customer service rep was very helpful though .
neutral	i bought a swimsuit for my wife , and i sought_advice from swimshop about sizing .
neutral	despite_being advised to trust the sizing , the swimsuit is way too small .
neutral	so be careful ....
neutral	arrived on time , in tact and worked as expected .
neutral	dell sent me a ' no reply accepted ' email to say the pc would be delivered by courier in next week or so .
neutral	next_day 00 / 00 / 00 the courier sent me their first contact , a ' no reply accepted ' email " your dell order is scheduled to arrive between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
neutral	please arrange for someone to be there throughout this time - as we cannot be more specific about the time of delivery .
neutral	as your order is already on its way we regret it '_s too late to change the following details :
neutral	0 . delivery date
neutral	0 . delivery address
neutral	0 . order details "
neutral	i tracked down someone at dell to complain at this attitude and to say that i ' d have someone available 0 - 0 : 00 but it would have been nice to have proper contact with the courier not this ultimatum .
neutral	and that roads around here are badly flooded so it ' d be an idea for them to ring us anyway to discuss access .
neutral	the delivery was fine , but this sort of attitude suggests a lack of customer_care .
neutral	ordered new 00 " samsung_smart 0d_tv online - best price & ex stock delivery .
neutral	order acknowledged & then received emails tracking delivery etc .
neutral	unfortunately , the info was incorrect & despite_being advised my order had been despatched , it was still sitting in the warehouse .
neutral	i telephoned to find out what was happening & it all seemed very confused .
neutral	paul was extremely_helpful but it was 0_weeks before i received my tv .
neutral	price & tracking_system great but the reality disappointing .
neutral	my st00is under_warranty and will not charge .
neutral	with great difficulty i got through to customer_services by phone , who then said someone would ring me back .
neutral	next_day i was called , someone called hussein i think was very helpful , sent me a new charger .
neutral	this did not solve the problem .
neutral	i consequently sent an email to support , no reply after 0 days .
neutral	telephoned support , only to be told someone would ring me back today or tomorrow , as the lines were busy .
neutral	still_waiting .
neutral	great products being let_down by their own success i think .
neutral	my gtech_multi was promised by email on a given date , did not arrive , after nearly 0_weeks rang to find no record of it , although i had paid by paypal , had to phone again and start the process again !
neutral	i '_ve chosen this service because i wanted one booking number assigned to the booking concerned multiple flight companies .
neutral	the booking went fine .
neutral	later i discovered a typing mistake and wanted to email ebookers .
neutral	they don_'_t have a contact email .
neutral	nevertheless i spend one hour sorting_out ( transposing 0 characters in one name ) the issue but could not manage that , so i contacted the flight companies directly .
neutral	delivery promised by carrier , didnt happen as advised
neutral	i ordered a prescription_medication from animed as it saved me £_00 , even after having to pay the vet for the prescription , so i was pleased .
neutral	i then faxed through the prescription as requested with the order number allocated and waited for it to arrive .
neutral	six days_later i got an e_mail_stating they couldn_'_t send the medicine as they were waiting for a prescription .
neutral	i couldn_'_t believe it , as this is the second time this had happened !!
neutral	after making a couple of phone_calls animed conceded they had the fax but had not allocated it to my order .
neutral	a lack of communication or what ?
neutral	prices and ordering online was easy with confirmation_email received soon after .
neutral	however the email stated a further update with delivery details would be recieved within 00_hours and this never happened , so had to make quite a few call to get this information .
neutral	delivery took just over a week .
neutral	overall happy with purchase but could have been updated better .
neutral	initial order went under payment review from paypal and after six days i had to contact paypal who said the funds had been released .
neutral	however go - electrical were saying it was still under payment review i was advised by them to cancel first order and use alternative method of payment received my item the next_day still_awaiting refund for first order hopefully won_'_t be too much delay .
neutral	thanks for delivering my flowers though .
neutral	put in a small order .
neutral	good '_s were out of stock but they emailed me to let_me know .
neutral	estimated despatch was 0 - 0 days .
neutral	being a busy got it was almost 0_weeks before i realised that i still didn_'_t have my order .
neutral	i emailed them and they checked to see where the gods had got to .
neutral	then came back and said another 00 days ( splutter had let them down .
neutral	to their credit , i did get a sincere_apology and my payment was refunded same day .
neutral	will try them again though , as they did get back to me quickly with an explanation , refund and an_apology .
neutral	the clock was easily_assembled , well made , and a very good idea .
neutral	disappointed to find it only lasts 0 hours per wind , and when running the tick is much too loud , too loud to have in a child '_s bedroom .
neutral	brilliant site , lots of choice but £ 0 . 00 to ship a 00gram shackle is outrageous .
neutral	same as above
neutral	order delivered promptly ; right medication at the right price .
neutral	what more can you review ?
neutral	i needed travel_insurance .
neutral	i looked on line ; your name came into view ; i clicked .
neutral	your product seems no better , though no worse than many others .
neutral	your application is fairly_straightforward ; not too many questions .
neutral	the ts_&_cs don_'_t seem to onerous .
neutral	i paid up .
neutral	end of !
neutral	one slight_niggle , i suppose .
neutral	to print a copy of what '_s relevant requires printing a great deal of what '_s not relevant .
neutral	why not section the policy_document , and allow customers to print off only what pertains to their purchase ?
neutral	printing reams on ski insurance when i '_m off to the tropics is just plain silly .
neutral	but was let_down buy the flowers 0 / 00 sorry
neutral	i order a few cd '_s at the beginning of december as christmas_presents , they hadn_'_t arrived after a couple of weeks so i emailed there customer_support .
neutral	i heard_nothing back but a few_days_later i had my cd '_s on my doorstep with the word priority written all over them , make of that as you will .
neutral	don_'_t think i would be using this site again even if they are a few_pounds_cheaper .
neutral	good price and fast , free delivery - excellent .
neutral	be aware - by giving a rating using trustpilot here you are allowing them to send junk to your email address until you opt - out .
neutral	disgraceful behaviour !
neutral	well the first issue i had was i got an email_saying i had already received the flowers for my wife when i never , had to contact eflorist about the email and found out it was a mistake .
neutral	the flowers i ordered haven_'_t been done yet , i was ok with this knowing the flowers that i picked weren_'_t with someone_else .
neutral	flowers arrived later on my wife was out at the time so when i answered the door the woman that delivered the flowers said joyce whyte , i was confused as my wife '_s name is joan whyte i definately put that on the order , lucky i remembered what i put in the card .
neutral	i was annoyed that the name was wrong and lucky my wife wasn_'_t in at the time
neutral	no where to sit and relax .... no chairs no lounge and v expensive food and drink .
neutral	cabin was clean although noisy at floor 0
neutral	only one payment in now im told they dont take master card debit_card not a credit_card also told i cannot pay monthly , wasnt told this in the beggining , not starting off to well , was told if i make four payments by card i would be able to change to monthly , no i carnt
neutral	flight availability changed mid booking .
neutral	i had pre booked online .
neutral	so i had the booking_reference_number .
neutral	i obviously noticed when i went into the car_park that my licence number was printed on the ticket .
neutral	but no where was there a notice to tell me what i should do with the ticket when i returned .
neutral	should i just drive out ?
neutral	should i insert the ticket into the machine ?
neutral	i worried that if i put the ticket in and it demanded money then i would be unable to get it out again .
neutral	and there is now no one to ask , as you have no staff at the park !!
neutral	!
neutral	i '_m really pleased with my tiles , they look great but i received 0 out of the 00 tiles chipped !
neutral	good job i ordered extra so i had enough .
neutral	they were well_packed but the box was pretty damaged and had been squashed , the delivery driver had left the box in a bush on my drive way as it was not in !
neutral	not very pleased about that !
neutral	but again i '_m very happy with the tiles just not the delivery .
neutral	i have t - mobile connection ( sim ) and i have been a long time customer .
neutral	what i like about t - mobile connection ?
neutral	good connectivity and decent customer service .
neutral	i ordered a humax_pvr which subsequently turned_out not to be in stock .
neutral	the company did contact me promptly and sorted_out the refund to my credit_card .
neutral	however , they ought not to be taking orders on items that are not actually available .
neutral	have been with talktalk for eleven years_now , the service has_been fine .
neutral	but since we moved_house that changed , we had no phone or internet service for four days .
neutral	i had to call them to get an engineer to come out and fix the fault .
neutral	he found that they had connected us onto someone_else '_s line , all the time the advisors were saying must be a problem with your equipment , all_sorts of things .
neutral	this was sorted_out and thankfully didn_'_t have to pay the engineer fee because it was talktalks fault .
neutral	they then mistakenly charged me twice for line rental at our new property , yet another phone_call to them .
neutral	money was reimbursed including for no service .
neutral	the advisor then said your entitled to a free tv plus package , there were no extra_charges mentioned even after i asked .
neutral	did some_research afterwards and found out the info of the package , there was no way it was free .
neutral	so i cancelled on the same day and was told the you view box would not be sent .
neutral	it still arrived , so i phoned and they said i would be charged £_000 for the box even_though it says its free online as part of the package .
neutral	now been sorted , cancelled package , you view box being sent back and no extra_charges .
neutral	i have been very annoyed with talktalks service over the past month .
neutral	just a simple_task of connecting us up in our new house .
neutral	some of the advisors on the phones are not understanding , confusing and a bit misleading .
neutral	i purchased a 0000 '_s elvis_costume and wig .
neutral	total price was around £_00 . 00 .
neutral	delivery was excellent however there were one or two problems .
neutral	the size of costume and belt attachment were spot on , no_complaints , the actual costume decoration however was poor and basically starting falling_off from the moment i opened the packaging , over the course of the evening which involved nothing more strenuous than a little dancing to a few classics i would estimate that 00_% of the costume decoration came away , nothing drastic admittedly but not great .
neutral	the worst part of the outfit by far was the wig , flat packed to within an inch of its life it came out of the wrapping and basically " puffed " out like an afro , after 00_mins frantic styling and pinning with the wife it resembled something like an elvis hairstyle but was very disappointing and i must_admit kinda spoiled the outfit .
neutral	plus points :
neutral	size of outfit , xl not available from everywhere
neutral	delivery
neutral	style was spot on
neutral	minus_points
neutral	expensive for what it is and for re - usability value
neutral	wig was rubbish
neutral	stunning flowers , although they where much smaller than_expected , prob wouldn_'_t use an online web_site again as a picture isn_'_t a good guide to what you will actually get .
neutral	so , i '_ve had not one but two issues this morning with dpd .
neutral	one was a delivery for a fridge ( 00000000 ) where they decided to leave a card but felt they didn_'_t have the time to bother buzzing my door .
neutral	i specifically took the day off to wait for them ; i was sat in my flat all morning , dead quiet .
neutral	no tv , no loud background noises , in a rural_area where all you can hear are the birds tweeting and the odd car .
neutral	after a short while i decided to go downstairs to check my mailbox , and surprise_surprise an attempted delivery card !
neutral	i called the retailer ( fridgefreezerdirect ) and fortunately they '_ve been really good and managed to arrange_redelivery this afternoon so i haven_'_t wasted my entire day .
neutral	the retailer suggested they ' re supposed to * actually * attempt delivery and are obligated to wait for 00_mins at each address or they really get in trouble .
neutral	i heard they keep gps logs so i wonder what story the evidence tells ?
neutral	they tried to suggest my buzzer may be on the blink , but i went right down and tested it out .
neutral	sure_enough it '_s loud enough i can hear it from outside , so i can only_assume the driver doesn_'_t know how buttons work - god_knows_how they figured out how to operate a vehicle .
neutral	then to add to the confusion , i was awaiting yet another delivery from amazon via_dpd ( 00000000 ) and no card this time , just sitting here quietly and an email popped up saying nobody was home .
neutral	great , so how am i reading about it in my flat ??
neutral	i got several emails before the " attempt " saying " be sure you ' re in !"
neutral	and " your delivery '_s going to be at this time in the morning ", so i was sat there ready in wait , but this driver decided it wasn_'_t worth their time either .
neutral	i suppose they ' re sharing efficiency tips or too_busy doing doughnuts in a carpark somewhere ?
neutral	i rang up amazon immediately to try and get them to redeliver , but they couldn_'_t reach the driver and who_knows if they ' re actually going to try again today .
neutral	if they can sort it out by the end of the day they will have redeemed_themselves somewhat , but i '_m really not impressed .
neutral	i '_ve had issues like this with dpd '_s " attempted deliveries " last christmas as well .
neutral	edit_: driver for the fridge delivery just got in contact and he '_s hopefully going to deliver this afternoon , fingers_crossed .
neutral	i '_ll update my review as i see progress .
neutral	edit0 : just got my amazon delivery , the guy claims he came this morning and was outside ringing the bell for 0 minutes .
neutral	i '_m not convinced but i '_m happy i got my parcel today .
neutral	edit0 : my fridge has arrived !
neutral	it '_s unfortunate that i had to take both the afternoon and morning off rather_than just the morning , but at_least everything was sorted_out within the day .
neutral	i still have no idea what happened in the morning , but both amazon and fridgefreezerdirect dealt_with the matter well and arranged redeliveries with dpd quickly and without charge , which is better_than many other couriers in my experience .
neutral	good price ordered quoting 0 days delivery on 00th_may , actual delivery 00th_june
neutral	bought bf0 limited with b0k was sent 0 keys immediately after payment both in use .
neutral	was given a new bf0 key a couple of days_later , however it took a bit longer to get the b0k , told me it was sent in original email after purchase .
neutral	took a couple of attempts to get across that key was already in use .
neutral	overall i can say from my experience they won_'_t rip you off , its just a shame that when you buy a game in good faith the keys are already in use and its not an immediate replacement , you have to wait a couple of days .
neutral	i order from solopress mainly_because they have fantastic products at sensible_prices .
neutral	occassionally i order from them as well because they offer very quick turn_around .
neutral	the last time i ordered from them , i did so becuase of the quick turn_around - sadly the promised two day turnaround tunred into nearly a week .
neutral	still , not bad but very frustrating when you are relying on a promised turnaround time .
neutral	i bought this jacket for my fiance and am extremely glad i read other reviews and ordered a larger_size than her other jackets , the sizing is definately smaller than elsewhere so take that in consideration and definately order a larger_size than needed for a great fit .
neutral	i ordered this for her_birthday and took into_consideration the delivery time and they still missed it .
neutral	i called up a week after ordering and apparently they had attempted to deliver this , which they hadn_'_t as both of us were in when they said they had .
neutral	the customer service lady then said it would definately be delivered the next_day ( saturday ), to which nothing arrived .
neutral	i called up and was told it was passed to a different delivery service but when i received it , it was the original company .
neutral	the following_tuesday it finally arrived , having missed the birthday and had to phone up a number of times chasing this .
neutral	next time i will just go to a shop rather and buy the item directly .
neutral	were not as helpful as they could have been when i had problems !
neutral	won_'_t use again !
neutral	in general the transaction was smooth , i was able to pay by paypal which i found very convenient .
neutral	the shipping was free and claimed to be 0 - 0 working day but by the 0th working day i had not received anything from them i called on the 0th working day after still not receiving anything and sure_enough the guy_who i spoke to was indeed very helpful and explained why there was a delay , it was feasible and i have no reason to think its just an excuse - see , i ordered my stuff on the tuesday of the jubilee_weekend with maximuscles 00_% of day and he said that the high_volume of orders slowed things up abit .
neutral	i guess they maybe should have said that there is likely to be a delay in delivery though but am i splitting hairs ?
neutral	i think i am to be honest .
neutral	but over all , i trust this company , there products have seen me right in the past and the service is generally good .
neutral	i ' d recommend maximuscle and their products to anyone .
neutral	this was the first time for us . the difficulty we had we didnt now where to meet .
neutral	we arrived at the groundfloor of the airport after ringing you 00_minutes earlier .
neutral	nobody was there , we had to ring again to find the right place and that was difficult to find . likewise on arrival ," you want the 0th level ".
neutral	not helpful for first time users not familiar with manchester_airport .
neutral	i am_glad you gave_me the opportunity to complete your survey . i would use you again , but " meet and greet " could be more helpful , especially for 0st timers .
neutral	i got a gear stick for vauxhall_zafira , i was told it was a good condition but when i got it fitted it is very stiff and hard to get in to 0st 0rd and reverse ,
neutral	i have been shopping at morrisons since they bought out safeway in 0000 .
neutral	they keep a reasonable stock of brand items unlike_some , but we have seen them change their management style .
neutral	they now stock shelves during the day , or rather during the busiest times possible , rather_than at night , which is very frustrating trying to dodge around them .
neutral	in addition , it used to be a " nice " place , but the till staff are under so much pressure now , they dare not speak or smile ...
neutral	i made a parking reservation on the web_site , on doing so i made a error with the dates .
neutral	i booked 00 / 00 0000 to 00 / 00 0000 and i meant to book 00 / 00 0000 to 00 / 00 0000 making this mistake cost me a £ 0 admin_fee , which i thought was very unreasonable
neutral	good fast service , great product as always , reasonable price
neutral	good range of products .
neutral	frequently the most_popular products / flavours are out of stock .
neutral	delivery is steadily getting worse .
neutral	don_'_t mind_paying for next_day delivery but don_'_t like when the items arrives 0 days_later by royal_mail with a 00 hour delivery sticker on it .
neutral	we be checking myprotein . com to see if i can get better deals / service
neutral	flowers were great but the ' secure_location ' was them being left_outside my front_door .
neutral	we were in but no one knocked or rang bell .
neutral	i do like pizza from the hut so can knock the food for what it is ........ but the website seems to always have problems with the page timing out at checkout , resulting in having to try and re order 0 or 0 times before it goes though .
neutral	have never had a problem getting media or games for play , but a couple of times orders from their gifts and gadgets have taken longer then the cds / dvds to arrive , and once was not in stock despite taking the order online .
neutral	would be happy to used them again as the competitive_prices out weigh deliver times !
neutral	quality was good , local_florist delivery not good , a little_bit_slow when i first complained about the failed delivery , upgraded bouquet to try and compensate , pathetic phone response kept waiting for 00_mins and 00_mins respectively .
neutral	jack did his best to respond but had problems with local_florist , suggest not using florist again , will give another chance but if same happens again i '_ll go back to calling local_florist .
neutral	i have their ' unlimited ' 0 - discs - at - a - time package .
neutral	they are eerily slow ' receiving ' returned discs if you return them before last post the following_day .
neutral	if you do , it always takes them two_days to acknowledge you '_ve returned discs , ( but not if you post them two or more days after ...) which obviously limits the amount they send you .
neutral	also , they don_'_t work weekends , so discs they receive on saturday aren_'_t processed until monday .
neutral	i '_m finding .
neutral	on my ' unlimited 0 discs at a time ' package , i receive a maximum of 00 films a month when returning discs the following_day .
neutral	in addition , it often takes several months after movie dvds are released to retail before they appear in their catalogue , or even be able to reserve them .
neutral	this is frustrating as i like to reserve a film in advance if i see a trailer or review on tv .
neutral	i moved to lovefilm when blockbuster ( who were slightly better ) closed_down .
neutral	i would cancel if they didn_'_t have the monopoly on postal dvd rental .
neutral	the fact that i had to buy the first tank ( and return the car empty ) put unnecessary pressure on my holiday .
neutral	the constant aim to use the fuel one has already paid for is neither very relaxing nor is it environmentally_friendly ( one ends up driving around just to burn fuel ).
neutral	it left me under the constant threat to run out of petrol before i even reached the airport and it reflects_badly on the provider who is clearly trying to make money with the fear of their clients - not very nice .
neutral	giood cover but the claim process seems a bit of a hassle , yet to complete it so i can '_t say how well it works in the long run .
neutral	i was very annoyed i booked my trip for half past 0 in the early hours of the morning my mistake and upon_arrival to check in at 0 - 00 afternoon time i was very distressed to learn i ' d make the silly_mistake and though surely i ' d just pay a small adjustment fee like we always used to with sea_france , but i was made to pay full price that cost morethan my whole return ticket , no effort was made to help or accommodate me even as a regular_user from this i would be reluctant to use again even_tho they are alot_cheaper i do not feel as a customer i was helped or looked after .
neutral	royal_mail lost my order emailed for replacement and one was sent one out by ups package arrived damaged but goods were ok apart_from the lid on chain lube was cracked .
neutral	i like sportsbikeshop but they need to have a word with there couriers
neutral	gulet sailing experience was wonderful with great skipper , excellent food and very professional crew .
neutral	but ..... having been told by the agent ( and was one of the reasons for booking ) that our 0 teenage children family would be with simlar , we were put on a boat with 0 italian / spanish couples .
neutral	this type of holiday is very intimate - eating , socialising , bathing in close surroundings so this aspect was disappointing .. and for couples wanting peace and quiet , then the sight of teenagers was equally shocking !
neutral	!
neutral	the old hie used to get my order to me the next_day or definately the day after .
neutral	the orders now seen to take a week or just over .
neutral	when i order something it is because i need it asap .
neutral	the prices are still veery competative though .
neutral	first time i ordered from this firm the delivery never arrived and it took a further 0 days and numerous phone_calls to get the item redelivered ?
neutral	the second time the ffx decided in their wisdom to hold back dispatching a next_day delivery item on a £_000 fein because they were waiting for a 000ml_bottle of stain to come into stock ?
neutral	to add_insult to injury they didn_'_t tell me this and i wasted another day waiting for the item .
neutral	all in all not good i '_m afraid .
neutral	my sister liked the winter flowers which were delivered on the correct date but , because the florist omitted my greeting_card , she did not know who had sent them .
neutral	i have ordered two_pairs of raybans from selectspecs in the last three_months .
neutral	the pair were for me , a saving of 00_% from the high_street .
neutral	great price , but ... they took about 0_weeks to come , and then they werent the right fitting .
neutral	as they were varifocals , i put this down to the fact that you really do need to go to a high_street_optician , to get an accurate fitting .
neutral	i did send them an old pair of glasses to aid measurement .
neutral	i will have to get the lens changed , and pay the high_street price .
neutral	selectspecs offered to changed them for a a fixed lens pair , but i declined .
neutral	the other pair , for my son , were perfect .
neutral	very pleased with the price , and service .
neutral	three_weeks as_opposed to five .
neutral	good price , good product but slow to deliver
neutral	ramada room was spacious , but we had no cold_water and air_con too noisy to sleep .
neutral	moved to an exec room which was quiet and the cold_water did work , however the room was actually less spacious and the bed was only king_size as_opposed to 0 ft in the standard room
neutral	out of all the companies i have used for lenses this is by far the worst with regard to delivery times .
neutral	far too long .
neutral	would recommened site prices ok , but delivery times only start when they have processed order .
neutral	ie order placed and accepted on a wednesday order arrives on monday 0 - 0 delivery paid for delvery ends up four days
neutral	aferry . co . uk is a great place to go to to book a ferry .
neutral	i '_ve_used them before and had no_hesitation in using them again .
neutral	however , this time i had some difficulties receiving a confirmation_email and as the time got nearer to departure i started to get worried that i could turn_up at the port and not get on the boat .
neutral	so i tried to contact through the internet site ( luckily i had noted down the booking_reference at the time i booked ).
neutral	i had no reply using the website so i tried e_- mailing but after a week had to ring twice as i had had no reply to the email .
neutral	the first call got a frosty reception and i was told that the email would be answered eventually .
neutral	i asked if they would send me the confirmation_email and was told it was on its way ... 00_hours_later i rang again as nothing had arrived .
neutral	this time i spoke to someone_who was very helpful , she didn_'_t make it seem like i was asking for too much and explained that i could even turn_up at the port with the booking_reference written on the back of my hand and i get on the boat .
neutral	to be on the safe side i gave her a second email address and within_seconds the booking confirmation arrived , then it arrived at my original email address too .
neutral	so all '_s well now and iv ' e got the email i wanted and the back of my hand too .
neutral	i '_m happy that things eventually got sorted_out through " travel gateway " and that i was lucky_enough to get a good response from a human_being when all the automation and previously failed .
neutral	i will book with aferry . co . uk again as they are a very good hub for ferry bookings , but next time i hope i don_'_t have to go chasing to find the confirmation_email .
neutral	i found this company paying really good price for my mobile_phone .
neutral	price was £_00 more than everybody_else so i requested ( tracked ) free prepaid_envelope .
neutral	to be honest , it was delivered really speedy and was in my letter_box next_day morning .
neutral	there was some problems after it .
neutral	i send my phone at wednesday_afternoon .
neutral	monday_morning i received an email from scrappa asking when i gonna post my mobile .
neutral	it was really stressful for me as this phone was valued for £_000 .
neutral	luckily it was send as tracked item .
neutral	they checked status and said that theirs local post_office claims , package was delivered to them but the do not have it .
neutral	issue was really between scrappa and post_office .
neutral	anyway ..
neutral	finally , i got my money ( full_amount as agreed ) paid yesterday , a week after i send my item .
neutral	also had message from scrappa ( because i meant to post another mobile_phone worth £_000 ), saying if i want to send another , it is strongly advice to post in for myself using recorded sign for post_office postage as they do not take anymore responsibility for prepaid 00hrs track postage which they send me .
neutral	in general .
neutral	i got my money , full_amount .
neutral	they pay pretty_much_better_than everybody_else ( so_far ), but i '_m not too sure if i would go there again .
neutral	at_least not this time as i already have sent my second phone to another company .
neutral	i bought a samsung dvd remote but it did not work with our model .
neutral	e_- spares were not able to source a orginal replacment or a compatible .
neutral	i was able to return the remote easily and had a refund a few_days_later minus a handling / postage cost .
neutral	ordered over £_00 worth was told next_day delivery , it took 0 days not happy
neutral	la_calidad de_la bomba no es la esperada tal y_como de describe , y_el envío no fue todo lo rapido que esperaba
neutral	the online booking service is one i use regulary .
neutral	it is easy to use , but is fraustrating at teh payment state .
neutral	after entering my card_details and pressing submit , it defaults by saying that i am timed out .
neutral	there is no chance of this .
neutral	i then re - enter and it accepts .
neutral	please find a soluttiona asap .
neutral	i ordered a cooker which was not in stock however pixmania came through a delivered 0 day later great , but the cooker never made off the van as it was damaged here begins the problem :-
neutral	0 ) it took the driver 0 hour to arrange return he then told me to contact pixmania .
neutral	0 contacted pixmania the next_day and was told i would be notified in 00_hours of the appropriate_action and refund i managed to get across that i wanted a replacement not a refund .
neutral	0 ) 00_hours no email so back on the phone and through the same story and result wait 00_hours .
neutral	0 ) 00_hours no email so back on the phone and through the same story and result wait 00_hours so i asked for the head_office number but they don_'_t have one as its in france .
neutral	0 ) 00_hours no email so back on the phone i spoke the the same person and he was good enough not to fob me off with the usual " i so sorry " but had no choice but to repeat pixmanias ' position which was " we can '_t do anything until the goods are returned " remember i never even received the cooker .
neutral	so at this point i tried the find out how to contact head_office this time i called dixon group who own pixmania they put me on the the know how group which does delivery and installation with 00_mins they contacted pixmania and i had an email from pixmania they will deliver the cooker in 0 day result at last .
neutral	despite the above
neutral	the people i spoke to were polite and as helpful as they were aloud to be and although i wasn_'_t abusive my apologies to them for putting up with an irate customer when their hands are tie by an inflexible system .
neutral	this could have be sorted by a phone_call to the delivery company to confirm the return and i could have had my cooker 0 days quicker .
neutral	to pixmania ,
neutral	please train and allow your staff to make_decisions to help your customers and not have to clear everything through head_office .
neutral	thanks to your slow lumbering system i will be without a cooker for 00 days instead of my planned 0 day as my gas oven an hob were removed and disconnected ready for my new electric_cooker .
neutral	just as well you have good staff at your call_centre .
neutral	update :-
neutral	following pixmanias ' reply to this review i have been in touch with emma and all is well , i would up their rating to 0_stars if i knew how .
neutral	why why , we all need free money but don_'_t buy what you don_'_t need
neutral	i had text from dpd uk to say they would deliver a parcel between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 and to make_sure i was in to receive it .
neutral	nothing arrived .
neutral	i checked the tracking and it says " unable to locate " but they have my phone number and only needed to phone and ask for directions .
neutral	they managed to deliver a parcel here for my neighbour this morning .
neutral	i now have no idea whether they are going to try again or whether it '_s gone back to the depot .
neutral	i tried_phoning their customer_services but couldn_'_t get through to a human_being ( their automaton hung_up on me twice ).
neutral	not fantastic .
neutral	update 0th_january
neutral	today the parcel arrived on time .
neutral	i have therefore updated my rating .
neutral	i just wish they had got it right first time and still feel that the ability to contact a human_being in their customer_services_department when none of the pre_- recorded options is relevant would be an improvement .
neutral	the site provides a huge_selection and prices are usually competitive .
neutral	main gripes are that six items can result in 0 different deliveries - my street is like the m0 full of delivery vans after every order .
neutral	big plus is that amazon are very helpful when things go_wrong and help resolve the issues quickly
neutral	some of the data especially on the credit_score page doesn_'_t always correspond with the actual results of the companies so i then have to go a lot deeper into things which is very time_consuming . a separate summary page with the credit_score and relevant facts is exactly_what i need and use . i would also prefer to contact you by email rather_than a social_media page should i need to .
neutral	i am still_awaiting my first payment since sept_0000 .. my fault i missed seeing the condition re energy providers ... but was easy to miss and then very difficult to navigate to find out why no payt received as no specific personal info available to say where or why money was still sitting on my a / c and not in my bank .. pure_chance i eventually found the answer ... i hope !
neutral	i had a similar experience to some of the other reviews here .
neutral	i ordered a pc case that was in stock on their website and listed as in stock in the order confirmation_email .
neutral	after a few_days i was contacted to say that due to issues with tnt losing stock they were unable to fulfill my order right now and they couldn_'_t tell me when it would be fulfilled .
neutral	the difference in my experience compared to some of the other reviews here is that for that i asked for a full_refund and the money was returned to my credit_card by the next_day .
neutral	ordered 0 blinds and one week_later delivery was left with neighbour without a calling_card , not their fault i guess .
neutral	opened box and only one blind inside without a note or explanation .
neutral	called only to find answer phone so left voicemail and emailed , neither were returned .
neutral	left further 0 days and called again and finally spoke to someone_who said they couldn_'_t understand what happened and things were in hand .
neutral	another delivery was received around a week_later .
neutral	both products ok but had a couple of issues which are still_unresolved .
neutral	based on my experience i wouldn_'_t use again .
neutral	no idea of customer service or communication at all and product could be better .
neutral	on the plus_side wide_range offered and cost pretty competitive so maybe my experience is somewhat isolated .
neutral	quicker and cheaper_than competitors .
neutral	both online and subsequent catoloque received with order state that the specific spax mdf screws ordered have pozi heads .
neutral	they actually have t - star heads which are slightly_different to others t - star heads being spax and the driver bits are only available from manufacturer and not something that ironmongery_direct supply .
neutral	so ended_up with 000 screws and no way of using them .
neutral	ordered bits from simply spax which cost as much as screws .
neutral	i bought a new donjoy knee_brace which turned_up in very good time and at a fair price .
neutral	despite reading the instructions several_times and scouring the internet for more help i was not convinced that i was fitting it to my leg in the very best position . i emailed the supplier , physioroom , if they could help me with a proper fitting or point me towards someone_who could . i received an email back saying no they could not help me , look at this short video ( which i had already seen ).
neutral	in my opinion this is shoddy service from someone_who supplies a very specialist product .
neutral	i have since found someone to help and am so pleased that i '_m buying a second brace as a spare ( to leave in the car in case i forget to take mine to golf !)
neutral	but i '_m not re - ordering from physioroom .
neutral	as stated above , reasonable service from frames direct , unnecessary emails_confirming what i was previously told was complete , however was not .
neutral	slow to prepare glasses to prescription .
neutral	courier service absolutely_terrible , extremely poor communication by several different agents .
neutral	email requesting import_tax payment paid on day of receipt , however , held by courier for a further eight days requesting payment .
neutral	despite several emails explaining payment had been made , courier held item without justifiable reason .
neutral	would not use frames direct again .
neutral	the online ordering system can cause problems by accepting all order details including payment details but on order confirmation states that delivery to the given address is unavailable .
neutral	a second online order went through correctly once customer_services confirmed , by phone , that the first order details would not be registered on their system .
neutral	the order was duly delivered as two kitchen taps against two different order numbers in one package .
neutral	the return of one tap by parcel_force was efficiently arranged by bathempire but a phone_call was necessary two_weeks_later as no money refund had been received .
neutral	i would add that the appearance and quality of the tiffany kichen tap wascellent
neutral	your goods are excellent but the delivery wasappalling . it was sent as a large letter with royal_mail . they say it would not go through a letterbox so since they didn , t ring the bell i had to pick it up using a taxi . i have had problems with royal_mail before and its no good complaining to them because they just don , t listen ... they won , t leave parcels arond the back and in this case they didn , t even stop to ring the bell . i find my friends have similar problems and i do not want anything delivered by royal_mail again
neutral	no_problems with anything just ghat when i came to pay a booking_fee was added with 0 other charges ... would have been more honest if the charges were already visible
neutral	never rated a company before on the web .
neutral	but , price was good ; service was good , arrived on time .
neutral	only_downside no instructions for the drum stool and hi hat stand was packed in brown_paper and not boxed .
neutral	i booked 0 new tyres to be fitted to my vauxhall_astra on saturday 00 / 00 /_0000 .
neutral	i arrived at my designated garage unaware that the tyres had not been delivered .
neutral	i spoke to the manager who informed me that the tyres had not arrived .
neutral	he contacted tyreshopper and the representative '_s solution t my problem was that i was to just come_back on monday .
neutral	having taken the morning off work i didn_'_t really think that this was an acceptable solution .
neutral	after debating the problem for several minutes the male agreed to have national_tyres fit an_alternative brand which was the ideal_solution .
neutral	after the initial_hiccup the tyres were fitted with no further problems .
neutral	tyre_shopper is an excellent website that i have used twice in the last_week .
neutral	i was initially disappointed in the solution to the problem but the representative redeemed himself and i will_continue to use and recommend the company .
neutral	map location is wrong !!!
neutral	!
neutral	they are not alamo !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i spend more then 00 in on taxi to finde this plase !!
neutral	!
neutral	the worktop recieved was once a nice piece of timber , but the delivery company must have been idiots .
neutral	the end was very damaged and a lump was taken out of the side .
neutral	a complaint was made and resolved .
neutral	.
neutral	parcel arrived opened and wet .
neutral	will not know whether the goods are damaged until use ?
neutral	good product but one of them was not stitched at the bottom of the pajama .
neutral	clear website , efficient ordering_process and email_updates , but the royal_mail bit not so good :
neutral	- ordered 0 june
neutral	- dispatched 0 june
neutral	- arrived 0 june
neutral	not exactly " express delivery ( by 0pm next business day )"
neutral	just one massive criticism . your customers are a 00 year_old couple . we bought
neutral	£ 0000 worth of furniture which was delivered promptly and efficiently but as soon as
neutral	your deliverymen left we realised our big_mistake and yours . there were 00 cartons
neutral	mostly large with heavy contents and very strongly packaged . at our age trying to unpack was a nightmare and eventually disposing of the packaging was another
neutral	huge problem . several of the items were too heavy for us to lift or move . we should
neutral	have arranged for you to unpack ( with a charge ) or refused to purchase .
neutral	you should look at your customers and say to yourself can this couple cope with
neutral	our delivery conditions obviously not and discuss_options with us
neutral	inevitably we are telling friends and relatives about our experience and this is poor
neutral	publicity for oak_furniture_land
neutral	i was really pleased with the look of the invites and the finish was great !
neutral	my only problem was that i ordered 00 invites which i received , but i only received 00 envelopes !
neutral	it was a pain having to source 0 additional envelopes that would fit , and at my own_expense !
neutral	great selection of gear and at a good price , annoyingly i '_ve experienced issues when trying ( and paying ) for next_day service , they havent sent the goods out and havent let_me know why until i have hassled them .
neutral	overall they are ok and i still use them , just not for critical stuff any more .
neutral	one item wasn_'_t delivered , i left an answer phone message , nobody returned my call .
neutral	rang on two other occasions , complaining the item hadn_'_t been delivered , the guy promised to come_back to me , heard_nothing at all .
neutral	eventually received a computer_generated email_saying the goods had been despatched .
neutral	i have my doubts that they were despatched in the first place , was on the point of reporting to barclaycard when the arrived .
neutral	bbq was great price and was shipped / received in 00_hours .
neutral	sadly the shipment arrived without my bbq_cover which , a week_later still has not arrived .
neutral	have contacted twice about this issue and was told first time ( thursday ) to ring back next week and second time ( tuesday of next week ) that someone would look into it and ring me back , they haven_'_t .
neutral	bbq currently sat in conservatory ( unused ) as can '_t cover it up outside .
neutral	all in all not a huge issue and at the end of the day it was a great price .
neutral	our new tokyo sideboard is really lovely , however it arrived slightly_damaged at the rear .
neutral	but because oak_furnitureland wash their hands of any responsibility with regards to returning items , we are keeping it .
neutral	purchased an hp officejet pro 0000a plus e_- all - in - one wireless multifunction inkjet_printer from this company , the item was delivered within the time_scale promised but unfortunately they failed to inform_me either by sms or text when this was .
neutral	it was very fortunate that the wife arrived home at that very same time .
neutral	service was really good , after ordering wellies arrived promptly .
neutral	however , as we excitedly open our new wellies and tried them on , my partner fit_perfectly , and looked great ....
neutral	mine were two different_sizes , the right one was right , the left one ...
neutral	well on the inner sole was printed a size 0 , and every where else is was sized as a ten .
neutral	when stood next to each other you could easilly see the size difference .
neutral	spoke to easy wellis and they sorted the problem really easilly and quickly , new willies are great and fit_perfectly .
neutral	well_done , fantastic customer service .
neutral	i was with 0 for a couple of years and at first seemed ok although the coverage wasn_'_t that great and i was supposed to receive a 0g_signal everywhere around me but i didn_'_t .
neutral	the worst thing about them was the endless calls from 0 trying to sell me another phone or contract , they would go through periods of ringing me four times a day for a week until i answered it !!
neutral	!
neutral	even when i answered it and said i don_'_t want another phone they would carry on saying i could give it to a family_member or friend .... why the hell would i want to pay for someone_elses phone !
neutral	when i cancelled my contract the person was trying to sell me another one .... rediculous .
neutral	i would not use them again purely_because in this day and age there is no excuse for not processing and sending an order out in just one or two_days following the order instead of 00 days especially as there are so many other_companies to choose from out there .
neutral	to charge extra for slightly faster processing is not good business practice .
neutral	also communication only followed when a query was placed .
neutral	to be fair the product was good and well_packaged and they did respond quickly to queries .
neutral	however as i say i won_'_t be rushing_back !
neutral	same as above , not received the parcel yet after a week
neutral	i bought my aviva home insurance through_quidco and saved_myself quite a bit of money on the policy cost but the cash_back amount stated was £_00 . 00 and i '_ve ended_up getting £_00 . 00 .
neutral	overall i '_ve saved money but i don_'_t think they should quote one amount and give another .
neutral	very easy to use site with good choice of fragrances
neutral	ordered sunday_night , arrived wednesday , what more can i say ?
neutral	as ordered , with the option to send back if i needed to , made obvious inside the top of the box .
neutral	as it happens , i will be keeping my purchase ......
neutral	basically they messed_up my order .
neutral	they didn_'_t put the extra hard_drive i ordered in , so now i have to send it back to them and then wait for them to fix it then send it back .
neutral	also i asked for windows 0 to be installed instead of windows 0 , which they did for me .
neutral	however every time i turn the laptop on it tells_me that the operating_system is incompatible with drivers .
neutral	this is not what you expect when you pay over £ 0000 for something .
neutral	however i '_m_sure that they are usually better_than this , i was told to use this site by a few guys i know who had no_problems .
neutral	i ordered a google lens , but the wrong_colour arrived ...
neutral	i rang up and the customer service attendant said that they had the correct one in stock , and he ' d hold it over for me .
neutral	got an email a couple of days_later to day that they were out of stock :( was able to get a full_refund , but disappointed .
neutral	i will once i get my parcel
neutral	normally the delivery of items from cpc is excellent , however my last item was sent from cpc by royal_mail .
neutral	they managed to make a complete mess of the delivery by returning the item to cpc without explanation and the packaged was left in some obscure place at cpc .
neutral	so by the time i phoned a query i didn_'_t receive the item for over a week and a half . however i did get a refund and an_apology from cpc .
neutral	this one bad_experience has not put me off using cpc .
neutral	it is always a bad policy not to have fully inclusive rates , it is very annoying to be asked to pay extra for ins etc after paying in advance it is not nessessary for you not to have inclusive rates , extra driver charge a bit expensive for the short rental_period ,
neutral	secondly for a short hire_period a full_tank of fuel charge was well over what was required and we returned the vehicle with over half a tankful of fuel with no way of recompense , half a tank would be much fairer for all hirers ,
neutral	we do visit spain three or four times a year plus many of our freinds and all have this hang up over extra_charges at the pick_up desk
neutral	delivered on time and efficiently , but my laptop ( samsung r000 ) is functioning slowly
neutral	ok it '_s easy and worthwhile going via their site to do purchases and get the credits , but a bit of a hassle actually trying to get " cash " back .
neutral	site said the retaillers wouldn_'_t agree to me getting the cash transferred_into my bank_account ( after giving my full bank details !)
neutral	and pushed me towards " love to shop " vouchers .
neutral	i have went down this road as it '_s still ok but i would have preferred to actually get " cash " xxx
neutral	choosing tuffnells for the delivery sevice is not one of you best decisions .
neutral	i know , the uk as a whole knows , in advance , that deliveries approaching christmas are more difficult ; in no way shouild that be excuse for tuffnells to send an e_- mail to the client at 0 . 00am on one morning ( dec 00 ) stating that the consigment was already at bristol and that local delivery will be made the following_day ( dec_00th ), then sending a second e_- mail at 00 . 00 on that supposed delivery day ( dec_00th ) that delivery had " failed "( no further explanation ) and that delivery would be made next_day ( dec_00th ).
neutral	thus one complete day wasted by client waiting in vain .
neutral	only when client took the trouble to contact tuffnells at bristol directly by telephone , after 0000h on dec_00th did they behave responsibly and deliver within the following hour .
neutral	no apology for the incovenence and waste of valuable time for the client as yet received .
neutral	metals0reputation , for which you should be proud , has to be attenuated
neutral	by clients if also the delivery service is not up to reasonable standard .
neutral	ordered peugeot bumper in colour which i am happy with .
neutral	service was good and efficient at a reasonable price for goods .
neutral	bumper delivered by xda who on first call left a card as i was out [ no warning they were coming ].
neutral	it gave a mobile no to ring to rearrange delivery .
neutral	despite_repeated_calls there was no answer and on 0 occasions the phone seemed to be answered and then cut_off .
neutral	i looked online for depot landline no joy .
neutral	i emailed head_office and to date have had no reply .
neutral	next_day firm came again whilst i was out and left real snotty note ring to rearrange delivery or bumper would go back to supplier .
neutral	again i tried for 0 hours ... no reply .
neutral	at 0 . 00pm i got through and driver said he would deliver next_day but couldn_'_t give time or even morning or afternoon delivery .
neutral	i cancelled my commitments and waited in and got bumper about 00 . 00pm .
neutral	delivery needs to be by a more switched on company .
neutral	ordered and paid on line like most things nowadays , was straightforward enough .
neutral	had to drive 00 miles to the fitter however .
neutral	( national_tyres ) i rang the fitter before going as advised and i arrived at the agreed time but my job was not started for half an_hour .
neutral	various " walk ins " were dealt_with and eventually my fitting was done .
neutral	it then took over an_hour .
neutral	staff were courteous and quality coffee was available at 00p .
neutral	the waiting area was clean and comfortable .
neutral	shiply fine be careful book early allow time to go else where .
neutral	seems every one can move a 0 bedroom house in a transit regardless of the i finery or volume requirements .
neutral	fridge bashed dining_room chair split in two wheels off typist chair room full of stuff left_behind driver says you will leave me .
neutral	good review i '_m_sure i will .
neutral	get another job
neutral	some items were delivered that had expired , some other items had short expiry_dates .
neutral	this is the second time this has happened .
neutral	the issue was resolved .
neutral	the trees are in good condition although they were delivered to the wrong_address not acceptable when address and instructions for delivery were clearly_stated
neutral	i had read_reviews and comments regarding the onboard prices and they were not wrong .
neutral	i cannot understand_why this company charge so much .
neutral	most people expect a bit of a surcharge when they are part of a captive_audience but when faced with pricing like this , if they are anything like me they become stubborn and refuse to buy virtually anything .
neutral	if i '_m not mistaken a pint of beer was in the region of 0 - 0 euro .
neutral	breakfast at 00 . 00 .
neutral	we survived on a few snacks and probably had 0 - 0 good nights at our destination on what we saved .
neutral	we returned home on irish_ferries .
neutral	just as nice for roughly the same travel cost but food and beverage at half the price , 0 . 00euro for a pint of beer .
neutral	back to dfds .
neutral	cabins good .
neutral	staff good to very good .
neutral	due to exorbitant price of food & beverage i treated this as method of getting from a - b instead of enjoying a relaxing cruise with a nice meal and glass of wine .
neutral	if dfds charged reasonable prices on board their customers would spend twice as much .
neutral	went in store to look at a product .
neutral	found product and it looked okay the sales_guy wasn_'_t too pushy and was mostly helpful .
neutral	left store and , once decided , ordered online .
neutral	seemed to go through smoothly .
neutral	was informed when delivery would be and it did come within the 0 hour time_slot , although i did not receive a 00 minute notice call as informed .
neutral	i did receive a 0 minute notice call - luckily i was in .
neutral	the product ordered is okay i guess for £_000 .
neutral	it will benefit from some careful sanding .
neutral	the service was fine .
neutral	all was fine , nothing amazing but no_problems .
neutral	people seem to be amazed and full of praise when they get what they paid for but i think that '_s a 0_star service .
neutral	free polish and some zen advice on furniture arrangement might have crept my review to 0 / 0_stars , but is good service not just the standard ?
neutral	hence 0_stars .
neutral	i used to use this car_park on every business trip i went on but recently i have looked at other options as the prices has_risen , on my length of stay , by roughly 00 %.
neutral	the bus service is very good and it is close by but the competitors are better priced
neutral	the wine gift box set was delivered in time but a bottle of red was delivered instead of a bottle of white .
neutral	unfortunately my father - in - law doesn_'_t drink red_wine !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a bathroom rad specifically from best heating because of their same day despatch promise ( i could have got it a bit cheaper_elsewhere but had 0 - 0day timeframe ).
neutral	however it turned_out in stock , meant in stock with our suppliers , which actually meant not in stock for at_least a week with our suppliers .
neutral	was promised a call back for a update , nothing .
neutral	chased up the product again , promised another call back .
neutral	nothing .
neutral	still_waiting ..
neutral	another order i made was dispatched for next_day delivery , nothing turned .
neutral	hope it is still with the courier and it will come next week .
neutral	update
neutral	just a quick update .
neutral	my milano cayos rads turned_up and i '_m pretty impressed .
neutral	they look great , feel reassuringly solid and look well built .
neutral	there was a bit missing in one pack but bestheating did redeem_themselves - a quick call and a spare was on the way .
neutral	the bathroom rad is a bit of a different_story .
neutral	after a frustrating wait it did turn_up eventually but tbh , not so happy with it ( the finish on the towel hanger is not so good ).
neutral	as its not held in stock by bestheating , i have to send in photos and wait for the supplier / manufacturer to come_back for a replacement part .
neutral	so , if you want one of the milano radiators , then the prices are good , the stock_levels seem to be accurate and the service is fine at bestheating ( though the courier is a little hit and miss ).
neutral	for the other makes , best to phone and check if its a stock item or one ordered from supplier .
neutral	sorry but when ordering my glasses from ozeal i didn_'_t think they would take so long if your desperate for glasses go to a high_st store you can get them in half the time took over two_weeks from the date i ordered them you can get them off high_st shops in three_days i ordered them for driving before i went on hols and had to go without them has i ordered them over two_weeks before i went away
neutral	it would be good to provide an easy view for cost - conscious , flexible shoppers of the prices for say , 0 or 0 days before the date and 0 or 0 days after the date , so we can decide_whether to travel on the date itself or earlier or later based on prices .
neutral	i love the grinder and it was a good price , only think that really got me wound up was that the delivery company ( apc i think they were called ) was terrible to deal with .
neutral	i work 0 days a week from 0am_till_0pm so i missed the delivery , when i called the company to re arrange delivery to either my worksite or a neighbors house they said that they could do nothing without permission from the sender , and unless i sorted it out by that day it would be returned to sender .
neutral	i was unable to get your phone number to call you to rearrange delivery as i had no internet signal where i was .
neutral	so i had to drive the 0 . 0 hours to there delivery ware_house to collect it .
neutral	the girls there were so grumpy i could not wait to get out of there .
neutral	please use another company to deliver as i would not order from you again if apc are the delivery company .
neutral	thanks craig
neutral	i have placed just one order - due to stock issues i '_m having to wait a few weeks - not too much of a problem in this particular instance - just slightly frustrating ...
neutral	however - before my order arrives i get two promotional messages offering me other stuff - each message a strong reminder of the failure to delver - and then - and then - as if to rub_salt into my wound - a survey to complete .
neutral	a " what do you think of our service ?"
neutral	survey from a company that has yet to give any service - kafkaesque !
neutral	better by far to wait a few_months .
neutral	if a customer places repeat_orders you can tell - and send out the survey only after completion - it '_s the sensible way .
neutral	otherwise people will just ask to unsubscribe .
neutral	i award 0_stars - more by way of hope and expectation than experience .
neutral	i love the variety of thins 00mx has .
neutral	it '_s good to know you have nearly everything i need .
neutral	however , i don_'_t like the delivery service .
neutral	it way too over priced and it took over a week to receive something as simple as spark_plugs .
neutral	a very nice place everything you would expect in a b_& b just the website did ' nt make it clear to me , that there was a price for room only and it was extra for breakfast , also it should be made clear that the final payment is cash only
neutral	this caused a minor_problem for us other than that everything else was high_standard
neutral	sofa arrived first thing the next_day , which is excellent .
neutral	it did not include the memory_foam pillow , however .
neutral	on the monday , i used the contact form on the website to explain the problem .
neutral	no reply was ever received : i ended_up having to ring up .
neutral	at this point , one was dispatched and it arrived two_days_later .
neutral	other issues are the html - only emails you send ( such as the one inviting me to fill out this survey ).
neutral	my mail client does not support html mail , only displaying the plain text section of mails , which your mails lack .
neutral	it also got caught as spam because of this , and i only just noticed it !
neutral	item ordered was spot on , the price was right .
neutral	however , delivery took longer_than_expected and no communication about delay .
neutral	was not sure if delivery was on its way , until item actually arrived , with a email confirmation received around same time .
neutral	when item was delivered it was a sense of relief .
neutral	the site is one of the cheapest on the internet , but the service let it down .
neutral	i paid for next_day delivery but the items took 0 days to arrive - problems with the delivery company unfortunatly .
neutral	however , when it finaly arrived , one of the items was incorrect , so i cut my losses and sent the order back .
neutral	following the online direction , i also paid for insurance , meaning the return cost me over £_00 in postage .
neutral	white &_bishop initially refused to refund this , despite the numerous errors , but eventualy agreed to pay for return postage too .
neutral	delivered 0 days early , good job we were at home , very helpful delivery man .
neutral	all in all nice summerhouse but roof very ' flimsy ' but with extra timber was able to strengthen and make good .
neutral	purchased your 0x0 base but had to buy more timber to support the veranda .
neutral	apart_from the roof problems , very well made and my wife is looking_forward to nice sunny evenings relaxing in her summerhouse .
neutral	a good network but very slow to connect when you lose and gain signal , also very expensive when you go abroad and make calls and use internet ( more than any network i have been with before ).
neutral	just one critism , you could have informed me that i needed a visa for this destination .
neutral	i bought a few items direct from the ffx website and will not be buying again .
neutral	firstly they didn_'_t inform_me right away about them not having stock of one of the items and they withheld the whole order .
neutral	i had to phone two_days_later and ask what was going on .
neutral	the person on the phone then said it will be at my home on friday so i waited in and it didn_'_t come , i spoke to them on the phone and the person said it will now be there on the monday .
neutral	when i received the package on monday the item was the lt model and not the ltx model !!!
neutral	they threw in an old dusty drill box for free but nobody ever uses the boxes , that '_s why i ordered a bag with the consignment .
neutral	they have arranged to pick the item up so now i must wait in another day !
neutral	!
neutral	this will be two_weeks now and i have to wait untill they get there wrong order back ?
neutral	you should have sent me a replacement right away .....
neutral	for the most part very straight_forward and once its set_up it moves very quickly .
neutral	though the last time i was asked to request 0 friends and get the money the next_day by 0pm , but it kept error out .
neutral	even_though they have been added to my account .
neutral	so i lost out on the next_day transfer .
neutral	better_bathrooms have had some bad_reviews recently .
neutral	i am being generous with 0_stars as i think they are trying to improve their service - which has_been their week point .
neutral	i ordered three products and i was kept waiting because the third product did not arrive .
neutral	i had to argue and pay extra to get the first two products sent on , which they finally did .
neutral	the girl on the customers service desk ( katie , i think ) was very pleasant and tried really hard .
neutral	but every time i asked a question she had to go and get authorisation .
neutral	this meant a long phone_call which could have taken just a few minutes .
neutral	katie needs to be given either training or authority to make_decisions .
neutral	if only companies realised that the quality of customer service these days can make or beak a business .
neutral	i sincerely_hope they get the message as their products and prices are good .
neutral	product arrived as on time and well_packed but i had to pay a customs fee to dhl as this company are not uk_based .
neutral	everything on the site makes you think you are purchasing from a uk company but they are based in honk_kong .
neutral	my order arrived on time and was delivered as per my wishes 0 days ago .
neutral	upon_opening i noticed that my order was incomplete with no recipes for the veal and no chicken .
neutral	i phoned straight_away and was promised an e_mail that night with the recipes and how my chicken would either be sent or compensated .
neutral	as it was nearly six pm i thought i would wait_until the next_day to hear .
neutral	i haven_'_t heard a word but have been bombarded daily with e_mails_asking for more orders .
neutral	i don_'_t think that '_s going to happen .
neutral	i can not right a review as iam still_waiting for my order
neutral	the website was easy to use and my order was available before the 00 day expected delivery time .
neutral	i bought from homebase because they were extremely competitively_priced due to a 00_% reduction on their radiators
neutral	disappointed i couldnt use my recent homebase vouchers that had been sent to me in the post .
neutral	i couldnt buy the product i wanted in store and couldnt use the vouchers online .
neutral	i had a voucher for triple nectar_points that i could not take benefit of .
neutral	all in all , reasonably satisfied .
neutral	would shop_here again if prices were competitive
neutral	good prices on tiles compared to other_retailers , but shipping_costs don_'_t make it viable to order .
neutral	need to know when my parcel arrives for example am / pm to prevent loss of time at work .
neutral	i ordered a case for my htc , and it was delivered very fast and item was good , just like i expected it to be , but first of all , there was some strange pieces of paper on the inner side of my case .
neutral	but the most unpleasant thing was the fact , that when htc '_s upper button sinks inside the frame - and that is happening with used phones - it is really very hard to press it .
neutral	no communication
neutral	when ordering my new ultra torque chainset and sti '_s i asked on the phone whether i would need any additional parts to complete the changeover .
neutral	upon_receiving the parts , very efficiently , iwas told by the local bicycle shop that i also need special italian style power cups to fit on the bottom_bracket as well as the cranks .
neutral	i then had to reoder them .
neutral	i had asked on the phone if i needed anything additional !!
neutral	!
neutral	hand book omitted from pack handed to me .
neutral	a fundamental necessity i would have thought when buying a new car .
neutral	general_manager writes to me telling_me about latest offer and inviting me to visit showroom a few_days after i had just bought a new car .
neutral	i sent e_- mail to general_manager about that and 0 / 0 other matters but received no reply to my inquiry or any apology .
neutral	disappointed with that attitude .
neutral	dealing_with the salesman himself was fine and he did hid best .
neutral	car hand over and admin all went well .
neutral	the service is very good .
neutral	good sell - by dates .
neutral	the problem now is the delivery costs to france .
neutral	it is now possible to buy the same products here at a higher price than gb , but they are not more_expensive when you take the delivery costs into account of bringing them from gb .
neutral	i know the more you buy the cheaper it becomes but the quantities necessary are more than we need at any one time .
neutral	the waterproofs seem quite good , trousers are a bit coco - the - clown !
neutral	delivery was terrible !
neutral	carrier assumed he was at the right house , actually he was trying to deliver to an unoccupied house and kept leaving cards there .
neutral	eventually twigged when i checked the parcel - track on - line .
neutral	the website was good , it just would have been handy to have some notification to say my order was ready to pick_up .
neutral	i got an email to say payment had been processed but that was it .
neutral	when i called they were very friendly and picking it up was really easy .
neutral	one simple email and it would be a great experience !
neutral	the price is very competitive , however , when i arrived in cancun , there was no driver with a large sign waiting .
neutral	i spent about 00_mins looking for the right person and it turned_out they had been wandering_around not by the arrivals exit and they only had an a0 clipboard which had multiple other logos on too , so was not easily_identifiable .
neutral	then had to wait about 00_mins for the van .
neutral	another comment : the website is confusing to use if you want to book one way transfers out of resort as the boxes refer to inbound flights and the wording swaps around between pages - maybe look into it .
neutral	overall i was pleased with the service for the price though and my return transfer ran perfectly .
neutral	happy with product , however , delivery time was a joke and no tracking_facility
neutral	the car was ok , but having a flat tyre is a complete pain in the arse .
neutral	car had no spare tyre when i had a flat tyre near hawkshead in the lake_district , uk .
neutral	had to ring to arrange towing to the nearest europcar office for a replacement vehicle .
neutral	by the time the towing service arrived it was too late to travel down to morecombe before office closed .
neutral	had to get towed to where i was staying in keswick - half a day wasted .
neutral	next_morning had to arranged to be towed to carlisle and swop cars there - another half day wasted .
neutral	must have cost europecar a fortune and racked off an otherwise happy customer who did not appreciate having precious overseas holiday time wasted by something as simple as a wheel change that i could have fixed in 00_minutes .
neutral	we had a great experience at the mousetrap inn .
neutral	the rooms were clean and the facilities were good .
neutral	breakfast was great and the scrambled eggs were the best we had tasted , so it '_s top_marks for the chef and we told her so !
neutral	the inn is situated out of the tourist centre , but still close enough to walk to the common in 0 / 0 minutes .
neutral	great before the tourists started to pour in at about 0am !
neutral	and of course after they had left for the day .
neutral	very enjoyable and we would have no_hesitation in staying again or recommending to others .
neutral	cheers for now ................. jmh
neutral	quick transaction and simple instructions !
neutral	ok but quality of printing not what i expected
neutral	was quoted £_00 but ended paying £_00 . 00 as there was a £ 0 gateick access fee and a £ 0 . 00 booking_fee added on .
neutral	didn_'_t see this clearly mentioned on the front page
neutral	first order came to me very quickly in approx one day from when i ordered but second order which i placed an_hour later is still yet to arrive and we will soon be a week .
neutral	i have also not been sent a email or a text regarding this order
neutral	the order reference_number :_000000
neutral	ordered a copy of family tree maker 0000 , but web_site appeared to show picture of 0000 box .
neutral	phoned to confirm the actual version they were offering but they were either unwilling or unable to check for me - had a look on his system and told me he could only see much earlier versions available .
neutral	however they assured me that i would receive the 0000 item as_described if that was what they were offering on their site , and if it was not so i could return it for a refund .
neutral	placed the order on thursday and received the 0000 version on saturday .
neutral	their price was far cheaper_than anywhere_else on the web .
neutral	great delivery and price - pity about the call_centre .
neutral	the steering sensor should have been pinned in position so i am told , i am not so sure but i will get around the problem and retain the item .
neutral	clear website , good choice of bouquets , effortless transaction , swift delivery .
neutral	if they send me a reminder next december , in anticipation of my wife '_s birthday , i shall use them again .
neutral	- so i wrote a short while after the arrival of the flowers , but within a couple of days , the roses were withering and the display had to be thrown out before the end of the week , which was a disappointment .
neutral	if this problem could be addressed , all would be well .
neutral	when ordering my new playstation pad i was advised that 00_% of orders are delivered the next_day , if ordered before 0pm ( which mine was ).
neutral	i didnt even receive my dispatched confirmation_email until late on the next_day , so find the stat if 00_% very hard to believe , i will now not be home when it gets delivered so do not know when i will receive parcel .
neutral	other than that shopto is great
neutral	the product is ok , but it is not made clear how muck work is needed to put frame together .
neutral	oak_doors had no grasp on the delivery , it was sent to the invoice_address and not the delivery address .
neutral	also oak door did not seem able to track delivery progress accurately
neutral	we were told to pick_up the car from terminal 0 .
neutral	we took a shuttle_bus from the airport hotel to terminal 0 , via terminal 0 .
neutral	when we arrived at terminal 0 , we eventually found the avis_desk , which advised us to report to terminal 0 !
neutral	we then waited around for the shuttle_bus to take us back to terminal 0 .
neutral	when we finally arrived at the avis_desk there was a very short queue , but it still seemed to take an age to get to the front of it .
neutral	we were advised that our car of choice was not available .
neutral	this was a little frustrating having spent quite a bit of time choosing a vehicle .
neutral	we had paid for a bmw and were offered a citroen , which we were sure was about half the value of what we had paid for .
neutral	we declined this and we offered a mercedes which seemed reasonable .
neutral	the car had been ' cleaned ' but to a poor standard , particularly inside .
neutral	we had been told that the fuel_tank was full , and that we were to return it full also .
neutral	however , the tank was not quite full - perhaps 00_euros below full .
neutral	by now we were keen to get going and were not going to argue about that .
neutral	we were pleased that the car had a fitted sat_nav , but it was set - up in italian ( we were picking the car up in france ) and after quite some time we were able to navigate the italian menus and convert it to english .
neutral	so , overall the experience was ok but a bit rough around the edges .
neutral	i ordered a bark lowe_alpine airzone 00 pack , but instead received a black one , even_though on the order summary it clearly_stated bark .
neutral	however , i needed to use the pack the next_day , so couldn_'_t return it .
neutral	it was , however , delivered within the stated time frame , with a free_gift .
neutral	unfortunately i have nt received my order .
neutral	parcel_force in there wisdom took it back to their depot and i understand sent it back to you . i still_await
neutral	guess watch , was available in stock which wasn_'_t available widely .
neutral	selected the free option to get it resized but it was not done .
neutral	had to go to a local guess dealer to get it resized .
neutral	we paid rentalcars . com for a ford_focus or similar size car from budget cars in toronto .
neutral	the car supplied was more ford_fiesta size and was unsuitable ( too small ) for our passengers and luggage .
neutral	the only alternative was a much larger suv which was twice the rental price and a ' gas guzzler '.
neutral	whilst we were pleased the alternative was available and we were able to make use of it for our holiday i am not sure if this was a ploy to to get us to rent a larger vehicle or just a difference in interpretation of car size .
neutral	my car is a ford_focus which i drove to the airport in england with passengers and luggage comfortably .
neutral	when renting a car in another country make_sure it is the right size for your needs .
neutral	reserved a guitar on - line and went to the london shop only the only day i could - a saturday to pick it up as i don_'_t trust any courier with a £_000 guitar .
neutral	the staff were friendly and helpful but the experience was ruined by the other " customers ".
neutral	the shop was rammed and although the staff were trying hard they were clearly stretched .
neutral	i had already decided to purchase the guitar and the only thing that would have put me off was damage or poor playability - neither of which this guitar had .
neutral	the problem was the hoards of teenage boys filling the practice rooms and shop floor all playing really loud and really badly .
neutral	guitars they obviously had no_intention of buying .
neutral	this meant there were no practice rooms available .
neutral	the member of staff set me up with a small stool right at the front of the shop plugged_into an amp display stand .
neutral	it quickly became_clear there was so much noise i could not hear well enough to tune it .
neutral	i asked for headphones but was told there weren_'_t any .
neutral	as the guitar was mint and the action a dream , i gave up , paid and left .
neutral	this firm sells replacement t00 fluorescent_tubes that are no_longer currently manufactured .
neutral	the tube i required was 0ft long and the firm had packed it very well with plenty of bubble_wrap enclosing a stout cardboard_tube around the light .
neutral	the whole package was clearly and prominently labelled ' very fragile '
neutral	unfortunately fedex , the distribution firm , managed on two_separate_occasions to break the tube during_transit .
neutral	e_- mail communication with the firm was excellent and supportive , but very reluctantly i had to ask for a refund .
neutral	it seems that the firm cannot claim for ' damage in transit ' from fedex , and this is unfortunate .
neutral	it looks as though i '_m going to face the hassle of replacing the whole fixture rather_than simply replacing the tube .
neutral	a real pity .
neutral	while the product itself was fine , the custom software is a little cumbersome but usable , i was let_down by how poor your b0b service is .
neutral	i had no one specific contact to deal with , i had no help with reviewing product options , i was not afforded a proof copy before putting in a bulk order of 000 and found the process broken and disjointed .
neutral	i would not recommend you to other_businesses based on my experience .
neutral	i first purchased a pair of low diesel trainers , however the leather upper started to split away from the sole after a few uses over the summer .
neutral	i informed rubbersole customer service and they were very helpful and agreed that it was a manufacturing_fault .
neutral	the shoes were promptly returned to yourselves and i was issued with a credit_note .
neutral	i then went of to purchase 0 similar pairs of diesel trainers , this time made of canvas .
neutral	however , after waiting more than a week after the yodel web - site claimed to have despatched this consignment , i still have not received the item .
neutral	after having worked from city - link for a number or years , i understand how important it is for your delivery company to deliver the consignment on - time and if it is not on - time , there must be some way for the customer to receive information about what has happened to the consignment .
neutral	however , with yodel , they have completely failed on this occasion .
neutral	they cannot be contacted by telephone and their tracking site it completly useless .
neutral	when it comes to using a 0rd part delivery company , that delivery company is representing rubblesole and is typically the only physical contact the customer has with rubbersole .
neutral	so all i can say is , dump yodel because they are letting your company down .
neutral	ordered a £_000 vacuum_cleaner
neutral	everything fine with product .
neutral	my only_gripe : painfully_slow delivery time
neutral	took 0 days to arrive after dispatch_notification was received .
neutral	despite spending £_000 + and getting ' free ' delivery i '_m not prepared to accept
neutral	a 0 day wait for my goods .
neutral	i expect 00 or 00_hours tops .
neutral	excellent service overall , especially being_able to tell me what bouquets are available for immediate_dispatch .
neutral	unfortunately the bouquet delivered was quite different from that ordered based on the picture on the website .
neutral	microsoft are the leaders when it comes to software in my opinion but they rarely listen to their customers on what they would like to see or need in a program upgrade .
neutral	they are a very american company in the way they run and this does not always fit well with how businesses should be in the united_kingdom .
neutral	they like to have their own piece of everything and if someone does something better then they just try and kill off competition with buying companies out or buying exclusive content / hardware for themselves .
neutral	customer_support is not very good at all either , usually stuck on the phone with an indian_call_centre for hours when it should have been done it 00 to 00_minutes .
neutral	seeing amazon grow over the years has_been great to see the expansion in available items and its great to go to one place for many different_types of goods .
neutral	the problem with amazon is that when you have faulty goods or problems they arent always very helpful .
neutral	i had a hardware fault which was an inherent manufacturer defect but amazon said i had no rights to claim a repair or replacement from them ( they say the sale of goods_act is a load of rubbish ) i had to go through the courts in the end to get them to deal with my faulty goods .
neutral	also bad if you have to return damaged goods , its at your own_expense and in most_cases they dont even pay back the cost of your postage_charges of recorded delivery so the item is traceable in the mail .
neutral	not a good way for a company to work .
neutral	sent me the wrong_size and then didnt have the right one in stock .
neutral	throughout , they were very professional given the very busy time
neutral	free bumper bulb collection received in good order and planted .
neutral	however still_waiting for the balance of the order i . e .
neutral	primrose strawberry ice plants .
neutral	i am pleased with the article i bought , but a little disappointed with the price .
neutral	it was advertised postage free .
neutral	i believe there is no such thing as somebody has to pay , presumably the vendor .
neutral	as i live locally to the source of my last purchase , i went in person to pick_up the article , thinking the vendor would make some reduction because he was not having to finance the delivery .
neutral	no such luck .
neutral	hence my disapointment with the system .
neutral	upload did not work - bad
neutral	called metro and told to bring in files on disc - good
neutral	took files in , disc not accepted - bad
neutral	uploaded files with profiles -, website worked - good
neutral	call from metro regarding profiles , apparently these prints would not be printed using this profile , which is not what it said on the site and it was admitted that i would not have known this - bad
neutral	rendered files to specified profile and delivered on disc , because if i use the website i have to pay again - good and bad
neutral	overall not a particularly easy interface nor a happy soul on the front_desk - i do not care if " fifty others have managed to upload " the site did not work and you knew it had crashed - that is neither my fault nor my responsibility .
neutral	i had asked if i could see the prints before they go back to the aop for judging , lets_see what happens .
neutral	and now my session has ended so i have to post a review again - really crap
neutral	i only ordered a set of fender string trees .
neutral	one of them was so badly finished it was beyond use .
neutral	fortunately the other was ok and i have been able to get away with only using one .
neutral	really poor fender product .
neutral	good service in terms of quick delivery .
neutral	the pet corrector sprays we ordered were fine .
neutral	sadly we had to go to the royal_mail delivery office to collect them , even_though we had given instructions to leave outside if no reply .
neutral	this had been printed on the paperwork inside the package but not on the envelope .
neutral	the order was delivered firaly quickly via first_class post , but why was the delivery charge so high for standard postal delivery ?
neutral	more product information would have be useful eg on size of mortice bolt required .
neutral	the ordering_process was simple and my matched memory arrived very quickly .
neutral	all at a great price
neutral	the only down - side it the amount of follow - up sales emails that arrive afterwards ...
neutral	the flowers were great but my mum was disappointed that they didn_'_t last the week .
neutral	bought everything i needed from this shop .
neutral	the only problem i could fault is the cables . they are cheap rubbish that is no good what so ever .
neutral	and the lights i got as soon as i touched them the button broke .
neutral	the cables and lights were cheap toys !
neutral	it does not reflect on the block party pa i bought , that was excellent .
neutral	be careful and look at what is described ...
neutral	this is a great site and easy to use but the amount of time from purchasing goods to receiving the cash_back into your account is much too slow to be of any real value .
neutral	zeppelin really excellent lives upto the hype excellent service and prompt accurate delivery .... first_rate however spoilt by the fact that the the web_site boasts a free_gift for every order over £_000 which i was never offered and when enquired online was ignored which has marred me ordering again dont offer when you have no_intention of supplying !!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	trophy itself is good value .
neutral	engraving looked cheap and only get a few words free .
neutral	delivery slow and delivered to the wrong_address which meant two_days hanging_around all day for delivery .
neutral	too expensive for such a small item .
neutral	very unhappy that my booking was only confirmed about a few hours before my pick - up time .
neutral	otherwise the whole rental experience was genrally pleasant and professional .
neutral	why does 0 phones get sent and only 0 get there but 0 in each bag and it has to be the iphone not very happy at all , why the 0 phone get there which add up to £_00 but the 0 which was a iphone £_00 get loss !!!!?!!
neutral	fun that when it the most money phone than we you try and talk them there say it the post !
neutral	well if the bag get wiped and still one phone get there that a joke !
neutral	yes well they turned_up really late , around 00 : 00 , dumped outside in the rain , our neighbour brought them in from the rain , if he didnt pick them up , we wouldnt of known they had turned_up , we was in all day ,, not the greatest service to be honest
neutral	economy service is too slow can take up to 00 days
neutral	the time to go from northern_ireland to uk hub is too big a delay , i like the collect_+ concept of dropping in a store , but it is useless due to the delivery time , cannot use it for my everyday parcels i sell online other wise i could send a lot more , i still have to use royal_mail for consistency
neutral	this retro lamp looks great but it '_s not a chrome lamp - it is encased in plastic .
neutral	may i suggest that your description says ' chrome - effect plastic ' or some such ?
neutral	the surgery was at manchester which was brilliant .
neutral	great staff and made me feel at ease .
neutral	after care at liverpool is a joke .
neutral	still_haven_'_t had my 0 months appointment as walked out after waiting 0 hours to be seen .
neutral	once you have my money you obviously don_'_t seem to be as arsed ( when i say you i mean the liverpool office ).
neutral	i '_m afraid i '_ve never received the advertised cash_back rate .
neutral	you should be able to see what you will actually get before_committing as voucher_codes will often provide a far better return .
neutral	i would rather not have the product displayed so prominently on the front of the packaging .
neutral	" 0 x rentokil bed_bug killer ......"
neutral	do i really want all and sundry to know that i may have brought bed_bugs back from holiday ...?
neutral	really that is not good policy nor is it good customer_relations .
neutral	soreee - need to change your labels .
neutral	all went like_clockwork when ordering , followed_by an immediate
neutral	acknowledgement .
neutral	then silence , only interrupted by my making
neutral	contact .
neutral	then all quiet on the western front again .
neutral	if there was going to be a delay i should have been informed whatever the reason .
neutral	then my order arrived .
neutral	happiness restored .
neutral	better
neutral	communication and it wwould never been lost .
neutral	the service from physioroom was excellent .
neutral	however the tape had a poor " sticking " quality .
neutral	i have struggled to use this tape correctly as i had to keep reapplying unfortunately .
neutral	looks nice though !
neutral	the service is rapid for euro - gbp between france and britain but :
neutral	the transaction fee of £ 0 , whatever the amount seems exorbitant particularly when i observe on the following_day that i never seem to have obtained as favorable an exchange_rate as the one reported ( and well below the rate for free transfers quoted by my bank lloyds_tsb
neutral	it took a very long time to get our rental car from ezirent / nationawide cars at queenstown airport in new_zealand - over 00_minutes .
neutral	there was only one staff_member at the desk and 0 customers before us and the process seemed very slow given that most of the information had been submitted on line before our arrival .
neutral	however the lady was very pleasant and the car was in reasonable condition for the cost .
neutral	we had booked a gps_unit which after we had paid for the lady told us we wouldn_'_t need as queenstown was very easy to negotiate . the most irritating fact was the $_00 " desk fee " that has to be paid .
neutral	this was not mentioned anywhere and i had thought the price that your web_site quoted would be the price .
neutral	the $_00 itself was not a lot of money however it does seem that these agencies can just add fees as they seem fit - maybe i chose this company for it '_s cheap rates to then find i have already spent almost another $_000 for gps and airport fee that is never mentioned .
neutral	the staff told us that rental_cars . com have been notified about this fee but despite_repeated_attempts from the car_rental company have not put it on their website quoting system as yet - a source of frustration to many renters .
neutral	quite good but some metchants do not confirm cashback and is still pending even after cashback date has long passed
neutral	easy to book , collection made on the early side at my local_store c 00am .
neutral	website easy to navigate .
neutral	i will only use when they have a price promotion on and for boxes of say 00kg they are well overpriced .
neutral	i was happy to use them a lot until massive price increase in 0000
neutral	experience was spoiled by the fact that when putting prepaid ticket in machine to leave car_park , it demanded another £_00 . 00 !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	was eventually allowed to leave after complaining .
neutral	not good enough !
neutral	!
neutral	do not know where the fault lies , but , suggest look0parking , and the car parking people communicate with each other more closely
neutral	good - priced quotes but unfortunately they don_'_t include info about when the contractor can do the job .
neutral	you have to pay the deposit as i did then i found out he couldn_'_t collect for 0 days , . used parcels0go instead
neutral	. probably good if you '_ve got no time pressure
neutral	i was emailed to say goods had been dispatched .
neutral	checked tracking site the following_day , which showed goods had reached the a depot .
neutral	checked next_day and it said order was closed .
neutral	rang animed .
neutral	they would chase it and ring me back by 0am the next_day without_fail .
neutral	no call , so rang them again .
neutral	kept in a q for 00_minutes and then was cut_off .
neutral	tried again and got nowhere .
neutral	after 0pm i rang the courier .
neutral	said he would chase and ring back .
neutral	rang back and said he could not contact the local_depot .
neutral	said he woul keep trying .
neutral	rang back some time later to say goods had been located and would be with me in 00_mins .
neutral	i rang him back after an_hour to report that nothing had arrived .
neutral	he rang me about 00_mins later to apologise and said the driver was definitely on his way .
neutral	finally received delivery around 0 . 00 pm .
neutral	my first and last order with animed .
neutral	have not experienced any
neutral	problems with my previous_supplier .
neutral	great for all_round experience
neutral	dont like the way they just act as middle_men and collect a fee but hey thats buisness .
neutral	should not tell you / advise not to talk to anyone_else as it arises suspition as to why not
neutral	ordered ear cones .
neutral	they were competetively_priced compared with other_sites and were delivered in a timely_manner .
neutral	the flowers looked better in the photo
neutral	after a00hr trans - atlantic journey , the last thing you need is another 0hr wait at the alamo_desk to process paperwork .
neutral	there was a lack of urgency by the desk staff ' processing the paperwork , the main_priority was obviously to sell upgrades , not to reduce the ever_increasing queue .
neutral	vehicle provided t &_c van ( no intermediate suv '_s available although confirmed at time of booking ) had to be replaced on day0 for a mechanical problem .
neutral	.
neutral	they should empower their people instead of making them hide - bound by their silly rules , especially pretending to be prevented from helping because of the data_protection act .
neutral	i actually went to see their board to discuss this ; waste of time .
neutral	but still good value especially their tv service ( no_longer actively sold ).
neutral	i want to buy youview through them but they ' re too slow and never ready .
neutral	i was already perfectly happy with nespresso and their pods , but they simply don_'_t offer enough variety for me .
neutral	so i was glad to find bclc , who seemed to be well thought of in reviews and came_across professionally from their website .
neutral	having tried my first few pods now i '_ve got mixed views on them as a long_term viable_alternative to genuine nespresso .
neutral	obviously the price is good and on top of that my initial opinion is that the blends are high_quality .
neutral	strangely it seems like the water comes out hotter with these pods than nespresso '_s own , which is a good thing , but i guess i could be imagining that .
neutral	the down sides are quite considerable and have been mentioned by others , namely the packaging needs a lot of improvement ( i '_m_sure that will come , given they ' re a new brand ) but more worryingly my nespresso_machine '_s pump seems to need to work a lot harder to get the job_done .
neutral	the lungo pull takes a good while longer_than with regular nespresso_pods , with the coffee coming out at a much slower trickle , and so_far 00_% of the pods i '_ve_used haven_'_t ejected properly , leaving the nespresso_machine flashing its lights in protest !
neutral	a quick couple of taps on the lungo button resolved the issue , but there certainly isn_'_t full compatibility there yet and i have no idea if this is causing any damage to the machine .
neutral	so , overall i '_ve been reasonably satisfied with my initial batch '_s flavour , but i '_ll need to live with them a while longer before_deciding to buy again .
neutral	and by that time nespresso might have launched their new vertuoline machine in the uk , with the redesigned pods , which will be an interesting development for both companies !
neutral	i would expect the website to be much slicker than it is .
neutral	yes , you get there with your design in the end but for a company that specialises in printed products , i ' d expect the website and build process to be flawless - it '_s more like a beta site that '_s still in development .
neutral	a printed mug was £ 0 - the mugs cost 00p , the printing not much more so i think £ 0 is unreasonable bearing in mind the clunky website .
neutral	the thing is with virgin , if it is working it is great but prepare yourselves for when it isn_'_t .
neutral	customer_services , based abroad , are absolutely_shocking .
neutral	nothing to do with them actually being foreign but the fact is the phone lines are shocking , they just do not understand you , and have the most basic crib sheets in front of them to try and diagnose problems .
neutral	on the rare occassions when they deem it necessairy to put you through to a uk level 0 operative you feel like kissing the phone you are that grateful .
neutral	the package on the whole is great but i do feel deeply angry that i signed_up to the 00mb cable internet just before they decided to choke the life out of it when you use it for anything other than surfing ( what , you ordered 00mb internet and want to actually download something ?!!
neutral	- outrageous !)
neutral	i won_'_t move as they are the best there is , but once there is an_alternative i will be gone .
neutral	we ordered two lots of shelving and it was quite straightforward to put up although some instructions would have helped .
neutral	one parcel was wrapped in cling_film - like it had been damaged by the carrier and that was missing some brackets .
neutral	i called big_dug and they sent them out by royal_mail so i got them the next_day .
neutral	i found software very easy to use and the quality of the final product is great .
neutral	my only complaint is that i ordered the book as a surprise gift and the name of the product is all over the packaging .
neutral	i didn_'_t notice if there was an option to have discrete_packaging so if so i should have used that but it wasn_'_t obvious .
neutral	anyway , other than that the book is excellent
neutral	expecting a skoda_octavia with enough boot roo for the family luggage but received a curious model known as lancia delta which i would not put in the medium category .
neutral	the search_criteria are good - gender , face_shape , brand etc_., with some useful extras such as what '_s hot and what '_s new .
neutral	but you get to the results page and it is slow to load ; then you go to a psecific pair to look at the detail and that '_s ok ( a bit_slow too ), but if you don_'_t like that and want to return to the results page it reloads your search !!
neutral	this takes_ages on a normal pc with the average download_speed and it takes a great deal of patience .
neutral	got a groupon deal , but could have got a bettter deal by internet_search .
neutral	otherwise good service and prompt delivery .
neutral	said handle was in stock on the website .
neutral	rang up after 0th day of no delivery and got told that in fact the item was out of stock and would be sent next week when it arrived with them .
neutral	it wasn_'_t the cheapest anyway .
neutral	i only bought it from them because they sold handles individually so i could get a sample .
neutral	my first pair ordered some 0 - 0 years_ago have been excellent vallue and reliable .
neutral	however , i had my eyes_tested about 0 months_ago an re - ordered from glasses_direct .
neutral	the glasses i received were terrible , the lens popped out after a week , they never fitted in the frame properly and the screw fell out a week_later .
neutral	i have since ordered a replacement set and they are very good - no faults at all .
neutral	delivery of 0 - 0_weeks was a bit_slow though .
neutral	overall , i would use them again .
neutral	i must_admit to have been worried_about not hearing_anything about the dispatch of my order and it took them 00_hours to respond ( which they do state as being their target ).
neutral	received the product 0 working_days after ordering .
neutral	they advised me the product had been despatched - on the day i received it .
neutral	my worries disappeared when i did receive goods and they did follow_up with communication to ensure everything was okay .
neutral	*** the only thing that worries me is the possibility of the goods being refurbished as they come in a white box with no manufacturer warranty ... only their own 00 months warranty .
neutral	so , be careful on this one .
neutral	product appears to be working but unsure as to quality being perfectly new as_opposed to remanufactured or something else .
neutral	however , the prices are very good and you get what you pay for .
neutral	received balls very quickly , communication excellent .
neutral	balls received where ok !
neutral	toooooo much writing on them spoiled the sale .
neutral	good choice of business phones , though tends to be pricey .
neutral	initial marketing suggested that i would be contacted if service was an over - provision : no such contact occurred .
neutral	when my phone needed repair , it was astonishingly expensive , and my queries about why were ignored .
neutral	i won_'_t be going back to o0 at the end of my contract .
neutral	i followed a youtube interview to install the 0g ram in my acer_aspire one .
neutral	it told me to disconnect the keyboard to access the memory .
neutral	installing the memory itself was easy , but after reassembly i lost use of the keyboard due to the extremely fragile connection being somehow damaged .
neutral	in retrospect it was not even to be necessary to disconnect the keyboard ( thankyou , whoever posted that video ).
neutral	however , using a usb keyboard ( or a mouse with a virtual keyboard ) i can use the computer and its performance is very greatly_improved compared to before .
neutral	ordered a bouquet to be delivered to my son and daughter - in - law , in new_zealand , for their wedding_anniversary .
neutral	received an e_mail_confirming delivery , bearing in mind 00_hours ahead .
neutral	as i had heard_nothing from them and their day had passed i sent a text to check if they were ok and was informed no delivery !
neutral	advised iflorist by e_mail .
neutral	my son has since advised they turned_up next_day , description and quality good .
neutral	no response from iflorist as yet .
neutral	my first order with your company failed even_though you accepted my payment you then found out the item was not in stock .
neutral	you made a full_refund which was speedily done so no_problems there but you order form should state if the item is out of stock at the time of purchase .
neutral	incomplete_address results in delayed delivery
neutral	they looked ok when they arrived , except most flowers were closed & 0 days_later they still closed and dead .
neutral	the roses_died yesterday on 0 .
neutral	although they looked ok they didn_'_t look like the picture i ordered from .
neutral	i would use them again but not if i really wanted to impress :-(
neutral	i would not normally comment on an issue that was resolved with myself and a retailer of anything - but , as the world seems to be " wired in " to pass comment on every tiny aspect of their existence nowadays = this " like " or " dislike " kack people seem to live by ( highly sad in my book ) : - my opinion =
neutral	i bet drum_stop are a great company - their " e " communication is first_class , but - the item i ordered ( and was verified by a staff_member description / specification wise ) was not what i ordered .
neutral	they did offer a replacement straight_away , but i did not want to pay the return postage on top of the original cost of the set of sticks .
neutral	not really worth the hassle to be honest .
neutral	it wasn_'_t difficult to get the order right in the first place really .
neutral	but again , the staff did offer a replacement - a bit late though .
neutral	the whole_process was easy .
neutral	order , receive the seal , fit seal , result dry floor .
neutral	i used to love facebook , but someone somewhere is getting paid too much money to screw the site right up .
neutral	searching for old friends now is just impossible without knowing their shoe and waist_size it seems , what happened to the old function of just putting in the name and their town ?
neutral	i tend to use it less now as i find it a bit frustrating , but when i do go online and chat with my friends its great .
neutral	come on facebook , if a record is ' nt broke why change it
neutral	i do like ba . com but sometimes find it frustrating at the long windedness of some of the procedures you have to go through to make a booking or simple search .
neutral	would be great to get up a load of prices and flight they are available from after a few simple steps so you can make a choice .
neutral	having said that its a darn sight easier than a lot of booking systems i '_ve seen
neutral	i received the item in question ( slightly later than hoped ) but the delivery team were simply excellent and would not accept a tip ( suggested i donate to charity which i did ).
neutral	beware woolworths stringent and onerous privacy rules regarding marketing which require a written letter sent in the post using very specific wording to unsubscribe separately from telemarketing , direct mail and emails even if you didn_'_t agree to marketing in the first place !
neutral	good product information and navigation .
neutral	but i had forgotten my password and the password reminder did not work - needs fixing .
neutral	i have been trying to source a ford_mondeo , and i was offered the details of four main_dealers with , give - or - take , the car i was seeking , but none of the four has actually been able to say if they actually have that car - or even if or when they will be able to obtain it .
neutral	users of the site need to be aware that ford dealers are all fishing in the same pool and may offer a vehicle which they simply hope to be able to obtain for you at some point in the future .
neutral	it seems to me that this is a potential weakness in an otherwise promising model .
neutral	e_- mailed them early yesterday to confirm track and send numbers for flowers i '_ve ordered and still had nothing .
neutral	none of the flowers have been delivered up to yet so yeah getting really worried .
neutral	the flowers and teddy arrived at a good time , my girlfriend called around 00 :_00pm to say she had collected them from the delivery man .
neutral	it wasn_'_t until 0 :_00pm that i got a text_telling_me the flowers had been delivered and left securely at the front of the property .
neutral	seems they got my flowers mixed with somebody elses ?
neutral	also , the added extra teddy_bear i ordered turned_out to be the cheaper alternative , so i essentially paid £ 0 too much for what i got .
neutral	bit_disappointing .
neutral	i have used this company on several occasionsand the service has always been excellent .
neutral	i have no_hesitation in reccommending them to anyone .
neutral	alpha_brain didn_'_t work on me at first but after taking it daily for a few_days i noticed a slight boost in concentration for 0 - 0 hours .
neutral	unfortunately with the amount needed per day the cost is too high .
neutral	if i could feel the effects without taking it daily i would save them for when i only really needed them but unfortunately that is not the case for me .
neutral	easy to order - but poor courier service !
neutral	having read all these great reviews i was expecting to be impressed .
neutral	however i wasn_'_t .
neutral	even_though the item i ordered was show to be in stock and available for immediate_despatch i was sent an email the day after ordering telling_me that it wasn_'_t in stock and i had to wait several days .
neutral	the item was a memory_foam cushion for my chair at work .
neutral	when it did come i was surprised to find that the item that i had paid £_00 for ( supposedly a saving of £_00 off rrp ) was actually available from the manufacturer for £_00 .
neutral	not quite the saving that was advertised !
neutral	in fact i paid almost £_00 over the odds !
neutral	also it came wrapped in what looked like a black bin bag - no branded packaging / box etc .
neutral	so who_knows if the item was new or not - it certainly didn_'_t look as you would expect it .
neutral	excellent service but still very expensive for 0 day stay .
neutral	you ' re a captive_audience so they can charge what they like .
neutral	dick turpin at_least wore a mask .
neutral	we use aldi quite a lot for generally a good standard of products at a fair price , but get annoyed when basic products just disappear for a few weeks ( or longer ), sometimes being replaced by an inferior recipe .
neutral	one at present concerns fruit teas .
neutral	the diplomat berry fruits tea rightfully won some awards and has_been my brew of choice for several_years .
neutral	recently after a brief absence this reappeared in a new , slightly_larger box , and the new product tastes frankly awful .
neutral	a sweet , chemically nothing , with no " berry " flavour .
neutral	a quick comparison of ingredients shows a considerable reduction in the good stuff , which probably explains the lack of flavour .
neutral	i will return the rest of the box , and look_elsewhere for a replacement
neutral	too expensive , ripped me off on postage_costs , item didn_'_t arrive on time and no offer to compensate for that .
neutral	ordered a few_times .
neutral	these_guys are okay but sometimes there is a stock problem that they don_'_t let you know about until after you '_ve ordered .
neutral	not an issue , but would be nice to know at time of ordering .
neutral	having 0 teenagers makes this store a must ... the prices are just right .
neutral	delivery can be a little lack lustre even on expediated delivery .
neutral	stock is always low or non available ... this needs_addressing as it is happening often .
neutral	interest_rates too high ... 00 +%
neutral	hotpoint , beko , hoover and indesit_washing_machines are fault prone !
neutral	the ability to return products without_question is fantastic .
neutral	a convenient and easy way to pay ... but if it faults you can in my experience pay for something 0 times over and then you have to wait up to 00 days for a refund
neutral	booked my usual ups delivery service through interparcel yesterday before cut - off time .
neutral	booking accepted - waited in all day - no collection .
neutral	phoned interparcel first thing this morning and after apologising they assured me that my parcel would be collected today .
neutral	by 0 : 00 p . m . ( after yet another phone_call to interparcel ) there was still no collection so i phoned ups myself ( something that interparcel don_'_t seem to be able to do ) and ups said that no collection had been scheduled for either day .
neutral	i got back to interparcel who ( again ) assured me that the item was scheduled for collection today .
neutral	it '_s now 0 : 00 p . m . ( collection cut - off time ) and i '_m still_waiting .
neutral	this is the first time in many collections that i '_ve had problems so you might think that '_s a good track_record and that this is a one - off , but for my first - time customer who needs their parcel this is a 000_% failure_rate on my part .
neutral	how timely that i '_ve been invited to give a review .
neutral	sorry interparcel but i '_m going to have to widen my options from now on .
neutral	good service , but a small bunch for the price that was paid
neutral	service all good - excpet for hassles regarding de , livery
neutral	ordered an azalea pot and a boquet was sent instead with no communications .
neutral	upon complaining i was sent a voucher to redeem off my next purchase but this had been used by me on the original order therefore is invalid .
neutral	no reply to the question regarding this .
neutral	overall a poor service from iflorist .
neutral	flowers delivered were a good quality and i would have been delighted had they been what were originally ordered .
neutral	for our first time using loco0 we were booking a complex journey through three countries with five changes of trains .
neutral	we had some difficulty in making the bookings , but to be honest , most of the issues were due to our unfamiliarity with the system , and we were helped to get it right in the end .
neutral	what impressed us was that there are not many sites that have the coverage to make this kind of booking .
neutral	up till now we would use db '_s site to work out the best route and train times , then book tickets from several different sites .
neutral	and the tickets that were posted arrived within two_days .
neutral	thank_you !
neutral	our first confusion was that loco0 allows more time for changes than db , so our chosen connection with eurostar wasn_'_t offered .
neutral	probably a good thing !
neutral	then having reached our first stopover we tried to ' add another journey ' but this just didn_'_t seem to work until we opened another window and entered it as a new journey .
neutral	but the two were successfully combined in our ' shopping_basket '.
neutral	lastly , we think it '_s a bit unfair to wait_until checkout to tell us that there is a charge for using a credit_card - maybe that could be made clear earlier on .
neutral	overall , though , we think we got good service and would use loco0 again .
neutral	i applied to recycle my phone twice but i didn_'_t get a jiffy_bag in the post ( as mentioned on the website ) either time .
neutral	in the end i sent it in my own jiffy_bag .
neutral	the price offered between applications dropped by £ 0 .
neutral	having said that , when they did get my phone , they did pay 000_% of the price offered and very quickly .
neutral	i went to this site as i have used them before and the service was fantastic .
neutral	0_stars is perhaps a little unfair as i never said anything at the time .
neutral	on this occasion they didnt have the pressure_washer that i originally ordered as it was discontinued so i had to order a more_expensive product .
neutral	i was contacted very quickly and my new order was placed without problem but i felt that a token_gesture might have been offered as it had been their mistake in the first place and i was having to pay more to receive a similar product .
neutral	the order itself was delivered very quickly and was well_packaged .
neutral	this is a helpful website and offers good information and good prices .
neutral	i have used the service before and so feel_confident that i will get good value , however the website twice said " an unexpected error has occurred " and i had to start the transaction again .
neutral	if this was my first experience i may have tried another supplyer .
neutral	the purchase of the two tyres was very easy , the problem came due to being located on the isle of wight , the delivery time being two to three_days .
neutral	the customer_support line were very helpful and arranged for the order to be cancelled and a refund to our account .
neutral	i had to purchase stock tyres from ats in the end , the price paid was only very slightly more_expensive than i was paying on line .
neutral	ordered 0 tyres over the phone and later that day wanted to check the brand and found national_tyres web_site were giving free punture repairs and accident damage on these tyres .
neutral	when i went into the branch i was unable to get the free warranty as branch charges £_00 so had to go into my car and order the tyres online then back into the depot to have them fitted .
neutral	what a stupid way to do_business .
neutral	so i needed some new ram , google found memory . co . uk / com .
neutral	i bought some ram , done .
neutral	please stop sending me emails .
neutral	thanks
neutral	i was promised delivery by friday , this didn_'_t happen .
neutral	shame because the product was good quality
neutral	easy way to get_rid of old or none working phones
neutral	but you can shop around for better deals
neutral	i have bought from national_tyres several_times in the past .
neutral	the staff i have met have been good and helpful and i value the insurance part of the deal .
neutral	i deplore , however the presentation on line causing me to try for discounts which did not apply to my purchase or were part of the quote .
neutral	i was going to order 0 sets of shelves however the delivery costs made this prohibitive , despite the delivery going to the same address .
neutral	i expect you are losing business as a result of this .
neutral	your service , products , website and sales system are excellent but you are badly_let_down by royal_mail '_s new rule under which they will leave a parcel with anyone who will accept it and leave no note for the intended_recipient .
neutral	my goods actually reached me three_days after they had been left with a neighbour - by which time i was unfairly beginning to have doubts_about your efficiency .
neutral	i think that companies like yours should consider a boycott of royal_mail unless they discontinue this practice .
neutral	sent one parcel using city_link which was picked_up as planned but the second parcel was a joke , yodel planned to pick it up as agreed and was finally picked_up 0 days_later after emailing interparcel 0 times , maybe not a problem with interparcel but yodel , tracking stated they had been and left a card but no card and somebody was in the 0 times it was meant to be collected
neutral	ferry , staff , transport to amsterdam , holland etc all good .
neutral	but , when arriving back at north_shields you may as well stay in bed till 00 . 00 so when you leave the ship you may have a chance of finding a customs desk that doesn_'_t require queuing for over an_hour .
neutral	why don_'_t they employ 00 ex customs people for 0 hours , pay them 00 pounds / hour , and charge everyone 00 pence to cover it ?
neutral	i ordered these ray_ban glasses from fashion_eyewear , easy to use website service and cheaper_than stores on the high_street .
neutral	but when i received them , they had shipped the incorrect type i had orderded .. :(
neutral	fast postage but very small bags of chocolate for the price , i hope its nice chocolate .
neutral	it '_s good , quick , convenient , etc .
neutral	but expensive - not value for money really
neutral	if i could be_bothered to shop around , i ' d probably get a better deal .
neutral	i think my health issues are pretty minor but they bump up the premium .
neutral	the option in previous years to exclude them from cover has_been removed .
neutral	i renewed with wft because i ran_out of time to shop around .
neutral	this will probably be the last_year i use them .
neutral	the people on the phone are excellent .
neutral	the cover is good and the documentation is clear .
neutral	given that i use the cover for winter sports , there '_s no easy " card " or single sheet of paper that i can carry around when i '_m out .
neutral	other_providers offer this .
neutral	blackleaf are the only uk distributor for the product i was trying to buy .
neutral	it '_s out of stock and they were pretty unhelpful about suggesting alternatives , blaming restocking policies from the italian supplier .
neutral	this may be true , but it '_s pretty unhelpful .
neutral	not enough staff at airport to deal with customers collecting their rental_cars .
neutral	we had to wait a long time , which was difficult for my wife , as she is disabled .
neutral	one thing that really is frustrating ( and we know that all rental car companies do this now ) that you get hit with extra_insurance cost at airport !!!
neutral	should be an option when booking , either accept full comprehensive , including tyres and windscreen , or or only part insurance , excl .
neutral	those .
neutral	so that you know what your cost is before you set off on your holiday .
neutral	everybody complains about this at the airport and i feel this is something that rental_companies should deal with .
neutral	ordered a ted bear , but the packaging was in german .
neutral	panicked until it swore in english .
neutral	email_telling_me the bikes will be delivered friday , i rang to ask where they were , to be told they would be with me monday , sorry we forgot to tell you .
neutral	to be fair they arrived on the monday at the time stated on the delivery email .
neutral	the structure of the cabin is absolutely fine but when i saw the roof coverage method my first reaction was -" i wouldn_'_t do it that way ".
neutral	a plastic membrane !
neutral	but they must be right i suppose .
neutral	in my view they are not !
neutral	it seemed to leak .
neutral	i went up there with silicone to try to prevent it - spent weeks .
neutral	then i realised that the water coming through the ceiling ( and wrecking the timber ) was independent of rain - it was condensation .
neutral	i spent more time tearing the roofing off and getting a builder to put me a proper 0 layer felt roof on .
neutral	considerable extra_expense .
neutral	no help from the company - just a statement that , since i had put it up myself it was beyond their control .
neutral	i don_'_t really think they give a s * i *!
neutral	it '_s a good cabin - now .
neutral	it was " the expletive deleted cabin " for a long while .
neutral	structurally good - probably the best - but put a proper felt roof on it .
neutral	............
neutral	i raised an order for some polishing kits where the price was significantly_reduced on the website .
neutral	i ordered the polishing kits at the price stated and recieved the order without the polishing kits .
neutral	frost did phone me and explained there had been a problem on there side as the price was wrong .
neutral	i agreed with them that i could have another polishing kit at a reduced price .
neutral	unfortuneatly this item is currently out of stock so i still_await delivery of the polishing kit .
neutral	part of the order was supplied and frost rang me to inform_me of the mistake .
neutral	frost
neutral	the online site is perfect .
neutral	the carrier took very time to delivery the order .
neutral	i make a call to they and seems that the address is incomplete .
neutral	i don_'_t know if the problem was a scubastore problem or carrier problem ...
neutral	because the delivery took very time i make a call to scubastore support and no support in portuguese language :(
neutral	stocked the difficult to find items i was after at a good price and the on - line service was quick and efficient .
neutral	however when i called to see if my order had been dispatched as i was hoping to correct an error i had made , i spoke to someone_who seemed very irritated that i had called and started quoting lead times from the confirmation_email before i could even explain_why i was asking .
neutral	i recently_bought a new camera through jessops website .
neutral	knowing nobody would be home to receive the package during the working week i opted for a so - called guaranteed saturday_morning delivery and paid the extra fee .
neutral	the package never showed up on saturday .
neutral	on enquiring with jessops i was told that the package was in the hands of parcelfarce - had i known this at first , that would have been enough to make me take my custom elsewhere .
neutral	as it was , it was several days_later when i finally got my goods , having wasted a whole saturday at home being assured by jessops that the parcel would arrive and having had to ask someone to wait at home the following week rather_than risk the package disappearing into the black whole known as parcelfarce .
neutral	i '_ve still not received a refund for the extra postage they robbed me of .
neutral	would i buy from jessops again - no !
neutral	i ordered my products on a monday_evening , an adida formotion top , adidas formotion trousers and a power balance wrist_band .
neutral	as the order came to over £_000 i thought perfect next_day delivery !
neutral	as it had past 0pm i knew this meant it be the wednesday i received the goods which was fine with me .
neutral	on wednesday_morning at 0000 i received an email_saying my order wouldnt reach me on time , with no explanation as to why .
neutral	i was going away the next_day and really wanted the goods to arrive and was gutted by this .
neutral	by the following_day ( thursday ) the products still hadnt arrived , as i was on the phone to function 00 the goods did thankfully arrive but the gentleman on the phone as helpful and polite as he was claimed that because i live in the north of scotland ( aberdeen ) nect day delivery wasnt always an option .
neutral	in my mind then it shouldnt be offered !
neutral	happy with the products but whats the point of paying for numerous items or others who pay for next_day delivery if it isn_'_t going to happen ?
neutral	!
neutral	as above .
neutral	can '_t really say anymore
neutral	order was completed but packet had been opened that some point .
neutral	i dont_know went .
neutral	have purchased from shower_seal ltd several_times and this was the first time the delivery was late .
neutral	product life could be longer as have to replace the shower_seal at_least twice per year .
neutral	i purchase a double shoulder_support as i have a multi directional of my shoulder .
neutral	the support helps but is not the best fit around the shoulder and does ride up a bit .
neutral	the item was posted quickly .
neutral	i expected this furniture to be delivered with only handles for drawers and cupboards to be fitted .
neutral	the amount of packaging requiring to be removed was excessive and it took me over three hours to have my furniture ready to be put in place .
neutral	if this had been explained to me at the time of purchase i would have organised to get some assistance with this weighty furniture .
neutral	the car itself was fine it is always the extras which cause annoyance i would love to be able to be quoted for an exact cost at the time i make a decision the price for a full_tank of petrol is excessive especially with a diesel car if all you need the car for is fairly local driving around i took half a tank back this time !
neutral	( i van hear you all saying well all fool you but i would like to decide what gas i guzzle ) insurances against the silly things in life such as scratches tyres etc .
neutral	adds even more so when rentalcars quote you bear in mind it will cost more
neutral	but dont use dpd again !
neutral	i placed an order for a ' vinrack wooden wine_rack 00 bottle - dark stain ' and at over £_00 i thought this would be of quite a good quality .
neutral	unfortunately the wine_rack itself did not live up to expectations .
neutral	as i was slotting it together , at_least 0 pieces broke in half , and a few more pieces were already partially damaged on arrival .
neutral	on a plus note , when i spoke to wineware they sent replacements .
neutral	hostelworld is a good website for finding hostels whilst travelling , but charging a service fee as well as taking a 00_% commission on all bookings ... what '_s with that ?
neutral	there are plenty of other_websites available to book hostels online which do not charge this fee .
neutral	veal is not easy to get and we hoped for success .
neutral	the escalopes were rather stringy and slightly tough .
neutral	it was a disappointment .
neutral	hope the rest is better
neutral	when we arrived at 0 . 00 in the morning we had to queue in the pouring_rain for a bus and could not board the first bus , so arrived wet and flustered at the north_terminal .
neutral	however , the bus driver was very helpful and assisted passengers struggling with bags off the bus .
neutral	there was just not enough buses in operation .
neutral	one passenger in the queue phoned airport_parking on his mobile asking for more buses to be put into service and was told this was not possible , which did not help our mood standing in the rain getting wet .
neutral	arrival back from holiday was good and a bus driver was very helpful with advice when i was walking to the reception_area after_discovering i had a flat battery .
neutral	delivery was on time and order complete .
neutral	ordered a bag of adhesive which had clearly been damaged prior to dispatch with a hole in the bottom .
neutral	had been and taped - up but leaked and made a mess .
neutral	don_'_t expect to be sent items with damaged packaging , but otherwise good .
neutral	i use wiggle from time to time and generally they are reliable and do what they say they will do .
neutral	on this occasion though they missed something from my order .
neutral	when i raised this with them it took 0 days to get a response .
neutral	the response was along the lines - we are looking in to this and will get back to you .
neutral	another day later and there appears to be some questioning about the info i '_ve provided .
neutral	eventually its confirmed that the warehouse have made a mistake and my missing order is dispatched ... which then takes 0 days more to arrive .
neutral	would have expected some greater urgency - ( they offer a next_day service but apparently not for orders they have cocked - up themselves ) ) or otherwise some goodwill_gesture in respect of the mistake and delay on their part .
neutral	average customer service on this occasion for what is normally a reliable supplier .
neutral	delivery was prompt but i was a little disappointed with the quality of the roses .
neutral	also , it would have been nice if i was told that the vase i was buying was too big for the bunch i had bought , as it is difficult to tell when viewing online .
neutral	phone cover was ok , some quality issues where wrap wasn_'_t lined_up perfect leaving a white uneven line .
neutral	delivery etc was fine
neutral	the quality of the ink was as good as usual but the delivery was very slow unlike previous_orders
neutral	the birthday hamper left your at 00 . 00 ?
neutral	any reason_why it did not leave early ?
neutral	arrived at destination at 00 . 00
neutral	i recently created 0 calendars on the jessops site and to my delight they arrived very quickly .
neutral	the online ordering system is slick and user_friendly as are the number of options and layout choices it provides .
neutral	unfortunately the quality of the print was very poor , akin to a £_00 inkjet on normal / draft settings .
neutral	the reproduced images have turned_out flat , grey tinged and don_'_t pop at all .
neutral	given that the photos uploaded to the layout system were raw images taken on a high end dslr , colour balanced in adobe lightroom and exported as best quality jpg files the fault is not with the images .
neutral	all in all the site and systems work we '_ll but the actual deliverable leaves a lot to be desired .
neutral	it seems to take_forever to send out what i want , and no explanation is to why ?
neutral	i would either like to get what i ordered or my money back a . s . a . p !!
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered goods .
neutral	a date of delivery was promised .
neutral	i waited in all day .
neutral	nothing arrived .
neutral	i later discovered a message on my phone to tell me that the item was out of stock .
neutral	i am still_waiting .
neutral	i should have purchased from another company that could have supplied .
neutral	staff never seem happy and why is the heating always on full ??
neutral	some items are a bargin others no cheaper_than elsewhere
neutral	ive found the signal to be always good but the tariffs arent the best around
neutral	staff could be a bit more friendly especialy on the tills or is it because its a no_frills kinda place ?
neutral	delivery is quicker_than waiting in the shop for it ... i went one tuesday and they had run out of pizza bases so sent one of the staff to another dominos to borrow some !
neutral	!
neutral	tesco direct not as low priced as i thought it would be
neutral	arrived late although arrived on the day stated good service lovely_flowers
neutral	would have been better if access to car_park had not been under improvement .
neutral	car not delivered on return .
neutral	had to go and find it .
neutral	not what was wanted when laden with suitcase and golf_clubs .
neutral	not the experience of meet and greet i have had before when car was taken and returned .
neutral	for a similar price
neutral	ideal company for quick delivery and cheap prices for screws and fixings , etc .
neutral	however , i find that any tooling tends to be mainly cheaper brands and consequently " poorer " quality .
neutral	i need accuracy so have to shop elsewhere for all my tools / blades / cutters .
neutral	i think it really is a case of you get what you pay for
neutral	yes you can order on line , yes you can select a time & branch to have the tyres_fitted , but it sems no one exisits to make_sure the tyres arrive before you do !
neutral	the branch claimed it was nothing to do with them , the only ' fit what is on the shelf ' and don_'_t think to check that they have what they need .
neutral	interestingly the manager denied that the on line sale was anything to do with national and that it was different company , still , they offer £_00 for loosing a day of work , most generous .
neutral	after_seeing all these posts i am wondering what is going on .
neutral	i also paid for the tracking service and like everyone_else have not had a tracking_link , my girlfriend just text me to say they have still not arrived and she finished work at 0 - 00 .
neutral	if they cannot make a courier paid delivery by 0 - 00 when i ordered last_week for valentines_day then what is the point in buying the flowers ?
neutral	wish they had a phone number to ring , all i can do is hope they arrive by 0 - 00 otherwise she will get them tomorrow which i will be seriously annoyed about .
neutral	will update my rating to 0 if they arrive on valentines_day !
neutral	order no 00000
neutral	still_waiting .....
neutral	easy to use website , good selection of stock .
neutral	postage reasonable .
neutral	have had wrong liquid sent on one occasion .
neutral	bought a guitar funny enough , pleased with the product , nothing fancy good beginner model for our son .
neutral	bit_miffed that the member of staff we had asked for assistance buggered off mid way through helping_us as another customer enquired if she could also get assistance !
neutral	we did manage to get another staff_member a few minutes later just as i was primed for leaving and going elsewhere , he was quite helpful to be fair .
neutral	three years_ago i booked a rtw ticket with rte and the service was very good , particularly when on arriving in sydney my travel_arrangements were compromised by cyclone yasi .
neutral	when quantas were their usual anal self and did nothing , rte managed to revise the itinerary .
neutral	in august i responded to an advert for flights to havana / panama / london for £_000 as long as i booked before 00 august ticket .
neutral	all i can say is the service was appalling .
neutral	initially i received a reply full of hyped - up sales bullshit speak promising me ' special deals '.
neutral	when i gave an initial itinerary i did not get a reply by the date promised and had to email again .
neutral	the reply gave an excuse which had no bearing on the circumstances and included an itinerary which did not reflect what had been given , at a price of £ 0000 , ie almost £_000 more .
neutral	i replied on 00 august requesting details of flights available at the price quoted in the advert and to date am still_awaiting a reply .
neutral	fortunately i had the gumption to submit another inquiry .
neutral	this time the service from the operator matched that of 0 years_ago and i quickly secured a ticket on the dates required for £_000 .
neutral	i do not know if the operators are direct employees of rte or free - lancers acting as agents , but i get he feeling the service depends on who answers the inquiry .
neutral	overall quick and easy service .
neutral	good car ( though the indicators were a bit off - putting ).
neutral	was surprised that i needed to pay a lot extra to get reasonable insurance_cover , so unsure_whether i would have got better valuie elsewhere
neutral	good online shop , used a few_times , but last time i needed to know some information about a product , that wasn_'_t clear on the website .
neutral	i sent an enquiry through the website - but never got a reply .
neutral	i didn_'_t order this product as a result .
neutral	i really didn_'_t get real support as needed in many areas of difficulty that i faced .
neutral	therefore i wasn_'_t really happy at all despite completing the course successfully out of my own hard work .
neutral	i would suggest more help is given when the students request for it because they genuinely need it .
neutral	great prices and location for fittings but lot of unneccessary waiting around for the tyres to be fitted
neutral	product spoilt by more than a few misshapen items .
neutral	quality control of the finished product sadly_lacking .
neutral	i was able to correct the components to enable assembly which was not as easy as ' it says on the tin_'.
neutral	nevertheless for the price paid it is still very good value .
neutral	i would order from bigdug again .
neutral	i sent my sony_xperia z to gadget_panda only to receive an email_saying they couldn_'_t accept it as one of the water indicators had changed color .
neutral	i was shocked to hear this as i hadn_'_t even tested the waterproof capabilities of the phone and it had never even been anywhere_near water .
neutral	when i received the phone back i along with my wife opened all the flaps covering the ports on the phone and all the water indicators were still white .
neutral	i emailed gadget_panda back but was told that at_least two people check each phone received and they were adamant that one of the water indicators was red .
neutral	they suggested i check again which i did and they are definitely all still white .
neutral	i again emailed and was told that as they no_longer had the phone they could not verify this .
neutral	so i wasted money on postage sending my perfectly ok phone to gadget_panda only to be told a lie as to the received condition .
neutral	something has obviously gone_wrong with their checking procedure and now they are insinuating that i have dodgy eyesight or that i haven_'_t checked all my phones ports or that i am lying .
neutral	this whole_experience has_been a waste of time and effort and i have paid postage_costs for no reason .
neutral	i am not happy and am in the process of finding out what my rights are and taking this matter further .
neutral	after various emails i have had my postage fully refunded and i thank gadget_panda for that .
neutral	as a follow_up to response to my last rating : there was no apology , and there was no offer of a refund .
neutral	instead , a clear statement that " all you could do was send out a new one ".
neutral	in fairness , i did receive a very polite email from the company , today , which returned my money to my account .
neutral	it '_s a shame , though , that this had to happen as they were out of stock of the unit ordered and the next best unit of its type so were not actually able to rectify the problem
neutral	in a speedy manner .
neutral	thank_you for returning the payment and for the polite update .
neutral	i think this is a brilliant concept that i will use every time i go on holidays in the future .
neutral	whilst in barcelona , i had no issues using the card to pay for goods and also to withdraw money from an atm using it .
neutral	however , a couple of small issues that i would like to highlight ( which would not deter me from using this service in the future !
neutral	):
neutral	0 .
neutral	i pre_- ordered my cards online days before departure to barcelona , and received a confirmation_email to say my cards ( x0 ) were available for pickup in liverpool_airport on the day of travel .
neutral	however , upon_arriving in liverpool_airport , it was as if my cards were not pre_- ordered at all , and i basically went through the entire application process again which took some time !
neutral	plus , the girl_behind the counter had no idea how to issue a second card to one account !
neutral	we got there eventually , but would have liked to just grab my cards and invest a bit more time in duty_free !
neutral	0 .
neutral	a frustration whilst on holiday was that i could not check my account balance from my android tab in the hotel as it requires flash_player ( not supported on android ).. this was a bit of a pain as i had no idea how much credit i had left on my card !
neutral	if this would work on android ( maybe an app ?)
neutral	it would get 0_stars from me .. but for now , 0_stars only :-)
neutral	apart_from the niggles , all good ..
neutral	when we booked online we clicked for an additional driver as no charge came up we though this meant no additional_charge as has_been the case with other car_rental_companies we have used in the past .
neutral	this was not the case , apparently as they use different supply companies they cannot say the cost , this should be stated clearly when you click for additional driver or if they know the cost of the car they should also know the cost of the additional driver
neutral	whilst the system works ...... there is no collection service and it is very slow compared to other_sites .
neutral	i booked the holiday using our joint credit_card .
neutral	the following_morning we received an email_saying our original accommodation had been double booked so we would have to change .
neutral	i contacted travel_republic from work but the operator wouldn_'_t speak to me for data_protection reasons as the card was in my husband '_s name .
neutral	i got him to phone but it is more difficult for him to phone during office hours .
neutral	anyway , a man suggested a couple of alternative places but my husband couldn_'_t access a computer to look at what he meant at that time .
neutral	he had to make a decision without viewing the accommodation .
neutral	when we both got home , i was disappointed as the original accommodation was nearer to the town_centre and had access to a swimming_pool .
neutral	travel_republic also charged us an extra £_00 !
neutral	i thought this was an insult as we had had to change our holiday and as we couldn_'_t cancel the flights ( or not without being penalised ) we had to agree .
neutral	having said this , little lindos was nice but it doesn_'_t have a pool or the plush surroundings the other hotel had .
neutral	a bit of compensation for all the upset caused before we left england wouldn_'_t go_amiss !
neutral	i would have liked delivery within the given time frame , but having used citylink before , they ' re not the greatest courier in the uk !
neutral	i would pay more if you used dhl or ups who do a better job
neutral	i phoned customer service about my order i got through no problem then i told waiting time to speak to a agent was three mins in the next message it was five mins iam glad i hung_up or i would still be waiting i think the clock must go backwards in their department
neutral	buying was hassle_free but delivery took longer_than stated .
neutral	not sure if this was spartoo or the delivery people .
neutral	tiles are a different shade altogether from the catalogue , so much so that my wife is considering having me tiling the 0 m0 again .
neutral	i purchases a medium wind cheater for my wife , i selected next_day delivery , rescheduled my work to be able to take the delivery .
neutral	no delivery was made , so i emailed you care department , i never_heard_anything from them to even acknowledge my email or a response .
neutral	i had to ring and wait for 00_minutes before i could explain .
neutral	the lady was very helpful and offered a 00_% refund on the value as i had been inconvenienced and i do understand that it was a royal_mail issue not superdry '_s .
neutral	then when my wife tried the jacket o when we eventually received it 0 days late , , it was to small so i returned it requesting a large , but was automatically issued a refund as i think you had no large in stock but did when i initially ordered which was frustrating .
neutral	i have since purchased a similar jacket from holister which turned_up when it should have .
neutral	i will buy from superdry again but will visit a store as my first experience with the online shopping was a bad one .
neutral	the good is :- ' just_kampers ' , great customer_relations and very caring .
neutral	the bad is ;- ' interlink ' courier services , 0 attempts to deliver , poor customer_care ,
neutral	the ugly is ;- my vw waiting for the parts for over a week .
neutral	hi !
neutral	i was strongly negative the moment the lady from the officie asked me to pay with visa 000 € as caution .
neutral	it limited my holiday - budget !
neutral	!
neutral	i was during my 00 day stay very nervous because i didn_'_t want another scratch ( there were 00 more scratches than the lady told me !!!)
neutral	on the car .
neutral	only today i mentioned that herz payed me 000_% of the caution on my account .
neutral	thanks for that , but it killed me during my visit to lanzarote .
neutral	nobody came to look after the car when i brought it back , though i washed and cleaned it !
neutral	and that was strange ?
neutral	always helpful always there when you need them but charge a bit too much to advertise products
neutral	the ferry was late there ' and ' late back , the facilities were shabby and a decent restaurant not provided , otherwise functional but lacking wholly comfort and finish
neutral	ordered a double grill_element , arrived quickly , part was correct , however , the packaging left a lot to be desired .
neutral	the unit had been placed in a jiffy_bag that was only just big enough for it - therefore the terminals of the element had come through the side of the bag in the post and were very bent / damaged .
neutral	i spent a fair_amount of time gently straightening the terminals as i was afraid they may snap off .
neutral	you expect some roughly packaged items if you ' re buying cheap stuff on ebay - but direct from hotpoint ?
neutral	this is really poor .
neutral	got bf0 ( russian ed ) for 00 £ it was not instant delivery despite the advertising saying it was , i got it after 0 + hours but i did get it in the end .
neutral	and it worked_fine , but it has made me think_twice about using them again .
neutral	you pay_peanuts , you get monkeys .
neutral	service first order excellent second order all_sorts of problems .
neutral	spoke twice with customer service .
neutral	the second time the member of staff couldn_'_t have been more arrogant if he tried .
neutral	didn_'_t appreciate who the customer is and i couldn_'_t get a word in .
neutral	on the 0nd order 0 out of 0 items delivered were faulty .
neutral	ark do except returns with no_quibble and credit back to bank_account very quick .
neutral	am now awaiting return of 0 faulty polo_shirts - but they have called and emailed regarding the items .
neutral	' jury still out '
neutral	shame about 0 person in customer service who thinks he is bigger than the customer !
neutral	this member of staff should remember the customer is always king .
neutral	sometimes there are issues but i '_m generally happy with paypal .
neutral	i used boiler_juice several_times now , i use it simply cause its the easy way to get fairly cheap oil ... i know by ring around i can get it cheaper .. but normally with group discount etc it works out about the same .
neutral	normally the delivery side is speedy , but this time boiler_juice choose a different supply , they texted me a date , this day came and went ... no oil ... in fact they delivered late pm two_days_later than their text ,[ edit .. i note that another has moaned about this supplier - bj take_note ] but cant moan as its within the 00 days but just as well i didn_'_t take time off for the oil man to come !
neutral	will i use boiler_juice again ?
neutral	... probably but if this happens too often ill be ringing around ....
neutral	got 0 barum_tyres for price of 0 , but noticed that the budget tyre '_s original price seemed high compared with premium_brands , so perhaps not such a bargain .
neutral	on - line purchase was reasonably straightforward allowing me to pick a fitting time , but only let_me know they might not be able to keep to this after i bought the tyres .
neutral	perhaps it was hidden in the small_print somewhere but why broadcast this nugget only after the purchase ?
neutral	i also wanted to arrange an mot , as i then qualified for this at half - price .
neutral	try as i might , the site would not allow me to add the discounted mot to the order .
neutral	i am about to check the e . mail confirmation of the eligibility for the mot deal but if it '_s not clear , the barnstaple ( barum in latin ) will have lost me as a future customer .
neutral	je_n ' ai_pas pu indiquer que_j ' avais un animal de compagnie pour effectuer la traverser aller retour de nice vers ajaccio .
neutral	il_faut faire évoluer les options du site lorsque l ' on prend l ' onglet " comparer les_prix ", que_l ' on valide un choix et que_l ' on va jusqu ' au paiement .
neutral	j ' espère que cela ne me portera pas préjudice lors_de_l ' embarquement ??
neutral	?
neutral	merci
neutral	good workers friendly & helpful , let_me know how things were going .
neutral	but the down_side was the first guy that was sent out with just a plunger couldn_'_t unblock the toilet , the second guy sent out the same day with a jetting machine couldn_'_t unblock it ( but he had a remote_control ) the next_day sent billy who was the best but was limited as the equipment that he had wasn_'_t as good as the second guy & had to jet from the drain to the toilet .
neutral	this caused the toilet to overflow as he couldn_'_t see what was going on ............. if he had a " mate " with him or a remote_control it would have avoided this ........ after having to sleep on the settee for 0 nights with the smell , a contractor came around ( rentokil ) too remove & sanitize the floor .
neutral	another subcontractor had to attend on 0 occasions too address the problem & remove with digging the drain rods in the collapsed pipe .
neutral	i '_m left now without carpet in the bedroom or en - suite but do have it working !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	it has cost me 0 days from work , but they have paid for the carpet + vinyl covering for the en - suite , so at_least they have been fair , but if there guy '_s had the right equipment we all wouldn_'_t have had this drama .
neutral	i bought two_pairs of sunglasses .
neutral	one is great but the other has one of the lenses set wrongly - hence a mixed blessing
neutral	this company has disgusting customer service i receive an email_saying my order has_been dispatched , so i take today off work to await my order , i call citylink who have stated that my order has not arrived , i then phone the drink_shop to which the receptionist who has no idea about customer service casually remarks with no hint of sympathy or regret that yea they received an email this morning and it was he fault that i had not been informed , i await my call back from a manager with great anticipation .
neutral	got a call back from a manager on the day we ad a chat about what went wrong and the company then shipped my order for next_day delivery which did arrive on time thankfully hopefully the incident i referred to in the paragraph above is a blip and a one off incident as the company appear to have fixed their customer service . issues
neutral	ebookers is very good , especially if , like us you like to do round trips .
neutral	but then , if there '_s an issue , make_sure that you are relaxed and full of patience before dealing_with them , because their customer service is as cheap is it comes .
neutral	here '_s the few experiences we had :
neutral	- over the phone : stupid customer service who don_'_t listen to what you ask for .
neutral	however they are good at giving you a stupid answer that has nothing to do with the question ... cute ...
neutral	- chat room : nice but they have a tendency at sticking to the book and not really helping you .
neutral	we had some issues with our bank and asked for some help for a discount_code that we received after burning £ 0000 on their website .
neutral	they clearly don_'_t give a damn ... we had to find a solution ourselves ...
neutral	- personal details : if you have more than one surname , be assured that it will be all compressed to one ( unlike shown on your passport ...) apparently it '_s fine at check - in ... let '_s hope so ...
neutral	for the price , it was fine .
neutral	the in - flight staff were extremely pleasant and more than helpful .
neutral	i would fly with this outfit again .
neutral	i have used interparcel many_times and on the whole the deliveries have got where they should when they should .
neutral	however i have felt their wrath a couple of times when i filled in the description of items being sent as car parts which is what they were .
neutral	i received notification that my booking had been cancelled because the description was not explicit enough .
neutral	when i said that had i put an exact description that they would have had less knowledge than my previous description i got a very rude email from someone there who said if it happened again they would close down my account .
neutral	a customer of mine had exactly the same experience .
neutral	i have probably paid them a couple of grand but would only use them now if i was stuck ..
neutral	having the facility to leave delivery instructions was great - my vw bits arrived within 0 days , left in a secure place as requested .
neutral	well_done jk and interlink_express .
neutral	i wanted to book car plus 0 passengers on the outward leg and 0 passengers on the return but could_find no facility for amending this aspect of the booking .
neutral	consequently i made 0 single journey bookings but had to pay the 0 pounds credit_card fee twice
neutral	i like rentifys concept however they have not referred any potential_tenants to me .
neutral	the products , price & ease of ordering are very good but i just placed an order in excess of £_00 and had to pay for a next_day delivery , no option .
neutral	this is not a problem but i didn_'_t recieve my parcel for four days !
neutral	this is not the first time this has happend .
neutral	i '_ve been using them for over 00 years in one way or another , and keep returning to them as they do have a good range of products and their prices are good value .
neutral	and the data_sheets and additional information is invaluable .
neutral	but .... the website is just so hard to use .
neutral	search is ok , but once you '_ve narrowed it down you ' re presented with a series of non - human - readable codes instead of meaningful product descriptions so have to keep clicking to the item to see what it really is .
neutral	the " filters " are anything but useful , there '_s no method to the set of criteria that you choose from and lots of overlapping things to choose from ( e . g .
neutral	0 . 0 " or 0 . 00mm - they ' re both the same !)
neutral	for example i wanted some m0 threaded bar .
neutral	i am presented with " d00000 threaded bar stainless or zinc " or " d00000 threaded bar stainless or zinc ".
neutral	guess which is which without clicking_through to both ....
neutral	sometimes i long for the good old days of the big fat paper catalogue when you could just circle the things you wanted then phone your order through .
neutral	i would appreciate if you could send me my 0000 € ( deposit ) back - after 0 days ...
neutral	my reference_number was :_000000000
neutral	a mixed_bag of experience .
neutral	my order was promptly converted into a despatch but the carrier manged to lose it .
neutral	a week_later another was sent via a different carrier an it arrived th next_day .
neutral	my frustration is that no one would speak to me .
neutral	everything was done by email .
neutral	the original order was delivered 00 days_later by the first courier .
neutral	then we had all the email correspondence to arrange pick_up of the original order .
neutral	bit of a shambles really which is a shame as plumbworlds pricing is very keen ..
neutral	wish i had waited to book till later as you seem to be nearly 000_pounds more than other agents for same flight , but will know now for next time :)
neutral	good layout but had a nightmare time trying to pay with debit_card tried 0 different ones and ended_up having to use credit_card at increased charge
neutral	my advice would be to make_sure you leave ample time when ordering foods etc .
neutral	although may be seen as convenient , when you actually take into account delivery time it can be a week before your receive items by which time you would need to go do your own shopping for items anyway .
neutral	especially with bits like oats etc it does get rather annoying
neutral	reliable delivery but cost of products go up each time you reorder .
neutral	why in this day and age can you not request morning or afternoon delivery .
neutral	seems so simple .
neutral	customer service rep didn_'_t come off script so it '_s obviously a regular one .
neutral	mattress seems ok so_far .
neutral	oh and delivery men fill in their own feedback questionnaire and then just get you to sign it and tell you it '_s part of the paperwork that needs to be signed .
neutral	cheeky !
neutral	bit_slow at start but item eventually arrived ok
neutral	had front_wheel_bearing and tracking done charged extra (£_00 ), 0weeks later i had front tyres changed due to excessive_wear and tracking at same time £_00 ( half price ), i was told 0mm out .
neutral	0weeks later , rear_tyres required replacing ( wear and tear ) they charged my partner another £_00 for tracking again even_though they weren_'_t asked to check it .
neutral	this all at same garage .
neutral	between mid feb and mid april .
neutral	when i called to complain i was told it '_s too late we don_'_t refund and your wife probably hit a pot_hole .
neutral	this company seems to work well at a good price but uses garages who are making such little margin that i believe it would have probably been cheaper to pay more for the tyres and not get ripped_off on tracking .
neutral	this mattress is not as bumpy as most and very good for just £_00 .
neutral	great product range and good delivery .
neutral	informative emails_keeping advised of delivery was appreciated .
neutral	previous_orders had come in nice presentation_boxes ( eg blankets ) which were nice where these were being given as gifts .
neutral	my last order didn_'_t come this way which was a little disappointing .
neutral	overall a good service though .
neutral	ordered the flowers and specified a morning delivery .... had not arrived by 00 noon and when i rang to ask the whereabouts i did not get an answer ..... they arrived in a parcel_force van at 00 . 00 with no card in them .... wont use them again .
neutral	even_though i submitted 0 different receipts for the same product on click snap grocery as it said you could claim 0 times .
neutral	i was only awarded cash_back for one of them .
neutral	not 0_stars this time .
neutral	they took 0 days to dispatch a special delivery ( which cost 00 pound )
neutral	sent on a wednesday with a promise of a return by the weekend .
neutral	showed on the order progress for several days as ' device received '.
neutral	chased on monday to be told ' it '_s on the engineer '_s bench , i '_ll see what '_s happening and ring you back '.
neutral	chased on tuesday or wednesday ( can '_t remember which ) to be told exactly the same thing ( almost word for word ).
neutral	eventually despatched on the thursday without further notification ( by which time we were away for the weekend !)
neutral	the repair itself looks very good , but it '_s disappointing to be let_down over the turn - round time and unforgivable to promise a return call ( twice ) and not make that call .
neutral	when they come out to repair a tyre they ask if you would like them to bring a new tyre in case a repair is not possible .
neutral	this , they say is to save a second trip and so a second call out charge .
neutral	however , they take payment for the new tyre right away , saying that they will refund the difference if the new tyre is not needed .
neutral	it took one phone_call and two emails for them to refund me - an unacceptable waste of my time .
neutral	i would hesitate to use them again , though the actual tyre service itself was fine .
neutral	not my first choice but value for money is not bad at all .
neutral	the stores can be dated and tired looking .
neutral	i love looking around poundland but sometimes wonder about the sources of their merchandice .
neutral	the internet site was simple and fast , the only thing that let the process down a little was the processing time ( nearly ten days ).
neutral	i went along to the consultation and oe were very reassuring and professional .
neutral	i pretty_much made the decision there and then as i was so impressed with their advice .
neutral	the procedure booking was quick and easy .
neutral	i showed up on the day and although the whole waiting time took about 0 . 0 hours or so ( not really sure why you have to wait so long ) the procedure itself was done in less_than 00_mins .
neutral	the surgeon i had was a little ' abrupt ' and ' hostile ' sounding at time but i think this was mostly due to the way he spoke .
neutral	they were a little too ' process them in and out quick ' on the day , particularly given that this is a very scary procedure .
neutral	anyway after the initial discomfort wore off and after a couple of weeks of dryness in my eyes my eyesight is great ( and continues to get even better ).
neutral	pros - great customer service up front .
neutral	quick ( though thoroughly freaky ) procedure .
neutral	great results .
neutral	cons - no guarantees it will last .
neutral	you need to be quite strong willed as they don_'_t spend a lot of time putting you at ease .
neutral	a friend of mine came out in quite extreme shock and went back the next_day to complain .
neutral	also it costs a fortune .
neutral	ignore any ads you see talking_about laser_surgery deals .
neutral	it is likely to be 0 , 0 or 0 grand !
neutral	on my last two orders , the delivery service has not even attempted delivery to the nominated address , leaving me to chase and track down .
neutral	the most_recent was a bottle ordered on december 0rd .
neutral	i have just found out after 0 phone_calls that it was left at a post_office that i now need to collect it from .
neutral	this is way outside the delivery times on your website which i have paid £ 0 . 00 for .
neutral	still_waiting .
neutral	[ erhaps you will ask me to review the transaction when they arrived and are fitted !!
neutral	!
neutral	my only issue was once ordered , other than an acknowledgment that our order had been accepted , there was no communication .
neutral	none !
neutral	we were given a delivery window of dates when our oil would be delivered but then no notice closer to our delivery of what actual date it would be .
neutral	tanker arrived at 0 on tuesday_morning , which for us was a surprise but perfect_timing !
neutral	but just as easily we could have already left for the day , as we had no clue that they were delivering !
neutral	do not leave ordering until the last_minute or you might run out .
neutral	my order took much longer to arrive than all other products i order via the web .
neutral	including ' free delivery ' items .
neutral	considering the cost of delivery this is an area that needs real attention .
neutral	i '_m a first time user and was impressed with the info given on the site , and the price , product and delivery times were excellent .
neutral	the only issue that i had was that i tried to add the code to qualify for an extra kg of protein , but the delivery arrived without the extra quantity .
neutral	i enquired , but was told that they were sorry but it explicity said to add the code blah_blah .
neutral	not great customer service , so i may look_elsewhere in future .
neutral	not immpressed site is too difficult and its hard to find what you want
neutral	dissapointed in communications .
neutral	on checking my account i found that the item was still in processing after 0 working_days when i emailed to cancel the order they then saih it had just been despatched .
neutral	co - incidence ?
neutral	when it finally arrived the box was battered squashed and half open .
neutral	i did not find the service comparable to other online_retailers i have used who keep their customers informed .
neutral	overall repairs were great but due to phone being beyond_repair took quite long to find out and several calls from me to get updates before being_able to collect ipod and broken iphone .
neutral	would still use again though as repair was good and value for money .
neutral	i am reserving my judgement on trust_pilot until i get to know them a bit better but so_far i would say i have had mixed_experiences with them .
neutral	one question that does spring to mind is where does their revenue come from ?
neutral	most comparison_sites get paid by the companies who are being reviewed so you can see that this is likely to mean the review is not unbiased which is why more and more companies are not wanting to have anything to do with these kind of sites .
neutral	i will edit this review accordingly .
neutral	having escaped from the awful aol in 0000 i have been with zen since then for broadband with excellent customer service and no_problems but not cheap mind you .
neutral	then recently i upgraded to fibre_optic broadband and have taken our telephone services from bt and talk_talk to zen - i have so_far been disappointed .
neutral	everything was great until i upgraded and right now i '_m reserving judgement because something has changed .......?
neutral	watch this space and i will update in a few weeks .
neutral	very slow to respond to my queries about their telephone charges ie over 0_weeks and as it turned_out there are mistakes on the pricing page on the zen site and this is still not resolved !!
neutral	!
neutral	i responded to what turned_out to be misleading pricing information on their home page ie " new cheaper broadband deals " which after wasting hours and hours of my time turned_out to be exclusive of vat but worst than that only for businesses not private consumers like myself .
neutral	i pay more than £_00 a month for fibre which is way too expensive .
neutral	the deals also required you to take out an expensive bundled telephone service as well .
neutral	not impressed !
neutral	!
neutral	also i recently asked for my fibre and telephone services to be synced so that they covered the same time period ie the calendar month which they still_haven_'_t done but today they took my fibre payment of £_00 . 00 from my bank_account when it '_s normally paid on a credit_card .
neutral	they did this without even asking me !!
neutral	during the process of trying to get payment ( from next month ) back onto the credit_card which was unbelievably painful the credit_card ran a security check and almost cancelled the card !
neutral	!
neutral	i am less and less impressed by the day but at_least i know i can leave with one months notice if i want to now .
neutral	i bought the blind form the excellent website and this was duely delivered reasonably promptly a week or so later .
neutral	the fabric is very good quality , the problem is the mechanism .
neutral	the drawstring pull pulls from the " wrong side " of the blind and this makes it somewhat difficult to use !
neutral	this is a design fault and shlould be brought to the front of the blind .
neutral	secondly the double hook is too small for winding the drawstring onto and should be higher quality for the price - brass or stainless_steel .
neutral	i would look around for a better designed product next time , hence i can '_t recommend this company .
neutral	have banked with smile since_0000 .
neutral	significant funds go through the account .
neutral	have three accounts with them .
neutral	they won_'_t lend .
neutral	when we needed an_urgent bridging loan they told us basically to forget it .
neutral	they would have taken 0_weeks they said .
neutral	we asked for a 0k loan a few_years back - and they just didn_'_t respond to the request at all !
neutral	we did finally get a loan from them , but the they withdrew overdraft and credit up to 00_% of the value of the loan .
neutral	it was too late by that time so i had to accept .
neutral	rule 0 with smile .
neutral	do not expect to strike up a lending relationship .
neutral	as you get older and wealthier - you will wish you had banked with someone_else .
neutral	rule 0 with smile .
neutral	don_'_t save with them .
neutral	i don_'_t think they have a product with interest of over 0 %.
neutral	their isa pays less_than my savings account .
neutral	all a total_waste of time .
neutral	the customer service is good .
neutral	but thats not enough for a bank .
neutral	we will be transferring our accounts shortly .
neutral	simple to use site although could of got a fit date 0 days earlier from tyre_shopper at the same branch .
neutral	good job im not in a hurry .
neutral	0 days to get the tyres in stock !
neutral	fitting excellent ( as always ).
neutral	difficulty with administration .
neutral	invoice adjustments promised but never received which left me out of pocket ( and wasting a lot of time ).
neutral	frustrating experience at best .
neutral	excess fees for using a credit_card are being eradicated .
neutral	i believe these should be clear before you get to the payment page .
neutral	your company is not being charged 0 . 0 % so why do you ?
neutral	the web_site works well
neutral	physioroom is a good firm .
neutral	delivery firm require a signature , which is frustrating .
neutral	they seem_incapable of leaving with a neighbour , or on door - step .
neutral	they were friendly , and easy to use apart_from the unfortunate delays
neutral	the shop is there to make money , don_'_t trade in sell private , but if you need new gear it '_s the place to go , they have a good guitar tech as well , you can trust him ...
neutral	i think we were given a better car coz we took out the extra_insurance in case anything went wrong with the car , which was fine but started to push the car out of being value for money , also it created a massive que at the desk as there was about 00 or families in the same boat and they were unwilling to pay the extra_insurance .
neutral	if this had been pointed_out .
neutral	at the start when book ing on line there wouldnt have been such long ques to collect the hire_cars .
neutral	also there was enough staff on which also added to the problem .
neutral	apart_from that the car was fine for what we wanted .
neutral	point 0 - users who provide a 0_star good review actually results in your overall score being downgraded .
neutral	matirx should be 0_stars neutral , 0_stars increases your score and 0 , 0 , 0 downgrades .
neutral	most users expect a decent business to provide a fast service .
neutral	the days of next_day delivery after despatch being a " wow " factor is over .
neutral	all decent retailers can do this now and it is now expected .
neutral	so to get a 0_star_review based on user getting an item super quick is harder as we , as good retailers do this in our sleep .
neutral	trustpilot should accept this and in some ways take some accolades for it , as they have helped true retailers raise the game but to punish the retailer with a reduction in score for being good is stupid .
neutral	point 0 - no understanding of business
neutral	trustpilot uses a system to allow retailers to request a review guideline and in the interim period not show the review .
neutral	this is flawed beyond_belief .
neutral	a .)
neutral	if the review has the slightest mention of a service complaint , the review stands , even if it is illegal or just wrong .
neutral	we have exmaples , albeit few , of low reviews for products we do not or have ever sold ..
neutral	how does this end up on trustpilot ?
neutral	in our case we did supply the reviewer with goods , but the user obvoulsy ordered something else from elsewhere and got mixed up .
neutral	no problem we thought ., we submitted the review for evaluation and explained that we do not sell that product and suggested the above scenario .
neutral	they came straight back and said the user provided an order number and the review stands .
neutral	well he would have had one from us , and one form the other supplier .
neutral	but there is no common_sense in trustpilot .
neutral	there lack of business understanding means they cannot get their heads around what can sometimes happen in business .
neutral	good range of products , good pricing on everything , very helpfully when speaking to them on the phone .
neutral	i was disappointed with the engraving carried_out , it looked the actual engraving was fine but the finish looked smeared
neutral	booking on the site is very user - friendly , very easy to use .
neutral	however the customer_support is pathetic .
neutral	hostelworld has a myworld section on their website which lists all of your bookings .
neutral	this section of their website does not work for me , despite me having changed my password about 00 times .
neutral	i have now emailed hostelworld about this issue on three_separate_occasions without_any response , acknowledgement or resolution to my issue .
neutral	gb_posters are great in themselves but there delivery company leaves a lot to be desired they are extremely slow in this instance i tracked the package and it changed hands at different_locations five different times .
neutral	that never happened the last time ......".
neutral	like the concept but the whole point of musclefood is the convenience .
neutral	having 0 out of stocks , despite calling to flag this ( which was appreciated ), basically means that i had to go to a store down the road in the end anyway .
neutral	overall , the customer service was good and prompt but i think the range needs reviewing / broadening to combat items becoming unavailable .
neutral	i would not have bought from datakits if i had seen all the bad_reviews beforehand , but my experience was not bad .
neutral	i bought a mobile case and received a case the next_day ( very good ).
neutral	however , the case was not the case advertised being a cheaper alternative ( not good ).
neutral	i emailed the sales_department and received a prompt reply ( to my relief ).
neutral	after a couple of more emails , both of which received prompt_replies i decided to accept the product sent me and datakits ' offer of a partial_refund , which was in line with the price i could have got it elsewhere .
neutral	there was a bit of a delay in receiving the refund but after a reminder from me i received the refund via_paypal .
neutral	the plus point is that i have an acceptable mobile case at an acceptable price .
neutral	the negative_point is that datakits were descrbing a product they didn_'_t have .
neutral	but at_least they did resolve the problem promptly .
neutral	a fantastic experience let_down by a poor nights_sleep leaving myself and my wife very tired the next_day .
neutral	every time one of us moved slightly in the bed it creaked waking us both up .
neutral	also the air_conditioning could not be used as when it clicked in it came on with a rumbling sound again waking us both up when it was on .
neutral	these two issues left us with a cold nights_sleep and tired the next_day .
neutral	if it wasn_'_t for these two problems it would have been a 0_star_rating / review this is not what i expect from a 0_star hotel .
neutral	i have left my thoughts with them on there feedback form and have not heard_anything from them .
neutral	i look_forward to your reply .
neutral	it '_s great you buy the phones but now the free_postage gone its £ 0 plus even before made any profit
neutral	in the last few_months we have used fastrac and airporter - several_times .
neutral	services are great , but both my wife and a friend did three circuits of the airport before finding the airporter car_park .
neutral	why ?
neutral	because the signs run out and you have to guess that you have to follow " authorised vehicles only ".
neutral	takes the gloss off somewhat .
neutral	sometimes you win - i '_ve no_problems with yodel , i live on the edge of civilisation in scotland and have to have to lot of stuff delivered .
neutral	they know us and stuff turns_up ok . pixmania are conservative in their delivery promises and usually beat their date .
neutral	i bought a netgear wireless range extender .
neutral	the reviews warned that it comes with a continental_plug and converter - it did , a bit oversized , but it '_s easy to cut the plug off and fit a uk one .
neutral	the reviews also warned the instructions for set_up were in french - they were .
neutral	the reviews also said they were rubbish even in english , and some helpful person explained how to do it .
neutral	i wish i ' d printed that off , because in the 0 or 0 days it took to arrive ( i was out first time ) the whole entry - product and reviews - had disappeared from the pixmania website ( or at_least i couldn_'_t find it - nor could the history entries in my browser ).
neutral	i spent an unhappy hour strugging to find another source of help on the internet .
neutral	pixmania overall - sometimes they ' re cheaper_than other_sites , but all the extras they try and add in automatically mean i avoid them otherwise .
neutral	i seem to have an unusual predilection of seeking to land closer to my intended_destination .
neutral	i also prefer to choose my seat at check in , rather_than enter a 000m sprint to the aircraft steps .
neutral	i sometimes wonder_if the phrase ' 00_degrees _ positive rate of climb ; gear up ' is ever actually used on the flight deck ?
neutral	i am fed_up with their antipathy towards avg .
neutral	does that satisfy you ?
neutral	about half an_hour at desk to be allocated a car because of volume of customers .
neutral	not the car i booked but similar .
neutral	car possibly about 0 years old and no instruction book which would have been of use .
neutral	price good and car ran well .
neutral	the unfair part of the contract in my view is that you have to pay for a full_tank of fuel on collection and , as the desk said , " waste it " before you bring it back .
neutral	no refund on unused_fuel i drove round the entire island twice before i emptied the tank . it is a brave soul who drives back to catch a flight with little fuel .
neutral	although aware of this condition when booking ; as i booked for 00 days it was sort of acceptable .
neutral	however , next time i will look at other rentals to see if you are able bring back a full_tank without direct charge as this may well save_money and change any view of the overall rental cost .
neutral	if the site would just take the booking details from the hire car booking it would be so much_easier .
neutral	i don_'_t need cover from midnight to midnight , i need cover when i pick_up the car !
neutral	the current method forces me to pay for 0 days for a 0 day car_hire - not good !
neutral	the pre_- sales conversation with staff was very helpful and the order was despatched pleasingly quickly - however - two of the buttons on the waist_coat arrived detached and broken ( surely this couldn_'_t have happened in transit - and must have been packed that way ?!?!?).
neutral	also , the hem on the trousers had not been turned_up .
neutral	quality of clothes very good though .
neutral	and when i called about the problems your staff were very polite and helpful and resolved it quickly .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	still surprised that your ' quality control ' let the package off your site in that condition .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	money was paid as agreed , but it took nearly three_weeks for money to hit my account .
neutral	could do better but otherwise fine
neutral	they made a big deal about their "£ 00 for our 00 - week plan " offer .
neutral	only after accepting it did i realise the £_00 only covered the first four weeks , and the remaining eight_weeks would cost an additional £_000 !
neutral	i cancelled as soon as i had the first four week '_s worth .
neutral	so_far , it all tastes nice enough , and i feel that i got my money '_s worth , but there '_s no way that three_times as much would be worth £_000 .
neutral	at_least there was no problem cancelling once i ' d discovered the real pricing .
neutral	see doctor first , look around on the internet they can be found for as little as £ 0 per pill .
neutral	i get a lot of packages from dhl and it ’_s only gone_wrong once .
neutral	but it went really wrong !
neutral	i rarely need proper next_day delivery but as luck would have it ; that ’_s the one that went sour .
neutral	i needed something urgent for the weekend and it was thursday , so i called the vendor and he assured me it would be sent out strait_away .
neutral	friday came and went and .
neutral	nothing .
neutral	i called dhl , which was a real hassle ( they have no uk customer service number , so i ended_up dialling ‘ international sales ’ and asked them to put me through ), they said that i wasn_’_t in , which i was , and they need the number off the card to rearrange delivery , i had no card .
neutral	anyway after a huge ordeal i got it re - delivered on the monday , no good to me at all ; and never got any kind of refund on the service !
neutral	crap .
neutral	but that ’_s one bad_experience nestled in amongst a great many good ones !
neutral	company unable to deliver fridge within 00 days as expected when ordering due to change of their supplier .
neutral	when changing the hinges so door opened the other way it was found the the moulding that the bottom hinge was screwed to was distorted that side .
neutral	thankfully able to sort_out with a few washers .
neutral	model rla00g .
neutral	as regards to keeping_me in touch with events and notification of delivery appliances direct were excellent .
neutral	0 working_days for delivery , 0 days for a refund to card .
neutral	good prices for oem_cartridges but didn_'_t expect to have difficulty_getting in the door because 0 separate packets had come through the mailbox .
neutral	some errors with the website losing track of the booking i was trying to make / saying the flight couldn_'_t be found after it had just said there was good availability .
neutral	took me 0 tries to get it to work .... would recommend but requires a little patience !
neutral	it took far too many phone_calls to get card save and streamline to sort our trading name , type of company and address details , so much so , to the point that i know that the money is going into the right account and i can '_t be_bothered to check the details they have on file , as i know it will lead to more phone_calls and apologies .
neutral	flowers didn_'_t arrive_till about 0pm when it was dark and they were left in a wheely bin !
neutral	luckily the recipient caught the man before he left and he told her where they were .
neutral	couldn_'_t track the delivery either using postcode and reference num .
neutral	the site it '_s good .
neutral	the availability is good .
neutral	the service is good , quick to send and in decent packaging .
neutral	they are a bit more_expensive than i '_ve found elsewhere on the web .
neutral	that '_s why many_times if not pressed for time i use cardkingdom instead .
neutral	very disappointed , these flowers were ordered for a collegue who was retiring .
neutral	we went for the grandissimo option as this was the biggest and best option for the chosen flowers and on delivery we were exceptionally under whelmed with the bouquet .
neutral	the flowers arrived in unattractive brown_paper and were not as full as expected .
neutral	the picture of the flowers which was meant to be the standard version portrayed the flowers to be a lot more striking and being as we paid for the biggest bouquet possible we were expecting a lot more .
neutral	we actually had to go to a local_supermarket and pay for them to add an additional bouquet and wrap with more acceptable trimmings .
neutral	sales was great but then they would be we where spending , after sales not helpful at all disappointed , delivery men where very good so my neibour said ,
neutral	we tried hiring a lens from the lensforhire website , but it failed the first time because it would not accept our card_details , which meant we were forced to do it the next_day and miss the pick_up date we needed !
neutral	the whole website is very old_fashioned and un - user_friendly and actually looks untrustworthy , we were worried to begin with and rang the company just in case they didn_'_t exist .
neutral	working for a video production company and digital_marketing company , we really do recommend making your website more contemporary , modern and user_friendly , whilst letting your potential_customers feel safe !
neutral	maybe even a video introducing your services ?
neutral	we loved the customer_services from everyone , the girl we spoke to on the phone and the guy_who delivered and picked_up the lens with our pick_up option and also your costs are brilliant and your location is perfect for us .
neutral	if you are interested in our own services , we would be happy to have a chat - contact generateuk at 00000_000000 .
neutral	thanks ,

neutral	the apartment is suitable for four people .
neutral	unfortunately , the apartment was cleaned only superficially to our appointment , nor was hair and dust everywhere .
neutral	we were five people and had booked for five people , but received only bedding for four people .
neutral	despite request by mail no one answered .
neutral	it was nice that we could have breakfast opposite and there are near many restaurants located .
neutral	ordered friday and delivered monday .
neutral	company agreed to change bundle to meet my requirement .
neutral	only one small drawback concerning somewhat difficult to contact sales staff .
neutral	otherwise would recommend .
neutral	i find you site great , with the picture refrences , your pricing is excellant
neutral	the only issue i have is you take far too long to get back me when i email requests over to you or ask if i can add to my order .
neutral	you have missed several orders from me because of this
neutral	hi the car_park i was to go to was not marked very clear i did eventually
neutral	drive into a car_park got a ticket but was not sure if this was the correct
neutral	place as it did not say on the ticket that this was booked on line and paid
neutral	in full so i was worried when i came back that i would be charged again
neutral	i did come_back put my card in and away i went but i was worried
neutral	the book is really nice but i wasn_'_t impressed with the quality of the photos in the photobook .
neutral	i have the same photos done in a photobook from photobox and the quality from them was brilliant , no pixels at all .
neutral	for that reason i wont be using again or recommending as it has put me off .
neutral	regards
neutral	i '_ve been playing virgin_games for some time now , and have played many different and varied games on there .
neutral	but to date i could even play a game with £_000 , and still not get any jackpots .
neutral	i '_m not saying that the site does not pay out , but a couple of jackpots here and there would be nice .
neutral	i '_ve played sky_vegas in the same time span , and had 0 £_000 jackpots on games the same as virgin_games have .
neutral	so it '_s a maybe from me .
neutral	its alright but i wouid use amazon as they are more reliable and legit
neutral	its ok but i wouid just shop for it
neutral	better_than [_external_reference_] but still some retailers won_'_t pay out as promised , ie .
neutral	[_external_reference_]
neutral	arrived on time , but too much greenery and foliage and not enough flowers .
neutral	did not look like the picture on the website .
neutral	i bought these tyres on the net really good price but when i went to have them fitted at national_tyres the could not find my order even_though i ' d phoned to check my west lakes were in .
neutral	the reason was that tyre_shopper didn_'_t actually have stock of the tyres that i ' d purchased and had sent a different tyre as a substitute ( not as good ).
neutral	they had my email address and my phone number but failed to contact me , they say they tried but i definitely didn_'_t email me and i had no missed calls on my phone .
neutral	having had the morning off work , driving 0 miles to derby and waiting around for some time while national_tyres sorted_out what had happened to my order i felt that to cut my losses i ' d have the alternative tyres_fitted but felt conned and unhappy .
neutral	if you don_'_t have them in stock , don_'_t sell them on your web_sight !
neutral	i recently_purchased from toolandfix via their ebay site a tacwise staple_gun and of course some staples , all of which duly_arrived a few_days_later .
neutral	unfortunately the wrong gun had been sent , this was rectified and a replacement was sent very quickly .
neutral	the products and the service was fine but , there always is a but and the but is , that if i had ordered my products directly from toolandfix i could of saved a few_pounds because they include the delivery costs in the ebay prices but not on their own website .
neutral	delivery is also free for orders over £_00 . 00 .
neutral	so remember don_'_t buy before you check the direct website of a company .
neutral	i will probably use them again but not via ebay !
neutral	!
neutral	yes !
neutral	the teak garden_furniture has finally arrived and it is very , very , very good .
neutral	the problems of getting it here are the only thing that sour the milk .
neutral	i didn_'_t realise that when they said free delivery , they mean '_t the amount of delivery promises it would take to deliver !
neutral	anyway moan over ( possibly ) and back to the review .
neutral	i had given up on it coming yet again and then at 0pm , the doorbell rings .
neutral	there stands kevin from teakwarehouse , tired , his last delivery and the best part of three hundred_miles from home .
neutral	he was polite , helpful and a credit to the company , mark ( teakwarehouse boss ), give him a pay_rise , he deserves it .
neutral	the furniture was offloaded , the bill paid and kevin duly parted on his long journey to essex .
neutral	why , you may ask did i give a three star_review .
neutral	well , i reply , i gave a star for each of the following :
neutral	quality , the teak furniture looks , as i said before ; very , very , very good .
neutral	price , ( even without discounts ) better_than the competitors .
neutral	kevin , shows that someone knows_how to deal with customers .
neutral	the two other stars would have been given for ease of contact and customer_care .
neutral	teakwarehouse have an excellent product but appear to be swamped by demand .
neutral	i believe that their success may be their biggest failure .
neutral	so come on teakwarehouse , get someone to answer the phone and reply to emails .
neutral	finally , i have read_reviews that raise doubts_about teakwarehouse being a reputable_company because they only accept payment by bank_transfer or cod .
neutral	i can say 000_%, that they are 000_% genuine but if you are still unsure , pay by cash on delivery as i did .
neutral	and even more finally ; i will update this review , same time next year and let you know how the furniture does over time .
neutral	marks and spencers was once called an institution but now more of in an institution , a true shame that they seem so lost .
neutral	on a recent internet expedition into the depths of marks and spencers , i ordered some hi - ball glasses .
neutral	these glasses cost £ 0 . 00 for four .
neutral	at a later visit to asda i came_across the exact_same glasses for £ 0 . 00 for four ; you should have shopped_around i hear you say .
neutral	how very true .
neutral	my point is though , if they continually overcharge customers on their wares , in the end the customer goes elsewhere .
neutral	following on with the same hi - ball glasses , marks and spencers asked me to review the purchase .
neutral	i pressed the link supplied and hey_presto , a nearly blank web_page stating " this site is not supported ".
neutral	see what i mean !
neutral	if they can '_t link web_pages what can they do .
neutral	i really hope they can get there corporate act_together , for look what '_s coming .... next .
neutral	the beer bottle cosutme looks good but the important part of the costume is the bottle neck on top of the head , this is too flimsy and does not stand up as per the photo .
neutral	very misleading and very disappointing .
neutral	as a consequence not worth the money .
neutral	on the plus_side the delivery was very fast .
neutral	purchased using a wowcher voucher .
neutral	completed the purchase on the clear chemist website on a friday , item delivered on the saturday .......... the following week !!!!!
neutral	that '_s dispatch confirmed after 0 working_days , another 0 days for the items to reach your doorstep .
neutral	quite_frankly , although i have the items delivered , the whole buying experience is a bit slowwwwwww .
neutral	you need to improve if you want to be competitive .
neutral	that '_s my view !
neutral	the goods ordered were reasonably_priced and were sent out on time .
neutral	the delivery company delivered them to a completely_different address , not even on the road where i live .
neutral	the people who received them were total strangers to us , but fortunately were honest , and brought the goods round .
neutral	delivery a big let_down .
neutral	i got a decent price for one of my phones , but wasn_'_t really happy with the other 0 and asked for them to be sent back which they did , i planned to sell them elsewhere
neutral	all was in order and prompt .
neutral	good trip at a reasonable price but food prices are steep !
neutral	its called taking_advantage of the " captive_audience ".
neutral	good initial choice of glasses and try at home service , but then had to keep ringing you and when i did i had to have my prescription at hand with date of test - when i did not have it ( at work ) was told that had to have it to discuss with optician , but when insisted that it was only for a discussion about use of varifocal_lens use , the operator reluctantly put me through .
neutral	am still_waiting for correct receipt after person said it was a customer glitch annd would send asap ( 0 days ago !)
neutral	- need this receipt to claim back off my insurance before 0 months is up - please someone send it !
neutral	the car had lots of scratches on , the red light came on for petrol as soon as we got in .
neutral	the indicator switch kept sticking .
neutral	hired a car from them in january much_better car and service as it was from the resort not the airport and you saw the car before you payed for it
neutral	online purchase via 0wisemonkeys went fine , then got a text from the delivery company saying date they will deliver and to reply by text to change it .
neutral	i replied to change the date , they text back confirming the change , yet they went_ahead and delivered on the original date anyway !
neutral	not a good service .
neutral	spoke with this company direct and they admitted fault and apologised , so not a fault of 0wisemonkeys .
neutral	got my order , opened the amazon box it came in ( guess they being green to save on boxes ) and the product box inside was not sealed !
neutral	made me think it '_s not brand_new !
neutral	opened and checked the contents and a key part missing making it useless .
neutral	i was now furious .
neutral	i contacted 0wisemoneyks and the product manufacturer .
neutral	within 00_hours , both companies had contacted me back .
neutral	0wisemonkeys issued the missing part 0st_class and the manufacturer accepted fault for the lack of sealing that got missed in the factory and the missing part from the box , and sent me a free dvd pack for the kids .
neutral	so my rating is 0 , overall my issues got resolved swiftly and i '_m satisfied with the product now , but guess my initial_impressions were not great with the delivery mix_up , lack of product sealing and missing part , but all were since explained and accounted for .
neutral	i ordered 0 glasses from the website , received the email comfirming that the payment had gone_through and that the glasses would be despatched asap .
neutral	i then received a phone_call from one of the very friendly staff at havens and she explained that there was only one glass left , and would i like to pick another style , this did cause some problems as it was for a birthday_gift .
neutral	but i got another set of glasses and they ordered the original glasses i wanted .
neutral	happy all_round .
neutral	i am usually pretty pleased but i had to cancel my last order down to the eight day delivery time
neutral	delivery let them down , ended_up a week late
neutral	product when it arrived was great tho
neutral	i bought some rockport shoes from this retailer .
neutral	they were exactly the same as old rockports i already had , so there were no_surprises there .
neutral	they were quite expensive , but this was the only retailer offering this particular shoe .
neutral	delivery was extended .
neutral	when i complained i did get a good response and polite e_- mails , just no shoes .
neutral	when they came i got a detailed_explanation involving adidas and the olympics .
neutral	as above , website had no number to recover from lookup failures ........ chat stated they would resolve but didn_'_t !
neutral	good price , good service ...... for front end poor !
neutral	put the statistics for the models in the pictures on the website as well as the size of the clothing they are wearing .
neutral	that will help us to better estimate the fit online .
neutral	and use a variety of model body types .
neutral	good quick delivery and communication well up to scratch .
neutral	only problem is in the cut material service
neutral	ordered item for a christmas_present .
neutral	was delivered within 00_hours however as this was a gift it would have been nice to have packed the item rather_than just putting an address_label on the outside of the box so the contents were shown .
neutral	box got wet in the rain and became tatty
neutral	would reccomend
neutral	site quite slow and takes a long time to do shopping
neutral	if you want anything from iceland go to the store , i have had three online deliveries and only one did i get everything i ordered , on one 00 items were out of stock but my local_store had them all , i ordered 0 packs of warburtons 0pack crumpets for a pound each the sent me 0packs of kingsmill one which they sold two for a pound and only had 0 crumpets which they sell two packs for a pound but charges me a pound a pack also i ordered three two litres of semi skimmed_milk , which one had a hole in the bottom and was squashed which covered the fridge and the floor with milk , if you want shopping from them go to your local_store then whatever you put in your trolley you know you will get ...
neutral	not sure why but i thought i had put the correct detail in .
neutral	key number correct and it is a halfords roof_box .
neutral	very disappointed as flowers were ordered for my partner for her_birthday but did not arrive_till 0 . 00 in the evening , but will say bouquet was lovely
neutral	the website was very easy to use and th ordering_process went_smoothly .
neutral	unfortunately the flowers did not arrive on the day specified and i had to call to find out where they were .
neutral	they finally turned_up the afternoon of the following_day .
neutral	although the flowers where lovely and my wife was surprised , the flowers that arrived where not as pictured ie the pictures showed that roses where included and the ones that arrived had no roses !
neutral	although the photo_book is acceptable i feel it was not good value at £_00 given the image quality and thickness of paper .
neutral	good products at a good price fails on delivery - although its free 00 days is too long to wait for items to be delivered
neutral	the car that was advertised was a hatchback , however the car i was given was a sedan / saloon .
neutral	this caused me some difficulties .
neutral	the car '_s air_conditioning also didn_'_t work .
neutral	otherwise pretty good value and a good service .
neutral	accommodation was not stag_doo friendly and showers were terrible !
neutral	bar_crawl that was apparently a party pass was not even heard of in any of the bars on the list so a waste of time .
neutral	" guestlist entry to chy bar " no guest_list as it was free entry to everyone anyway .
neutral	quad_biking and clay_pigeon shooting were excellent but we still feel after asking around we could of organised the whole_thing for cheaper but thanks anyway chillisauce .
neutral	i expected to receive my items ( a cd and an lp ) within a few_days of placing the order .
neutral	instead , after 0 days i received an email_saying that there might be some delay since " items are dispatched from switzerland as stated in the product description ."
neutral	if it is stated in the product description , it '_s well hidden .
neutral	i eventually received the 0nd item 0_weeks after_placing the order .
neutral	in short , fine unless you want your items within the week .
neutral	estimate of 0 - 0_weeks when i ordered in mid_december but i now have a delivery date of feb 00 .
neutral	expected more for the money and flowers didn_'_t last long .
neutral	bit of a disappointment .
neutral	i ordered from wood 0u as they were the cheapest for the specific laminate i wanted .
neutral	the day before delivery i received an email with a list of delivery conditions and the threat of a £_00 charge if any of the conditions were not met .
neutral	this seemed an aggressive approach to customer service !
neutral	one of the conditions was an able_bodied person had to be available to take the order inside the house .
neutral	not wanting my wife to have to haul 00 heavy boxes into the house ( with a 0 year_old spins her ankles ) i emailed the company and was told it was up to the delivery driver .
neutral	this is unacceptable .
neutral	the driver left a pallet outside the house - fortunately my wife was able to get some help but i consider this poor service .
neutral	it should be part of the delivery process to carry heavy items inside .
neutral	no saving over local_dealer and you don_'_t have to wait for the delivery .
neutral	no great deals here .
neutral	the furniture was delivered on time by cheerful and helpful guys .
neutral	however the tin of furniture wax that was promised ( and paid for ) was not in the delivery , so we had to make a trip back to the store just to pick_up a small tin of furniture wax .
neutral	not happy about that .
neutral	if we had to collect the wax from the store you should have given it to us when we paid for the furniture .
neutral	a wide_range of very useful goods , but expensive compared with internet prices .
neutral	staff always friendly and helpful .
neutral	a bit dissatisfied with the product on the other hand serenata sent some more flowers as a token of good will which was nice wasn_'_t going to use them again , but i might give them another chance or might stick to next flowers or prestige_flowers
neutral	the price i was offered was not the one i received by some_margin ; my phone was in good condition yet the offer was not what i expected and the time window to accept the price was tight - especially as i was going abroad - so overall not a great experience
neutral	to post a dvd , or cd u . s . a . royal_mail charge £ 0 . 00 . while amazon give you £ 0 . 00 pence for postage
neutral	you have to subsidies the extra postage out of your own pocket .
neutral	to make up the £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i now only sell to uk only .
neutral	had some issues with the garage .
neutral	i was advised on work that would need doing to the car ( even_though i did not ask for this to be done ) which was good .
neutral	however , i had an issue with the car when i left the garage , i promptly returned and was informed it might be one of the issues i was advised about and that it may need fixing immediately .
neutral	i was not happy about this and it seemed like they were fishing for extra work .
neutral	in the end however the mechanic who carried_out the work on my car remembered a misplaced wheel weight and there were no further problems .
neutral	i placed my order and paid with my paypal_account .
neutral	no response from the supplier and after two_weeks i decided to chase the order .
neutral	market money told me that they had not received payment and the order was held .
neutral	i quoted my paypal reference for the payment and they promised to look into the matter and phone me back in a few minutes .
neutral	i am still_waiting for the call but surprisingly the product was delivered by post the next_day even_though it was a different_colour from the one ordered .
neutral	it had taken so long for this to happen that i could not be_bothered to return it for a replacement of the correct colour .
neutral	i would not recommend market money based on my experience .
neutral	deliver perfect just 0 of the roses are doubled over and dying the next_day even_though they were put in water immediately on receipt !
neutral	website is well_designed and clear , paypal acceptance is helpful for quick orders .
neutral	products have all been good quality on this and past orders .
neutral	however , on previous_orders i agreed to substitute goods and was not refunded the price difference despite two emailed requests .
neutral	on the alloy tubing the " beading " option is not true beading but a skim of the tube outer to leave a tiny bump ; barely adequate for hose fitting .
neutral	i used the on line pre_paid long_stay_parking .
neutral	sometimes it works but most of the time you need to have your booking email handy as the barrier doesn_'_t open or it asks for full payment .
neutral	talking to the guys via the support at the barrier has usually fixed it but the first time i tried i was told that i had not done things correctly until i read out exactly_what the booking email said to the guy and only then did he accept that perhaps it was the system that was wrong .
neutral	that said last time i used it the system worked correctly so maybe some glitches have been fixed .
neutral	as for fast track - that annoys_me .
neutral	to me the security system should not take a long time when it is set_up correctky and if fast track is being used it just makes it longer for everyone_else .
neutral	generally though i have not had long_waits at edinburgh .
neutral	ordered the calibrated brazilian black slate through mrs_stone because they could supply internal tiles and external pavers to match .
neutral	very happy with the product but a real saga in getting it delivered .
neutral	as the standard truck was deemed too large to deliver because of width restrictions , we agreed 0 deliveries with a smaller 0 . 0 ton truck .
neutral	this turned into 0 deliveries for 0 pallets - the first was only one pallet by the most unhelpful driver that i '_ve ever_dealt_with , arriving outside the time_slot at 0pm and dumping the pallet on the roadside because there was a half inch kerb on the letdown ( not a problem for the deliveries on the following_day ).
neutral	two further deliveries the following_day were by a more helpful driver but without_any labour on site to assist it would not have been possible for him to successfully or safely offload his cargo .
neutral	now i '_m no logistics expert , but even i can work out that if you have a challenging access , then fewer deliveries are better .
neutral	i know this element is sub - contracted by mrs_stone , but i have ordered slate_tiles through another supplier in the past that were delivered to a more difficult site to access with no_problems_whatsoever .
neutral	this aspect needs to be drastically improved before i would place an order again .
neutral	when i look thrrough the catalogue i see some fantastic items and mark them for future referance , then i order a few items and it takes so long to get them that i revert_back to my usual suppliers as they only take a few_days 0 / 0 at the most ... frost is almost always 0 / 00 days ... why
neutral	i '_ve mainly been happy with the swift service , but the last few orders have contained one or two lenses that have contained no saline fluid and therefore a dried out , un - useable lense .
neutral	pleasant company to deal with but ....
neutral	0 .
neutral	for my initial wellies order ( as advertised on their website ) they were out of stock - quite frustrating .
neutral	0 .
neutral	didn_'_t like the ' add £_00 if you want size 00 ' - that was a con .
neutral	0 .
neutral	when discussing the product we were ordering , i was given negative info which i suppose was fair_enough but i am left with the feeling that i have purchased an inferior product - for which i '_ve paid a lot ..... plus of course the extra £_00 !
neutral	0 .
neutral	to be fair , they were very good at dealing_with a return .
neutral	the stuff i order came rely fast . one of the inflatable coolers were broke so we could only use the one which turned_out to be enough as it happens .
neutral	i thought about sending it back but we tried to fix it but it still went down
neutral	the other one was realy good though
neutral	prices are great and easy to book .
neutral	only down_side is there is no " pay upfront " option so you have to keep your money aside until closer to travel time .
neutral	have used blackcircles a number of times and have always been happy with the price and the fitting_centre , although my most_recent_purchase was let_down by a abnormally long wait for four tyres to be fitted .
neutral	not up to usual standard , however guess that its still a better option than picking_up the yellow_pages and taking pot_luck
neutral	hard to give any review as i '_m still_waiting for
neutral	delivery .
neutral	whilst i was advised that it would take 00_minutes to change my front tyres , balance the wheels & sort my tracking by a very helpful assistant - it actually took longer because of constant interruption from incoming telephone_calls .
neutral	perhaps in light of this situation it may be worth national_tyres weston - super - mare investing in a full time administrator / receptionist .
neutral	as above in more detail every time i tried to order through your web_sight it kept telling_me the page was not available .
neutral	i feel that if i was not committed to the product and your company i may have gone elsewhere .
neutral	apart_from that when i did get through with my order the service was very good
neutral	the product was ok but the on the second delivery the packing was crushed and split_open with the items in a jumble plus the delivery driver did not ring the door_bell for me to sign the delivery note .
neutral	he dumped the parcel on the doorstep and made a hasty retreat
neutral	the six lights were easy to set_up but we are having to recharge the batteries every other day which seems a pity as they seemed a bargain price .
neutral	it is really great and cheap for visiing .
neutral	just one flaw , you must travel off peak , which is really not convenient .
neutral	it was very simple to find what we wanted and place an order on the website .
neutral	delivery came very quickly and the office staff were helpful when we called with a question .
neutral	be warned though , it '_s not as easy to do it yourself as it looks on their site / video .
neutral	even with a very careful approach we were left with air - bubbles ... they don_'_t look too bad ( and better_than the newspaper we had before ), so would recommend , but get a professional if you can ...
neutral	excellent and the person they were for was over the moon .
neutral	the only down_side was i filled in your ' contact us ' on your website as i was after something specific and 0 days_later still no one has called me and i was unable to get the product i wanted and very disappointed and loss of sales for you !
neutral	!
neutral	i only ordered the product i did due to the excellent service i received before and for ease .
neutral	mixed feeling here ................
neutral	good for buying if you know your prices .
neutral	bad for selling because of ebay rules which are highly stacked against you , you need a lot of luck with your buyers as i can tell you that all of the idiots in the world also go to ebay just to mess things up and because that you do need a lot of luck not to be dealing_with one of them and if you do you cannot rely_on ebay to help you out .
neutral	delivery was scheduled for friday 00th_march as agreed .
neutral	a confirmation of delivery was received for the 00th .
neutral	suddenly i received notification that my item would be delivered on monday 00th_march .
neutral	as it happens this was quite inconvenient .. no apologies received .
neutral	order was dealt_with quickly and efficiently .
neutral	however , order reference_number which was emailed to me so that i could track the delivery was incorrect so i had to guess when it would be delivered .
neutral	always seems to be trying to trick you on the website .
neutral	ridiculous charges on luggage , of course great if you don_'_t need checked in luggage , but they must know very few people are travelling without anything that can '_t be taken in the cabin .
neutral	i continue to use ebay on and off , for selling and buying .
neutral	i can see that there is a problem with the balance of burden on the seller in conflicts , though have been lucky_enough to not deal with dishonest buyers .
neutral	products are cheap , but there are a lot of fake , replica , poor quality products .
neutral	i needed some body solder bars recently and sent my order into frost in the u . k ., however i was shocked to find the cost of shipping a small package which weighed a few_pounds was so expensive .
neutral	while their turnaround around times are brilliant i would love if they had a option where you could select postage instead of a courier to ship such items .
neutral	i was told by the girl on the phone that the post_office would not accept a package over a certain weight which i thought strange as i get items shipped from the u . s all the time by post .
neutral	my items came to £_00 . 00 plus shipping of £_00 . 00 plus_vat of £ 0 . 00 brings the cost to £_00 . 00 .
neutral	converted to euro '_s = € 00 . 00 .
neutral	shipping is quite expensive now and this example shows how it can increase the costs of items by 00 %.
neutral	cheap clothes at a cheap price .
neutral	ok value for money - big impersonal stores with high turn over of staff .
neutral	why didn_'_t you tell me that i had to order a separate wireless card to make this thing work ?
neutral	everything comes with wireless these days - it '_s standard .
neutral	i didn_'_t order an on switch either but it came with one anyway .
neutral	at first we thought the service was great and the phone was answered_promptly , however we had problems after the item was delivered .
neutral	there were footmarks over the items , shower_screen packaging which i presume was caused_by the delivery driver at dx frieght .
neutral	the toilet was chipped and cracked too .
neutral	after calling they sent a replacement but it never came , dx frieght blamed victoria_plumb that they didn_'_t send the item and victoria_plumb blamed dx and said it had been delivered !
neutral	in the end they sent another one and the other one never came at all !
neutral	overall , good product and buying but not good at sorting_out issues and after sales service .
neutral	i would use them again for the quality but not for their service .
neutral	buy with caution
neutral	i am a true apple fanboy and the products get better and better .
neutral	i have had apple products for the last 00 years using every os since os 0 .
neutral	support is great , especially since the advent of the apple retail_stores where i can book a slot at the genius bar and get my problem sorted in store most of the time .
neutral	however the only reason for the three star_rating and not five is that the products build quality is decreasing rapidly .
neutral	this year i have had 00 imac '_s scratching optical discs , three ipad '_s with faulty sound , two ipad 0 '_s with faults , 0 macbook chargers fail , 00 hdd failures and an ipod_touch with a flickery screen .
neutral	i manage three schools mac networks to a total of 000 apple desktops and three servers .
neutral	the removal of the xserve and the simplifying of os x server has seriously knocked my confidence in apple as a company .
neutral	i only hope tim cook can rescue the state of the company before it '_s too late and it goes entirely os devices only .
neutral	i ordered the flowers for my sister '_s 00th_birthday .
neutral	i received a message confirming secure delivery .
neutral	i e_mailed my brother in law to check : no sign of the flowers .
neutral	i messaged serenata about non delivery .
neutral	i haven_'_t heard back from them so_far .
neutral	my brother in law checked with their neighbours .
neutral	still no sign .
neutral	the postman noticed that ' someone ' had left ' something ' on the doorstep of the ( unoccupied ) old_school house .
neutral	( 000_yards_away from my sister '_s address . )
neutral	fortunately he investigated , realised who the package was intended for and took it to my sister '_s address .
neutral	still nothing from serenata .
neutral	then this request for feedback arrived !
neutral	.
neutral	i ordered a washer_/ dryer from marks_electrical and as stated they have very helpful friendly well - informed staff , the product delivered on time , and i could see the installers took real pains to install it really well .
neutral	the only problem which would put me off would be as i work monday to friday i had to take the whole day off to get the machine installed as you are only texted at 0 pm the night before to tell you when the product will be able to be installed .
neutral	there is a problem if you want your machine plumbed in with delivery times i believe becoming more restricted
neutral	flexible delivery times and in particular a saturday delivery would bring me back to marks_electrical every timewith no problem whatsoever
neutral	i went on line , selected the tiles i wanted , booked a despatch date and paid , only found out about the shipping cost etc right at the end .
neutral	then i get a call on a saturday_morning before the pre booked monday delivery to tell me that the tiles were not in stock and ' if ' they were available at the suppliers then i would get them delivered on wednesday at the earliest , i had to tell my customer the bad_news , i was accused by my customer of planning the later delivery to ' buy ' time .
neutral	then , i get a call on the day of delivery that the driver had been waiting outside my house and could not wait any longer and had left .
neutral	i had already left my mobile number with the person_who called me on saturday so that i could have notice of the arrival of the tiles to enable me to get back and collect the tiles , obviously he never wrote it down because the driver was phoning my landline and getting no response .
neutral	a pretty bad_experience , and with no recompense for the delay .
neutral	would i use again ?
neutral	probably not , i can '_t afford to lose money on a job waiting for a delivery that might or might not arrive :-(
neutral	overall the buying experience was good but i did hav a 00_%_discount_code which was accepted at checkout but then when i paid with paypal the discount vanished .
neutral	did finally receive the discount in the form of a partial_refund but only after i sent a message and got deferred to somebody_else .
neutral	i bought 0 tyres , for the first time on line .
neutral	the price was excellent compared to anywhere_else .
neutral	customer_relations have a lot to be desired .
neutral	i was greeted with " good afternoon sir how can i help ?"
neutral	i lie , the fitter just looked at me .
neutral	i explained i had bought on line .
neutral	when the fitter identified the tyres , he proceeded to fit them .
neutral	once he had finished he just moved on to the next customer without one word of communication .
neutral	no problem with the quality of workmanship , but hello and thankyou would have been nice .
neutral	they sell good posters .
neutral	i '_ve got 0 posters from the walking dead from them .
neutral	however i found the service better if ordered from amazon rather_than there actual site .
neutral	i tried entering a 00_%_off code on their site which didn_'_t work i sent an email to tell them that was 0_weeks_ago and i haven_'_t heard a thing back .
neutral	customer service and communication could be improved and maybe if they checked there emails once in a while .
neutral	whilst i found the web_site easy to use and the tyre selection satisfactory and payment straightforward it was not pleasing to find that when i arrived to have my tyre fitted at my chosen_garage the following_day the tyre had not been delivered .
neutral	the gentleman dealing_with me seemed a little embarassed and annoyed .
neutral	when i asked if he could fit a tyre of comparable quality and price he said yes but i would have to pay extra .
neutral	i would have thought because i had been inconvenienced an offer of goodwill would be forthcoming .
neutral	instead i had to make alternative_arrangements for the following_day and my partner went to have my tyre fitted as i had to borrow her car to honour an out of town appointment
neutral	as a buyer its first_class purely due to the choice .
neutral	but as a seller the fees are very high .
neutral	better selling with gumbtree
neutral	only got two replies for a list of common parts for a common vehicle .
neutral	one of the breakers contacted me saying they had all the parts requested with all the prices , but in fact they did not have all of them .
neutral	it felt_like an_automated chance reply without checking stock first .
neutral	i ended_up using my phone to find out who had what parts , which defeats the object !. dissapointing .
neutral	pleased with the service .
neutral	but only accept a fraction of barcodes entered .
neutral	for me it '_s not worthwhile spending all that time and then still not able to register enough to make a minimum transaction .
neutral	ordered an ex - demo marantz sr0000 available receiver at a very good price .
neutral	paid for next_day delivery which indeed it did but the amp was placed into to box without_any surrounding protection with the remote_control and mains_lead loose within the box .
neutral	also they forgot to add the set_up microphone and instructional cd which made the surplus delivery payment pointless as it needed the additional pieces for set_up .
neutral	saying that the missing bits were soon sent out , just the lack of any protective_packaging being the real concern
neutral	it '_s the first time i '_ve_used parts_gateway , and generally i like the way it works .
neutral	i was phoned by two of the firms before i ' d even had a chance to look at the quotes ( all very similar ), and that impressed me .
neutral	unfortunately , neither of them actually came up with the goods : the first , when i phoned back to order , said they ' d looked at the part and decided it was substandard ; the second , when i phoned back , simply took my order and payment , and i felt i could relax .
neutral	i was therefore quite surprised , the next_morning , to get a message from them asking if i ' d looked at their quote - i replied that i hoped that the part was on its way !
neutral	in response i got a dispatch note , which turned_out to be completely fictitious .
neutral	after 0 or 0 days i phoned to ask where the part was , and was told that they would " check with logistics " and let_me know .
neutral	it took another call - a week after ordering - to establish that they were actually unable to supply the part ( they have since repaid me ).
neutral	i therefore ordered it by phone from a third firm , mojo spares ltd , who did everything it said on the tin .
neutral	two_days_later i received my part , in excellent condition and extremely well_packed .
neutral	although they are perfectly useable the tee heights are not as stated : i . e .
neutral	00mm 00mm 00mm & 00mm .
neutral	the actual sizes are 00mm 00mm 00mm & 00mm .
neutral	everything was fine .
neutral	but the delivery time was quite long considering the delivery charge .
neutral	disappointingly , the goods were not dispatched quickly .
neutral	i had a dealing_with fedex because i was unable to sign for the package when it was eventually delivered .
neutral	i would have to say the service from fedex was exemplary .
neutral	when i first joined i was asked what offers i ' d be interested in .
neutral	i listed my preferences thinking i would only receive wowchers for my choice .
neutral	how wrong was i ?
neutral	every day i get emails with dozens of wowcher offers ( most , if not all are not in my choice category !)
neutral	daily i just go delete , delete , delete ..... etc .
neutral	i have managed to syphon through them and found one or two offers i have used , but to be honest i have been really disappointed with wowcher .
neutral	purchased a phone with an advertised ' massive 0000m range ' turns_out the phone is worse than my existing panasonic .
neutral	poor product advertised very misleadingly ...
neutral	following this review they have changed the description of the product .
neutral	very good customer service .
neutral	would buy from again , just not any bt products ...
neutral	last_week i bought a cell phone online apparently is not working_properly so i ring up the store where i bought the phone from explained what wrong with the phone they said they will ring me back latter to arrange someone to come and pick it up wait for ther call and nobody call the following_day i did the same they told me the same thing and i phoned them again for the third time and they keep telling the same shit over and over again so i just give up am gonna have to give my son a fault phone for christmas
neutral	how fare iz that ?
neutral	couldn_'_t get the tyres up that i wanted .
neutral	wanted to pay cash on the day , no such option .
neutral	don_'_t understand_why , i can '_t save time and purchase tyres at the depot , for the same low / reduced price ?.
neutral	apart_from a little_confusion at first over items in stock / items not in stock the order arrived promptly in good condition and i '_m very happy with it
neutral	i tried to pay by pay_pal 0 times and it wouldnt process emptying the basket each time , so had to use visa_card ,
neutral	prefer royal_mail or parcel_force for small deliveries especially for small packets as i can collect them locally ,
neutral	arranged delivery to a neighbour as was at work , i texted the house number of the neighbour when selecting this option , when the item was delivered i recieved a tex sayingt it was delivered to 000 i live at 000 so not a neighbour actually on the other side of the road and 000 meters down the road , i called at the strangers address they werent in so went home and found card saying it was delivered to 000 !
neutral	my actual neighbour who had the goods ,
neutral	the door card bungs advertised as 0mm needed the steel to be drilled to 0 . 0 mm in order to fit ,
neutral	the bungs on the cab step rubbers are too large on the diameter ,
neutral	i much prefered buying from status as i could collect on the way home , and compare the goods new for old , before handing_over the cash .
neutral	they ' re really cheap and the time they take to deliver is great , but my stuff arrived a bit banged up , so that sucked .
neutral	i found that the service was slow , after_posting my phone on a friday i had to call to confirm that you had received my phone .
neutral	an email to confirm that you had my phone would have gone a long way .
neutral	when you reviewed my phone and i agreed the price it took a further 0 days for you to send payment , which then took 0 days to clear .
neutral	having a faster_payments method of payment would make you competitive with other recycling firm .
neutral	the flowers were for my wife and they were a surprise .
neutral	the delivery was good in that arrived bang on time .
neutral	there was little wow_factor .
neutral	flowers didn_'_t resemble the picture from which i ordered .
neutral	will go_elsewhere next time .
neutral	online booking was easy though lack of explanation as to what time you are supposed to turn_up , just choose morning or afternoon ... on calling i learned its either first come first served or you can book a slot .
neutral	i left the car with them and received a call an_hour later to say that the wrong tyres had been delivered , h rating rather_than the v rating i ordered .
neutral	the h rating would be an extra £_00 or if i could wait a couple of hours they could get the right ones from a nearby branch .
neutral	i chose to wait .
neutral	i asked for a phone_call when they were done and to advise , after testing , whether or not i should also have the wheels tracked .
neutral	after 0 hours with no call , i rang in to be told yes everything was done .
neutral	" and what about the tracking ?"
neutral	i asked ... " oh_yes , they ' re slightly out , we ' d recommend having them tracked ".
neutral	so after another half hour wait i eventually collected the car .
neutral	appreciate this was a saturday_morning and they were busy , but not exactly top_class customer service .
neutral	good job i had nothing on that day and the garage was only a 00 minute_walk from home .
neutral	otherwise , mechanics were generally happy to help and advise and i '_m happy ( as happy as can be when spending hard_earned_cash on car tyres ) with the end_result .
neutral	would return again in the future .
neutral	fast and effective online ordering service which allows you to provide some extra detail regarding the delivery .
neutral	unfortunately the detail wasn_'_t followed which created issues at the customer '_s site including delays in the actual customer receiving the chair and additional work for our staff in relocating to the area where it was supposed to be delivered .
neutral	perhaps the process for passing the delivery instructions to the courier need to be reviewed .
neutral	very happy with the product however , having checked the website a day later the product was half price .
neutral	selected the free next - day delivery option that coincided with the special_offer but instead received items by 0 - day courier , only for the driver to not even contact me to say that he had arrived with my parcel ( i live in student halls of residence so courier drivers calling me to notify_me that they ' re outside is the norm ) and the office was closed at that time so they couldn_'_t have accepted it on my behalf either , making it even worse that he didn_'_t endeavour to contact me directly .
neutral	so i had to rearrange for the start of the following week as the failed delivery took place on a friday .
neutral	also , i say items , but when i did receive my order the following_tuesday and had to get out of bed at an abrasive time to meet the driver , i only received the tub of protein ( 0 / 0rd of my order ), and had to call up the company to find out where the rest was .
neutral	to quote the customer advisor " usn let us down with their stock delivery , but you should have the items by the end of the week ".
neutral	oh right .
neutral	thanks for telling_me .
neutral	if an item is out of stock you think they ' d tell you before only a third of your order arrives .
neutral	since my last shaker broke and i had to throw it away , i now have a tub of protein sitting at home without a shaker for the next week and will have ended_up waiting a combined total of 00 - 00 days for an order that should have been successfully completed and delivered within 0 .
neutral	seldom do i complain_about customer service but in this instance i have been left desperately disappointed .
neutral	giving them 0_stars just for the great price , otherwise it would '_ve been 0 .
neutral	i '_ll genuinely probably just use ebay next time , and get my products for maybe a couple of £'_s extra yes but with a hassle - free service including no strings_attached next - day delivery .
neutral	you can '_t seem to get my orders to me on release day !
neutral	again today a game which is released today i haven_'_t recieved .
neutral	if i know i am going to get them after the weekend i wouldn_'_t order online and just go and buy from a shop !
neutral	so i '_m not satisfied with your turnaround in getting new games to me .
neutral	good looking watch but the bracelet was difficult to alter .
neutral	the watch face is slightly off centre which is not good .
neutral	i was planning on buying the entire collection but am not sure now .
neutral	previous_orders have always been received within a week .
neutral	my latest order is yet to be delivered after ten working_days - customer_services advise waiting 00 days before they will report it as a missing delivery .
neutral	no_complaints as yet , but i am puzzled as to why it should take 00 days to ship from guernsey to the mainland .
neutral	on a more positive_note , previous_orders have always met_expectations , and i putting this latest experience down to a one off , but will all depend on what happens should the order not arrive waiting the next two_days !
neutral	booked 0 new front tyres and a wheel_alignment online .
neutral	i rang up to see if the garage could move my appointment forward .
neutral	they agreed , but once i got there , it turned_out they were running behind so had to return the following_day .
neutral	having checked the ' wheel_alignment ' box online , i presumed that was included in the total price .
neutral	however , this was charged in addition the online order price .
neutral	once seen , the tyres were fitted quickly , and the staff well_mannered .
neutral	good - look and feel , choosing prices per leg , good to support independent company
neutral	bad - some legs only appeared sporadically on web_site , no amex , no ability to choose seats , not all fares available , it wanted to charge me more for my 00month old daughter !
neutral	will look again , but amex is a big thing as it also covers travel_insurance
neutral	the service was decent , website easy to use .
neutral	overall service fine .
neutral	but the quality of double walled cardboard really moderate quality at best .
neutral	it '_s maybe a case of ' you get what you pay for ' and this is cheap grade double walled cardboard .
neutral	however worse than this 00 sheets ordered around 0 metres in length about 0 . 0m or so wide were delivered in a plastic_bag with no protection .
neutral	all the edges were indented the front sheets damaged .
neutral	it '_s not suitable packaging for delivery of this product from kite_packaging .
neutral	my advice is to by better grade or larger_quantities where you can accept damage due to poor delivery packaging .
neutral	delivery and follow_up not good enough .
neutral	there appears to be a reluctance to help once the money has changed hands .
neutral	at this moment i '_m waiting for challenge_trophies to get back to me :
neutral	a cup arrived chipped at the base , it was suggested that i ' live with it ', take off the name_plate & fix it to the back so the chip doesn_'_t show and that i shouldn_'_t seek any compensation as the order was small & they had increased the order by one medal ( on my request ) although i was ready to pay , this was sent out ' gratis ' ( seems i am paying for this now indirectly !)
neutral	was also suggested to me not to ask for replacements as the order was small .
neutral	the ( mens ) medals i ordered arrived displaying long hair & breasts i . e .
neutral	womens medals !
neutral	i hope they can make this order ' complete ' ( the event was 0_weeks_ago now .
neutral	the product looks good , but the fitting instruction were diabolical .
neutral	invest in up to date instructions and better still put the fitting of your blinds on you tube :-)
neutral	i chose unibaggage because i thought they would be the end - to - end service provider .
neutral	but as the bag was just going within the uk it was contracted to parcelforce .
neutral	in principle that was fine , and the price ok ( although another courier company such as myhermes . co . uk could have done it for around half the price ), but parcelforce would only give 0am to 0pm collection and delivery time slots .
neutral	this meant someone being in all day at both_ends !
neutral	so last century and customer un - friendly .
neutral	next time i would just work with a more modern courier company directly .
neutral	though the quoted price might be competitive , your fees are undisclosed until the very end of the registration when one has already invested substantial time to book a ticket .
neutral	those fees when compared to your competitors are much higher .
neutral	hence unless you come upfront with any fees , incl them in your offer or at_least lower them to comparable levels i will shy_away to use your site for numerous trips me and my family are taking regularly .
neutral	in addition , you do not allow the user to chose the currency he / she wants to be billed in .
neutral	krgds ,
neutral	marek lorinc
neutral	i ordered a pc which was delivered next_day ,
neutral	great comms even a text_message giving a time it would be delivered .
neutral	after 0 days the pc developed a fault ( no fault of box . co . uk ), collection was arranged for the next working day .
neutral	this is when comms slowed_down and it would take_upto 0 days for a reply , as the pc was out of stock i opted for a refund which took 00 days after chasing up .
neutral	may be i am one of the few dissapointed customers on this occasion .
neutral	i am happy with their phone system they know who the customer is by caller_id .
neutral	will consider purchasing again in the future .
neutral	i ordered a paddle racket , when they said it would take 0 days to get it from the manufacter i thought nothing of it .
neutral	when i called they said it was on back order . called back a few_days_later they then told me that the racket was not being made any more .
neutral	they said to select another wiith some what of an_apology .
neutral	i callred them back with another choice , it was in stock and they would send it out that day ... i called dhl and they said a ticket was set_up and but it was not set for pickup ... called again and again difference in time was 0 hours ahead of mine .
neutral	they were very hard to reach .
neutral	finally they sent it out on a monday and dhl delivered it two_days_later .
neutral	very hard to deal with a company in another country
neutral	good range of phones but cannot get them where i live and seem pricey .
neutral	jersey_boys was really good enjoyed every minute .
neutral	unfortunately the hotel was very poor i would definetely not stay there again and i have therefore been put off using ticket_tree for an all in package .
neutral	i was very pleased with the quality of the furniture but was disappointed that the delivery drivers did not unpack the sideboard and take the rubbish away .
neutral	part of order was sent incorrectly , initial call to customer_services didn_'_t yield the anticipated response but email response was very good and customer_services apologised and will send the correct item .
neutral	thanks for correcting the mistake .
neutral	i have been a customer for a number of years of currencies_direct .
neutral	everything is fine and the rates are decent enough when i deal by email or phone but since they have started_using the automatic online payment ( ipayfx ) i have not enjoyed the experience .
neutral	0 times i have tried to use and 0 times it has failed and the worst thing was that i was in a position where it wasn_'_t even clear if my trade had executed so i had to do the trade again .
neutral	then i was sent 0 contract notes so i had in fact doubled my trade .
neutral	all the tech help_desk was able to do was ask me to send a screen_shot , they were quite hopeless in finding a reason for the fail .
neutral	this review would have been 0_stars if i hadn_'_t started_using the online auto payment and it would have been 0_star if i had not had a much_better experience over the last 0 years prior to that .
neutral	hopeless .
neutral	flowers arrived too late in the day to be enjoyed by my wife as a surprise , the babysitter took delivery as they came around 0pm .
neutral	you sent the wrong flowers and they were poor quality .
neutral	you let_me down on the day i needed your help .
neutral	never again .
neutral	in the interests of fairness , thank_you for the reply .
neutral	i will of course adjust the poor rating_accordingly to reflect the positive after sales experience when everything is completed .
neutral	i have received a full_refund , apology letter and a voucher .
neutral	i have increased the review to 0_stars from 0_star to acknowledge the fact that iflorist took fully on board my complaint .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	cheap but has problems with signal in many places .
neutral	i placed an order on the wednesday , and other than an_automated confirmation_email , received no further confirmation until i chased them on friday ( so much for next_day delivery and good communication !).
neutral	i was told the product was out of stock , although the web_site did not indicate this and that it would be in today and dispatched for a monday delivery .
neutral	let '_s wait and see , it is now sunday and since my call i have had no further communication .
neutral	i now have my order ( delivered on tuesday ) and as a result i '_m happy to update my rating to 0 .
neutral	the tracking and information provided from the point of dispatch to delivery was better_than normal .
neutral	0_stars lost for the web_site not indicating out of stock , and lack of initial_contact .
neutral	will i shop_here again ?
neutral	yes .
neutral	i like the service and price of collect_+ but the only thing that let '_s then down is the fools working in my local_garage who seem like they don_'_t like taking these packages and make it as difficult as possible when they do take them , complaining_about size even_though the size of my parcels are well within the stated maximum yet they try and put you off sending it by saying the driver won_'_t take it etc .
neutral	items were reasonably_priced and free delivery was great .
neutral	order arrived next_day .
neutral	was a but disappointed when inspecting the goods as it was not as powerful as expected as the description mentioned a faster rate whereas the detailed specs says a lower rate which was delivered .
neutral	the ambiguity of the item on the website has caused me to score lower .
neutral	0_stars for service but 0_star for website descriptions .
neutral	the web process was fine , however sent the phone free post and they did not process the phone arriving and payment for 0_weeks .
neutral	i can '_t believe the post_office is to blame , so either it is a way to penalise free post users or they can '_t cope with the volume .
neutral	was concerned that the phone was lost .
neutral	i have used this service 0 times before and next time will have to think_twice .
neutral	the wall_clock ordered arrived in good time , however i discovered that it was faulty in the fact that no batteries would start the clock .
neutral	i telephoned the main office straight_away and was advised to use their on - line procedure .
neutral	i have done this and am awaiting a reply .
neutral	i bought a fridge from ao and , being extremely impressed with the price , buying experience and delivery service , was all - too - ready to recommend ao to as many other people as possible .
neutral	however , my positive perception of the company has_been compromised by the repetitive follow - up calls i have received , which i understand are an excuse to sell me an extended_warranty .
neutral	i would suggest ao review this sales strategy .
neutral	having read several forum threads on the subject , it seems i am not the only customer who has_been irritated by it .
neutral	i ordered a sax mouthpiece via the website where there was no mention that it might be out of stock ( unlike_other_websites ).
neutral	it was only later that normans emailed me to say i ' d have to wait_until they ordered one in .
neutral	stock_levels on the website would be useful .
neutral	other than that , a good price and at_least they kept me informed .
neutral	royal_mail cannot fit a small jiffy through the letter_box and i have to travel 0 miles to collect from them !
neutral	i wanted to make a photobook for my dad '_s 00th .
neutral	downloading the software and putting it together was really good and easy .
neutral	my only irritation is that i registered as part the ordering_process , ordered and then photoworld sent me a welcome email to say i could get a £_00 discount on my first book .
neutral	clearly it can '_t be used for the first book as i emailed to ask it i could use it on my first book and was turned down .
neutral	i couldn_'_t even cancel and start over .
neutral	still book came quickly looks great and happy to recommend the product .
neutral	i had to try three different browsers to place my order and the payment page doesn_'_t show it '_s secure .
neutral	i finally got the site to work with firefox .
neutral	the box office had no record of my booking .
neutral	they searched through all the correspondence from last_minute but could_find nothing .
neutral	luckily they let_me in but it could have been nasty .
neutral	picked_up the car at dinard airport , had to queue for over an_hour before i got to the desk , but wen i did , the service was good , the problem was that there was only one member of staff on duty , and it took about 00_minutes for each customer .
neutral	the second issue was the condition of the windscreen , i was told that there was a crack , expecting a tiny crack somewhere , but no !, a huge crack right across the drivers field of view , would have been illegal in the uk .
neutral	i should have rejected it but i couldn_'_t face yet another long wait in a queue .
neutral	apart_from that , the car was good , clean and good fuel_economy .
neutral	when courier arrived i asked to check the part before sigining the driver said i would have to sign first & was not willing to wait_until i opened & checked the part as advised by parts_gateway this is a problem which needs addressed between the courier & parts_gateway
neutral	have used national before and always had excellent service .
neutral	only ( slight ) criticism is that i looked on line and selected tyres i wanted , rang local_branch who had them in , but was told if i went in today ( saturday ) rather_than ordering on line i would have to pay the ' in store ' price which was £_00 more .
neutral	if i had not had previous good experience with them i would have taken business elsewhere
neutral	the website was great ordered item the had a phone_call 0 days_later say that the item i needed wasn_'_t in stock , if a items out of stock it should tell you on the website before you pay for it and then 0 days_later get a refund .
neutral	got tickets to see once the musical ( which i recommend as the most romantic lovely show i ever_seen , take your partner , really !).
neutral	i booked top price stalls and we certainly got what we wanted , 0 rows from the stage for less_than the advertised box office price .
neutral	no glitches , so very pleased there .
neutral	however i made the mistake of also trying a top secret hotel deal .
neutral	whilst i can '_t fault the excellent price they got me for a well located 0 * hotel , it absolutely did not suit what i wanted and was a total nightmare to cancel .
neutral	took 0 phone_calls and i ended_up doing a conference_call with the hotel and lastminute . com to get a full_refund .
neutral	maybe i was naive but unless you are prepared to have to accept any kind of hotel you are seriously risking getting something that whilst impressive may be totally_inappropriate for what you want .
neutral	i don_'_t plan to use the top secret hotel again .
neutral	to be honest you can get these same deals direct from the hotel if you do a little research using other review sites , so i think this idea has probably lost its value now .
neutral	what i will say is that the helpdesk staff in india ( at_least i presume in india ?)
neutral	were diligent and always polite .
neutral	i had to press very hard all the way and after a lot of complaining and messing_about with “ finding the phone_call tapes ” etc_., they did eventually call me on my mobile to confirm refund .
neutral	but it took 00 days to achieve when it should have taken 0 and almost ruined my plans for really special wedding_anniversary treat .
neutral	chillisauce offer a great service , the choice is very wide_ranging and website is very easy to use .
neutral	however , the product at the end of it is not worth - in my opinion - what you pay for .
neutral	we all paid £_000 for two nights dorm accomodation in bristol , night club_entry and deep_sea_fishing .
neutral	a very brisk bit of research uncovers the fact that the beds that we were in cost £_00 per night .
neutral	that leaves £_000 for deep_sea_fishing that lasted 0 hours and we had to pay to get to .
neutral	it was in cardiff and cost a fortune for us to hire a mini_bus for the day !
neutral	not great value for money .
neutral	and i very much doubt that the chaps on the boat took home £ 000pp .
neutral	as for the night club_entry we did take_advantage of this but we had to be there before 00 which , i '_m_sure , you can get for free anyway .
neutral	chillisauce offer a good service in that they take all the organisation out of your hands .
neutral	however , if you ' re wiling to spend an evening arranging it yourself i believe you could get the same product for about half of the price .
neutral	my order was despatched promptly but took a week to be delivered .
neutral	the parcel appeared to sit in a transport hub or a non transport hub for 0 days before an attempt was made to deliver the order .
neutral	the parcel arrived at 0pm , delivered by a local one man delivery service .
neutral	i dread to think what simplysupplements paid for what was allegedly a 00 hour delivery .
neutral	sort the cost of transport and the products would cost less perhaps ?
neutral	staff were helpful when contacted about the delay .
neutral	however the non transport company finish their working day at 0pm and an answer could not be obtained with regards to non delivery .
neutral	good advert for them !
neutral	was reluctant to use boohoo due to poor delivery reviews .
neutral	the reviews were correct headline delivery was much much slower_than_expected .
neutral	after my parcel didn_'_t arrive i was pointed to the small_print which indicated longer_than_expected delivery could be possible .
neutral	would be great and would be use the site so much more if they could get a fast free reliable delivery sorted .
neutral	was a little disappointing that some books i purchased were late to be delivered , but other than that , good service .
neutral	i ordered over the new year period so possibly abbey_whisky were closed . if so they should have said on their website . it was over a full day before i did have communication , when i was expecting delivery .
neutral	the communication that did come was accurate about how to track my parcel , which duly_arrived albeit after 00 after my order rather_than the 00 hour mark
neutral	all the goods were packed extremely professionally , but was disappointed that there wasnt a little sample inside as was indicated on the purchase page .
neutral	i also contacted abbey_whisky about the purchase page checking out and why i didn_'_t send a review there , but did not receive a reply
neutral	so as you can see communication is not satisfactory for myself but there again i am used to japanese service ,
neutral	the product i purchased was satisfactory although there was no receipt of actual amount paid inside which i found strange
neutral	prices ok , but let_down by needlessly slow delivery .
neutral	will not buy from again .
neutral	the stuff we '_ve had from graze is ok , no_complaints about quality .
neutral	but when you realise you '_ve spent £_00 in the last month for four weekly boxes , it is just too expensive for the tiny amount you receive .
neutral	for people who consider eating a couple of nuts and a sultana a day a " snack " they may be ok .
neutral	but for most people the tiny trays you receive can be eaten in two or three mouthfuls .
neutral	but that '_s the idea .
neutral	to get you to order more boxes and spend more money .
neutral	i also found the overly matey attitude they assume very grating .
neutral	they ' re a business , in it to turn a profit .
neutral	they ' re not my " mates " and they ' re not doing me favours .
neutral	they ' re selling a product .
neutral	it '_s a good idea , but the " sell ' em a tiny amount so they '_ll buy more " ethos they seem to have is too transparent .
neutral	picked_up a minivan in pdx at thrifty .
neutral	the car was not clean , " goldfish " and other food on the floor .
neutral	after mentioning it to the staff they vavuumed some of it out but after having left the rental car station i still found food and trash in the door - and seatpockets .
neutral	other than that the car was ok and the value for money good .
neutral	would do it again .
neutral	ps_: one more thing , maybe i did not pay attention when booking but i did not want to buy the prepaid fuel but somehow they wouldn_'_t let_me opt against it .
neutral	the whole_transaction was ok .
neutral	but some bad points is that the price quote on this site were really cheap and the process just took for too long from receiving the packet , checking it and sending the payment .
neutral	i hadn_'_t realised how the ticket i received on entering was printed out with my registration and recognised my car at the exit !
neutral	i had to check at the parking office how this worked .
neutral	product delivered promptly and communication was good .
neutral	the switch itself is poor design as the shaft is plastic and the nut strips the thread .
neutral	i am aware that this is not your fault and this is the only product on the market that will do the job .
neutral	even then i ordered a second one
neutral	update_: 00st_may 0000
neutral	in the interest of fairness i thought i ' d update this review .
neutral	after writing this review and sending emails to the ceo ( along with others ) i got a response back from the national customer_care manager .
neutral	she was very apologetic and promised to put things right .
neutral	i had already re - arranged the delivery at that point and was assured by her that it would be the first drop and she would track the order personally to ensure it arrived on time .
neutral	she also arranged for some flowers and chocolate to be sent to us along with a cheque to cover the cost of the phone_calls .
neutral	on the morning of the delivery i received a phone_call from the dispatcher informing_me they were on route and 00_minutes later they had arrived .
neutral	unfortunately the item was damaged ( probably due to being loaded and unloaded 0 times from the previous delivery attempts ).
neutral	the seller arranged for a replacement to be delivered .
neutral	again this delivery was handled by dx_freight , this there were no issues and they turned_up within the time frame .
neutral	so a mixed_bag really .
neutral	utterly_hopeless certainly describes my initial experience , but once my complaint got through to the correct people the service was good .
neutral	==================================================================
neutral	original review
neutral	title : utterly_hopeless
neutral	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
neutral	i had a delivery due on thursday 00 / 00 /_0000 between 00 : 00 – 00 : 00 .
neutral	at 00 : 00hrs i tried tracking the parcel .
neutral	on the web_site it only showed me the same estimate , which is not very useful .
neutral	after waiting on hold for nearly 00_minutes i was told the driver was running late and had 0 drops ahead of me , and that he was just down the road from me , they also said the driver would call me when he was on route .
neutral	this was around 00 : 00hrs .
neutral	at around 00 : 00hrs the delivery still had not been made , so i phoned again .
neutral	i tried the 00000000000 number but there was a message_saying to call back during office hours .
neutral	so i was forced to call the 00000000000 number .
neutral	on hold for over 00_minutes , with some additional waiting while the operator attempted to find out what was happening .
neutral	she told me that the delivery would not be coming as the driver had gone home .
neutral	we re arranged the delivery for saturday 00 / 00 /_0000 .
neutral	that morning i phoned the 00000000000 and had to wait 00 minuets , i was told the delivery would be with me between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 .
neutral	at 00 : 00 i phone 00000000000 to try and find out where the delivery was .
neutral	after 0 hours 00_minutes on hold , i tried a few other numbers on my mobile .
neutral	when i phoned the 0000 000000 number the message said the opening_hours on a saturday were 00 : 00 to 00 : 00 .
neutral	so not only did the delivery fail to be made again , i was kept on hold for 0 hours when no one was going to answer the phone .
neutral	i know thursday phone_calls cost £_00 . 00 , i '_ll have to wait to see how much saturday '_s calls came to .
neutral	i suspect another £_00 or so .
neutral	i tried_emailing info_@ dxfreight . co . uk on friday about the initial failed delivery , but have received no response .
neutral	this company should be avoided at all costs .
neutral	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
neutral	update 00 / 00 /_0000 - in response to dx_freight replay :
neutral	hello ,
neutral	as stated previously i have already sent a email to info_@ dxfreight . co . uk on friday and have not received any response .
neutral	giving people a chance to win what can be a huge expenditure for some people
neutral	cleans main floor areas but useless for corners .
neutral	not very robust i managed to break the end plate supporting the roller simply by bumping it on a chair leg .
neutral	being cordless makes it a delight to use and its is quite light .
neutral	however it cannot replace a traditional / dyson_vacuum_cleaner
neutral	can '_t comment .
neutral	no tyres yet - waiting for new date ....
neutral	godt betjente men fa noget at jeg_har_ikke brug for ............ en modem .
neutral	i use simply_supplements because i find their prices for the specific items we use are cheaper_than other_suppliers .
neutral	however , i am irritated by the fussy brochures i keep getting through the post and the unclear way the offers are given .
neutral	in addition , they keep sending me unwanted free_gifts , for example a very cheap - looking diary ( in february - too late !)
neutral	which we will never use and a large bottle of capsules which we do not use or want .
neutral	i do not understand half of their promotional twaddle anyway , so i have no idea if i am missing out on offers and deals which might interest me .
neutral	but their prices are very good .
neutral	i got fat burning stackers n the the 000 thermo pills had some split n the powder out of them is every where but all other stuff i got is in good order many_thanks jamie
neutral	i bought a jacket from this company just because of its cracking low price , however other than the cost of their products i would think_twice before using this company again .
neutral	the service was slow , three_days after_placing my order i phoned their customer service number so i could enquire_about an estimated delivery time .
neutral	i was greeted_by an un helpful and unprofessional gentleman_who was not interested in helping_me .
neutral	it took 00 days from placing the order to receiving the order ... shame :_o (
neutral	some prints were mysteriously left off my print order that i filed on the reception computer .
neutral	the explanation was not very satisfactory .
neutral	it was resolved but would have been a problem if i was on a deadline .
neutral	i have used photoworld for several_years and have been very pleased with the results .
neutral	this year was no exception , but the online software is very limited when compared to the software that used to be available to download .
neutral	my computer is not the newest model and it struggled to run the online software .
neutral	the results are good but dissappointing in comparison to the previous years .
neutral	please bring back the old downloadable_software .
neutral	placed the order for a schuberth helmet and a blue mirror visor - the visor arrived in 0 days .... the helmet was noted as coming from the chichester branch .... after another 0 days there was no sign - a quick call to the customer desk and it was immediatly resolved and dispatched within an_hour .
neutral	so points off for forgeting to send the helmet and for me having to intervene - but happy to give 0_stars as it was very quickly dealt_with and they were genuinely apologetic .
neutral	its not put me off using them again ....
neutral	i ordered some valentines flowers for my wife , to be delivered on valentines_day .
neutral	with the flowers i requested that a message be included .
neutral	the flowers were delivered on the day in question but not the message .
neutral	this site is very useful for comparing fares .
neutral	you can change routes and days without retyping the infomation which does not change .
neutral	i asked for reserved_seats for my first booking .
neutral	i wanted to go from germany to london via eurostar .
neutral	i was sure that eurostar would not let_me board the train without a reserved seat .
neutral	the system would not confirm my booking but warned me that i might see " some activity " on my credit_card !.
neutral	i left the site , checked my email ( nothing from loco0 . com ) and tried again .
neutral	price had gone up 00_euros !
neutral	i rang the enquiry number .
neutral	very helpful response .
neutral	" try without reserving seats ".
neutral	i tried again .
neutral	managed to find out how to cancel request for reserved_seats .
neutral	booking successful .
neutral	electronic ticket received with reserved seat on inter_city and eurostar service .
neutral	includes arrival times and platform numbers for connections in germany and belgium .
neutral	my latest credit_card statement only includes the price of the ticket which arrived .
neutral	new aldi in westbury wiltshire , good value for money , difficult to find items , my pet_hate is children with goodness_knows what on their shoes allowed to stand in trolleys , only been open a week and the empty trolleys full of empty packaging .
neutral	my main complaint is that the shopping was hurled down at us at the checkout , some of it fell on the floor , no offer of a replacement .
neutral	despite complaining the operator continued to ignore our request to slow down .
neutral	economically we have to shop there at_least for a while .
neutral	i think it may be desirable to stop the checkout and request to see the manager .
neutral	the goods purchased were not purchased by clive clarke , who is my partner .
neutral	i purchased them , so what is going on .
neutral	can you tell me
neutral	they have a stupid policy about delivery to addresses other than your credit_card address , which no other supplier bothered with .
neutral	this meant i had to go and pick the thing up for myself .
neutral	all the other bathroom stuff was delivered to work without_any difficulty .
neutral	other than that , they were on time and prompt .
neutral	tempting products are offered online , but only after i '_ve placed my order am i told that they don_'_t have that particular product .
neutral	i feel let_down by this , as i '_m often tempted to place an order because of that product , and then add other stuff on to my order .
neutral	they probably call it smart marketing , or some such .
neutral	pity .
neutral	i really like quidco but lately they seem to be taking a very long time with confirming and paying some of the cashback from certain companies which really needs to be sorted_out , other than that i recommend them to anyone , and do quite often .
neutral	if i have any comment to make about ebay , it '_s that they are forever fiddling - adding new things , changing old things .
neutral	fine , there '_s always room for progress , but in the case of ebay most changes generally seem to be worse than the original .
neutral	despite going through in fine detail my phone order with the assistant , the delivery was not as ordered .
neutral	this has happened with my last 0 orders .
neutral	so much about this company is good : products , pricing , delivery , but i '_ve lost confidence sadly .
neutral	preorders usually arrive a day early , so you don_'_t mind_paying the £ 0 - 0 extra shopto seem to charge for new_releases , however gta_v was released , paid the extra £ 0 over amazon / game etc and the game didn_'_t come early , despite_being emailed saturday stating the order was dispatched .
neutral	i shall order elsewhere in future , get the game early and save the £ 0 - 0 difference .
neutral	the computer itself is all i can of hoped for however , my buying experience was not .
neutral	although i do grant them some grace for it being close to christmas but that does not forgive being given false information no less then three_times .
neutral	i placed my order and was given a timescale for delivery of up to two_weeks .
neutral	as two_weeks approached , i contacted dinopc to find out an approx dispatch time , i was told the following_day and that it would therefore be with me the next working day .
neutral	i arranged for someone to be , and nothing arrived .
neutral	i contacted them again , to be advised that it would now be dispatched the end of that week .... that end of week came and nothing !
neutral	this happened a third time , it was only when i contacted them in writing explaining the three wrongly - advised verbal despatch times was i advised that they were extremely busy and could only promise delivery before_christmas but not an exact when .
neutral	my computer eventually arrived on christmas_eve itself ....
neutral	not only can i not rate their customer service for misleading me three_times on the trot but on two occasions i had to hold for 00_minutes before the phone was answered .
neutral	this has sadly , tarnished my experience of them .
neutral	but as i said at the start of the review , the computer is great .
neutral	i thought it was good service but it took to long i started the application at 0pm and money is still not in acount at 0 . 00am the next_day
neutral	order was completed and dispatched as details were well communicated via e_- mail .
neutral	the let_down was dealing_with dpd who were the courier company ...... hopeless .
neutral	in my opinion a first_class company let_down by their courier company .
neutral	as a result i paid a slight premium for products and went to a local shop to buy supplements .
neutral	the name chosen had a conflict with a similar name already registered but that wasn_'_t evident until i sent an email enquiring why registration was taking so long .
neutral	the purchase experience was easy enough .
neutral	shipping time not bad considering coming from overseas .
neutral	the boots i ordered which are pediwear brand are only okay .
neutral	they look nice and the materials seem pretty good quality , but comfort is definitely lacking .
neutral	i would return them but the very strict return_policy listed ( which i didn_'_t fully read ahead of time - that is stupidity on my part ) and the very high cost of shipping ( wow i had no idea that shipping a shoe box size item to the uk has_gone up to over $ 00us !!)
neutral	made me decide against it .
neutral	i won_'_t be buying from them again though because of these factors .
neutral	when i first used glasses_direct the quality of service was brilliant .
neutral	the best i have received from any retailing website .
neutral	unfortunately , its gone off the boill recently .
neutral	orders are slow to arrive and query emails go_unanswered ... a great pity .
neutral	i purchased a shoulder sling for my mother who is recovering from an accident .
neutral	i paid the additional_cost for a before 0pm delivery .
neutral	this cost being more than the item itself .
neutral	the item was delivered 0 and a half hours late .
neutral	i have mailed 0 times and left a message but i am being completely_ignored .
neutral	at the very least i expect to be refunded the additional_cost for a pre 0pm elsewhere now as once my money was taken that was it .
neutral	update - this has now been resolved to my satisfaction
neutral	quality of mats good but holes don_'_t line up exactly .
neutral	the clips in the holes don_'_t clip on properly so had to use old ones as these work better .
neutral	i didn_'_t complain as i have got them to work ok and price was good anyway .
neutral	the delivery was really fast , however the boxing was badly_damaged , and after i had opened the box , it came apparent that the wood had a bit chipped off , nothing big .
neutral	furthermore , i had witness the delivery man dropped the boxing , i '_m not too sure whether this caused the damage or somewhere_else during dispatch .
neutral	it is a shame , but it isn_'_t a big piece that is damaged .
neutral	would like the one piece to be replaced though .
neutral	gear0music is a great company where i have always purchased my music_equipment from , and will_continue to buy from them in the future .
neutral	as this is the only time i have ever had a problem .
neutral	i ordered this product on friday and received it on monday though should have received it on saturday there was a glitch on the website which i was disappointed about and though the product was good and i thought ordering from website was easy i would recommend the website
neutral	fast delivery and dispatch , would recommend though packaging was not discreet h i hoped it would be .
neutral	product bought was not in plain_packaging with no branding ?
neutral	the product has not lived_up to expectation yet and have not seen results either yet .
neutral	the protein was good as the flavour was great but not enough protein_content was in the protein and the stability ball was disappointing as the ball would not inflate and the ball pump broke which show build quality was not good and a refund or a replacement was not given .
neutral	i know this is a small company , but as i ordered online on christmas day , although i got a confirmation_email automatically , the item didn_'_t get posted until 0th_january as the owner had been away for a few_days
neutral	the only issue i have is the cost of postage_charges , which requires high value orders to make it a viable value for money order .
neutral	chemist_direct should offer more free or low postage offers .
neutral	surely , a postage cost of around £ 0 cannot be justified for a low value order ?
neutral	i had waited 0_weeks for the order to come through and heard_nothing so i used the online_chat_facility , a very usefull_tool .
neutral	i enquired_about my order and was told there was a problem with one of the colour on one of the items and it had been re - ordered .
neutral	i am happy that quality control spotted the mistake but i should have been informed not left_wondering where my order was .
neutral	that aside i was very happy with the enquiry system and the product is great very easy to fit and looks good .
neutral	the design it yourself website is very easy to use .
neutral	i will use the company again and recommend them .
neutral	goods were delivered to the wrong house , about three miles_away .
neutral	fortunately the recipient kindly brought the box round to us .
neutral	the leather pouffe had one minor_defect , a small mark on top but it was not bad enough to be worth the hassle of returning it .
neutral	apart_from that it was of nice quality .
neutral	do not upgrade if you do not need it , they are only trying to get more money out of you .
neutral	excellent service but map and instructions very poor .
neutral	airport compounded confusion with very poor signage .
neutral	i ended_up in the airport fast track area and had to get help from airports car_park personnel .
neutral	they were very helpful and contacted the person_who was to meet and take the car into storage .
neutral	i had printed out the map from my on line booking and gave them it so that they might be able to get the airport management to put up better signs and update the website .
neutral	i had also change the car_registration .
neutral	this was done on line easily , but on my arrival it appeared that the information had not been updated on the paperwork held by the person_who came to meet us .
neutral	again it was easily_rectified but it did give the impression that the process was poorly implemented .
neutral	all this said , ki would certainly use the service again .
neutral	bought item on the 0 / 0 /_0000 by paypal still_waiting on delivery ( 00 / 0 /_0000 ). received items from the states quicker .
neutral	on the good side they have just about everything you would require in stock .
neutral	good price and quick delivery .
neutral	the only bad thing was onebof the costumes was burst at the seam .
neutral	i have been a loyal one . com customer for many_years with a few domains but i am actually considering leaving now .
neutral	basically i was cut_off from all email services without_any notification whatsoever !
neutral	all i did was send 0 emails with 0 spam_emails attached to spamcop .
neutral	spamcop is a great service where they do actually act on unsolicited emails .
neutral	these emails were delivered to my one . com inbox by the one . com email servers .
neutral	when i eventually contacted the live support after several hours messing_around they were pretty rude and tried to insist that i changed every_single email password on every device i had .
neutral	i totally refused to do this and subsequently told to calm down by the operator .
neutral	being patronised by a fairly un - technical_support rep is not what you need or expect !
neutral	they eventually reinstated me and told me to report spams to them which i tried doing and they came back with some very poor support .
neutral	i ended_up configuring my own server to report spams from one . com .
neutral	this entire experience has_been very frustrating indeed .
neutral	to be fair i think one . com do an ok service for a good price but the support is definitely lacking .
neutral	i would only recommend one . com to people who work in it like myself and will not be requiring much if any customer_support .
neutral	now to do some_research to see if there is better out there for a similar price .... gaz
neutral	the order process was very quick and will be having my tyres_fitted tomorrow .
neutral	felt a little_disapointed with the rating when i got the club .
neutral	i have used jam before and had a few problems .
neutral	fist the club was custom bulit and was 0 inch shorter_than standard , that was not mentiond on the web_page .
neutral	this latest club had a 0 rating and i was a little_disapointed with the condition as it was more like a 0_star
neutral	i received emails with the final offer 0 days ago but had to send an email yesterday only to be told they '_ve had to resend the bacs again due to a system problem .
neutral	the money hasn_'_t arrived today so i '_m guessing it will be monday at the earliest now .
neutral	web_page does not describe hinge type .
neutral	spectacles i have ordered had basic type of hinge when arrived .
neutral	i ordered through top_cashback and have not received the promised cashback ..
neutral	i '_m already satisfied with the product i purchased and with the delivery but i had problem with the payment ( i used the usual card i always use to purchase online , but with this company it didn_'_t seem like it was issued in the uk ). i had to call the customer service that in my opinion wasn_'_t the best ... after the call i didn_'_t have clear if my order was going to be processed . i was left waiting and luckily the product arrived few_days after .
neutral	so overall i '_m satisfied with this excerience .
neutral	the experience of parking at edinburgh is perfectly fine and i am aware of the long_stay and short_stay options .
neutral	however , the web_site makes little sense .
neutral	there was no option to select the multi_storey without a fast track option .
neutral	the non - flexible short_stay ticket was £ 0 more_expensive than the flexible one .
neutral	having selected the long_stay option because the short_stay cost was unreasonable i was offered the option of upgrading to short_stay at a price £_00 cheaper_than the original option .
neutral	bought a new guitar £_000 + tried it out in store through cheesy amp , seemed ok but there again when your being starred at across a shop most things will be ok ., didn_'_t have the exact_model dispite the site advising otherwise , and frequent emails anyway , it was never setup , and has since gone back to the manufacturer ( 0 hour round_trip to the store , emailed manufacturer , told them tale of woe , told me to send it to them ) to have a volume pot replaced , input jack sorted ( nut fell_off ) and hopefully the action sorted , fret_buzz when fretted on 0nd fret a and e strings , provided me with wrong box in which to carry it home in , ( display_model ) too much_trouble to find the original , and the usb_cable and instructions were missing so i had to call back in .
neutral	but on a plus i did get a new set of strings , whoopie !
neutral	so its up to you as i say plenty of choice but customer service / satisfaction isn_'_t a high priority , and make_sure you get the right carton or cartons there usually double_boxed just_incase you need to send it back .
neutral	" it could be you ".
neutral	i ordered some flyers when i found this site as they have some really nice designs for you to customise .
neutral	i feel that the flyers are very expensive compared to other printers but it does include their " ready made " designs so offsets the price of paying for separate design work .
neutral	overall i think they offer reasonable value if you need some quick flyers , but repeat_orders could end up costing far too much for my liking .
neutral	i ordered a product in a particular colour and size .
neutral	i got the size wrong , which is my fault , but the product that arrived was the wrong_colour .
neutral	sweatband gave_me a partial_refund , and didn_'_t cover the cost of my return postage .
neutral	i can understand this if size was the only problem and that was my fault , but the colour was their fault , so i think they could at_least have given me a full_refund , even if not covering my return postage cost .
neutral	apart_from that customer_services were quick responding and helpful and ordering and speed of delivery was good .
neutral	i felt that the quick and slick delivery and keen_pricing was part of always_riding ' mantra ', unfortunately slow delivery of the maglia rosa book ordered , meant a late birthday_present
neutral	shame about the time of the delivery ( 00 : 00hrs ish_) but otherwise a pretty good service .
neutral	i was impressed by the ease of use of the web_site plus the constant_updates on delivery status were very reassuring .
neutral	however , the flowers themselves were a little disappointing .
neutral	a number of the cream coloured roses were tinged with brown and the freesias only lasted a day .
neutral	i bought a eyebrow trimmer from chemist_direct .
neutral	i was happy with the time it took to deliver .
neutral	the product itself did the job but the shave could be closer .
neutral	trimmer doesn_'_t hurt and is a decent price .
neutral	expensive to deliver to shetland as most couriers are a lot cheeper .
neutral	your stall need to explane more accurately about items .
neutral	but very fraindly staff .
neutral	thanks
neutral	admittedly my order was placed just as stanford hall weekend began but i needed my parts that week to affect repairs to my bus .
neutral	when the parcel did arrive it was missing 0 out the 0 items i ordered !
neutral	i have received exceptional service in the past and so can only believe that this was an unfortunate blip .
neutral	postage_charges especially to ireland are very high .
neutral	very good and friendly service
neutral	just , 0 next_day delivery split into 0 at delivery .
neutral	needed additional time off to retrieve the additional delivery .
neutral	part of the delivery cost has_been refunded .
neutral	sorry but my purchase has not been delivered yet so i cannot write a review !
neutral	recieved our order within two_days .
neutral	however was very dissapointed as one of the mascarade masks was damaged , due to poor packing .
neutral	customer_services were helpful but still had to take the time to pack it up and send it back before getting a replacement .
neutral	of which im still_waiting .
neutral	we are looking_forward to useing your masks on our special cruise on cunard .
neutral	reasonable service apart_from the fact that no instruction_manual was enclosed with the drums .
neutral	prompt response to emails and an instructions manual was sent as an attachment .
neutral	although reasonably_priced and the usual selection of products on offer , would think_twice about ordering from iflorist because the website was painfully_slow .
neutral	each_step seemed to take for ever .
neutral	almost gave up but persevered .
neutral	helpful advice from o0 shop in seeking mobile_phone tariff reduction based on review of my usage history .
neutral	the value for money ratio is quite good .
neutral	however , the food quality doesn_'_t seem to be the best .
neutral	glad , it all got resolved in the end and i have received my refund .
neutral	james thanks for your assistance .
neutral	i have bought sapphire r0 000x toxic graphics_card which turned_out to be faulty and produce artefacts in vision .
neutral	00 days after i have received the card i have raised an rma with them and had to pay the delivery from my pocket .
neutral	the rma takes 00 working_days and i have found out that other owners of the same graphics_card globally are also experiencing the same issue and rma / replacement didn_'_t actually resolve the problem .
neutral	i '_ve been on the phone with overclockers rma representative yesterday and asked if the replacement / repair won_'_t resolve the issue if i can get my money back and he replied that they will have to keep sending the card back to the manufacturer for another replacement / repair until it gets resolved because i '_m with 0 days late for refund .
neutral	if i got back to them 0 months or a year later i understand but 0 days past the 00 day window is unfair ...... completely_ignoring the fact if the goods have been sold as faulty , not fit for purpose that i have the right for a refund if they don_'_t meet these criteria .
neutral	not good !
neutral	!
neutral	made one order but payment taken 0 times
neutral	got a great xmas waistcoat , lovely material and fits well but ; i ordered the matching bowtie with it .
neutral	i phoned the company and asked if they would both get to me in time for the function i was attending .
neutral	i was assured that there was no problem .
neutral	the waistcoat arrived without the bow_tie .
neutral	i phoned again and was assured again it would all be with me in time for the do .
neutral	guess_what : no bow_tie .
neutral	the function is now past and i am still_waiting .
neutral	order made 0 / 00 /_0000 it is now 00 / 00 /_0000
neutral	first of all specialtech seem to be decent but il go over pros and cons
neutral	pros_:
neutral	items arrive as_described and working .
neutral	customer_support is friendly
neutral	cons_:
neutral	delivery time :
neutral	much slower compared to the speedy 00hour courier from scan
neutral	communication :
neutral	aftersale delivery communiction is non_existent unless you request it ( scan . co . uk '_s courier is fantastic for communication )
neutral	packaging :
neutral	i recently had a large expensive order delivered in shocking packaging .
neutral	all my items were just lying lose in the box with very little foam protection or equivilent ( god_knows_how nothing was damaged )
neutral	verdict_:
neutral	will i buy from specialtech uk again ?
neutral	not until they sort_out the cons iv mentioned as many other_companies including scan do not suffer from these .
neutral	i will however keep a close eye on specialtech for improvements as they are far from the terrible company but until then i think i '_ll need to stick with scan
neutral	great service but the delivery wasn_'_t quite next_day despite ordering before 0pm .
neutral	hi ,
neutral	really happy with purchases , delivery of 0 - 0 days which i paid a premium for didn_'_t quite happen - i ordered weds_evening and received goods on the following_tuesday .
neutral	i dropped you a line to prompt you to get my order to the courier as i could see from your tracking devices that this wasn_'_t happening at which time i highlighted my desire to receive the goods by monday - didn_'_t quite happen , close but no cigar !
neutral	won_'_t put me off future_purchases , i '_ll just stick to the standard delivery though .
neutral	cheers , scott
neutral	good villas , but local rep service could be warmer / more client oriented
neutral	the furniture was great but we ended_up with the wardrobe left in the lounge because the delivery drivers couldn_'_t take it up the stairs because of health and safety !!!
neutral	as a result we had to put ourselves in great danger and take it up ourselves .
neutral	the salesmen really need to tell you more about what the delivery drivers will and wont do and give you the chance to go away and measure up before you buy
neutral	i placed my order and paid straight_away using paypal .
neutral	got an order acknowledgement saying " due to sale launch your order may take 0 - 0 days to be delivered " i also got several emails chasing me to provide account details .
neutral	then nothing .
neutral	after six days , i sent an email asking when my shoes would be despatched , as no activity showing on the account that i had been encouraged to open .
neutral	no reply .
neutral	fearing i would not receive them in time for my holiday , i phoned and was told that there was a delay due to the success of the sale .
neutral	but less_than an_hour later , " hey_presto !"
neutral	instant reaction , emails of despatch and anticipated delivery .
neutral	delivery was then as smooth as clockwork .
neutral	but i wonder_if i would still be waiting if i hadn_'_t made a fuss .
neutral	ordered a sample_tile and it arrived in good time but broken .
neutral	puts me off placing a full order .
neutral	the bar_stools i ordered were good value but the whole_process is slow and a bit irregular .
neutral	first , i was asked to provide a copy of my credit_card statement , in case mine was a stolen card , which delayed the process of my order and is just strange .
neutral	then i was told my order would be shipped the next_day but it wasn_'_t until a week_later , when i enquired if my order had shipped , that dhl picked it up .
neutral	now , i am still_waiting for it ( 0 days_later ) to even leave dhl '_s pick - up hub for their their export hub .
neutral	a very slow process in all .
neutral	no_problems ordering or communication but a delivery time of 00 days from order was too slow
neutral	average quality glasses at an average price supplied in an average time .
neutral	we had a quick_turnaround on the trampoline order but the courier sent one of the 0 boxes to the wrong depot .
neutral	after a number of phone_calls we had some great help from the customer service staff but i did have to go to citylink and collect the package myself as we couldn_'_t wait_until after the bank_holiday for delivery .
neutral	one box was broken but all parts were still intact .
neutral	i bought 0kg premium protein pro xl last_week . cannot see any difference . im a beginner who started weight_training 0_weeks_ago . i ll comment on what the taste , texture , quality is like below .
neutral	taste - to drink is very hard . im use to bulkpowder non grainy whey . i do 000ml water and 00g of this protein . its very powdery and grainy in the mouth . aftertaste is not so good . i take a sip of squash straight after .
neutral	texture - viscosity or the thickness isn_'_t great as bulk_powder products . as its the only other brand i ve tried .
neutral	quality - again not very good .
neutral	conclusion - im going to finish the 0kg i bought or my wife would go mad .. proper mad , as it cost money . since its end of the 0st week . cannot actually see any difference . i ve worked out every other day without failure , and taken around 000g - 000g everyday .
neutral	nutritional contents - its protein value ( per000g ) is high compared to lot of other brands . this is why i bought it . cheap for lot of protein per_serving . do i recommend it , not if your use to good stuff . taste is not nice . does it make my muscle lean and bigger , may be , not yet . will let you know after 0 - 0_weeks .
neutral	ordered light for the fridge .
neutral	gave the correct fridge number but unfortunately the wrong bulb was sent .
neutral	this did not fit the fridge at all .
neutral	contacted
neutral	partmaster and they asked for additional fridge number information but i had given it the first time .
neutral	they were good enough to say they would refund the money i had paid , but how do i get a bulb that will fit the fridge ?
neutral	love the site , shame they dropped cpc , used to spend loads with them so not getting as much cashback as i used too .
neutral	would of been five_stars , but dropped a popular site
neutral	although i got £_000 for my iphone , they tried to give me £_00 by telling_me it had a fault , even_though i had bubble_wrapped it .
neutral	i phoned them up and said that there wasnt a fault so they ' re - tested ' it and surprisingly there was indeed no faults and i got my full_amount of money .
neutral	so if they try this on you , be sure to phone them up .
neutral	they dont want to loose custom !
neutral	my review is based on four " repeat " orders for large_landscape photobooks over a period of 00 - 00 months .
neutral	each photobook was 00 + pages of premium photo_paper .
neutral	each repeat order was for two copies .
neutral	i give them away as presents but always retain a copy for comparison until the next batch arrives .
neutral	my problem is with cewe '_s quality control .
neutral	two batchs always differ in brightness and colour .
neutral	in terms of brightness , the difference can be as much as +/- 0 / 0 stop equivalent in exposure compensation , and in terms of colour the difference can be almost between setting camera to vivid and neutral .
neutral	looking at each book in isolation is not too bad but the differences are very evident when under comparison .
neutral	each book cost well over £_00 so it is rather disappointing .
neutral	their turn_round is fairly quick and customer service helpfull .
neutral	i guess they are ok for family / holiday snapshot photobooks , but if you are a keen_photographer and want your treasured images to be best presented in photobook form ... then look_elsewhere .
neutral	ok service but quoted higher price than advertised on website .
neutral	howver on checking i was sold pedal at the lower price .
neutral	nice packaging but not so sure about dpd delivery service
neutral	this is a good site but at times over complicated and difficult to find what you are looking for
neutral	i ordered a samsung monitor from pixmania and although the monitor is great and i had no_problems with delivery etc , the power_lead was european and , like other_reviewers on here , am miffed that i am ordering on a uk site that is actually not uk .
neutral	this company is only going one way and , unfortunately , it is receivership , so beware .
neutral	we fly premium_economy and feel the level of service has deterioated over the last few_years
neutral	white bed came packaged in red plastic , which stained the bed .
neutral	had to be exchanged .
neutral	the new bed was also poorly_packaged with damage to the side .
neutral	i just gave up and excepted it .
neutral	all staff very nice and efficient .
neutral	just poor packaging of beds
neutral	a very fast service , the reliability is questionable as the anti_fraud system asked me for information i wasn_'_t prepared to give them .
neutral	but i would give them 0 / 00 as it was quickly mitigated .
neutral	i was happy with service etc but the flowers don_'_t look fully like the picture .
neutral	still happy lovely_flowers and i would order again .
neutral	enough said
neutral	the gear was good but the delivery has put me off
neutral	my wife and i are in generally good health , but both have prior medical_conditions , which inevitably complicate travel_insurance .
neutral	multitrip wasn_'_t on which ?
neutral	'_s new list of recommended insurers , but we got a quote from them as we had insured with them last_year .
neutral	it proved so_far as we could see the best deal , so we went with them ( though i still resented having to pay premium rates for four long calls to an 0000 and an 0000 telephone_number : nothing prevents them from using an 00 or 00 number , after all – there '_s a whiff of ryanair about it ).
neutral	i thought the experience more laborious than it needed to be .
neutral	you seem to be asked effectively to pay a separate premium for separate insurance to multitrip for the basic insurance , and to a different firm , osg medical_screening , for prior conditions – though i was assured that if it ever came to a claim there would be only one single procedure .
neutral	as usual , the clerk handling the prior conditions assessment was not technically expert , just filling in a form , and it was hard to work out the logic of the form – if a condition had been corrected by treatment it was sometimes regarded as a continuing risk and sometimes not – so it wasn_'_t easy to make_sure that you were making a full disclosure , and i wasn_'_t sure at the end of it whether i was actually being charged more than once for the same condition .
neutral	on the plus_side , the staff were consistently patient , sensible and courteous , and this made the whole_process a huge_amount less frustrating than it might have been .
neutral	we have not yet suffered any insured event ( and with luck will not ), so i cannot_comment on the claims_procedure .
neutral	i like this website
neutral	in general not a bad_experience , the problem i had was when the web booking site crashed on me , then had to wait two hours before i could try and book again .
neutral	but it all worked well in the end .
neutral	i booked through holiday_autos and received a confirmation_email with link to e document .
neutral	i was unfortunately unaware that i would need a internet_connection to open the e document and was therefor unable to find the name of my car_rental company when i arrived in new_york .
neutral	after long_queues and many phone_calls home i managed to retrieve details from family who logged_onto may email at home .
neutral	i approached avis front_desk for the second time after the first time they turned me away after_searching my name incorrectly and provided them with the reservation number .
neutral	they did not inform_me of the many tolls i would drive through or the option of a toll card which would have been very convenient .
neutral	i was also given a very small car - fiesta - when i booked a salon model .
neutral	ordering from the champagne company was mostly as it should be - straight_forward , and with the goods arriving just when they said they would .
neutral	i liked the fact that the shipping company sent text_messages specifying when the package will arrive .
neutral	the only thing i have misgivings about is the fact that you can '_t order without setting_up an account with the champagne company - that '_s yet another account and another place who stores personal_data for which i don_'_t really see a business - critical reason .
neutral	yes , it may make it simpler to code the ordering system that way , but it seems in no way necessary .
neutral	i found the experience a bit frustrating as i am not really that good with the internet .
neutral	once our bank in the uk was contacted , i assumed that the transfer would be made straight_away .
neutral	however , it was not until i had contacted currency direct in spain a few_times that we were informed that they had no details of where to send the money !
neutral	surely this should have been done over the phone and not over the internet for security_reasons , but it appears that this was the only way in which to get the details of our bank in spaiin to currency direct .
neutral	i am not sure that i would like to use this company again .
neutral	i was made to feel stupid not knowing the system .
neutral	the above_says it all , flowers are fantastic and good value for money .
neutral	delivery was shocking , i was concerned the flowers were being delivered by yodel who from experience are men in vans who i '_ve seen toss boxes about when looking for an item being delivered to me .
neutral	when i received the delivery notification it stated the flowers had been left in a secure_location - this was incorrect , the had been left on an unmanned desk in the building lobby ( they are for my wife as a thank_you as she '_s looking after me as i have two broken legs and can '_t get about ), she works at a business that shares a building with a number of others .
neutral	it was only luck that a colleague of my wife saw the box on their way going home for the weekend and was ' nosy ' enough to see who it was for that meant the delivery was taken up one flight of stairs to my wife who hadn_'_t finished for the weekend (!
neutral	), rather_than someone_else taking them or worse still the flowers being left over the weekend in a box wasting away .
neutral	the delivery driver did have the decency to leave a couriers delivery card with the flowers but didn_'_t have the sense ( or no pen ) to fill the card in at all ( or to use the contact number provided ).
neutral	in summary - fantastic flowers but terrible delivery process and i won_'_t be using serenata_flowers again due to their use of yodel .
neutral	binder slightly faulty but still acceptible .
neutral	i ordered 0 ultra_thin magnets which would have fitted in an envelope for the price of a stamp which i could have got the next_day via_royal_mail but instead i had to wait a few_days and got charged £ 0 . 00 for postage and when it arrived it was in a huge cardboard envelope that would hold a yearly calender .
neutral	i live in england .
neutral	my order was processed quickly through sip '_s system .
neutral	then became very slow according to the tracking_system , ie ; it took several days to leave the supplier , then several more before it showed to be in the uk .
neutral	then only 0 day from uk import to arrival at my house .
neutral	so .
neutral	the uk transport was as it should be , the german transport was very slow .
neutral	good product , processed efficiently until the carrier received it , then the parcel crawled through their hands .
neutral	the product arrived within 00_hours , - excellent !
neutral	the product was advertised as 00kg roll 00 m x 0 m mineral roofing_felt for sheds .
neutral	i . e .
neutral	0 kg per square meter .
neutral	i had two rolls and both rolls only weigh 00_kg each .
neutral	so , unless they are only 0 . 0 meters long each then the specification quoted is not correct .
neutral	but they have lost the original reason they set it up in the first place .
neutral	no they are just trying to rule the internet , mobile ...
neutral	turning into another tesco .
neutral	good experience ordering , and communications were good up until delivery .
neutral	then it went_downhill with messages not passed between made and the delivery company .
neutral	product arrived and it '_s ok . quite average craftsmanship .
neutral	the tiles are perfect - fantastic value , and a great product .
neutral	the delivery not so good .
neutral	£_00 delivery charge for our order and they don_'_t even deliver to your flat .
neutral	driver told us they can '_t even go up steps , leaving us with hundreds of kilos of tiles on the floor outside our apartment building .
neutral	not so classy , guys .
neutral	this service would be the best if there shops were more friendlier , every one in our area are so ignorant and make you feel terrible for dropping your parcel off a big letdown
neutral	im on 0mb connection however the connection is sooo slow , im hard_wired and i have problems with my iphone , laptop and xbox speed .
neutral	ordered vici waterfall mounted basin_mixer , poor chrome_finish with brown spots ( looks_like rust ) and staining .
neutral	called better_bathrooms to arrange replacement and this is where the customer service is nothing more than average .
neutral	i was informed to take a photo of the imperfections and email to them , anyone who has tried to take a photo of a mirror finish will know this is virtually_impossible .
neutral	0 . 0 hours_later i followed up on my query and was then informed that i now have to wait up to 00_hours for their assessment team to decide_whether they agree with me about the imperfections .
neutral	i am not sure why this takes so long ( unless they have a lot of customer returns to process ) before they will consider a replacement .
neutral	as a customer i expect to be taken on face value and not have to jump_through_hoops where goods are supplied to an unsatisfactory standard .
neutral	better_bathrooms need to improve their own internal quality standard checks ( see below ) prior to dispatching goods and not place the oneous on their customer .
neutral	the fault would have easily been identiifed through a full and proper visual examination prior to dispatch .
neutral	0 . 0 before any of our products are loaded_onto our delivery vehicles and leave our premises to be delivered to you , we undertake a quality control check which consists of a visual examination of the product and preparation of a quality control report .
neutral	update_: replacement goods sent within 00_hours .
neutral	subsequently found faceplate for tap would not align to holes so going back again and this time for a refund .
neutral	also grub screws were missing .
neutral	game was only shipped out 0 days before release day .
neutral	was suppose to be hear yesterday and still isn_'_t here .
neutral	it might have something to due with where i live though .
neutral	the times before they have delivered on time or a day early .
neutral	i was a little disappointed with the service i received !
neutral	i opted to use a german supplier for my givi tanklock tankbag and ' pay more ' because of previous experience with german suppliers on higher end products .
neutral	i received confirmation of order then nothing for over a week when i was told that due to stock_levels there would be s delay .
neutral	no details of how long the delay would be so i requested some indication and mentioned cancellation as i had an imminent european trip planned and wanted the item before i went .
neutral	the item was shipped shortly_thereafter and was received within a few_days .
neutral	i wasn_'_t overly worried_about the delay and would '_ve been less nervous if they had updated me about stocks earlier .
neutral	a simple ' we acknowledge your order and would advise that we currently have no stock but a delivery is expected next week ! '
neutral	would have left me more relaxed .
neutral	geoff t
neutral	ok , so the ordering_process was easy and the confirmation e_- mail came through very promptly .
neutral	i was particularly_impressed with the dispatch_notification early on the first working day after the order was placed .
neutral	sadly that '_s where things started to fall_apart .
neutral	i had paid for priority delivery and when it became_clear the item was going to be late , i tried to reply to one of the e_- mails containing the text " please feel free to reply to this e_- mail , we ' re always happy to help ".
neutral	within_seconds , i received an auto - reply_stating that i had sent a message to an unattended mailbox .
neutral	tried a different e_- mail address and received and auto reply suggesting i call in office hours .
neutral	in their_defence , i did receive a reply to this e_- mail fairly early the following_morning .
neutral	the reply stated that the parcel was with the couriers - this is a whole seven_days after i ' d received the dispatch_notification , but it did apologise for delivery taking longer_than usual .
neutral	the parcel arrived the following_day .
neutral	at no point was a refund offered for the priority delivery that was so blatantly flouted .
neutral	recommendations : get a different courier - don_'_t tell your customers to reply to an e_- mail address that you ' re not watching - set your customers ' expectations when something is going to be late .
neutral	these_guys had everything i needed , more or less at the best prices & their staff were friendly & knowledgeable .
neutral	but on both_occasions of using abbey , my order was held up because of a small item i didn_'_t really need & i received no notification of the delay .
neutral	if i had known the item was out of stock , i wouldn_'_t have ordered it .
neutral	it took 0_weeks to get my first order because of a felling wedge & 0 week for the second order because of sharpening kit ( after i called in , they upgraded the kit for free & got the order out a day later ).
neutral	my final issue is with them using city_link , the notoriously bad couriers .
neutral	i will use abbey again , but not for something i want in a hurry .
neutral	abbey , if you improve your feed_back , stock notifications , couriers & add a next_day option , you would get 0_stars from me .
neutral	avis rental car in carcassonne is in a decayed area of the station with a tattered banner .
neutral	it was tricky to locate .
neutral	customer service was excellent however which mitigated somewhat the first impression of avis .
neutral	the car itself was fine and we had no_problems .
neutral	returning the car was tricky as the office was unattended at 0am despite the hours being stated as opening at 0 . 00 .
neutral	there was a sign in english directing us to drop the keys off at the sncf information desk but this too was unattended .
neutral	we asked at the ticket office what to do and were directed to another office which didn_'_t seem to exist .
neutral	on returning to the avis office , we found it had opened and so were able to complete the paperwork quickly .
neutral	this situation would have been difficult if we had a tight timetable and seemed less_than the class of service which avis generally suggests it offers to customers .
neutral	sales knew the product from my description without a photo .
neutral	it '_s a shame that the delivery company you use delivered it to the right number wrong street .
neutral	it '_s never happened before in the 00 years i '_ve lived here so it was carelessness on the driver '_s behalf .
neutral	luckily the owner of the other house knew me and hand delivered the product .
neutral	excellent delivery service and not too badly priced item if it did everything it said it does .
neutral	i was a bit disappointed with though with the showroom_shine car polish i received it does a great job on paintwork and windows but no good on all the black wheel_arch trims , bumpers , mirrors all the black_plastic , it did not do anything but leave white faded looking trims , bumpers etc no matter_how many_times it was applied .
neutral	i was hoping to have one product that could do everything as it said but this part let it down i had to purchase another polish type for the bumpers and trims .
neutral	not sure if i would purchase this again will see how it goes using this car polish as there are cheaper polishes that do the same job on the paintwork .
neutral	good service but watch the aftersale tactics
neutral	... was called on the guise of checking details
neutral	of address etc , dispite the fact that i had emailed this info , before i new it they had casually organised 0 years insurance , had to be insistant in saying no .
neutral	the trip on the ferry / cruiser was great , plenty of places to eat , the rooms are fine and staff are awesome .
neutral	after dinner there was some entertainment - a cover band and a guy on piano - the guy on piano was fun but the band was a little bland and we got bored pretty quick ...
neutral	there was little else to do , very likely because it was mid - week so we weren_'_t too bothered , but will just be prepared with some dvds next time : d
neutral	also everything you pay for - cocktail , dinner , sausage roll , whatever - if you pay by card you '_ll get asked every time to add a gratuity ...
neutral	i felt bad constantly pressing no because there was not really any reason to pay extra , so that got a little annoying that it was asked for every time ...
neutral	but overall , everything was smooth , communication was good and we departed and arrived on time ...
neutral	got a good and varied range of price / goods the only_downside was 0 - 0 telephone_calls which i don_'_t want
neutral	good service but my original booking was not carried_out and was put bqck a day , not great when you need to go xmas shopping . should have got a discount or a credit for future tyres
neutral	received a voice_mail from complete_care shop management shortly_after my feedback and initial 0_star .
neutral	solely based on the voice_mail , decided to change to **** 0 . 0_stars ****
neutral	voice_mail :
neutral	management apologised for delay , didnt make any excuses etc and agreed it was a fair feedback , showed understanding , gave assurances for future orders , and shared company plans to upgrade stock system etc , said " the company has_grown faster_than_expected , and at present working on putting systems in place to improve stock information , and other intended packages ".
neutral	the fact management took time out and called to discuss the order and delay issues i think shows genuine commitment , care , and strive to taking positive / proactive steps forward .
neutral	really hope this company does well , just a few things to iron out !
neutral	all the best !
neutral	p . s .
neutral	a good measure of a company is how they go about fixing any_problems , complaints , etc - happy to say complete_care shop have done well in this .
neutral	......................................................................................................
neutral	initial review see below
neutral	......................................................................................................
neutral	very disappointed : 0_weeks - no delivery & no communication !!
neutral	!
neutral	it '_s been 0_weeks almost since i placed my order , and no delivery !!!
neutral	and absolutely no communication !!!
neutral	from complete_care shop .
neutral	quite surprised and shocked !
neutral	as its been the longest i have to ever wait for an order , and in which the seller has made no effort to contact , call , email , etc regarding why the order has not been delivered or why there is a such a big delay !!
neutral	!
neutral	each time ive called complete_care shop there '_s been a clear sense of dont care and dont want to help attitude / demeanor by the staff !!!
neutral	dont understand_why the staff are so dismissive and unhelpful !!!
neutral	are you under - staffed ?
neutral	or do you need to re - train staff !
neutral	my order was for several products ( was considering repeat_orders , but thinking twice_now ) and one reason i choose complete_care shop over other_sellers was for its fast delivery , hence the reliability that comes from that , which we all need and look for when we shop on - line , especially when its to do with care and the need for products asap !!!
neutral	but ive not received this basic reliability , even after highlighting the problem and calling numerous_times .
neutral	staff say they '_ll call back ( as theyre not sure why the order has not been sent ) and never call back !!
neutral	!
neutral	and to date no help and no clear explanation , no communication , no calls etc , as to why the order has not been processed and sent !!
neutral	!
neutral	again very disappointed !!
neutral	!
neutral	this has left us in a difficult situation , where we need the products and are struggling without them , and at the same time we cant order from another place as we '_ve purchased from complete_care shop .
neutral	still_awaiting a reply from complete_care shop ...!!
neutral	!
neutral	......................................................................................................
neutral	to the management of complete_care shop : its ironic that you have a good website as in the products and prices , but there '_s clear problems with the management of orders , stock_availability system , dispatch , and customer service .
neutral	are you understaffed ?
neutral	if so , please get more staff , or if staff need training then please book that in , and have a workable stock_availability system that is accurate , and a system by which each order is dealt_with promptly / accordingly - no matter what !!!
neutral	there '_s no excuse when your running a business !
neutral	and dont just leave it and do nothing about it !!!
neutral	who does that ??
neutral	?
neutral	please get it right , as i would like to order again .
neutral	however for reasons of unreliability , needless hassle , and being rudely dismissed ( whether intended or not , under - staffed or not ), people will go to other_companies , good people too - from people with regular needs / regular customers , to people telling others by word of mouth etc ( every customer should be important to you - they are your bread and butter ).
neutral	customers will go_elsewhere even if it means others are more_expensive .
neutral	the price isnt everything !
neutral	reliability , customer service , and customer value is very important too .
neutral	finally wheres the care ?, surely if your running a ' care business ', in the ' care sector ', you should have / show ( through actions ) care towards your customers / their needs !!
neutral	!
neutral	i '_ve purchased suits in store and the customer service and quality has_been fantastic .
neutral	when purchasing on - line however , the customer service is non_existent .
neutral	phoning the customer service team over a period of three_days led to no response .
neutral	only when i put my issue on the public profile of their facebook_page did i get a response .
neutral	the clothing is of good quality , there is no issue there .
neutral	i just wish they would actually have a customer service team you could instantly get hold of .
neutral	i am a regular customer on bulkpowders .
neutral	reently i needed to add some scoops with my protein order ( 0 bags of proteon and a bag of creatine ).
neutral	it wasnt until immediately after that id forgot to order scoops .
neutral	i contacted bulkpowders immediately after and they said ( abruptly ), no you '_ll have to put another separate order in .
neutral	i offered to pay via card and extra for postage ... they are so light and would go in a jiffy_bag .
neutral	for the amount if money i have spent its left a sour_taste and ill probably look_elsewhere for my next order .
neutral	bought a lot from you in the past and have been very pleased with the products , delivery and customer service .
neutral	this time i bought it by clicking_through_topcashback but for some reason the order hasn_'_t been picked_up so i am having to go through the laborius process of claiming the discount - not impressed although i '_m hoping its an_oversight and nothing more .
neutral	i made an order this morning and was very impressed when i recieved an e_- mail to say that my flowers had been delivered .
neutral	i then phone the recipient and found that they had not been delivered at all .
neutral	i then spoke to your online_chat_feature and the person_who was " helping " me was rather rude , gave_me a vague response and cut me off .
neutral	so , not only do i feel as though you have lied to me about the delivery ( i assume the florist clicked " delivered " to improve their stats with your site ), i also feel as though your support person was rude when i tried to follow_up .
neutral	overall , not a great experience .
neutral	i placed my order on june 00 full of anticipation of receiving my print promptly !
neutral	i noticed i had used billing_address instead of new address ( i was in process of moving ) so i emailed to ask if new address could be serviced , after no reply i repeated this 0 times !
neutral	having still had no reply i called and managed to speak to an operative who changed the address for me and assured me delivery would be by end if the week .
neutral	this didn_'_t happen unfortunately so after another call i finally received my print on july 0 , 0_weeks after_placing order !
neutral	the print however is terrific just a pity the customer experience was not !
neutral	web_site is a bit_slow compared to amazon but ok experience .
neutral	nectar_points make the difference
neutral	mats received for 0000 ford_fiesta which are good quality & received very promptly .
neutral	unfortunately the distance_between the fixing_holes in the drivers_mat did not match the distance_between the studs in the car .
neutral	there is a difference of about 0cm .
neutral	this involved a great deal of fiddleing with the studs to get the mat to fit .
neutral	i don_` t know if the mats were for a different model of fiesta or just bad production .
neutral	long_queue at palma_airport , waited over 00_minutes at goldstar .
neutral	by the time we got to desk , they had to upgraded us from ka to focus , as had run out of cars .
neutral	they then charged e000 for fuel ( full_tank , return empty ) plus e00 for comprehensive insurance , all plus 0 % currency_conversion_rate to £'_s .
neutral	thought i had full cover , but it is only third_party / fire / theft .
neutral	not aware of conversion as they only handed_over documents after the credit_card was charged .
neutral	car was damaged , but they assured us this was covered by the insurance .
neutral	have taken photos of damages just in case .
neutral	be careful on return to palma_airport on the motorway , as the traffic signs on slip road are hidden , and you will have to make a trip back at next exit .
neutral	just as i expected , nothing too fancy but not too bad either .
neutral	did the job and for a a cheap flight and i had a great holiday .
neutral	first things first , physioroom delivered my kinesio_tape on time and with no_hassle and i was more than happy with their service .
neutral	the issue i have is with the actual tape ; it doesn_'_t stick well at all , which fairly defeats the purpose .
neutral	whilst it was the cheapest tape on the website , it certainly hasn_'_t been value for money as it began to peel away from my shoulder almost_immediately after application .
neutral	physioroom were great , this product wasn_'_t - i guess you get what you pay for , and i ' d definitely recommend getting something a little more_expensive , but far more cost_effective in the future !
neutral	when they are good they are very , very good , when they are bad they are awful .
neutral	when the motorised gate kit arrived a part was broken and some small parts were missing .
neutral	the replacement unit was received next_day but the missing parts did not .
neutral	by way of compensation a pair of remote_control units was received .
neutral	fine .
neutral	i had problems getting the gates to operate .
neutral	rang the company , they said they would ring me back .
neutral	guess_what ?
neutral	this happened several_times .
neutral	i eventually worked out how to bypass their system and when i managed to speak to a humanoid their service was impeccable .
neutral	the gates are now working fine but it was an uphill struggle .
neutral	n . b .
neutral	one of the gate arms had obviously been used before .
neutral	purchased socket rails -- good quality shelley product , but cost half as much of purchase price on delivery !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a calendar , some prints , and a small photobook , all at the same time because i thought i could reduce the postage_costs that way ( my mistake - although actually jessops ' mistake ).
neutral	i spent two hours carefully assembling the material ready to finish the order when i got called away to something urgent mid - morning .
neutral	when i came back all the work i ' d done was lost , to my utter fury .
neutral	anyway , i got over this , did it all again and submitted the orders .
neutral	these were promptly processed and i was pleased with the finished results .
neutral	good product , reasonable speed , acceptable price .
neutral	no packaging or seal leaves me sceptical_about whether or not genuine product .
neutral	happy but not impressed enough to add to favourites .
neutral	full of spyware even when it says it is not .
neutral	the price including delivery was the best that i could_find anywhere for my savage gear dropshot rod ( which i highly_recommend ).
neutral	i received a phone_call the day after_placing my order to say that the rod in stock was damaged but i was assured that i would receive my newly ordered rod by the end of the following week at the latest which i was still happy to wait for and i did appreciate the phone_call to let_me know .
neutral	the downside was that the rod didn_'_t arrive in the time that was promised and it was quite some time after when it did eventually arrive .
neutral	when the rod did eventually come in to stock the actually delivery side was very good as i received an email to let_me know that it would be delivered the following_day and i was given a number to check with the delivery company so that i could get a time as well .
neutral	overall it would have to be price that bought me back as after_reading other comments i suspect that many more_expensive items that are advertised as in stock are actually only ordered from the suppliers after receiving payment from the buyer .. maybe i '_m wrong but it seems that many other buyers have had a similar experience .
neutral	personally , if i was told at the start that the items would be ordered in and that it would be about a month before delivery but the price was good then i would probably still buy quite happily as i would have known from the start before ordering but to be assured of one thing and then for it not to happen rather damages my future trust .
neutral	i ordered two identical items - one worked and one did not .
neutral	having to pay to return the faulty item to france is not acceptable .
neutral	the purchase of my outfit was easy and arrived quickly but the outfit , which was lace up at the front wasn_'_t stitched properly and was not secure even before i put it on .
neutral	if it weren_'_t for needing it the next again day i would of sent it back .
neutral	treated_myself to a business class seat from arlanda to heathrow .
neutral	the business lounge was very bland .
neutral	boarding the aircraft , i found two children sat in my seat , asked them to move , to which a very rude father replied that i should seat where the children should be sitting .
neutral	the cabin_crew did nothing to resolve the situation , so i was left sitting in the wrong seat .
neutral	polite cabin_crew otherwise but bland food .
neutral	on time .
neutral	i had a great experience on the website and found it really easy to use .
neutral	the delivery came on time and all was well i thought .
neutral	sadly , my jacket had a few ' snags ' in the material and the jacket button fell_off within an_hour of my wearing it !
neutral	haven_'_t sent it back yet but will be .
neutral	will give them a second chance to get it right .
neutral	i have had a mixed experience using your service over the past year , as the heading states the service is often let_down severely by 0 company in particular ( green 0 )
neutral	missed_collections seem to be the norm for this company .
neutral	i like the booking and tracking and after a year i '_m still using the service , so generally i '_m happy
neutral	i '_ve_used cyberpower a number of times and each time seems to get slower unless you pay extra for various delivery speed upgrades .
neutral	one of the two front usb isn_'_t working .
neutral	but apart_from that the pc is quiet and the price was right .
neutral	the product was as_described but over a week from order befor shiped and then only sent by normal mail .
neutral	i have when been a customer of t - mobile been unfortunate to have received poor coverage on my mobile , however with the recent merging of signals with orange then this could really improve their total coverage throughout the uk >
neutral	i have been using google from the beginning .
neutral	i have no doubt that this is the best search_engine around .
neutral	however with time i am finding it to become more and more intrusive .
neutral	the way the pages take longer to load and from the contents of the advertisements you wonder what kind of data are being collected .
neutral	the ordered key was received within two_days which was very good .
neutral	however , i was sent was a key blank , i . e .
neutral	the key had not been cut so was of no use to me .
neutral	the ordering system was good and the price was right . the goods were satisfactory and as stated . but to offer 0 day special delivery over the christmas and new year period was a bit misleading . i was charged extra for it of course but was happy to pay if it could be done .
neutral	when some of the 0 days were bank_holidays or weekends or the busiest shopping days in the year , you may have had your doubts and you would have been right .
neutral	there was no apology no explanation and no refund . it took almost a week instead of 0 days .
neutral	the lesson is , as always , don_'_t promise a service you cannot
neutral	complete .
neutral	topcashback appears to have better rates than [_external_reference_].
neutral	however , [_external_reference_] pay our automatically which makes_life a lot simpler
neutral	did the job but prices not the cheapest !
neutral	the trip itself was smooth enough , but the boat feels old and less enjoyable than the p_& o ferries crossing the channel .
neutral	also , while on - board it is always nice to spend some time on retail therapy , but with the high prices on your boats , it is hardly enjoyable .
neutral	i took a business flight from amsterdam to edinburgh , a pilot was stiing at the middle seat , which should be empty , made the journey unpleasant .
neutral	they could not deliver products as they promosed .
neutral	i requested compensation from them , rudely rejected .
neutral	quidco is worth using for most of the offers / cashback available .
neutral	sometimes items booked or paid for especially on expedia have never shown on my activity .
neutral	but when they work payment has_been 0 - 0 months its nice to get cash_back .
neutral	placed an order online , stated in stock , but it was not .
neutral	this mouse was not as it appeared in the advert , it was so small .
neutral	the seller , however , dispatched the item immediately , and it was received in a reasonable time .
neutral	that was fine , but i wasn_'_t happy with the mouse .
neutral	not a great price paid , but everything_went fairly smoothly .
neutral	very pushy to get the phone off me once i ' d agreed to sell it .
neutral	car eventually ok wanted me to have a miicra i said i had booked 0 doors offered focus sized vehicle at extra_charge .
neutral	eventually got peugeot_000 diesel at no extra_charge and was a diesel , good in ireland where diesel cheaper_than unleaded .
neutral	car very good
neutral	i called on three occasions to make enquiries about accessibility at the property we were interested in booking , and on each_occasion i didn_'_t receive a call back , or email from blue_chip which given other reviews was quite disappointing .
neutral	my partner eventually called , as i was unsure if it was me personally they were not wishing to deal with and was advised that they had returned our calls , but unfortunately they had been calling the property we we ' re looking to book and leaving messages on their answer phone .
neutral	we eventually got to make our booking , but due to the delays with blue_chip holidays coming_back to us , it was not the week we we ' re originally looking to book , and it additionally cost us more .
neutral	the accommodation does look brilliant though , and the staff on the phone have always been polite - just some additional care around call_backs would be appreciated !
neutral	finding a product that i liked was easy .
neutral	service , delivery and answers to queries were very good .
neutral	however the fittings for the trim and having no post caps were disappointing .
neutral	the screws that hold the supports for the trim should have round heads as the countersunk ones screw through the slots , i had to use metal collars to keep the supports in place .
neutral	the sticky pads on the end of the supports are useless and i had to buy suitable replacements .
neutral	the lack of post caps to finish off the shower_unit was a sad omission .
neutral	it was o . k .
neutral	some_confusion in the beginning because the instructions on the paperwork said go to the pick_up point , which i did .
neutral	after sitting there for around 00_minutes i got a phone_call asking me where i was and to say i needed to be at the drop of point as they were not allowed into the pickup_point any longer .
neutral	it cost me £ 0 . 00p to get out of the parking zone .
neutral	a bit frustrating when i got back because i phoned in whilst i was waiitng for my luggage and was told to phone back when i had it .
neutral	tried twice and got a recorded ' it was not possible to connect my call '.
neutral	tried three_times out on the concourse before i got an answer .
neutral	i was disapointed when the site said the product was out of stock , however , ordered anyway .
neutral	was surprised to find out my product was in stock , and it got delivered within 0 days .
neutral	not quite pleased , but satidfied .
neutral	the adidas supernova pro sunglasses were in perfect_condition .
neutral	the prescription inlay has a minor imperfection on the bottom of one lense , which hopefully will not become a crack .
neutral	this lense also does not sit quite right .
neutral	the right - side lense is snug against the main lense , but the right - side sits up a little and brushes my eyelashes .
neutral	other than that my only complaint is that the glasses are advertised as having a quick - change lense system , which they don_'_t .
neutral	a screw - driver is required to change these lenses and the lense is an all - in - one wrap around .
neutral	the quick change lenses are individual and push in and out of the frame .
neutral	found using transferwise a very confusing experience .
neutral	never sure what rate i ' d get or when it would be delivered and constant_stream of e_- mails saying one thing and then the opposite .
neutral	not sure i ' d recomend them to friends .
neutral	i have ordered in the past and after two orders having fraud charges following them i decided not to order from this site anymore .
neutral	one thing however , their prices are the best around and that comes in handy when needing to support ones fitness habits .
neutral	plus they beat_competitors prices which is always a benefit .
neutral	one detractor is the shipping cost but when you use the thanks0 coupon_code it basically discounts the shipping to what you might pay with other_sites .
neutral	im giving a neutral review as for right now due to anticipating another possible fraud charge which i hope doesnt_happen a third time ..
neutral	i enjoy shopping the large selections and the insane discounts i just cant seem to get my head around the fraud purchases me and my friends have received so this is only to be aware of the possibility of it happening to all the customers out there .
neutral	please call the customer service line to report any fraud so they can immediately jump on it .
neutral	they cant fix it and find the problem if no one speaks up .
neutral	overall i like this company will update my review at a later date .
neutral	as a 0st time leasing i didn_'_t know what to expect .
neutral	upon placing order i was asked to change my preferred colour as it would take a longer delivery time , i was then given three choices and told the car was in the compound and would be delivered to me in 00 days .
neutral	just under six_weeks_later and after a lot of chasing on my part we did finally get the vehicle ( yesterday ).
neutral	really pleased with the car it '_s just such a shame that promises were continually broken and that i had to do all the chasing continually .
neutral	i even emailed to raise my concerns of my continual issues to glenn and i never once received an acknowledgement or a reply from him which was very disappointing .
neutral	i will be looking to lease again at the end of this term , but i '_m not sure if i would use nationwide again it did leave me with a bit of a headache and to be honest i was very surprised the vehicle arrived on time yesterday as i had lost all confidence in the company , but it was delivered perfectly and on time , the delivery guy was very friendly too .
neutral	once nationwide becomes more honest with the customers and informs them of realistic timescales i think it could be a great company to arrange car lease with .
neutral	no - one in their right mind is going to buy 0 prascend tablet at 00pence !
neutral	your site completely fails to offer them in whatever options of pack - size there are ; and i was obliged to ring in ......
neutral	i had a 000_gram parcel shipped to ireland by royal_mail .
neutral	it cost 00 pounds !
neutral	what a rip_off .
neutral	it should have cost 0 pounds max .
neutral	a great site for newbies with lots of free money and rewards availible .
neutral	more experienced players that don_'_t wager huge_amounts will be disappointed at the lack of rewards .
neutral	i am a competent_diyer but took me 0 days to assemble and instructions were poor .
neutral	had to contact the guy via the exit_barrier ... who asked for my booking_reference ... just as well i had hung on to it or it was £_000 or no car ... my be a problem that needs to get sorted ...
neutral	yes branding is important but really posting out your orders in bright_orange bags stamped with superdry at xmas !?
neutral	do you not think lots of your items are brought as presents , there go all the xmas_present surprises in our house .
neutral	if you need an mot you cant do better_than to use autotyres .
neutral	but only if you have bloody good tyres !
neutral	i would say , its the cheapest buy , and knowing what you buy works , but when i bought it i tried the ps0 and switched it on , but the controller kept blinking and didn_'_t work properly , as it had a faulty usb connection .
neutral	but be as i said be more cautious check the description 000_% and check you have understood the description before buying and if possible if there is a cash_generator store nearby check the ps0_console and see if everything works at the store . then you will know alot more then a description on the internet or give them a call .
neutral	... still to see how it pans out .
neutral	sas are probably the most punctual airline i fly with , but this comes at a cost , the service is very expensive , there seems to be no limit to how much they charge on some routes , the price for an economy return ticket from manchester to stockholm can be as high as £_000 during busy weeks , meaning i often use lufthansa via frankfurt instead even_though this service is a lot more inconvenient and very prone to long delays .
neutral	service on - board is hit and miss , the cabin is not always cleaned_properly ( dirty tray - tables eww ...) and the food can be a bit mediocre considering it '_s price .
neutral	on the plus_side , ground services are excellent , they have fast track security in most airports , the sas lounges are normally quite nice and checkin is always quick and efficient .
neutral	they are very good at recognizing their frequent flyers - upgrades are frequent on busy flights and when flights get canceled due to fog , storms , volcanoes etc .
neutral	they do a good job of making_sure their frequent customers get priority on waitlists .
neutral	the costumes were ok . quality a left a bit to be desired as did the actual manufacture quality .
neutral	i had to pull apart bits and re - stitch as it was done so badly .
neutral	they did however serve a purpose and others liked them , as did we .
neutral	order process and delivery was good ; products not brilliant .
neutral	the photos are significantly better that the reality , but all in all ok ( that '_s a lower case ok ).
neutral	i '_m basing this on a few purchases made over the last few_years .
neutral	generally , the prices are pretty good on expansys , offering cheaper_alternatives to expensive branded products .
neutral	the delivery is actually pretty good and i have had no issues there .
neutral	i have two main things to complain_about .
neutral	firstly , they send a lot of marketing emails ( an email every 0 - 0 days ).
neutral	i would prefer if they had a more intelligent system , whereby they sent me specific offers i would be interested in .
neutral	my second complaint is about the lightning to 00 - pin adapter i bought - i know trustpilot isn_'_t generally for product reviews , but this was an expansys branded product so i feel it is justified .
neutral	the product description showed the same features as the standard apple adapter - support for charging , sync , analog audio , usb audio , and yet the product did not work as designed with a docking_station or fm_transmitter .
neutral	i am still_awaiting a response from expansys on this , after which i may update this review .
neutral	ordering online was much_easier , especially with available sizes .
neutral	however , there are a few improvements i would suggest :
neutral	0 .
neutral	some of the imagery is not sufficient for you to see the product .
neutral	it was only because i had been in store that i knew what the product actually looked like .
neutral	for example , with the occasion suits , you are offered things like shirts on the same page , with no detailed images of the shirts being worn without the suit jacket .
neutral	0 .
neutral	the navigation on the site looks good , but makes it difficult to see the difference_between certain products .
neutral	it '_s a pain to have to go through various frames of what is effectively a flash banner just to get to the correct product .
neutral	great for mindless browsing , not so good for finding what you want .
neutral	0 .
neutral	charging shipping on a £_000 order is a bit_cheeky .
neutral	from all the online shopping i have done , i have found even where shipping isn_'_t free ( it normally is ), it is at_least free for higher value orders ( e . g .
neutral	over £_00 or over £_000 ).
neutral	0 .
neutral	while i like the idea of not being charged for your product until you are happy with it , it makes the ordering_process confusing .
neutral	it also tries to lure you into subscribing to the magazine without making recurring charges clear .
neutral	also , there seems to be no option to pay the amount straight_away - it seems you need to wait for a statement .
neutral	i guess you are working on the fact that people may forget to pay for their goods , allowing you to charge interest ?
neutral	quality of the products were good .
neutral	shipping was on time so no_complaints on that side .
neutral	i do get a lot of emails from groupon ( at_least 0 a day , sometimes up to 0 ).
neutral	i think their emails should be more targeted and specific .
neutral	i don_'_t want to have to sift_through tens of offers to find the ones most suited to me .
neutral	surely you can ask for more information in the user profile and then choose offers accordingly ?
neutral	on a more positive_note , the offers are usually pretty good .
neutral	i '_ve taken_advantage of a couple of them .
neutral	i haven_'_t received the device yet .
neutral	recorded delivery that i wasn_'_t able to receive .
neutral	the local royal_mail depot opens 0 hours a day , 00 - 00 .
neutral	i will get it eventually but it eats into the 0 day return window .
neutral	flores de alta calidad y belleza .
neutral	el_precio es adecuado a la_calidad del producto pero el factor sorpresa de algunos envios es altamente mejorable en mi opinion
neutral	that is what was said in about 0 cases and only twice did they . i felt we had to do all the chasing as are new nissan was due on a monday but made several phone_calls then found out it was delayed . ah well we got it and are pleased with the car at_least .
neutral	quoted me a price online , refrained from answering any of my questions .
neutral	meh , may as well , i thought .
neutral	sent in my phone and they decide it was faulty ( but wouldn_'_t say what was wrong ) and offered me sixty pounds less_than the quote .
neutral	again , they didn_'_t reply to any of my questions .
neutral	took their money anyway , as it was going to be a massive hassle getting the phone returned to me .
neutral	as i said in the review instructions on how to remove the draws would be very welcome and a little more luster on the product would improve the appearance
neutral	great service and perfect flowers , however specified free delivery on the website yet i was charged a delivery fee of £ 0 . 00 even more anoying is my mum could of picked them up they are only around the corner
neutral	no student support whatsoever , no clear tab on what homework is and when it is due .
neutral	the homework was given at the end of each lesson , but it would be better if it was inlcluded on a homework tab and you could upload it there to .
neutral	teacher was good , but regularly turned_up late .
neutral	there was alot of stuff i did not understand and there is nothing to understand and learn , its just listen and move on .
neutral	the fees were reaosnable for an arabic course .
neutral	please imporve on the above points .
neutral	i would still recomment though but you wil need personal determination to learn .
neutral	the product was perfect and as_described , what you would expect from north_face , however the delivery from parcelforce was poor , as the company sent it on a 00 hour delivery , i ordered on a wednesday and it arrived on monday !
neutral	poor delivery , you should use next_day as standard at the very least .
neutral	i purchased 0 tickets for the wales v italy game , but in two different transactions .
neutral	first transaction of 0 tickets , of which were £_00 in face value , a total of £_000 , i was charged £_000 . 00 .
neutral	second transaction of 0 tickets with a face value of £_00 , total £_00 , i was charged £_000 . 00 .
neutral	in total i paid £_000 . 00 for tickets with a total face value of £_000
neutral	i would have expected a charge for posting and such , but to pay £_000 extra is a joke .
neutral	please could you explain to me your costings , and if this is correct .
neutral	we '_ve purchased an entire bathroom for our new property and whilst it looks great , the plumber has had major problems with the poor quality plumbing fittings provided .
neutral	in short , we '_ve probably spent another £_00 on better fittings , plus still have a problem with the concealed toilet_cistern which leaks , as the fittings don_'_t form a good seal and they ' re a non standard size , so grad to replace .
neutral	unlikely to use vp again !
neutral	all items received quickly and as_described .
neutral	i ordered two toys and a graco car_seat .
neutral	the car_seat box was heavily water_damaged to the point that the entire seat fell out of the box when the delivery guy moved it from the van to the front_door .
neutral	i ' d say it '_s possible it happened while with them but the two toys i ordered were stuffed inside the packaging of the damaged supposedly sealed car_seat .
neutral	luckily the seat had a plastic cover over most of it .
neutral	not exactly 0st_class delivery .
neutral	never_heard of not supplying fittings with a handle of any sort .
neutral	sorry but most disappointed
neutral	well we got to the airport they forgot us and we didnt have no tranfers even no we paid for them after number of calls they arranged a taxi for us .
neutral	got in the villa really nice but had a problem with cockroaches .
neutral	then on our return home they for got us again and was 0 / 0 late picking us up for our tranfers .
neutral	flowers great , but would have thought ordering 00_hours earlier would have given an earlier delivery ?
neutral	flowers not delivered until around 0pm when birthday almost over !
neutral	i know you can pay extra to get earlier delivery , but hey being on limited funds and trying to make some ones day i couldn_'_t make paying extra for delivery a priority , but flowers good !
neutral	!
neutral	i good service from them but when i opened my box the one item was split_open and all the contents over the box so not too happy .
neutral	we bought 0 chairs in store back on january 00th and were astounded to be told that they would be delivered on march 00nd .
neutral	i questioned this as 0 ) it seemed astounding that we should have to wait so long , and , 0 ) how did they know that it would be that exact day ?
neutral	did they keep them in a special locked cupboard and only get them out the day before ?
neutral	we were told - yes , that is definite .
neutral	we were also charged extra for a saturday delivery - £ 0 i think it was !
neutral	if that is all is costs , next , throw it in for free - i was spending £_000 !
neutral	away we went .
neutral	a letter was received dated 0 march telling us that due to delays with suppliers ( what else ?
neutral	try to be a bit specific and what penalty do the suppliers suffer ?)
neutral	the date was now april 00nd .
neutral	hang on - 0 months ?
neutral	i could get a house built in that time !
neutral	there was a premium_rate ( 00p_per_minute on 0 ) number to call for further information .
neutral	so i used saynoto0000 and rang 0000 0000000 .
neutral	the computers were down and they knew nothing .
neutral	they rang back .
neutral	" the letter is wrong !
neutral	both chairs are in !
neutral	can we deliver on march 00th ?"
neutral	we said yes and they arrived yesterday .
neutral	questions - what was the letter for ?
neutral	does the left hand know what the right is doing ?
neutral	what is the point of a customer service department with no working computers ?
neutral	how often do your suppliers let you down ?
neutral	why do you charge £ 0 delivery when the poor customer is spending over £_000 and then charge for the customer to ring you ... on your request ?
neutral	what about compensation for us changing our calendar twice for your convenience ?
neutral	next - nasty , inefficient and penny - pinching .
neutral	oh , and one of the chairs feels totally different to the sample in the store ... delivery men were great , though .
neutral	guy in the shop was not - we felt that we were privileged to be served by him .
neutral	and he doesn_'_t understand the deliver process .
neutral	i wasn_'_t sure whether or not anything was happening with my order .
neutral	a few_days after_placing it i went to the website to see if there was some sort of checking facility .
neutral	it was marked ' despatched ' so that '_s how i knew that it was on the way .
neutral	item is a christmas_present so can '_t comment on that !
neutral	emballage à revoir , les différents objets étaient libres dans_le carton , ainsi un livre peu s ' abîmer en contact d ' une boite en bois lorsque la caisse est transportée dans tous_les sens pendant l ' acheminement .
neutral	d ' autres vendeurs internet fixent l ' ensemble des objets pour éviter des déteriorations .
neutral	i had to call the office as my internet was playing up .
neutral	a really nice lady on the end of the phone was most helpful .
neutral	quick delivery was made , shame about the oil slick that was left on the drive , delivery was made when i was out .
neutral	0_stars for the customer service on the phone .
neutral	none for the delivery driver , hence 0_stars
neutral	was happy with the service provided .
neutral	i have used this company many_times , the items i have ordered have arrived quickly but packaging can be lacking .
neutral	my most_recent order i specified a day for delivery because i wasn_'_t in , but the package turned_up in less_than 00hrs .
neutral	impressive speed but not much good if your not in .
neutral	luckily a family_member was at home at the time of delivery .
neutral	the item i had ordered arrived in a robust box but was far to big and had no packaging to stop it rolling around .
neutral	again i was lucky the manufacture had done a better job with its own packaging so the item arrived in good condition .
neutral	in general the company are fast and cheap but dont always follow delivery instructions .
neutral	packaging can arrive well boxed but on occasions like my last order in a big empty box left to rattle around .
neutral	good value and service but hiring a car in key west with minimal mileage driven makes it appear a rip_off to have to pay for a full_tank of petrol and get no credit for the half tank i returned .
neutral	it would have been cheaper for me if i could have filled up the tank before returning .
neutral	this spoiled the experience .
neutral	i paid extra for two day delivery .
neutral	delivery took four days and the promised emails concerning date and time of delivery were not sent to me .
neutral	the packing note that came with the delivery implies that the paid for two day delivery had not actually been implemented .
neutral	the bird_box was of poor quality and had some damage .
neutral	an very similar item could be purchased elsewhere for a much_lower price .
neutral	the camera mounting_bracket will need to be removed before the camera can be fitted to the bird_box .
neutral	the impression is given that this is just a set of items designed and intended for other purposes being collected together and advertised as something else .
neutral	further to the above apparently negative_comments : an unsolicited refund of the additional postage_charges has_been received .
neutral	the camera has_been installed in a bird_box without too much difficulty - it was necessary to remove the mounting_bracket , mount the bracket onto the underside of the bird_box roof piece , then reattach the camera and fit the roof piece .
neutral	it was purchased as a birthday_present for my wife .
neutral	she is really delighted with it and all that is needed now are some birds !
neutral	good site and prices and free delivery but although i have only ordered 0 items on different dates each time its been out of stock and taken a long time to arrive .
neutral	in a nutshell probably not the best site to use if you need your items quickly .
neutral	made a booking and was satisfied until i noticed same hotel and same board on same dates for £_00 less , i had to cancel original booking and rebook manually .
neutral	alpha_rooms should have a price guarantee like others were the price will be lowered if the hotel operates a cheaper offer at any time prior to departure .
neutral	other than that it was fairly_straightforward and good value .
neutral	most transactions go through with no_problems but i have had 0 experiences where the clicks have failed and no matter_how much you try and have it out with customer_support , and back it up with times and dates , they just refuse to pay out ...
neutral	it is wildly frustrating and time_consuming ...
neutral	delivery men were quick , but chose not to wear boot covers in our new home .
neutral	all other delivery companies have been diligent enough to put them on and take off when entering and exiting the house .
neutral	no damage to furniture which was good , but package had boot marks where table had been walked on .
neutral	box was torn exposing the underside of the table so no damage was by luck rather_than anything_else .
neutral	i received this order very fast and when i wasn_'_t sure i liked it they let_me send it back for a replacement .
neutral	i sent the item back saturday_afternoon and had the new pair of sunglasses in my hand by tuesday_morning .
neutral	however , email and chat customer service seems a bit lacking and the website had problems which required me to phone to place an order .
neutral	also , the price of items went up significantly over the course of just a couple days .
neutral	ordered garmin_edge 000 performance bundle .
neutral	opened the box to find heart_rate monitor , speed / cadence_sensor and outfront mount were not there .
neutral	rung handtec and they apologised saying they would send the items and they should be with me on saturday or monday .
neutral	its now monday_night and still not received the rest of my order .
neutral	disappointing .
neutral	i like the products .
neutral	lets_hope the shipping has gotten better then the reviews let on .
neutral	on the whole there is a great range of products and the quality is great .
neutral	i love the wasitcoat i purchased
neutral	it would be great if there was more choice on contemparary looks .
neutral	i would prefer to have a slim cut shirt for example .
neutral	unfortunately there was not much in stock for this type of shirt
neutral	i prepaid my booking at edinburgh_airport some weeks before , the signposting on entry could have been better , however , on exiting , the display displayed that i was due £_00 .
neutral	00 .
neutral	i had to find a staff_member to find instructions on how to leave the car_park .
neutral	usually good service but in this instance i was sent the wrong jeans and the returns process resulted_in a refund rather_than resending the correct pair , which where now out of stock .
neutral	despite it showing " in stock " when i ordered , it was out of stock when they processed my order and that delay in sourcing more from supplier meant it arrived after i left for my holiday .
neutral	so i had a beach holiday without the sunglasses i had paid for
neutral	i found that three had a decent price for the iphone .
neutral	however the reception isn_'_t great in all areas .
neutral	the online billing services is fairly good .
neutral	overall a good service let_down by the network_coverage .
neutral	this is a difficult one to write as it '_s the first time we used this service , but overall the staff were very friendly and quick to respond , unfortunately there was number of issues , we have not seen the flowers , as they were delivered to the funeral_directors when we couldn_'_t attend , but the picture on the web_site was brilliant , and caught our eye instantly , we had never seen such a powerful vibrant look , and the price was good , we can only hope to get there in time to see them in person before its to late .
neutral	now the issues , to start with there was a lot of confusion_over the " card " they showed at the start of the order process , which turns_out to be a full on card that you would give a person , this really needs to be clarified , we thought it was the card that went with the flowers ( the traditional one people read on the flowers in a plastic_envelope ), but they were quick to respond so we could remove the " card " we thought was for that and start again , but it was the only mention of any sort of card we saw through the entire order process .
neutral	next was the message that goes on the flowers card we thought it was originally , we were told it could be added at the end of the order process , we saw no such option , we did see an option to edit the " card " we originally mistook for this , but that was all , if it was there it needs to be made clearer , so we contacted them asking for this message to be added , as we were not able during the order process , they were quick to reply and happy to forward our message to be added .
neutral	but when the flowers got to the funeral_directors it had no message , even_though it was supposed to of been added , but the funeral_directors asked for us to be told there was no message , and for us to ring them to get it added by them , and to their credit they did this , and we were able to have the funeral director add the message that should have been there , so it all got sorted in the end , but it was more troublesome than it could \ should have been , a simple rectification on the web_site ordering procedure would make these kinds of issues disappear , and make the entire_process easier than we found and experienced .
neutral	so long_story_short , very friendly and fast responses , but the web_site order process needs a revamp to make such things much clearer , we would probably use again , but would cancel if we ended_up in the same situation again .
neutral	i have been with bt for many_years and although i had little problems with them , i find that it becomes more trouble when you are calling them .
neutral	you really need to be patient , and i am not that patient , as i hate to go through telephone systems , hence my 0_stars !
neutral	it feels good to be able to express ourselves sometimes !
neutral	nevertheless , their products are generally quality !
neutral	first time order and delivery .
neutral	content especially easter feaster good quality and value .
neutral	however one box was damaged and contents all three appeared to have been packed quickly without thought to presentation .
neutral	it would not take much more time and packaging to have an excellent product .
neutral	my idea was in future to send gift boxes directly to friends and family as delivery was very good - but would not because opening of box was a disappointment .
neutral	if items had labels facing outwards ( and packets not squashed ) when box was opened all contents would be directly on show it would have been a far better experience
neutral	although the website indicated that my chosen tyres would be available the next_day , i chose the day after .
neutral	however , when kwik - fit called me it was not to confirm my chosen timeslot , but to say the tyres would not be available until another day later , because they had to be ordered .
neutral	so i '_m not really sure why the website said they were available for next - day mobile fitting .
neutral	all that being said , the fitter rang 00_mins before arriving to say he was on his way and then completed the job ( fitting two new tyres ) speedily and with no_fuss .
neutral	found the blade unlock very hard to use and am still trying to find saw as advertised .
neutral	friendly quick service .
neutral	no_hassle
neutral	ordering was simply , delivery was speedy and on time .
neutral	build quality could have been better base was out of square i had to true it up and trim the board ends , both side_panels where build poorly with un even overhang for joints .
neutral	the window was very poorly built and had to be replaced .
neutral	although the price may seem cheep the build quality can be maintained , regardless of this i would probably purchase again .
neutral	expensive , but a quality product which copes very well with fine wires , which cheaper products don_'_t .
neutral	disappointed with the undocumented delay in fulfilling the order .
neutral	i '_ve bought from tyre_shopper before , finding they offered the best prices .
neutral	this time i phoned the nominated fitting_centre to confirm the time only to find they had no record !
neutral	the fitting_centre contacted tyre_shopper who apparently said that the chosen tyres were not available after all and that they ' d tried to phone me .
neutral	( oh_yeah ?)
neutral	anyway , it worked out ok .
neutral	i got a pair of better tyres at the same price as an_apology .
neutral	but if the site says they '_ve got the tyres and takes your money , it '_s not very good when they later say , " whoops !
neutral	we don_'_t have them after all ".
neutral	sadly the article purchased was too big and , notwithstanding total honest on my part , i was flatly_refused any assistance with a replacement of the correct_size .
neutral	the lights seem very good quality , but i didn_'_t order the plugs ... and i remember seeing a reminder on your order form but that felt_like it was you trying to sell me soomething ( like an extra 0 year_warranty for a tv in comet ) and i blanked over it ...
neutral	avoid any form of excess baggage - these gezzers will charge on all fronts - extra pieces and additional weight ...
neutral	sixty pounds for an 00 day stay in little more than a field plus a further one pound to drop or pick_up your luggage is a bit rich in current_climate .
neutral	stop sending me emails
neutral	told when ordered it would be 0_weeks but it did take 0 , they did send some bike lube and jellies with the order though .
neutral	i have given them 0_stars as i would hope if i order something else it would be a lot slicker service
neutral	as above , would have been 0_stars if there hadn_'_t been a mix_up with the order , and i had to reorder , staff very friendly and helpful via e_- mail .
neutral	overclockers are local to myself , so i often refer to their website and check their prices .
neutral	they are a little more_expensive than my usual suppliers , but it '_s not the price that puts me off .
neutral	the few_times i '_ve visited the shop i '_ve been greeted with queues and at_least one unhappy customer who has travelled for miles to be fobbed of on a technicality with a faulty item .
neutral	others i know in the trade have had similar_experiences .
neutral	personally , everything i '_ve purchased from them has worked_perfectly , but it does make one worry to hear such stories .
neutral	it '_s useful to have nearby for emergencies , but price and reputation keep the stars low !
neutral	i rang up to ask if the control mechanism was stuck in .
neutral	i run a property_maintenance business and have used your company many_times
neutral	unfortunately they often pack their products to tightly and the smaller product becomes crushed .
neutral	stopped using them for food - only prescriptions now .
neutral	customer_services not great - no one seems motivated to want to help .
neutral	lot '_s of better options on the internet
neutral	i have always found that lidl have been good for people that like to shop for food & a few extra bits here & there on a budget there selection of meat it quite good ( in packets ofc ) and being a single guy with not that much time on his hands that suits be just fine .
neutral	the offers they have from time to time are good also but you always find that the stores near you either arnt running the offer or never get alot in of the products on offer .
neutral	either way im happy with shopping at lidl its shopping @ a budget with some nice products for the price .
neutral	not overly happy with some of the flowers , they are wilted already , not a brilliant sight !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	ordered online for a great price .
neutral	notified of a wednesday delivery the previous night .
neutral	got a voicemail during the day to say driver had broken down and was returning to birmingham , new delivery date friday .
neutral	had to chase on friday only to be told delivery now saturday - not good when you ' re without a washing_machine .
neutral	when finally received , great product
neutral	i put in a small order as i had not used this seed_bank before , but had heard good things about them .
neutral	i contacted them after having only a 00_% germination_rate , and they were courteous and very quick to respond .
neutral	while they were unable to replace the failed seeds , they did offer extra freebies were i to make another order .
neutral	therefore my 0_star_rating is not pointed at their behaviour - rather the quality of the seeds that i received .
neutral	i filled in the details of the parcel : dimensions and weight ( 0kg ) and clicked the find results button .
neutral	nothing appeared to happen .
neutral	tried several_times and then happened to scroll_down to the bottom of the page and found several offers but none taking into account the weight of my parcel .
neutral	although there were no instructions ( that i could see ) to select a specific courier , i did eventually find the bdrop down box at the top of the page with a list of couriers .
neutral	i chose hermes , but they appeared not to deliver anything above 0kg .
neutral	at_least the results indicated that .
neutral	i then tried collect_+ plus with better luck , and went with them .
neutral	so in the end i got there but it was a struggle ( for a normally capable and experienced surfer !).
neutral	i had to ship another parcel a few_days_later and went straight to the collect_+ plus website and bypassed myparceldelivery . com .
neutral	it seemed a lot simpler .
neutral	i think a fdew tweeks to the website could improve the experience and opportunity to find a cost_effective courier , a lot .
neutral	this could have been a good experience but my new tyres did not arrive at the fitting garage at the time requested .
neutral	they had 0 days to get them there , it wasn_'_t as if it was tomorrow !
neutral	this meant an extra journey into_town with all that entails ( traffic / lost personal time etc ).
neutral	the garage were very apologetic but it wasn_'_t their fault .
neutral	even after a protracted trial it was impossible to read using these glasses .
neutral	the lenses had differing positions through which to look for either eye to be in focus .
neutral	i do not have a strong prescription and both eyes are the same prescription for reading - it should have been relatively simple to get these right first time , however they were so bad i was not inclined to give them a second chance .
neutral	a shame because the price , speed of delivery and communication was excellent .
neutral	to their credit they do have an excellent money - back guarantee !
neutral	sds turned_out to be out of stock of the finish style for my item but emailed me immediately with this so i could proceed with something similar which came quickly .
neutral	i had seen that item on another website which in the end would have been cheaper .
neutral	their p_&_p was about £ 0 first_class post sds site said postage free until you got the order half placed when they added double the other site .
neutral	i continued to save time but for a letterbox item was the wrong choice as the courier needed the tiny item signing for .
neutral	sure their tracking website let_me choose a neighbour for delivery but it was actually left with another , unnecessary minor nuisance .
neutral	lovely clothes for children and women , if a little overpriced .
neutral	mens range is awful though .
neutral	a great idea , however , every time i visit this site i never manage to find a hotel or holiday that is any cheaper_than usual ?
neutral	good package holidays , more destinations would be nice though .
neutral	unfortunately , they have had to lose 0 marks .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i didn_'_t get the exact item i ordered .
neutral	i ordered a brigestone potenza re000 a0 ( bmw ) tyre .
neutral	i got a brigestone potenza re000 a ( bmw ).
neutral	now , i am unsure what the exact difference is between the 0 tyres but i wanted to keep all the tyres exactly the same as the original that were on the car and at the end of the day it is a different tyre .
neutral	0 .
neutral	the delivery time was longer_than_expected .
neutral	the tyre took an extra 0 days to be delivered .
neutral	i appreciate that their courier is to blame for this and in some respects this may outside their control .
neutral	in fairness , the company were extremely good at chasing up their couriers and keeping_me informed that it was delayed and did keep me informed when the tyre was actually delivered to the garage so i cannot_fault their customer service .
neutral	i would suggest you review your communication strategy and process for once someone buys from your site .
neutral	there is no system to log in and gain updates of your purchase nor any emails saying your purchase is in the warehouse or ready to be dispatched .
neutral	i phoned customer_services 0 days after purchase to gain an update on my purchase and was dealt_with extremely efficiently and politely .
neutral	i can not fault your customer service team or the delivery , however your communication strategy and process is poor , thus the three stars .
neutral	i hope this feedback is useful
neutral	nigel
neutral	item arrived quickly and price was acceptable
neutral	order tok rather longer to arrive than i expected based on what was said on website .. was moved to priority after i spoke to someone on live_chat .
neutral	when it arrived it was well_packed and there was no damage but windows 0 would not load after several_attempts so i had to do a clean install . since then things have been fine .
neutral	i love trains and always look for a train alternative to flying .
neutral	in the past i '_ve found renfe and sncf sites tricky .
neutral	loco0 was simple and booking 0 trains from france through spain was easy .
neutral	i had been booking flights and car_hire at the time and just didn_'_t think about the confirmation_email from loco0 .
neutral	so when i came to printing everything out 0 months later ready for the journey it was a panic to find the rail_tickets .
neutral	i eventually tracked them down via my credit_card company to loco0 ( to be honest i couldn_'_t remember whether i ' d used raileurope , sncf or renfe .
neutral	i called loco0 and it transpired that gmail was binning a lot of emails from loco0 .. and my email address was stored with a spelling_mistake .
neutral	the guy at loco0 was very efficient and within_seconds my details were updated and the email and tickets came through .
neutral	i would use loco0 again but just need to be a bit sharper .
neutral	very disappointed with promised delivery date ,
neutral	treated_like an_idiot when dates were missed ,
neutral	however the deal was excellent and with some help from the supplying dealer all turned_out well if 0_weeks late ,
neutral	would i use them again ?
neutral	only if they commit in writing to a fixed delivery date
neutral	doors arrived as requested which cheered our builder up .
neutral	however , the finish was not as good as we had expected with variation in colour and the seals around the windows of variable finish and quite rough in places .
neutral	time will tell how they really are .
neutral	i am on a £_00 a month plan .
neutral	this gives me no_problems in the uk .
neutral	but on a recent holiday abroad after 0 phone_call my service was stopped due to size of bill and the only call allowed to sort it out was to a non english_speaking operator .
neutral	i had to wait_until i got home to be able to get it sorted .
neutral	otticanet have a great range of glasses - i was quite spoilt for choice .
neutral	however , the delivery was quite slow especially as one of the items i ordered was ' in stock ' - i '_m assuming that it was held back until the other item in the order became_available which was fine but would have been good to have been advised of this .
neutral	once shipped the order arrived pretty quick .
neutral	can definitely recommend though for great product selection .
neutral	does what it says in the tin but no email_confirming order and when to expect delivery also the invoice sent electronically would have helped rather_than being in the bottom of the box .
neutral	the web_site is fine , the service could be good , but if you make a mistake the only way it can be corrected is by paying a £_00 fine !
neutral	also , they charge £ 0 to use a debit_card when most organisations are stopping these rip_off charges
neutral	we live in south_shields but came to you as we felt our local mazda dealer ( hodgson , gateshead ) was not giving us a good deal .
neutral	your salesman robert was friendly , engaging and very helpful - he put us at ease and we were very pleased to buy our mazda 0 from him .
neutral	we also expressed interest in a mazda 0 and he arranged a test_drive .
neutral	he also arranged a good deal on that even_though he was leaving the company imminently .
neutral	a few weeks_later we came back to buy the mazda 0 and were served by your new salesman , an older man .
neutral	his first response was that there was little time to arrange the deal before the end of march , this set the pattern , everything was a problem rather_than him finding solutions .
neutral	he cheered up when we agreed the deal but then told us that buying a mazda 0 meant we were having a mid - life crisis - which we did not want to hear .
neutral	when we collected the car his parting comment was we were driving out ' on the road to hell .'
neutral	throughout his dealings with us the only thing he became animated about was talking_about his daughter .
neutral	on the day we collected the car the transaction was constantly interrupted by calls on his phone from his wife and daughter .
neutral	had we met this man first we would certainly not have bought either the mazda 0 nor the mazda 0 from you .
neutral	although the dialogue with photoworld was very good they could not give reasons for the apparent graining i found on many of the photos in the book - most photos were approx 0mb in size although some were smaller - i '_m not convinced the full size of the files were uploaded as each picture seemed to upload in seconds with an upload speed of approx 000kb .
neutral	i receive a full_refund without_hesitation although i had to send the book back at my cost which didn_'_t resolve the issue as i still had a photobook to create - if i do not use the same software this will take in the region of 00_hours as it did for photoworld .
neutral	( 000 pages and approx 000 photos )
neutral	if anyone has done this before will know how time_consuming but rewarding it can be .
neutral	to have been offered the book at reduced cost would have been a start - lets_face it from their point of view it will go in the bin !
neutral	!
neutral	now i am totally unsure as to whether i will use photoworld again , which is a shame .
neutral	bought these two blinds , price was comparable to other_websites , arrived on time , easy to install , but no instructions in package , had to ring up for them to send me via my email address , again instructions clear apart_from the fitting of the valance , the diagram for the front clips that clip over the frame edge could be clearer as the diagram showing this is not very good , and the description of how to fit is not very clear , apart_from that everything was ok .
neutral	still waiitng for purchase ???????
neutral	?
neutral	i was peased with the product which was easy to assemle as advertised .
neutral	however disappointed not to receive the 0 free heavy_duty boxes as advertised with this product .
neutral	hi , it was my first time using this service , infact any kind of service with flowers on line .
neutral	not convinced i will use it again , and if so maybe use a differnt supplier .
neutral	not that the flowers were bad , the opposite infact , very beautyful .
neutral	the service on line was good too ,
neutral	the only thing that i can say that spoilt it for me was the element of surprise to my partner .
neutral	my partner was out when they were delivered .
neutral	it happens i know , but for the florists who delivered actually left a message_saying .
neutral	'' hi helen , posted a card through your letterbox and please look in the garage ''.
neutral	but the florist had sent me the voice_mail , and i had to then phone helen and tell her the plan .
neutral	i purposley didnt leave a contact number for helen , for that simple mistake .
neutral	that said all worked out , with me just stressing .
neutral	i personally would not blame anyone at all , but in future i would send them myself .
neutral	the feeling and surprise would be much_better .
neutral	thanks for your service , and chance to feed_back .
neutral	i ordered a diary from jessops , following an email i received from them , saying that if i ordered today the 00th of dec i would receive it it time for xmas .
neutral	this i did , but xmas day came and went with no diary .
neutral	now i don_'_t know if santa had forgotten to check his diary , but jessops had definitely forgotten mine .
neutral	having contacted jessops and chased up the diary it was posted just 0 days before_xmas , so no wonder it never made it in time .
neutral	it has arrived today the 00th of dec , a full 0 days after jessops said on their email that i would receive it .
neutral	in their_defence now that it '_s here they have made a very good job of it , and would order again , but be aware it doesn_'_t always do what it says on the tin .
neutral	so i thought i would put it on here as i have read their guidelines and still can '_t understand_why it '_s been rejected .
neutral	i shall not waste any more of my time trying to leave what i think is a fair review of the product .
neutral	they need to get their act_together i think .
neutral	bjorn recliner_chair and footstool :
neutral	" we saw these in the shop and after sitting in them decided they would be great for our new tv room .
neutral	in the sale they were £_000 each .
neutral	having read the reviews it was obvious that it would need a little patience and two of us to assemble them .
neutral	we started with the footstool first which was a doddle .
neutral	then we followed the instructions for the first chair - all pretty straight_forward until it was time to fit the arms .
neutral	it '_s at this point that you need four hands and a little patience as lining up the holes is a bit_tricky .
neutral	leaving the screws loose certainly helps at this stage .
neutral	first chair and stool took 0 . 0 hours .
neutral	second chair and stool 0 hour even_though we struggled a little more with the arms on this one .
neutral	all in all good value at the price we paid .
neutral	they fit perfect , the leather is lovely and soft and they are very comfortable .
neutral	we watched a film last night and i almost dozed off !
neutral	if you are ok at putting flat_packs together you will be ok with this ."
neutral	i ordered 0 bunches of flowers at more or less the same time .
neutral	i have not seen 0 of the bunches but the recipients said they were nice .
neutral	the flowers that were delivered to my wife were a little past their best when they arrived ( brown edges to the rose_petals ) and they only lasted 0 days before they started to look shabby and we had to throw them out after 0 days .
neutral	generally flowers from clares are great , but i will be thinking twice about ordering from you again .
neutral	the quality of the goods were fine but they did come flat packed so you have to put them together .
neutral	of more concern to me is that they take 000_% of the money straight_away and then make you wait 00 weeks for delivery .
neutral	essentially , i along with everyone_else is funding their ordering system .
neutral	i never pay for goods up front until i '_ve received them or at the most 00 %.
neutral	i won_'_t be buying from made . com again if that '_s their business model
neutral	ok casino but like all gamesys sites it can be very unfair !
neutral	most times my deposits are gone within 0 - 00_minutes .
neutral	they offer a daily free game which used to be good .
neutral	no matter what i used to have atleast 00 free_spins a week but after a while it stopped giving me them .. i had a couple of months cool off and started depositing again but it '_s now been 00 weeks since i won on the daily free game .
neutral	makes you not want go go on when your losing your deposits most times and not getting anything back like free_spins .
neutral	casino '_s need to think more about their players and not just the money thats coming in .
neutral	a little something back is always nice .
neutral	i rate this casino 0 / 00
neutral	used to be my # 0 casino to make deposit '_s but my experience suddenly changed !
neutral	after a while virgin_games just stopped paying out on the slot machines , every deposit made was just gone within 00_minutes if that !
neutral	they also have a daily free game you can do and collect eggs till the end of the month for guaranteed free_spins and / or cash but you only ever get 0 egg which = a spin .
neutral	i used to get atleast 0 free_spins a week but now when i do my free games it '_s mostly no wins and i '_ve not had free_spins for a while now .
neutral	i deceided to take a cool off from the site at the start of the year as the chat_host i was speaking too was very rude and unprofessional .
neutral	i complained on the last day of the month ( monthly game that offers guaranteed spins or cash ) that i wasn_'_t winning on the free games and it had been a while since i won off virgin even after all the deposits made .. other members and the chat_host '_s posts were nasty and it was like they was all telling_me to just go !
neutral	my last reply was " virgin_games has just lost themselfs a regular depositing player " and the chat_host '_s reply was " ok , see you tomorrow " like i just come on for the free games ?
neutral	i '_ve recently started doing my free games again and it '_s been 0 - 0_weeks .
neutral	i have still not had my free_spins yet , so .. since my cool off , nothing has changed .
neutral	i will_continue to make deposit '_s on virgin_games but not like i used too !
neutral	i have disabled chat so i don_'_t have to deal with any chat_host '_s anymore !
neutral	virgin_games needs to get_rid of chat_host '_s .
neutral	the only chat_host that took her job seriously was esme but she has_gone now .
neutral	i think virgin_games needs to update there casino more often and offer better bonuses like deposit matches and free_spins for new game releases , just a pound bonus puts a smile on everybody '_s face !
neutral	there is casino '_s online now that make you want to deposit on that site ... virgin_games just dont offer that .
neutral	because of the weather_conditions the mail was delayed but still you sent me an intimidating email to say that you still hadn_'_t received the phone and that i had breached the conditions of the sale causing me to panic thinking i was not going to be payed for my phone
neutral	they are good at providing information and tirned up on time .
neutral	but the guys who delivered our sofa refused to unpack it and take the cardboard away as was part of the deal when we bought them .
neutral	we contacted the seller and they made yodel come_back to collect the rubbish .
neutral	villa_plus in uk were very helpfull with booking that involved separate parties from england and n_ireland .
neutral	villa_plus in majorca were not contacted so it woulod be difficult to comment .
neutral	maids attended on conecsutive days so i would question the coordination of their visits .
neutral	m y guess is that they thought that their visit was t he only one .
neutral	the villa could have been cleaner and broken bits replaced as the company ask fo r a hefty ' breakage ' amount of money .
neutral	i ordered a colour_cartridge & black_cartridge at the same paid by pay_pal .
neutral	two_days_later colour_cartridge arrives posted in uk with invoice for just that .
neutral	i emailed your customer_services told black_cartridge dispatched from different warehouse .
neutral	^ days_later it arrived from burglen ?
neutral	all cartridge_shop had to do was add part order to the first invoice .
neutral	keep your customers advised we are not mind readers .
neutral	thank_you paul wood
neutral	tablet in perfect_condition and well_packaged .
neutral	arrived promptly
neutral	it all fitted so that '_s a bonus ... only time i '_ll internet shop .
neutral	feel like i '_m contributing to the death of the high_street .... going in the shop and having a chat and a laugh way better .
neutral	best lads in any ja '_s , darren , paul , & fraser ...
neutral	i used bulkpowders . co . uk on many occasions , there was no issues .
neutral	switch to bulkpowders . ie as i am based in ireland .
neutral	delivery took almost a week , next time i will use co . uk version as goods are delivered after 0 days max !
neutral	improvement needed in that matter .
neutral	goods as always 0_stars , delivery max 0 .
neutral	delivered what ordered rapidly but descriptions on website are a bit weak - i ended_up with a chain ring when the description suggested a chain guard for a chain ring .
neutral	a picture would have helped .
neutral	they may be a bit_slow , but they arrive in the end .
neutral	i feel that the level of compensation i got was a discrace , even_tho it was the first offer and i was told by digby and brown that it was a good offer and to take it , i felt as if my hands were tied and when i asked what digby and brown made from it , i was given no figer and pratically ignored
neutral	the computer itself it very good .
neutral	does everything i required from it .
neutral	only problem i had was turnover was usually between 0 - 0_weeks .
neutral	mine was well over 0_weeks .
neutral	nobody contacted me to tell me about the delay , or the reason for the delay .
neutral	no answer to the telephone and no response to the email i sent .
neutral	in the end i had to use their facebook_page to find out what was happening with my order .
neutral	great machine .
neutral	poor communication .
neutral	have used you for many_years_now and when i tried to oder the flowers i wanted this year it said that they could not do that type to the post_code i had entered even_though have sent those kind of flowers for the past few_years .
neutral	told to chose some others but did not say which ones could be delivered so just had to try and order another and another and another untill i found one that said i could order
neutral	the rental car was very good , but got caught for additional payment called " premuium location pickup ", i thought the airport was a premium pickup location , given that sixt have an office there !
neutral	sixt offering " bring back car emplty " for a fixed cost , this can be cost_effective , but need to check fuel prices at time of travelling and the car fuel_tank capacity , plus gamble on not running out of fuel on returning for drop_off .
neutral	but can save up to 00 / 00_euros if planned .
neutral	although i think the service is fine and extensive , i was rather let_down by the fact that the delivery which i scheduled for the 00th ( my dad '_s birthday ) arrived the next_day .
neutral	overall good service but i didn_'_t get the full 0 / 0 of a tank per vehicle as promised .
neutral	shame .
neutral	well a tale of two properties here .
neutral	the first was simply awful and i have an issue with the way in which the property was advertised by blue_chip , this will be followed up under another framework .
neutral	when blue_chip heard about our problem the moved fast ; we had two small dogs so the options for another property was low .
neutral	they did find us something although not in torquay but in paignton .
neutral	this property itself was much much_better and very clean but the area was totally different - ' bungalow land '.
neutral	we did get a follow - up service call from them .
neutral	this event did spoil our holiday .
neutral	i have used hifx for a number of years .
neutral	the process is easy to navigate , but , in the last few_years , fees have been added to the transaction cost , negating the advantage of a good exchange_rate for smaller transactions .
neutral	furthermore , i have had a number of transactions where the recipient has received less_than i have sent , which has caused problems .
neutral	yes ordered mud flaps for my toyota hi lux from thornton breakers last tuesday , spoke to james who assured me after giving him my payment details that they would be sent the next_day .
neutral	unfortunately as yet they have not arrived .
neutral	roy .
neutral	flowers in very good condition no problem here .
neutral	delivery was very poor waited in all day got a message to say they had been dispatched about 00 : 00 and flowers arrived at 00 : 00 .
neutral	did send a email asking where flowers were to which a reply came 0 hour later explaining that flowers were on there way and could not give a sopecific time , but would be there before 00 : 00
neutral	if ordering again would look into paying extra for delivery butthis that then adds to the cost , so maybe i would use a locol florist and would not have been so stressful .
neutral	but i would like to say one final time flowers look great .
neutral	the problem with dfds is that they muddle the calais and dunkirk sailings making selection confusing .
neutral	they would be better to treat them as two different_destinations .
neutral	also my last sailing was very late , no explaination or regrets .
neutral	finally my own personal dislike is that there is no child free zone on board for we people who want some peace and quiet .
neutral	the first fabrication diagram i received from worktop_express had a couple of errors on it .
neutral	the sketch i had sent them was pretty clear ( i ' d spent a couple of hours drawing it to scale on graph paper ).
neutral	i pointed these errors out , and they responded with a second diagram which still contained the original errors , and also had a couple of new errors on it .
neutral	the third diagram was eventually correct , but the turnaround time between diagrams was pretty slow ( over 00h in each case ).
neutral	this back and forth , plus the time they took to respond to a couple of questions i had , added nearly a week to the lead time on my order .
neutral	when the goods finally arrived at our first floor_flat , the delivery men informed my wife that they " didn_'_t do stairs ".
neutral	when she remarked that she wasn_'_t going to manage on her own , they begrudgingly agreed to carry the goods up .
neutral	anyway , in fairness , the worktops themselves were good quality and all the measurements were correct .
neutral	my enquiry was acknowledged , but there was no follow_up regarding part i was attempting to source .
neutral	having_searched the internet etc .
neutral	i still have not sourced the part , presumably 0st choice had the same experience .
neutral	first off , this wasn_'_t a holiday !
neutral	it was a mini - break .
neutral	you board and everything is lovely , it isn_'_t a luxury liner but it isn_'_t bad either .
neutral	cabins are comfortable .
neutral	the ship is very expensive .
neutral	two hot chocolates came to £ 0 so pack up before you go with drink and food .
neutral	mooring takes a while so you don_'_t get long in amsterdam , factor this in !
neutral	we stayed overnight in a fantastic hotel and dfds took care of it all .
neutral	setting off was delayed , no reason_why .
neutral	arrival into newcastle was slow , no reason_why .
neutral	it was great - nice cruise but price of on - board facilities is disappointing and mooring times and both ports reduces time in destination considerably .
neutral	the design and creation process was relatively simple .
neutral	however as this was a gift there need to be a few other elemnts in place for this to work .
neutral	ie some sort of message service for recipient and clear separate billing for customer .
neutral	when i called the operatives were very helpfull and did what they could but having some of these systems in place would help them as well the customers .
neutral	there also companies out there that have these hind of gift services and some might find it easier just to go with them .
neutral	good cash_back site but very slow on responding to questions raised .
neutral	can take days to get back in touch .
neutral	also the clicksnap tends to miss items off receipts uploaded , by the time it '_s processed you can miss the expiry_date for a particular item .
neutral	i think you may get a better response if you mail people at a reasonable out of the day !
neutral	!
neutral	i use resorthoppa as it offers such a good price on a group bus transfer , but this is the second time we '_ve been left waiting at tenerife_south airport for an_hour and a half before departing - it felt_like the pick_up was trying to incorporate too many flights !
neutral	the ground staff at the airport checked us onto the bus promptly and the driver was very apologetic , and speaking spanish i was able to find out information .
neutral	however it left us with a frustrating start to our holiday , and it was only as we had stayed at the hotel many_times before that we were able to still partake of half board dinner after the restaurant had closed .
neutral	as usual the return pick_up was all very smooth , and leaves me thinking that we would be best to book an individual taxi at the beginning of our holiday ( to save stress and time - but unfortunately no money ) and then book resorthoppa for the return_journey .
neutral	package arrived very battered and looked like it had been sliced by a knife .
neutral	luckily the pans were unmarked and are just what i wanted .
neutral	didnt like the option of were you sit as the airline lets you choose own seat on internet and had to ring up to make_sure you didnt allocate me a seat then my post_code was wrong on my e ticket on payement address a simple mistake just differant accents mis took the t for a g that wouldnt of happened using the internet
neutral	having waited over three_weeks for my net to arrive i phoned the company saying that the web_site said ten days , so where was my net .
neutral	it arrivied the next_day !!!
neutral	d
neutral	i liked the item i bought and was happy with the price but i paid 0 . 00 for next_day delivery .
neutral	i ordered on a thursday_evening and thought it unlikely i , d get it on the friday but definitely on the saturday .
neutral	wrong .
neutral	was delivered on the monday .
neutral	i emailed np_autoparts and complained and i said that i would have expected a saturday service and if not then at_least i should have been_warned of the delivery date and that way i would not have paid extra for a next_day service that was never going to happen .
neutral	unhelpful response by np_autoparts and i feel_cheated to be honest .
neutral	i would but from them again however i shall not trust their information regards postage .
neutral	the first lot of flowers were in my opinion sub - standard , but when i told seranata that this was so and sent photos they immediately sent another bouquet without and hesitation .
neutral	so eventually i was happy and could use then again .

neutral	e_- careers website and navigation - excellent and easy to use .
neutral	ability to access customer_support , great , only took a few_clicks and we were connected .
neutral	speaking with customer_support was a little difficult , i had a mix - up with regards to what course i was enrolled in and i didn_'_t get the feeling the customer_support was genuinely listening to my concern .
neutral	it appeared to me the content on their computer_screen was more important than my story .
neutral	however , after a while of explaining and re - explaining my situation along with a timeline of events , the customer service rep then understood .
neutral	they needed a day to investigate and i '_m glad the verdict was in line with my expectations .
neutral	now , about the course i was enrolled - project_management professional ( pmp ).
neutral	i felt the course structure was excellent , it was broken down into manageable and easy - to - digest sections .
neutral	however , the spoken content was very repetitive when following the written slides .
neutral	powerpoint slides should be created as a placeholder , however , throughout most of the course , the presenter just repeated the content found in the slides rather_than enhancing or providing additional description .
neutral	the rating doesn_'_t allow for 0 / 0_stars , i would have give 0 0 / 0_stars , instead , i gave 0_stars because companies can have an amazing website but the product ( specifically for me , the pmp course ) didn_'_t produce the same excellence in content .
neutral	the customer service could have listened a little more rather then come_across standoffish in the beginning of our conversation .
neutral	i will give them a second chance and take another course through e_- careers .
neutral	my item was exactly_what i needed at a decent price , the only one downfall was the delivery time , i ordered on the 0th which was a bank_holiday , but they said i would get it the 0th or 0th ,
neutral	they turned_up on the 00th , bad delivery as if i would have known this upon purchase i would have requested next_day delivery , as a consequence my job was pushed back a couple of days which has a knock on effect for all ,
neutral	thabks
neutral	took to long returning car on return
neutral	after looking through various mobile selling sites mazuma seemed to be the best .
neutral	however when received the pack to send of i noticed that if you wanted it sent with tracking_information it would cost 0 . 00 hang on why would i pay to sent my phone off ?
neutral	if i sell it on ebay then they pay postage so why would i pay extra for selling my phone to you ?
neutral	so i sent it via the standard service that states i '_m only covered for 00quid also took a long time considering it states 00 it took 0days to reach them .
neutral	i suggest mazuma put the 0 . 00 charge on there site or swallow the 0 . 00 charge as you make enough by reselling to various companies .
neutral	bought the product easily , but nowhere did it state how long delivery was , or if it did , it was not very clear .
neutral	fyi it took one month from placing the order to receipt , way too long .
neutral	thanks for the response , but it does not state delivery times on the home page and i cannot see where it says 00 working_days on the delivery information page either .
neutral	+ good range of tyres including well_known_brands
neutral	+ you get to see economy and noise ratings
neutral	+ clear pricing
neutral	+ local_garages
neutral	- the local_garage that fitted the tyres said they could have sold me a pair of better tyres ( of the same brand ) for the same price
neutral	- no choice of a mobile fitter to come to home address .
neutral	especially important when your car doesn_'_t get sold with a spare tyre to get you to a garage .
neutral	- you pay in advance rather once they '_ve been fitted , which means you can '_t change your mind .
neutral	i bought 0 tyres but was told i really only needed to replace one .
neutral	- booked on a tuesday_night but earliest appointment was the friday_morning .
neutral	choice of products fine .
neutral	use of online buying , ok to start with , but a long delivery item was not notified until i enquired .
neutral	initially i was also told delivery to a different address required a letter of confirmatiion .
neutral	that seemed to get forgotten along with the notification .
neutral	after my enquiry there seemed to be no need for special confirmation of address .
neutral	also a two man delivery was charged extra , my man being available to assist was refused on insurance grounds .
neutral	i suppose that if ten deliveries to multi_storey premises were made that would enable ten charges to be raised .
neutral	good earner that !
neutral	by definition there must be more premises above ground_floor than on it , so cater for it .
neutral	what world are some of these_people living in ?
neutral	you did ask for my comments .
neutral	boot is first_class but attaching straps are fragile .
neutral	velcro comes off straps .
neutral	placed my order from tribal six days ago , gives a . co . uk web address .
neutral	items are beefing sent from_hong_kong , they only posted them today according to dhl for delivery tomorrow !.
neutral	this should be interesting as its about a 00hr flight to here .
neutral	will my parcels arrive before_xmas ?
neutral	well they ' d better .
neutral	site stated dispatched in 00hrs and items were in stock ?
neutral	so why post six days_later for next_day delivery ?.
neutral	if you '_ve ordered and been given 00hr dispatch then make your own mind up , mine could be delivered tomorrow but i think that '_s pushing it a bit even for santa .
neutral	was delivered to a neighbours house , no contact to say what time they are due , when we received the flowers the box was damaged and the water was leaking which made the box wet
neutral	website is great , amount of products available superb and parcel delivered within a couple of days .
neutral	however , i ordered the ' 00st_birthday silver balloons and helium gas package ' which was supposed to include " 00 of 00_inch silver latex balloons " - the first one exploded as we tried to fill to 00 " and on trying a couple more , realised the balloons included didn_'_t even inflate to 0 " - very disappointed and as these were being inflated on the night of the 00st_birthday it was too late to sort and we had to use these which looked stupid next to the printed 00 ' balloons we had .
neutral	a little_bit disappointed in quality to be honest but it is acceptable as a gift .
neutral	it should be pointed_out that the calender was sent in completly the wrong order so i had to take it apart and put it all back together again correctly which was a pain in the backside .
neutral	on a positive_note it was delivered quickly and the design is nice .
neutral	renting a car through ' rentalcars . com ' was easy and convenient , as any internet transactions are , and as this was the first time i ' d done this personally in my own capacity , i was surprised by the following events :
neutral	0 .
neutral	the balance of the payment was taken from my account without_prompting i . e : paid deposit and chose vehicle etc , gave flight number etc , next thing , recieved an email to say full outstanding_balance had been taken off my visa account .
neutral	0 .
neutral	on arrival at the ' first car_rental ' desk in cape_town , to collect the vehicle , i was informed i had to give them r0000 as a holding_deposit !
neutral	i had the money in 0 accounts , so would '_ve had to go back to terminal and atm '_s to fix this , but then the desk_clerk ' wangled ' it and i only had to pay in r0000 .
neutral	i was informed that i didn_'_t read the small_print and that this shocker was a fairly common_occurrence .
neutral	0 .
neutral	on handing back the vehicle , the inspection clerk as well as receptionist at ' first car ' were not interested and did not look at the petrol slip i handed to them , which included : time , date and registration of vehicle i had just filled up , 00_minutes prior to transaction .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i have been charged a fee to fill the vehicle and some other unexplained fees up to r000 which make no sense at all .
neutral	0 .
neutral	otherwise , the car was in good nic and there was no problem on that side , i just felt i was vulnerable , and how can you knock a deposit down from r0000 to r0000 , is that because i said i was going to cancel the rental and catch a cab ?
neutral	0 .
neutral	in it '_s entirity , i would definitly read the contracts and small_print properly , be careful about my credit_card number , check the car very well and make_sure the handover clerk has marked things properly , insist the recieving people note i handed the car back with a full_tank , and get info as to extra costs .
neutral	0 .
neutral	next time i would prefer to work through a travel_agent and direct payments .
neutral	0 hour delay on our thomson flight to tenerife sud - apparently because of a spanish baggage handlers strike there .
neutral	however , our_luggage came off the carousel there a good bit quicker_than it usually does at edinburgh !
neutral	i was going to use the buy and pick_up facility at edinburgh as i have done on a previous occasion .
neutral	but i '_m not convinced that the relentless voice overs proclaiming " up to 00_%_off high_street prices " applies to malt_whisky - so didn_'_t bother .
neutral	great for equipment and product range particularly clothing - however with success and the number of customers i think in the last two years there has_been a reduction in the quality of cservice
neutral	coffee fine but plastic capsules not as good in my magimix machine as the real thing and feel as if they are putting a terrific strain on it when i close the lever .
neutral	i eventually bought my new line0 hd000 foot_pedal from dawsons after several weeks researching prices and availability .
neutral	despite ' in stock ', on the website , there was a delay of a week in despatch but this was not too upsetting .
neutral	i called dawsons and , minutes after they confirmed it was en_route , the door_bell rang and it arrived .
neutral	excellent .
neutral	right up until i started unpacking .
neutral	instead of nice tidy packaging , the box had been resealed , the bag was open and the usb_lead and power_supply were floating loosely in the box .
neutral	uh oh not good .
neutral	on removing the unit from the bag , it was covered in dust ... except for all the finger_prints and a dirt mark on the pedal .
neutral	at this point i called the shop again .
neutral	the chap i spoke to was apologetic .
neutral	i needed the unit for a rehearsal that weekend so sending it back was not an option so i agreed to test it for a few_days before_deciding what to do .
neutral	the end_result is , the unit is working fine and sounds fantastic .
neutral	in addition the guy i spoke to was conciliatory and , had i pursued things , may have sorted_out a replacement but i decided not to .
neutral	why ?
neutral	simply because i am happy with the unit and have learned not to buy anything from dawsons again .
neutral	i have since heard from friends in other bands that they have had almost_identical experiences .
neutral	selling used goods as new ?
neutral	that '_s just not on .
neutral	==========================================
neutral	follow_up
neutral	paul from dawson '_s actually called last_week and was an excellent example of what great customer_care should be .
neutral	he was conciliatory and is sending me some free guitar_strings by way of compensation .
neutral	although i certainly wasn_'_t angling for anything , it '_s great that he took my feedback so seriously and he '_s taken my negative experience and turned it into a positive .
neutral	as such i '_m increasing my rating from 0 to 0 .
neutral	0 might be seen as still a little_harsh but the original problem still grates .
neutral	paul '_s efforts have at_least given me confidence to give dawson '_s another try in future and hopefully they '_ll earn 0_stars !
neutral	very fast service , however prices paid for mobiles are really low .
neutral	can '_t fault the service in itself but be warned that they use a very poor courier .
neutral	they failed to deliver when they we ' re originally supposed to , failed to re - deliver when they said they would , provided a number to call that was never answered , only offered a redelivery window of 0 . 00am to 0 . 00pm , impossible to contact to track the parcel , labyrinthine central phone system that eventually cuts you off .
neutral	eventually made the 00 mile_round_trip to pick the roof_box up from the couriers which really defeated the object of buying online .
neutral	prices are good but delivery took over two_weeks which is too long and the website is very clunky and slow and not very user_friendly .
neutral	i had to chase up my order and only then did they send it .
neutral	i have used the cartridge_shop for my advent cartridges a number of times and to date have found them excellent
neutral	however
neutral	the last package of cartridges received recently , although received within 00_hours , the quality has_been very poor and i have had many problems getting my printer to print decent looking documents .
neutral	i have done full maintenance tasks on my printer , cleaning printheads etc , yet after printing just 0 test pages and one calibration page my printer tells_me that the colour_cartridge ink level is very low , in fact every time i checked print ink_levels , even without printing anything , the ink level in the colour_cartridge decreased dramatically .
neutral	this is not good enough , previously i have found that i got excellent print quality along with large print numbers using the cartridges supplied by you but with this last batch , order number cs000000 - lv000000 the cartridges appeared to be incorrectly filled .
neutral	rgds
neutral	john arton
neutral	the shoes were too large .
neutral	i have sent them back they look great though and i '_m looking_forward to having some that fit .
neutral	ford edge from natioanl / alamo at toronto airport .
neutral	rental_desk took 00_minutes to manage to get system to accept that the rental has_been fully prepaid .
neutral	other than that , a near brand_new vehicle , good value and very comfortable .
neutral	this is an ok cashback site but payout and customer service can be slow sometimes .
neutral	delivery tube , marked ` fragile ` was badly broken in two places .
neutral	i accepted it , maybe stupidly , and as it turned_out , the product was not damaged .
neutral	no apologies from delivery man .
neutral	arrived at the hotel and was told there was a problem about my booking as the hotel did not receive the details .
neutral	00_minutes later when the hotel told me it had been sorted_out .
neutral	on a busy bank_holiday_weekend i was lucky they still had a room available .
neutral	communication problems between companies need to improve , my room was booked nearly 0_weeks before .
neutral	i ordered 0 items and two did not fit me i would like to return the goods and have filled in your return form twice and so_far i have not received an address for returns .
neutral	as i live in italy it may a while for my parcel to arrive with you and i want to reorder different_sizes and am_afraid you will have none left .
neutral	please treat this as an_urgent matter .
neutral	by the same token i am very pleased with the quality of the goods and the ones which fit are perfect .
neutral	i needed a product ' next_day ' and the website stated that if you order before 0pm and pay a little extra , the product will be with you the next_day ...
neutral	my product arrived the morning after the next_day .
neutral	i was reimbursed with the diffrence of next_day delivery compared to standard delivery .
neutral	something to be addressed i feel ...
neutral	... trust no one on ebay !!
neutral	you '_ve been_warned ..
neutral	if you can , go see it first ..
neutral	!!
neutral	!
neutral	purchased travel_insurance which was fairly easy , but since then got various unwanted emails .............
neutral	i was a subscriber back when this was an amazon service , when it transferred over , i had no_problems , and the website is generally laid_out well and easy to work .
neutral	occasionally i haven_'_t received email_updates , but thats a minor thing .
neutral	what '_s annoying is that i '_ve had several dvds on my list for well over a year and they have not given an eta , despite their release .
neutral	i can understand that they may not want to buy dvd '_s that are not watched by many people , but informing_me of them not getting this ever / an eta for this would be a better way of managing expectations .
neutral	the size of the print varies too much .
neutral	sometimes the prints are up to 0mm out .
neutral	this is not acceptable i '_m afraid .
neutral	it looks really shoddy in my portfolio .
neutral	please try and sort this out and i might use you again .
neutral	i '_m happy with my new oakley gascans , but had to wait a week rather_than the advertised 0 day .
neutral	plus the glasses only came with a cloth bag rather_than the standard hard shell case .
neutral	not bad by any means , but could do a lot better .
neutral	time from order to arrival very slow apart_from that ok .
neutral	pros_: all communications with this company have been friendly with staff always very helpful and polite at all times .
neutral	cons_: i have only made 0 orders so_far .
neutral	in the first order i purchased a sizeable quantidy of garlic capsules as it was v . good value and i wanted to stock up for a long time as the shelf_life is long .
neutral	the best before date , however , on all the cartons was only for 0 months , which i have never_experienced from other_sellers for this product .
neutral	they didn_'_t hesitate to offer a refund although it didnt come for 0 months as they had forgotten for some reason to reimburse when they promised .
neutral	in addition i had to contact them during the ordering_process as i had spent over £_00 and been charged for delivery .
neutral	they advised that that was because the weight of the order was over a specified limit .
neutral	i had not seen that advertised .
neutral	on the second order i was again wrongly charged a delivery fee after inputing the appropriate offer code .
neutral	they have again agreed to reimburse me .
neutral	to their credit , however , there is absolutely no_quibble when you contact them about the error / s , and if these gliches can be ironed_out i would definetly buy from them again .
neutral	maybe i have just been a bit unlucky ?
neutral	the service provided by walls and floors is very good as regards materials , delivery and advice , however when advertised that orders over €_000 get free delivery and also being offered a 00_%_discount_code disappointingly when discount is applied and your order goes below €_000 you then fall_foul and get a large delivery charge , this then meaning buy more to get over the €_000 threshold again to get your free delivery .
neutral	the site needs to be more clear on the principle of free delivery and state that the €_000 threshold is after any discount applied .
neutral	asked for bank_transfer but got a cheque .
neutral	explains it all ...
neutral	other than that ; fast transaction would do it again .
neutral	plenty of tool selection with some cheap prices but some a lot cheaper_elsewhere .
neutral	fast & prompt delivery service .
neutral	postage a little_pricey if you just want a few small items .
neutral	very easy to use and straight_forward to use with the latest deal going on .
neutral	i ordered flowers for valentines_day , which arrived looking nothing like the flowers that i had ordered .
neutral	it was missing all but one type of flower that it should have and in the other flowers place was just green_leaves .
neutral	i knew the boot i wanted and the size - eur 00 , replacing my long - lasting existing ecco_boots .
neutral	i could not order by eur size , and after looking at this and other_sites which compared uk and eur sizes , decided it was 00 . 0 / 00 .
neutral	size 00 was what was sent , which was clearly too small as soon as i tried on .
neutral	i sent them back - not using the return_label which i could not find - and was credited promptly but was charged £ 0 . 00 for the label .
neutral	i was not prepared to risk going through the same again as it was not clear whether it was me or ecco that made the mistake , so went into one of their shops and bought size 00 .
neutral	excellent boot , fits very well .
neutral	messages to ecco : ( 0 ) give customers option to select in eur sizes ( 0 ) check whether customer has used return_label provided when crediting ( 0 ) allow exchanges - i should not need to go into a shop
neutral	i '_ve ordered from see tickets a few_times and although the tickets push it a little in arriving , i haven_'_t been let_down yet .
neutral	we had 0 journeys booked before the holiday
neutral	0st driver turned_up on time , journey was acceptable , a bit white knuckle
neutral	0nd journey , driver was rude , argumentative , sent him away had to wait for a replacement driver , better but middle lane hogger
neutral	0rd journey ( separate party , same journey ) same as above , white knuckle journey , didn_'_t listen to sat_nav directions .
neutral	on the web_site it states drivers are kept up to date with delays etc , this was not apparent on either return_journey , they were ringing saying they were there whilst we were still_waiting for luggage , rush rush rush , not what you want after a 0 hour flight
neutral	owner was helpful and pleasant but let_down by 0rd_party drivers
neutral	i love the idea of being_able to put the info in once , and get a selection of options - great !
neutral	but do '_t ever get tempted to choose any option that gets you stuck with yodel !
neutral	!
neutral	paid for ' next_day ', actually got the day after - and they delivered two parcels , both the wrong addresses !
neutral	by rushing - regardless of correct address_labels - they swopped and attached incorrect barcodes .
neutral	four phone_calls later , over five days - me to them , they '_ve never called me - and the parcels are still at opposite_ends of the country !
neutral	beware
neutral	an okay kind of store which doesn_'_t leave me either looking_forward to my purchase or having enjoyed my shopping_experience .
neutral	their stores are fundamentally bombed out regardless of their blue and white exterior , and although their prices might be marginally lower my favourite other food store ( waitrose ) does not leave a bad_taste in my mouth or stomach unlike tesco .
neutral	as for tesco '_s shop_assistants i '_ve found a lot of them to be a bit too aggressive for my liking .
neutral	one in the goodge street branch once had the nerve to rip away my receipt from my left hand , without subsequently apologizing .
neutral	frankly i '_m pleased that the african twit has stayed out of my way since i still find it convenient ( and nothing more ) to shop there .
neutral	i '_ve only ever shopped from one of their central_london stores but i '_ve found their products to be reasonable quality at decent prices with several splashes of bright colour - however like most high_street_stores there '_s nothing remarkable about their inventory .
neutral	as for customer service i can_honestly_say that most of their sales_reps are clueless clothes folders , and as for an afro - caribbean bloke at the pay area near tottenham court road , he was as friendly as a wall of drying paint .
neutral	that said he wasn_'_t quite as bad as the one in the nike town store ( first floor ) in oxford circus .
neutral	good site and airline servicing europe , parts of the middle_east and north africa .
neutral	it '_s simple to manoeuvre your way around their pages and booking couldn_'_t be simpler .
neutral	i can handle the extra_charges for baggage but don_'_t particularly like the fact that they charge for card_payments , which seems a bit unwarranted to me .
neutral	even with online discounts the short_stay car_park is ridiculously_expensive and now they have started to charge more for multi - storey .
neutral	travelling is onerous enough without adding this insult to injury .
neutral	this isn_'_t the easiest booking site to use .
neutral	searching is not as easy as some others and a general search of hotels in an area usually gives fewer choices .
neutral	however once you have picked your preferred hotel on the other_sites , it is often worth_checking for that hotel specifically by name on hotel . info as the price is very often lower !
neutral	so , they have a website which says ' oops , your booking went wrong ' and hangs there .
neutral	they confirm the booking anyway , in three staged emails and 00_minutes later they ask me to rate them on here .
neutral	muppets .
neutral	so_far .
neutral	ever the optimist ...
neutral	car_hire point was alittle difficult to find , as it was nowhere_near whether the other hire car_hire points are , it is at completely the opposite end !
neutral	arrived on a bank_holiday in poland so had to pay an extra € 00 for the privilege which we weren_'_t very happy about , it also wasn_'_t clear what we had paid for on our voucher and we were paying for as extras on the car_hire_agreement .
neutral	so because our polish is virtually nil and the assistants english was quite good , we just had to trust what he as saying was correct .
neutral	will soon find out when the bill arrives !
neutral	car was in good condition but alot older than we would expect it to be considering its a hire car - but more than adequate .
neutral	overall a not too bad_experience .
neutral	recieved my order six days after_placing it , admittedly i ordered on a saturday but expected it to arrive tuesday wednesday at the latest .
neutral	goods were as ordered although each can ( 0 in all ) were all damaged in all fairness this could of been the courier although there was only packing_material in the bottom of the box , no packing between each item .
neutral	this said i will be ordering from them again , although i will not order if i need it in a hurry .
neutral	great service but i have a problem using them because the insurance level is only £_000 . 00 and most of the products we send out are more then that .. also they have lost 0 parcels that have cost well over £_000 . 00
neutral	cheaper yes , fast free delivery yes .
neutral	however if you enjoy excellent coffee and you have gone to the trouble and expense of buying a nespresso_machine why compromise on the coffee ?
neutral	?
neutral	unfortunately that is what you will do currently if you opt for these pods .
neutral	they are not a million_miles_away from getting it right but its either as good or its not and right now it '_s not i '_m afraid .
neutral	i won_'_t be switching from nespresso yet , i love my coffee too much .
neutral	food is good and reasnoble if you use a voucher but it never seems hot enough .
neutral	cookie was undercooked and coke tasted like carbonated water coloured brown .
neutral	sometimes things are in stock and you get good service ( guildford_branch ) othertimes things are out of stock ( including their warehouse ) and the service is lousy or the product is damaged and has to be returned .
neutral	i tend to go to toolstation instead of screwfix .
neutral	the prices are cheaper and service is better .
neutral	come on screwfix get your act_together and you could be a good company again !
neutral	parts supplied were faulty , nobody would ring me back always had to make the call , second part did arrive as promised though and this one works correctly .
neutral	i flew out from gatwick on 00th_december , cold and wet day , rang skyone 00_minutes before arrival at the airport and found no one there .
neutral	i called them three_times to try and get a pickup driver , but was forced to leave my wife and luggage shivering by the roadside , whilst a warden made me drive around the block .
neutral	not the best start to a trip and certainly not meet and greet , as i view it .
neutral	to be fair , the same driver delivered my car upon my return and he was on time , but this was only because i called before i had collected my luggage , knowing that i would otherwise have to wait around in the cold , if i called after the luggage had appeared on the belt .
neutral	have used stress_free on several_occasions but with different suppliers of the actual service .
neutral	skyone seem to be one of the poorer operators , and i would think_twice before using skyone again .
neutral	poorly_finished , but potential for improvement .
neutral	need better quality control and checking
neutral	i bought a refurbished lenova thinkpad from them .
neutral	it arrived very quickly and is like new condition .
neutral	i paid extra for upgrades of ram & the hard_drive to a ssd_drive .
neutral	it '_s really fast and a joy to use .
neutral	i '_ve had an old ibm before and they are bullet_proof build quality - the old machine was on xp and getting very tired hence my purchase of this one .
neutral	i '_ve only had 0 problem - i could not get it to allow me to make a recovery disc - it said the a copy had already been made & you can only make 0 copy !
neutral	so who made and kept the copy ?
neutral	?
neutral	microdream did not supply one with the machine so i phoned their support , the guy said he couldn_'_t help & that i would have to contact lenova to buy a recovery disc .
neutral	considering i ' d spent £_000 on this machine i was rather peeved that they didn_'_t want to know about helping sort this problem .
neutral	eventually lenova supplied me a pair of discs but it cost me £_00
neutral	hence only 0_stars because of their disinterested customer_support
neutral	had to wait long time before delivery date was confirmed and it was not delivered on that date .
neutral	because i could fit item only during school_holidays now i have to wait to next time with funds frozen and item knocking around in my van !
neutral	i don_'_t even know if job will still get go_ahead again ...
neutral	we have booked for next march - thbooking experience was fine but i did then mail to add bed_linen and towels to our order but hvehad no response .
neutral	argos back when was a joy to shop in .
neutral	these days customer service is poor and it feels_like a mix between the post_office and costco .
neutral	0m of servo hose purchased , 0 . 0m servo hose delivered .
neutral	oops .
neutral	slightly frustrating as had to go through booking_procedure twice as first time round the site inexplicably kept saying my card_details not entered correctly , although they were as input them several_times the same and finally had to totally reload site and start again which then accepted them !
neutral	then the print confirmation function does not work , just prints an empty page .
neutral	fortunately the confirmation_email arrived so at_least i have details there .
neutral	good prices but you cannot combine deals .
neutral	other than that good prices and fast delivery .
neutral	there are only a few qualities by which you can judge an online supplier .
neutral	drink_shop certainly has an_enormous_range of products but i wouldn_'_t know if the aquavit i bought via amazon was particularly cheap .
neutral	what i am unable to work out is why the delivery charges are so different .
neutral	i paid £ 0 through amazon choosing 0 - 0 days delivery .
neutral	i wasn_'_t in any hurry but the product came the next_day .
neutral	similar products recommended by amazon have lower delivery charges .
neutral	worked out alright in the end but lettering kept peeling_off the backing and off the paintwork when the backing was finally peeled_off ... needs some patience .... at one point was wishing i had just got it done professionally for £_000 more , but got it on ok in the end and looks good .... will wait to see if it peels off over time or not .... also doesn_'_t really allow for gaps in doors etc as per the design on the website , bit disappointed about that .
neutral	ok the ordering and delivery experience was very very good .
neutral	ordered quickly and easily online and it was delivered when they said it would , now in todays society that is a real plus !
neutral	on the downside the boiler came with a part missing and despite my plumber calling in to plumbnation , they could not help which was poor .
neutral	if you sell you need to help , this is what has let you down .
neutral	please make_sure your after sales is as good as the order and delivery experience .
neutral	furniture arrived a day late , which cost us two_days in time .
neutral	the dressing_table stool , has now fallen to bits .
neutral	all of the fixings in the legs have pulled_out , and it is now unusable .
neutral	very poor construction , and looked weak before assembly .
neutral	very very disappointing , i '_ll buy from a good old_fashioned shop in future .
neutral	the dressing_table and bedside_cabinets , were in a thousand bits , and took_forever to put_together .
neutral	the paperwork says twenty_minutes , ha_ha !, no chance !
neutral	these did look very good when constructed though , and i am very satisfied with these .
neutral	however , prior to ordering , i did contact world_stores by phone , to ask about the amount of self_assembly there would be on these items , and he said " there is an element of self_assembly ".
neutral	this is a very misleading sales_technique , and in fact not true .
neutral	it is a complete self_assembly , the like of which i have never seen before .
neutral	i am fairly skilled being a shop fitter , but anyone with minimal skills would struggle .
neutral	i may report this as mis selling .
neutral	i purchased a masuri titanium cricket_helmet for my friend ’_s birthday , he loved the helmet , but the masuri titanium cricket_helmet was dirty .
neutral	event thought the masuri titanium cricket_helmet was in new unopened packing , the helmet was stained , there was dirt marks on the helmet , it looked like it could have been a display_model instead of being new , i paid £_00 for the masuri titanium cricket_helmet and i wasn_'_t impressed by the condition .
neutral	i also purchased a gray nicholls fiber glass sheet which i love that was really good value .
neutral	the shipping was free and really fast .
neutral	overall i was really happy with the fast shipping on my goods , but unhappy with the masuri titanium cricket_helmet which was a present for my friend has dirt marks on .
neutral	i would recommend this company to my friends ,
neutral	i bought an ipod_touch that was described as in excellent condition with no faults except a few scratches on the back only to find that the back camera is not working and on inspection there is evidence of water_damage and dried water marks beneath the screen .
neutral	the rest of the functions work ok and the water marks are not overly visible when the screen is on .
neutral	this was a present for my daughter who didn_'_t want to wait for me to return this and get another and luckily isn_'_t bothered about the camera , so i '_ve decided to keep it , but next time i will be wary of believing the descriptions stated .
neutral	i ordered some tube and rod from theplasticsshop .
neutral	as they offered free cutting i thought it would be easier for me to have some of the lengths pre_- cut .
neutral	the accuracy was very poor , up to 0mm out on a 00mm length and they were hand cut nowhere_near square .
neutral	one set of parts were mis_- cut by a fatcor of ten , i ordered 00mm and recieved 000mm ( ish ).
neutral	the delivery was fast so i would be tempted to use them again but the free cutting is not an option .
neutral	service fine , but instruction what to do with key not found by me !
neutral	fortunately had steam account so knew procedure
neutral	i wanted to buy a guitar .
neutral	i spent much time online deciding which one and from whom i ' d buy .
neutral	gg seemed a good choice .
neutral	so , i put my trust in them and my money .
neutral	in return , i got not a brand_new guitar but a shop_soiled one sold as brand_new .
neutral	admittedly it was newish but not brand_new .
neutral	i loathe being_conned .
neutral	of course , had i been in the shop , they ' d not have done that since i would have noticed .
neutral	but buying blind online , on trust alone , seems they saw a chance to pass off something inferior as brand_new .
neutral	they claim to check all items before sending ...
neutral	whatever , i played it and liked it .
neutral	there were some manufacturing marks but nothing too drastic .
neutral	to avoid the ' to and fro ' hassle of returns which i dislike , i thought if they offered it to me at a good shop - soiled price , i ' d likely accept it .
neutral	however , they seemed uninterested in that and intent on replacing it with a new one from the manufacturer .
neutral	they could not offer a replacement soon .
neutral	i decided to cancel .
neutral	it was then an offer was made to sell at a shop - soiled price .
neutral	i accepted the offer .
neutral	i should add that they apologised , were polite and did not ignore my emails .
neutral	point is i should not have been put in that position .
neutral	i should have been given what i ordered and paid for .
neutral	as it is the experience was sullied .
neutral	i ordered two cheap pairs of their " basic " range which eventually arrived ok .
neutral	i was careful to order the right prescription and sure_enough the glasses were fine and corrected my vision properly .
neutral	sadly after a few_days they started to go_wrong because honestly the build quality is rubbish .
neutral	the folding arms became_loose which meant the glasses fell_off my nose every time i leaned my head forward .
neutral	after about a week one of the two screws which hold the arms in place fell out and disappeared which meant i now had a one - armed pair of specs .
neutral	i e_- mailed selectspecs asking if they would send me a replacement screw .
neutral	amazingly however they do not know what kind of screws they use in their glasses so asked me to " send them a photo ."
neutral	they want me to remove the remaining surviving screw and photograph it so they know what sort of screw to send me as replacement .
neutral	anyone who_wears glasses knows that these screws are very very tiny so i am still trying to work out how i can possibly get a decent photo with a normal camera rather_than an electron microscope .
neutral	i think i might just bin the glasses and give up .
neutral	i wish there were some middle ground between having to deal with goofy things like this and being robbed blind at uk high_street " opticians ".
neutral	only a so - so review as after waiting a week for delivery i found out that the item hadn_'_t been dispatched .
neutral	arrived next_day once i queried its whereabouts so 00 / 00 for the customer_services group who sorted it out !
neutral	!
neutral	no info on account about status of order - e . g .
neutral	pending / dispatched etc .
neutral	the product looks great but their customer service is poor , yet another company that makes promises that just let the customer down and do not give a truthful straight_forward answer .
neutral	places my order was told that one item was not in stock , waited 0_weeks to be told that 0 item was no_longer avalble ( even_though still advertised on site ).
neutral	was told to change my order in the basket even_though it was not posible as i did try .
neutral	cancelld the order and got a refund , i do not think i will bother to use then ever again
neutral	if they had sent the rest of the order all would be fine but withholding the order to wait for one part made me go else whare for my goods
neutral	although the service was friendly and very helpful , unfortunately the car was not supplied in a condition that i would consider safe .
neutral	the booking was for collect from pietermaritzburg and return at johannesburg a journey of 000ish km .
neutral	i was advised that the tyre_pressures had been checked and were correct , on checking for my own peace of mind , i found the drivers_side tyre at 0 . 0 psi and the passengers side at 0 . 0 psi .
neutral	i would recommend everyone double checks everything and not take their word for it .
neutral	the quality and speed of print production is excellent .
neutral	the choice is almost overwhelming at first .
neutral	it '_s a shame that the reception experience is not more friendly and welcoming .
neutral	while the product wasn_'_t what i wanted , the return process and refund was all dealt_with in good time .
neutral	didn_'_t have to chase them .
neutral	i was told i will get next_day delivery if you order before 0pm on a thursday i did not receive my product till the monday not happy with the service
neutral	i ' d like the option to pay for standard royal_mail first_class delivery rather_than have to pay for recorded delivery .
neutral	set_up fairly easy but wanted to pay by debit_card which was refused as was the first credit_card i tried to pay with the second credit_card was accepted .
neutral	when i checked with my bank neither of the refused cards had a stop on them so why did xend refuse then ?
neutral	delighted to find at geneva_airport that i was offered a 0x0 audi quattro instead of my prebooked vw_golf for a ski_trip in the alps on saturday 00th_jan . everything_went well until i arrived at my destination , where , unfortunately i stalled the engine while parking and was unable to restart it .
neutral	the dashboard display in german indicated that a safety lock system had come on and that i should consult the handbook .
neutral	i did this to find that it was in german and i couldn_'_t read it .
neutral	i tried to find german speakers in the hotel , but had no luck .
neutral	telephoning the contact_numbers for europcar in geneva put me onto a recorded_message in french only , which happily i understood , but when i keyed the number for breakdown assistance i was transferred back to the original list of recorded options , which was very frustrating .
neutral	i redialled but had the same experience the second time .
neutral	luckily while this was going on , my wife noticed another audi quattro being parked nearby .
neutral	she asked the driver for advice , and he kindly sorted the problem out for us .
neutral	in ' safelock ' mode the quattro cannot be started unless the clutch is depressed .
neutral	of course the problem was relatively trivial and obviously when first starting the car i must have inadvertantly depressed the clutch , not my usual practise .
neutral	however , surely a company the size of europcar could have basic vehicle instructions in 0 or three european languages .
neutral	secondly i feel that a 0day 00 hour manned breakdown telephone service is a reasonable expectation .
neutral	if my problems had been of a more serious nature it would have been impossible to get any advice or assistance until monday_morning .
neutral	placed my order and 0days_later i '_m still_waiting on it arriving .
neutral	not very impressed .
neutral	goods got despatched ok but their courier service is rubbish !
neutral	ordered frontline_flea_treatment which was fine .
neutral	having to walk 0 . 0 miles three_days_later to post_office , far from ideal .
neutral	gpo left a card saying that i was out , when i believe i was in .
neutral	message in window saying where to leave if i was out was not followed .
neutral	wish you would use a courier firm as they are generally better .
neutral	i will think_twice about using you again .
neutral	product has a good high protection level .
neutral	the last time i bought this lotion there was a £ 0 + price cut offer per bottle .
neutral	this was not available this time , so i had to order 0 bottles to make the high delivery cost affordable .
neutral	as we haven_'_t made a claim , we cannot fully comment on the quality of healthy_pets , but the purchase of the policy , the policy itself and the price paid seem fair .
neutral	the booking on line was easy .
neutral	the company in malta were helpful but totally disorganised .
neutral	the transport had the wrong name and hotel .
neutral	after the company sorted this they made the same mistake on the way home despite having reconfirmed the travel_arrangements .
neutral	unfortunately no provision for delivery specifics . parcel delivery people insisting on a signature , no body to receive parcel what do you do . able to give secure delivery ! 0 phone_calls later we can only hope eurofit have spoken to parcel del !. adice on delivery time would not have helped anyway .
neutral	item payed for surely a receipt left would suffice ?
neutral	service was exemplary , supplied without_fuss and speedily , just was expecting more robust product
neutral	worktop_express lost my email ?, even_though they remembered to take my money .
neutral	the worktop arrived eventually and i have no_problems .
neutral	the staff were very helpful but i would have expected the delivery charge to have been wavered once they realised they had taken almost a month to deliver the worktop .
neutral	ordered ariston europrisma water_heater along with expansion_vessel and pressure reducing valve .
neutral	had to chase after a few_days after_hearing_nothing , only to be told was vessel was out of stock , that it had just came and , was to be shipped on a 0 - 0 day service .
neutral	issues :
neutral	- it would have been nice to have been immediately notified item / s were out of stock ( website / phone / email ... anything ), instead of being left in the dark and having to chase them .
neutral	- delivery was not via interlink_express / dpd 00 or with 0 hour delivery window that was supposed to come as ' standard ' ( my order was £_000 +).
neutral	overall , i would order again from edd , but would suggest they look at how these small things may lose them customers who may pay a few more pounds , but have peace of mind from larger seller who will honour these things .
neutral	ordered 00 batteries but only 0 sent .
neutral	very good value so , really , not worth the effort to chase up the tenth .
neutral	disappointing though - but a good product at a good price
neutral	well_designed villa and contained all that we had been promised , swimming_pool , table_tennis , pool_table but it just lacked a good clean .
neutral	also the drains backed_up most days and so you had to run the taps on all wash basins for 0 minutes to clear the smell for an_hour or two ..
neutral	the cleaner came mid - week and took out our waste bins which we did every day anyway and also made our daughters bed .
neutral	rather annoyingly she arrived at 0 : 00 am on the morning of our departure which was not helpful as we had allowed until 00 : 00 am to pack and leave for the airport .
neutral	the company in general are very good .
neutral	i '_ve had no_problems with my phone or service ...
neutral	but just be careful when they call you to try sell you upgrades , i often get called from vodafone asking if i want to upgrade , when they really mean ' buy a 0nd line and pay for both '.
neutral	my mum got caught out with this scam but luckily she realised within the time she is aloud to cancel her " 0nd line "
neutral	so overall .
neutral	the company and the service is brilliant .
neutral	but put the phone down if they try to offer you an early upgrade .
neutral	its never real .
neutral	the service was very good and staff helpful but i don_'_t think i ' d order varifocals again as without the custom measuring done by the optician the final product may not have the optimised focal fit .
neutral	despite ordering the most expensive lens they aren_'_t a patch on my old nikon lenses .
neutral	poor prices slow to process
neutral	ordered a polisher from them , they contacted me saying the order has_been cancelled , phoned them up to find out why , but they said it may not go through as i have missed the next_day delivery slot .
neutral	in the end it did turn_up next_day , so im none the wiser why it was cancelled in the first place
neutral	hi , we thought the location was good , the speed at which we were picked_up by the mini_bus was good and the cost was fair .
neutral	i would however like to draw attention to the driver of the bus who was in no way anything other than a driver , this may be what he is employed to do rather_than a driver who actually moves from his seat and assists the elderly and infirm with cases particularly when the cases need to be put up on the rack rather_than stored on the floor .
neutral	i myself struggled to lift the cases as did a number of other passengers , as we are regular travelers it would be of benefit to us to know what the role of the driver actually is .
neutral	i '_ve ordered about £_000 of things over four orders since starting to use tohc in summer .
neutral	the first botched delivery took 0_weeks and there '_s still an item in dispute , the second took 0_weeks , third 0_weeks , and the latest a much more reasonable one week .
neutral	if the delivery performance stays around a week to ten days , then i will keep on using them .
neutral	they generally discount their prices for purchases made on wednesdays and at the weekend , at which time their prices are good .
neutral	and if you can put_together an order for £_00 or more delivery is free .
neutral	the online forum that they host is the only reason i carried on using them after the atrocious start to my ordering from them .
neutral	the forum is friendly , active , questions posted are replied to by genuinely knowledgeable and helpful people who are keen to help out and willing to spend a few minutes passing on helpful information .
neutral	day started well in nottingham on my stag_do with paintball which was awesome , we then went to book into our hotel_rooms to find there had been not rooms booked and we were left waiting for approximately an hours ( vital time on your stag_do ) eventually we where put in a taxi to the other side of town moving us away from hooters where we had to be in 00_mins .
neutral	this as you can_imagine put a dampener on the evening .
neutral	hooters was brilliant as expected !!!
neutral	after that we had a good lads night out on the town .
neutral	not sure i would use chillisauce again unless they sort_out there confirmation of rooms and follow_up issues with some type of apology as hopefully i only have one stag_do ...
neutral	i was sent the standard package when i had ordered the deluxe and had been sent a different vase from the one i had ordered - all resulting in a waste of roughly_£_00 .
neutral	good range of products , sometimes it can be a bit cluttered with lots of products , offers on screen and confusion between used and new is not always clear .
neutral	normally , purchasing from ss is straightforward .
neutral	however , this time the site seemed to freeze at the payment validation step and i had to call the 0000 number to purchase the desired items .
neutral	it is rather frustrating when this happens and wastes time .
neutral	i have been using the whisky_exchange for a few_years to send bottles to various customers , however , the web_site is cumbersome when trying to do this .
neutral	ideally you would fill your basket with ( n ) bottles and then dispatch them individually to addressees from your address book and have one credit_card transaction .
neutral	the experience on the whole was good however what the advert stated and what you got was two different things ... it stated there was a socket for a portable music player ... there isnt ... and it also stated a leather steering_wheel with aluminium trim .. it isnt ..
neutral	i '_m_sure that we are not alone in finding it very hard to purchase from one of the only su [ pliers in britain who will not offer a trade account .
neutral	as such i keep purchases to a minimum & have worked to buy parts elesewhwre wherever_possible .
neutral	the staff i have dealt_with do seem helpful & professional , but they are restricted in what they can do .
neutral	goods received as ordered .
neutral	apart_from one being red and the other yellow , there is no difference at all between the long handled fine and the long handled style combs - not that i can see !
neutral	purchased a table and directors chair set as a bundle package whilst it was on offer for £_000 , then a few_days_later i receive a promotional email , with the same products for £_000 !
neutral	slightly_disappointed !
neutral	at first the smokerelief kit does its job but after a couple of weeks the batteries noticeably weaken and the pulls are weaker as well as the batteries and capsules not lasting as long .
neutral	the batteries will need replacing often if you stick with this .
neutral	there are more enjoyable , longer_lasting products on the market .
neutral	the smokerelief flavours however are pleasant .
neutral	informação sobre a encomenda pouco esplicita
neutral	excellent prices and the order was made .
neutral	after_placing the order i immediately amended the order with minutes of placing the order and was charged for the amends .
neutral	then the glasses turned_up without the amends despite_being charged .
neutral	no in process of waiting for a response after returning the incorrect glasses .
neutral	not happy as all i wanted was a refund the changes that weren_'_t made and am now living without the glasses whilst i wait and hear nothing .
neutral	i had very productive conversations with the local_branch ( coalville ) but as i had to book using the website to get the best deal , this created barriers with delay .
neutral	i am hoping that the local service element will come into play , but have yet to see if it can indeed make up for hte shortcomings of the website management approach .
neutral	i thought the process of the loan went_smoothly without_any hitches .
neutral	one draw back was the process of the loan i don_'_t agree with , is your loan being paid into the gauarator bank_account and not the borrower .
neutral	it make you feel you are not trusted , even when you have had a existing loan , and taking a top up loan out .
neutral	amigo_loans in my option should review this process .
neutral	i am still_waiting for my order to arrive .
neutral	i am not sure why it took so long to ship it .
neutral	i place the order on january 00 , 0000 and it was shipped on fenruary 0 , 0000 .
neutral	that to me is not acceptable in today '_s online world .
neutral	have ordered a couple of times in the last month and both_times took 0 - 0 days to receive goods , certainly not as quick as crc and planet x , 0 days for them .
neutral	quick , efficient delivery service without_question
neutral	have purchased more than once in house product for hp_printer , not all units have worked with the printer .
neutral	potential_clients would need to be reasonably fit to negotiate steep stairs to upper sections of the hotel .
neutral	breakfast was cooked well but could have been a bit more substantial .
neutral	also because of a lack of parking and having to park and ride it would be useful to let guests know before they arrive
neutral	...
neutral	but the help line ( i rang them twice on this matter ) could not explain in simple english one of the most fundamental questions : what exactly the " settle " button does and how do we know the figures it gives is correct - yet every night we are told to press it , print it and throw_away the report it creates .
neutral	what is going on - does anyone really know ?
neutral	saying it pushes the payment to the bank - so what ?
neutral	why do i need a report for that .
neutral	why are there so many breakdowns in the printout ?
neutral	why is the settle figure different from the z ( end of day ) figure ?
neutral	something bigger is going on and i am exasperated that i have no understanding of it .
neutral	its my money and i want to know !
neutral	turned_up to get tyre fitted but was left waiting in the reception as the lone assistant answered phone_call after phone_call giving priority to incoming_calls rather_than dealing_with a customer physically on the premises .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t prepaid for the tyre i would have walked out and gone elsewhere or would have rang the branch on my mobile from their reception to discuss my fitting and been seen quicker
neutral	easy to operate on - line system and the purchase of boiler , flue kit was straightforward .
neutral	to be fair it was the delivery company that failed to turn_up on the delivery day blaming it on no - one answering a phone .
neutral	surely any delivery company worth its salt would at_least attempt to reach the delivery address .
neutral	not there one .
neutral	so don_'_t rely_on the product reaching you as specified .
neutral	when the delivery guy turned_up he dropped the box the flowers came in and getting it wet and damaging some of the flowers .
neutral	lucky my gf was still happy as it '_s the thought that counts .
neutral	its useful over all and can save you money .
neutral	the premium account its not very different than the basic one .
neutral	and chashback takes usually long time to pay to your bank_account .
neutral	( 0 / 0 months even 0 months )
neutral	some time its disappointing , like when the order didn_'_t tracked by quidco and you need to claim the order , its takes_ages to approve and confirmed .
neutral	over all i think its good idea to have it but be patient .
neutral	0 / 00
neutral	everything seemed to be going swimmingly hence the 0_stars until it came to the finance suppliers .
neutral	regardless of having several_hundred_pounds a month available income after completing payments on two large loans with my bank .
neutral	i decided to go for the finance_option as it seemed a good deal and i am not inclined to save a large_sum this close to christmas .
neutral	finance was not granted by the supplier so the transaction was never completed .
neutral	will now by the parts i was looking at individually but this leaves me shopping elsewhere as what the attraction was to cyberpowersystem was the complete build already built .
neutral	sorry would have been nice to have the complete build done this side of christmas and sent some business your way as reviews and [_link_] seem to recommend yourselves .
neutral	maybe in a couple of years when i building my next model until then :(
neutral	excellent service and delivery however the joining units from the curved rail to the straight rail fitted_perfectly in the curved section however the rails internal size was smaller i resolved the problem by grinding a few thou off of the joiner however this added a lot of time to what should have been a relatively easy job
neutral	if you are going to include batteries with an order , ones that work would be good !
neutral	one half_dead , other totally dead .
neutral	it was great shopping , but i am considering to high for shipping for the item i had purchase and also do not see united_states postal service for cheap and fast services .
neutral	placing the order was straight_forward , but had to swop browsers as google - chrome didn_'_t work with the online payment system !
neutral	had to call customer_services twice to find where my order was .
neutral	0st call , stated that i was waiting for an item , despite having been told in was in stock , but goods would be dispatched and delivered thursday , waited in , no delivery !
neutral	call 0nd time , told goods are now with the carrier at the depot , delivery now saturday ( doubtful ) or monday .
neutral	i will have to wait and see but if they don_'_t arrive i will cancel the order and request a refund .. an email_telling of a delay or lack of stock would have stopped the frustration , i doubt if i will buy again due to the reasons stated above .
neutral	the loading was fast and precise .
neutral	the services on the vessel were plentiful and good .
neutral	the journey time was exactly as promised .
neutral	disembarking also fast and precise .
neutral	sadly it was necessary to return a day early from our scheduled 00 day drive in france and spain . this necessitated applying for a change in ticket for the return . the charge for the administration at £_00 one way on an almost empty boat was sheer extortion .......... and dfds know it .
neutral	!
neutral	overall ok but long delivery date and lack of communication about delays spoilt the deal .
neutral	good service and fast delivery
neutral	when the system came ( 0_weeks and few_days ), i was wow !
neutral	loaded up looking good , took important stuff off old system onto new only to have a notification about my windows key not being right .
neutral	turns_out my build should of had vanilla windows 0 but the system has pro on it and the key on the side is for the vanilla so won_'_t work .
neutral	contacted cyber support , fairplay they got back to me next_day but telling_me i have to reinstall windows even_though it was their mistake .
neutral	my dog has cushing '_s disease .
neutral	i live in spain and the medication my dog requires is very expensive here .
neutral	my local_vet tells_me most owners whose dogs are diagnosed with cushing '_s have them put down due to the treatment costs .
neutral	i obtain a prescription from my local_vet and send it to viovet .
neutral	their medication price is fine but because the prescription originates from spain the tablets have to be sent " overseas " viovet postal_charges are excessive .
neutral	i purchase other medication for my wife online from uk , her medication arrives far better packed , and is heavier but the postal_charges are a third of viovet postal_charges .

neutral	i wanted to order on - line to get my lenses quickly as my optician can occasionally be a bit_slow and i needed some new lenses for outdoor use over last weekend in predicted poor weather .
neutral	i was contacted to send confirmation of my prescription , which caused a delay and the whole_process was slower_than if i ' d gone_through the usual channel .
neutral	i did not see anything on the on - line booking process which said this would be necessary .
neutral	i will use my own optician in future .
neutral	the site has loads of choice which is great .
neutral	unfortunately they sent me the wrong_size for both_pairs i ordered .
neutral	had to send them back which was fairly easy .
neutral	delivery i think is too slow by today '_s standard , even_though it is free .
neutral	and no delivery on saturday which is really disappointing , be nice to have my new trainers for the weekend !
neutral	organised service and friendly , but unhappy with the price after doing further research .
neutral	for headlight re alignment and bulb replacement cost £_00 quid including mot .
neutral	in reply to this they offered me a £_00 refund which i accepted
neutral	the item took too long to arrive considering delivery cost £ 0 . 00 , i didn_'_t receive the item for a few_days , the courier failed to collect the item twice .
neutral	so_far , i '_ve been impressed with the coffee '_s that i make using the espresso capsules ( usually used to make small to medium latte '_s ).
neutral	however my nespresso_machine is 00 + years old , and still going_strong , and these capsules are just slightly too large .
neutral	so i have to been more hands - on when making coffee .
neutral	if the capsules were the same size then i ' d have given 0 or 0_stars .
neutral	its ok . its not particularly cheaper_than any other online shop
neutral	sink ordered was a very good price but took longer_than_expected to deliver and then when it arrived it had the overflow missing which as on this model of sink is at the rear will necessitate the removal of the fitted sink to install .
neutral	too many emails and text '_s regarding the purchase ; in fact so much it puts me off further_purchases .
neutral	the whole image on reflection is of a " flash " marketing operation buying in volume from india and china !
neutral	quality appears to be ok but time will tell .
neutral	pushing the polish is like extended_warranties at curry '_s ; gives the impression of obviously massive margins for the shop .
neutral	otherwise my wife ( sue ) appears to be happy with the purchase .
neutral	even_though the flowers were very nice , the order was fulfilled .
neutral	but for some reason when you enter address it somehow changed on both delivery address and billing_address .
neutral	hence the flowers were delivered to the wrong_address .
neutral	trouble also could not find a contact number so had to send email .
neutral	not the same as dealing_with a person .
neutral	tablets were a lot cheaper_than from the vets but delivery was very slow .
neutral	the ordering_process was excellent and being_able to configure an all in one pc to a very high specification for the price was a big plus .
neutral	i chose to have a blank pc with no os as i had some spare windows 0 pro licenses .
neutral	i contacted pc_specialists 00 working_days after my order as it was not even registering as in build .
neutral	i was informed that they had a problem with a batch of chasis and they were meant to be in tomorrow ( thursday ) the guy said he would rush the build due to the wait and put the pc on special saturday delivery if it was ready to post on friday .
neutral	it had been quite a long time but i was happy with the response .
neutral	i got an email it had been posted friday but delivery was not on saturday as promised but on monday .
neutral	when the all in one pc arrived i was very happy with the quality for the price , the only
neutral	problem with it at all was they had installed windows 0 home version , so just made installing my version take a bit longer , i am not sure why they give a no o / s installed version then install one .
neutral	but as the title_states i would rate the actual kit and price as 0_stars only gave three due to timescales , being told i would get free saturday delivery and not and being told no o / s would be installed when it was but overall very happy and would reccomend them if you do not mind waiting a month .
neutral	the photbook ( when it arrived ) was very well printed - however , it was despatched on 00th . august and we still hadn_'_t received it on sat . 00th ..
neutral	when ringing jessops we spoke to someone in germany who promised that the postage would be refunded and that somebody from the uk would be in touch on tues . 00th ..
neutral	it is now weds . 00th .
neutral	nad we are still_waiting for the call - not good enough jessops !
neutral	nordicagolf deal and dispatch orders efficiently but their choice of delivery service ( dhl ) let them down .
neutral	a missed parcel is not left at any of the nieghbours houses and their online re delivery service does not work because they do not recognise parcel numbers so thanks to dhl still not got your parcel .
neutral	website good , easy to use but if tyres are not available they should not be offered , especially as deal of the day
neutral	why would i write to a friend who gave_me a parking service ?
neutral	as ever with such web sites you get working solution then someone comes up with a " bright idea " and the process changes .
neutral	i do not use the service very often , thank_goodness given the cost , but the process worked and i would like to think i could follow the same process the next time .
neutral	yes is worked .
neutral	expensive as all parking at airports are - closed market and no completion .
neutral	what did concern me was that i have an expensive car that i do cherish ., there was no personnel visible .
neutral	there may have been cameras as in a airport you would expect that but the price paid for the service then you would expect at_least some visibility .
neutral	i guess it would not be a great job and career limiting but .....
neutral	the friction was the cost ... at_least dick turpin had the decency to wear a mask .
neutral	i purchased a north_face jacket i received jacket within a good time but when i checked it there was a musty smell and things in the pockets i complained to customer service and i '_m waiting on another jacket !
neutral	other than the state of the jacket i was very happy with webtogs !
neutral	prices are ok but range of wholesale products is pretty bad to be honest .
neutral	there are better online japanese food stores out there .
neutral	the service itself is very quick , from scanning the items in to receiving payment , so top_marks there .
neutral	the prices offered aren_'_t amazing , but neither did i expect them to be , so no real issues there either .
neutral	the one thing that bothers me is that so many of my discs were considered " damaged ", which meant ziffit keep them , offer me no money , and i know for a fact they played .
neutral	feels a bit like i '_ve had them stolen to be honest .
neutral	there should be a system in place where i can get them back if they ' re not going to buy them .
neutral	edit_: completely understand about your terms and conditions , after all i accepted them when i sent my goods to you .
neutral	you '_ve missed the point of what i am talking_about - i believe they did meet your condition criteria , otherwise i wouldn_'_t have sent them .
neutral	as the process is not transparent at all , how am i supposed to be sure they are recycled and not sold on ?
neutral	i have given this review 0_stars because it '_s hard to assign into one rating a value that represents all_aspects of the transaction and product .
neutral	at a simple level , the web_site , checkout and delivery process was faultless .
neutral	if the rating was about this alone it would be 0_*.
neutral	but i had read_reviews that said this product wouldn_'_t work very well and i decided that those reviews were probably biased and that the product details seemed more valid .
neutral	unfortunately it would seem that the reviews are correct .
neutral	we still have cockroaches and they walk around the traps even_though we have lots of traps out and at a range of locations .
neutral	in 0_weeks , with 00 traps in our kitchen , no roaches caught , but several seen in the open or caught by hand ( glove ).
neutral	in short , you can trust the company to deliver , but their choice of items to stock may be suspect .
neutral	the item i ordered arrived on time and in good condition but had one item within the package incorrect .
neutral	i sent an email to customer_services who stated i had received the order i wanted .
neutral	if i could_find evidence to the contrary in the confirmation_email , let them know and they would investigate_further , needless to say , i could not find the email and so the matter had to be dropped .
neutral	customer service was very helpful and friendly .
neutral	it would have been helpful if they had told me that my course was being made redundant in advance .
neutral	ec0000
neutral	the car we had was a volvo convertible and it did have some issues , the door locks didn_'_t seem to close properly and would cause a dashboard warning_light to come on .
neutral	this meant we had to stop , open all the doors and boot and close them again .
neutral	also because the car didn_'_t think the doors were shut properly , the windows kept going up and down .
neutral	also we booked a saab 00 convertible and although we didn_'_t pay any more i was a bit unhappy at the change .
neutral	the car was economical and the staff were nice though and i would hire again .
neutral	no issues with the product that was great , but delivery was slow this time .
neutral	usually next_day great service but this time it took 0 extra days which was particularly awkward as it was being delivered to a clients site and i have to keep apologising for the failure of the package to turn_up when expected .
neutral	i am reviewing the post_office here today .
neutral	never had any complaints with letter deliveries nor parcel deliveries before .
neutral	but setting_foot in wythenshawe post_office , manchester and having committed the apparent mortal sin of putting a couple of staples in a bubblewrap envelope i certainly would never ever go in there again !
neutral	so this is for the assistant_manager at wythenshawe post_office :
neutral	" hail mary full of grace .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	amen " i '_ve said it ten times along with 0 our fathers and hope my soul has now been cleansed !!
neutral	:)
neutral	i have had a co - op bank credit_card now for many_years .
neutral	back in the old days they were throwing cheque books at me , and giving an unnecessarily high credit_limit .
neutral	i reduced my limit voluntarily to £ 0 , 000 .
neutral	this week i have a payment and security_deposit on an enterprise hire van declined .
neutral	guess why ?
neutral	because the co - op reduced my credit to £_000 .
neutral	no postal communication was received .
neutral	( how is it letters from other banks seem to arrive ok but not the co - op ?
neutral	it leads me to believe they were never sent in the first place ).
neutral	i am 00 years old , a property owner , with above national average savings .
neutral	so as far as i '_m concerned my credit worthiness is rock_solid .
neutral	or is it ageism you are now applying co - op ?
neutral	i wonder .
neutral	i understand the co - op has quite_frankly ended_up in the creek .
neutral	they are going to make thousands redundant .
neutral	i also personally believe they are restricting access to the extremely low rates they were offering me on this card compared to modern day rates , and this may have happened to many , many others too .
neutral	whatever the case i do most strongly object to submitting a card to a van hire company and having it declined and having to use my daily shopping lloyds card instead !!
neutral	my credit_limit was £ 0 , 000 .
neutral	i didn_'_t even have £_000 used out of this , and to top it all i pay regular amounts throughout the month by lloyds fast payment into the co - op to keep my bills down .
neutral	update november 00 : and here we are , coming up to a month later and no reply from co - operative banking .
neutral	need i say any more ?
neutral	it was a shame as i misread the size of this diary .
neutral	whilst it is very good and comprehensive , it is too large for me and i don ; t think they do one these days at the size and info that i want .
neutral	it is a shame , but i still use it as i haven ; t yet found one to better it !
neutral	i placed an order several weeks_ago and it is still outstanding .
neutral	to their credit , there have been automated updates , but i am frustrated not to have my items yet .
neutral	also , sent an email asking advice and hoping to add to my order given it was still outstanding , but the email was not responded to .
neutral	i subsequently purchased these items independently and they were promptly received .
neutral	order submitted to ffx which processed professionally and rapidly with updates sent to keep me informed of order progress .
neutral	dpd announced they would deliver on the date and time specified but never arrived and reported that the order had been received and signed for - it may well have been but not by me or anyone i know .
neutral	slow to respond to emails requesting information and a let_down to ffx who are extremely efficient .
neutral	update_:
neutral	success !
neutral	i can confirm that the issues i have had with regus have now been resolved , thanks to their dedicated customer service team at surrey .
neutral	for the way that their customer service team handled the situation , i have altered the rating from being a one star to a three star_review .
neutral	unfortunately , due to the experience i have had , i won_'_t be retracting my original review as i think people should still be aware of the potential issues they can come_across when dealing_with regus .
neutral	original review :
neutral	- hidden_charges .
neutral	at no point did the salesman , edward discuss the additional services mentioned in the terms and conditions .
neutral	he discussed rent rates , telephone and internet rates so why not point out the other charges as well .
neutral	i get the impression that they play a game of " who can we catch out " with prospective_customers .
neutral	their abuse of trust is morally and ethically disgusting and i hope they are investigated for their deception .
neutral	you only have to type " regus " and " complaints " in google to see that i am not the only one affected by this .
neutral	- extremely poor reception , call answering and mail service .
neutral	on numerous_occasions , i had calls to my mobile from clients and prospective_clients saying that i hadn_'_t returned their call .
neutral	why ?
neutral	because i never got the message , that '_s why !
neutral	i even spoke with the receptionist , christine , about whether anyone had come into the building asking for my company to which she replied " yes , someone called richard was asking for you but i told_him you weren_'_t here so he left ".
neutral	this was a prospective customer who i have since never_heard from and presumably he has chosen to use a different company .
neutral	there was no attempt made to take his details so i couldn_'_t follow_up on his visit .
neutral	i will be looking into the " supply of services and goods_act_0000 " to establish whether regus are in breach of contract by not carrying out their duties adequately .
neutral	as a direct result of choosing regus , i have lost business .
neutral	- poor office conditions .
neutral	my office was centrally_located in the building so i had no windows to help cool down .
neutral	even in the winter_months , i had to leave my door open to ensure a steady supply of fresh_air .
neutral	and just 0 months before my contract was due to end , i found out that a business opposite mine ( in a similar_sized office ) had air_conditioning controls !
neutral	why do some have it and not others ?
neutral	- damaged reputation .
neutral	i referred a client ( and a good friend ) to regus for a short_term office ( this was before i was fully_aware of how regus operate ).
neutral	at no point did regus head_office or centre management acknowledge the referral .
neutral	he only had the office for 0 months but since leaving , he has had numerous issues with regus ( major accounting errors , false charges etc_.)
neutral	and is now on poor terms with me as a result of the recommendation .
neutral	this particular client has quite a high spend with me and i may lose a considerable_amount of business as a result of this .
neutral	do not recommend anyone to regus .
neutral	- security .
neutral	the lights in the office are automatic - they only turn on when someone is in the room and stay on for about 00 - 00_minutes after leaving .
neutral	a few_times on arriving at the office , i noticed that the lights were already on before entering ( and sometimes late at night when i decided to pop in to do a bit of work out of hours ) so i questioned the center manager , sharon , about this .
neutral	she told me that the cleaning staff had key access to all the offices to ensure they could carry out their duties even when the offices are locked .
neutral	this was very concerning to me as i use a lot of expensive equipment , software and also stored confidential documents in the office .
neutral	fortunately i never had to report a theft but my office was at the mercy of their security practices - a scary thought when they aren_'_t even able to take messages for me !
neutral	in conclusion , regus are a cowboy_outfit .
neutral	they rely_on their global brand to create the impression of trust and use deceptive and misleading sales_tactics to lure you into a false_sense of security .
neutral	i ordered pairs of plain wireless reading_glasses .
neutral	one ' frame ' wasn_'_t initially available but the first pair arrived very promptly and i was pleased with quality and style .
neutral	however , within a week the screw in one arm fell out giving me cause for concern with quality .
neutral	returns were very responsive and instructions were easy to follow .
neutral	a week_later the 0nd pair arrived and are fine ( so_far ) but i '_m disappointed at the delivery and repair times .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting after another week for the repair ( a single screw ) to be fixed .
neutral	i '_ll reserve_judgement but it shakes ones confidence when the glasses come apart in a week .
neutral	one ' even better if ' : the weight and size of the glasses case is huge and heavy and as a bloke i carry my glasses in my pocket , not a hand bag , so i ' d really like to see light_weight and smaller glasses cases .
neutral	quick dispatch .
neutral	items returned .
neutral	returns_department lost my parcel in the warehouse ... found it after 0_weeks .
neutral	here comes my reviewsdf sdfsf
neutral	i thought the " bath buddy " for kiddies was a great idea , sadly it wouldnt stick on the bottom of the bath and kept deflating .
neutral	the shower timer was stuck and the sand wouldnt run thro it .
neutral	i '_m an 00 year_old student from birmingham and i ordered a gladiator mask for halloween to resemble one of my favourite rappers ; mf doom .
neutral	they sent me a cannibal mask - like the one hannibal lecter wore .
neutral	they sent the correct one out the next_day , after i rang them , and i have sent back the wrong mask .
neutral	they said they would refund the postage it cost me to return it , but as soon as i said i had sent it , i haven_'_t received an email or refund from them .
neutral	everything fine but a wait of over an_hour to be served at rome fiumincino airport ( by hertz ) on a sunday_afternoon was dreadful .
neutral	also directions and signage from booking desk to collection_point were poor - several of us all wandering_around looking lost but found it in the end .
neutral	as i would expect from such a company the quality of the product is very good and the speed of delivery was excellent .
neutral	however the devil is , as they say , in the detail .
neutral	i ordered as follows_:
neutral	" origin ( blackout )- snow - roller 000 . 0cm ( w ) * 000cm ( d )
neutral	recess
neutral	controls - left
neutral	straight - finish 0 "
neutral	what i received was a blind 000 . 0cm ( w ) and a controls – right .
neutral	fortunately the slots in the mounting_brackets allowed adjustment inward but this has left a small gap_between the wall and the brackets instead of the flush mounting that i had measured , to the mm , for .
neutral	i can only_assume that a misread eight became the three quoted on the delivery information .
neutral	when i went to school we were educated in the international system of units ( abbreviated si from french : système international d ' unités ) which is the modern form of the metric system which measures in mm and not cm .
neutral	if that system of measurement had been observed perhaps this 0mm error would not have occurred .
neutral	the control left or right made little difference in the event , but it was not as ordered .
neutral	further , there was no instruction regarding how to either fit the chain or how to set it such that the connector did not meet the gear wheel .
neutral	simple enough to work out i suppose , but not for everybody .
neutral	not particular good value , the biltong pack contained just a few very small pieces of meat .
neutral	i ' d also echo the comments about the high sugar content of some of the snacks .
neutral	i didn_'_t like at all how clumsy and difficult it was to cancel .
neutral	i would have thought that the easy way was to click on my account in the top right after logging in with a simple one click option to cancel , but it '_s not like this at all .
neutral	cancelling is hidden away and made deliberately difficult and i really , really don_'_t like that .
neutral	it '_s sharp_practice .
neutral	i always spread the good when it happens , but i also share the disappointment when it happens sadly .& thierry customer service is a lot to be desired or am i believe in thinking what customer service ????
neutral	does it exist mighty no so good deals .
neutral	the coffee from fine_coffee_club is fine - nothing special , but perfectly ok .
neutral	the pods don_'_t work as well as the proper nespresso ones , there is still some leaking past the pod even with the new design .
neutral	all of the little niggles would be forgivable if they were significantly_cheaper_than official nespresso_pods , but they aren_'_t .
neutral	they are slightly_cheaper but not enough to make it worth putting up with the problems .
neutral	for a few_pence more you can have lovely coffee delivered from a pod that works every time , no mess , no_hassle .
neutral	it might be worth it for some but i '_ll be sticking with official nespresso for a while longer yet .
neutral	local_store seldom has the offers advertised and specual offers appear to be less_than special
neutral	buying tickets second_hand introduces a stressful delay in obtaining the tickets .
neutral	basically you can '_t be certain that you will attend the event , only that you won_'_t pay if you don_'_t .
neutral	at these prices you can travel to other venues with greater ticket availability and pay the same .
neutral	gardens0less is a great site for some of the greatest deals you could hope for , supper_fast delivery and great customer service .
neutral	but
neutral	if the site would allow you to open an online account it would save all the hassles of entering all of your details everytime you purchase from them .
neutral	that one small item makes the web_site long behind the times .
neutral	ordered some dog_food at a good price on the sunday .
neutral	recieved an email from the courier , apc_overnight , on tuesday informing_me that the goods would be delivered on wednesday .
neutral	so_far no_complaints .
neutral	having stayed in all day they did not arrive_till thursday_morning only to find that the packaging had been damaged .
neutral	i compained to animed who immediatly offered to replace the product or refund some of the purchase price ( just under 00 %).
neutral	i took the refund option as i had run out f the food .
neutral	having said all that i would use animed again if the price is competitive , just hope they change courier !
neutral	i have placed an order and this has_been acknowledged by an email_saying the the table is expected to be available from 00th_may and that i will be contacted shortly_thereafter about delivery / collection .
neutral	as i have paid £_00 . 00 for delivery i expect this to be method chosen .
neutral	until the table arrives i am unable to comment further on the service .
neutral	i '_m not fully sure about these_people .
neutral	they '_ve take almost £_000 from me , yet where exactly are the results ?
neutral	i could have just gone to the . gov site and paid £_000 and received the same service , or lack of it .
neutral	time has yet to tell whether i '_ve been legally conned or trade_mark direct ltd are genuine .
neutral	i '_ll form an opinion when i have a fact and not a promise .
neutral	i don_'_t know why exactly these_people want feedback before any facts exists for me to give feedback .
neutral	~ ajr
neutral	i ordered 0 identical bookcases from paperstone .
neutral	one came very quickly , but the other was out of stock ( something not made clear when i ordered it ).
neutral	a subsequent delivery date was also not met , and i am still_awaiting delivery of it .
neutral	true the company has kept me informed , but often via an e_- mail at the last_minute .
neutral	users need to be aware of very low and clearly unrealistic prices being submitted by some hauliers .
neutral	there appears to be a very low entry_level , with no insurance required for example . the owners need to be aware of this as a race to the bottom will drive out many of the competent operators and will lead to poor service and disputes with clients .
neutral	this will damage the site owners .
neutral	business
neutral	mobile is just about acceptable
neutral	not the fastest shipping time to sweden , especially with the high shipping prices .
neutral	a normal royal airmail package usually takes 0 to 0 days to sweden from uk when i have bought from other_sellers in uk , but most of the time i have to wait 00 days or more to get the package from chemical - records .
neutral	i have ordered a few things from techno groom .
neutral	normally they are prompt and good at order picking .
neutral	although the ordering was simple and delivery was prompt considering it was xmas .
neutral	they actually didn_'_t send the item i wanted .
neutral	they sent a two speed clipper instead of a variable one !
neutral	it also states variable on the receipt so i know i have chose and paid for the right one but what i received was a two speed .
neutral	normally i would send back and exchange but i desperately need the clippers for work so do not have the choice to swap as not enough time .
neutral	so will make do for now and when money permits will buy a variable speed one .
neutral	part of the order came promptly .
neutral	however item missing , only mentioned on delivery note .
neutral	0_weeks_later i '_m still_waiting with no update from polybags .
neutral	no intimation on website item was out of stock .
neutral	no updated emails - nothing .
neutral	not too bad an experience but beware , the quote is not the actual price you pay as itr mysteriously goes up .
neutral	enter the same details again and the quoter is the same as before and then goes up when you book .
neutral	still the cheapest ferry_crossing
neutral	i had to look hard on the internet for info re fitting the boards , i was also unaware that they needed to be stored flat , and they warped , which made fitting more difficult , had to use props to jam against wall .
neutral	could have done with more adhesive !
neutral	they look very good .
neutral	was happy with the product but past experiences ordering online youd normally be kept_upto_date with your order for example
neutral	order purchased
neutral	order pending
neutral	order shipped
neutral	abit of communication knowing ya product has_been shipped gives u an idea when to expect a parcel
neutral	the product is great , as is the price .
neutral	the only problem is that gear0music , like so many companies appeared to wash their hands of their responsibility once the product was been picked_up by the courier for delivery .
neutral	in their favour gear0music did respond very well after i alerted them to the fact that my product hadn_'_t been delivered and then later found out when i left the house that morning that it had actually been left on my doorstep overnight .
neutral	hopefully this will have made g0music more aware of the importance of their delivery options and courier company - as important to the customer as the product .
neutral	everything was easy & very straightforward , but the payment system needs serious improvements .
neutral	i find it very strange that these days it should be a cheque payment , it then had to be chased before it arrived .
neutral	very antiquated payment system that it far behind their competitors .
neutral	disappointed with the packaging on the t . v cabinet , it looked as though the cabinet was sent back due to the marks on the right hand door .
neutral	there are are a couple of little dents on the left hand door and one on the top rear left hand_corner .
neutral	the right hand door was not lined_up so i had to take it off realign it and now it is fine , in saying all that i am still pleased with the style and look of the cabinet .
neutral	it has not put me off of purchasing my next piece of furniture which will be a office desk .
neutral	useally a great service but recently very slow posting orders out and as a wholesale customer you tend to feel the company only values it '_s own shops before its long_standing customers
neutral	recently had a holiday to tenerife booked through thomas_cook , it was a very good holiday , the reason i give it 0_stars though is because thomas_cook were pretty unenthusiatic , was informed that we ' d receive a discount card for restaurants , attraction etc .
neutral	plus money off our next holiday , never received .
neutral	and all transport , when part of thomas_cook , was always ridiculously late .
neutral	other than that , i had a great holiday , i would_gladly use thomas_cook again , but feel these are thing thay could work on .
neutral	ordered a 0gbp chainstay protector and received a 0gbp sports_nutrition shake .
neutral	this to me is a monumental cock_up as it '_s not as if you can get the two confused .....
neutral	hopefully this problem will be sorted promptly without hassle .
neutral	ask for reviews after the product has_been fitted rather_than after it has_been paid for .
neutral	the system to book slots for fitting tyres is also poor , it should be possible to view available bookings and select a time , rather_than the booking being sent to the branch and requiring confirmation by them .
neutral	it wouldn_'_t be expensive to set_up .
neutral	i have been a member of my local costco since it opened many_years_ago and i have been a regular customer and a huge_fan .
neutral	two years_ago i would have given them 0_stars without_hesitation .
neutral	recently however i have found their pricing much less competitive , so much so i am beginning to question if my membership is value for money .
neutral	for example :
neutral	books are cheaper on amazon ( with free delivery )
neutral	cameras are cheaper in pc_world and argos
neutral	pcs are cheaper in pc_world
neutral	many foods are cheaper in asda .
neutral	many white goods are cheaper on line without the hassle of arranging your own delivery , installation and disposal .
neutral	once you could almost take it for granted that if it was for sale in costco then you were getting the best price .
neutral	sadly this is no_longer true .
neutral	costco '_s buyers need a wake_up call .
neutral	it is all to easy for consumers to find the best price available .
neutral	it seems that they costco are just too slow to react to price fluctuations in the current fiercely competitive retail environment and if they carry on they will lose out on membership .
neutral	very competitive_pricing and next_day delivery .
neutral	good communications from dv000 , always keeping you advised of what is happening with your order .
neutral	i would have awarded 0_stars , however the supplied power_cable for the fender amplifier had a non - uk_plug fitted .
neutral	and so i had to cut the foreign plug off and fit a uk version instead .
neutral	so sadly minus 0_stars for supplying non - uk product .
neutral	have given a three star as now , only just loaded the inks into my printer should they be as they should perfect then i would rate them higher and use again ..
neutral	my overall experience of surgery was tainted a lack of medical cover when a difficulty arose .
neutral	on a saturday i had excruciating pain in one eye caused_by a complication of surgery .
neutral	despite it occurring on a saturday , it was not possible to see speak to anyone locally at all .
neutral	i ended_up being referred on the telephone in eire .
neutral	i am a big_fan of ellis_brigham and have been a loyal_customer for many_years however i am a little disappointed in the time taken from placing an order to the home delivery .
neutral	having placed a number of orders online following my purchase from eb , every other order arrived before my eb purchase , including a 0nd_class postage from a public bidding site .
neutral	i will_continue to shop with eb however i am confident i will use other for online purchases .
neutral	ok , goods ordered pm , delivery free as order was over £_00 ex / vat , arrived within_00hrs which was fine .
neutral	well_packed , no_breakages .
neutral	but ?
neutral	rather ambiguous on insurance_cover .
neutral	they imply delivery is covered by them however , why have an optional insurance at the check out stage ?
neutral	i will probably use this company again .
neutral	decent product but very small sizing i returned a medium and re ordered an extra large but this was hardly_any bigger and still didn_'_t fit right
neutral	i purchased a bouquet of flowers for my wife on our_wedding_anniversary .
neutral	i placed the order several weeks before the date .
neutral	i upgraded to the " deluxe " version and also added a " romantic cake ".
neutral	the flowers were ok in terms of quality , but the bouquet was significantly smaller than i expected from the description , picture and price .
neutral	the cake was cute to look at but inedible .
neutral	the experience was not so bad that i would make a complaint , but overall it was quite disappointing and i wouldn_'_t use them again .
neutral	i buy flowers for my wife regularly , and this product doesn_'_t compare to other services i have used .
neutral	just my opinion .
neutral	in response to their reply_below ...
neutral	note that their response comes about 0 months after i wrote my initial review .
neutral	while providing me with a list of what " should " have been in the bouquet might have been helpful at the time , the flowers are long since gone and there is no way to " check " now .
neutral	it is true that i made no complaint to customer_services .
neutral	the reason for this is that i have a very busy life and i have bigger things to worry_about and better ways to spend my time than making complaints about a sub - standard bunch of flowers .
neutral	the product was sub - standard for a deluxe_bouquet and instead of wasting my time complaining only to get a " we ' re sorry you were disappointed ", i '_ll vote with my feet and make my experience known to others .
neutral	in short , my response here is simple .
neutral	if you want to buy flowers for someone , you '_ll be better served spending a tenner at tesco or asda than you will be buying a deluxe product from this company .
neutral	if you want a deluxe_bouquet that is worth the money , go to marks &_spencer !
neutral	it appears to be a good policy but the proof is in the pudding .
neutral	how good are you at settling claims without haggle ?
neutral	i would like to see some reviews from customers who have had to make claims .
neutral	they should be the first thing you see on your web_site .
neutral	another small thing is that you say you have frozen prices since last_year but despite the loyalty_discount i still paid about £ 0 more than last_year .
neutral	how come ?
neutral	the loyalty_discount is almost an insult .
neutral	00_% would be a more realistic amount .
neutral	as i say the product appears to be good but i hope i never have to test your claims_procedure .
neutral	the trouble with using royal_mail with an internet retail outfit is their inevitable inability to deliver product in a timely_manner and the customer then has to schlepp off to some remote place open from 0 . 00 am till 0 . 00 am to pick it up ( closed at the weekend ).
neutral	having said that cho seem to be taking over the rm williams space ( i am a fan ).
neutral	so cho - go withe fedex dhl or a bloke on a bike .
neutral	application proses is a bit drawn_out but good overall experience shame about the apr .
neutral	should be lower with a garantor but hay ho if you need the cash , so be it .
neutral	after two_weeks from my order , i had not received any shipping confirmation and the order was still showing as " processing " in my account .
neutral	after writing to the customer_support , though , i got a super - quick response saying the first shipment probably had got lost .
neutral	a new shipment was issued the same day , and arrived two_days after .
neutral	the offers and product range are great .
neutral	the brochure and website are great and two day free delivery would be great but the courier company lets you down .
neutral	on tracking my delivery i found you had dispatched my delivery straight_away but it took another three_days sat at the courier depot before it arrived .
neutral	well , basically i hadn_'_t taken the lock off one of my phones which then dropped the price down by 0 / 0 and then when i asked the customer service for some advice on the matter they didn_'_t give me any information which helped_me , also i also didn_'_t know that envirofone could accept your sale for you , seeming as i wanted to withdraw my phone to unlock it to receive the full payment therefor i '_m not happy with envirofones customer service !
neutral	clear account offer a really good alternative to payday lending and they are cheaper !
neutral	if it wasn_'_t for the constant bank connection errors this would be a 0_star .
neutral	and the frustrating thing is often the error can happen just when you need it most , meaning you are stranded .
neutral	in my particular case i had an_emergency and really needed funds badly .
neutral	i spoke to one of their representatives who told me not to log on to internet_banking for 00_minutes whilst he " did a reset ".
neutral	i waited but the problem continued and was left without access to funds in my clear account all night .
neutral	i tried to call back after the 00_mins but got no answer .
neutral	there is no out of hours support_team which means after 00 : 00 you just can '_t get any help .
neutral	some times the bank connection issue can last a couple of days !
neutral	after my problem i email customer_services and the response was " stock " and not and explanation at all .
neutral	in summary i think it '_s a good service but personally i have had a " hiccup " with an unsatisfactory response .
neutral	the company is not at the terminal when you arrive but it will supply transport to a fantastic facility away from the arport just five_minutes away .
neutral	however after a ten hour flight and three checks through passport_control .
neutral	i arrived to be tenth in a que of never moving people .
neutral	when i reached thr front after an_hour there was 0 staff so i thought this wont take long .
neutral	then three of the seven stff went off duty whilst the que gained momentum .
neutral	so i then got to the front and the staff serving me was pleasant and appologised for the wait , computers then went down back to paper took him nearly three quaters of an_hour two phone_calls to the credit_card company .
neutral	after this he asked me to pay for a full_tank of gas which i gave half back , the car was great new , clean and big enough for all .
neutral	the return went fast and sooth pleasant staff .
neutral	no damage or problems .
neutral	checked with me and recipt given .
neutral	i wwould use again but if the was a que i will not use again .
neutral	all the other carhire places flowed fast whilst we waited .
neutral	i will provide further info should you require .
neutral	great instore service but why can '_t i take it home with me ?
neutral	i had to organise my day around an all day delivery slot , albeit that the slot was later shortened but then the driver came early .
neutral	my order ( euros ) was easy to arrange and the exchange_rate was good - to get better rates requires more anti - money_laundering checks .
neutral	unfortunately , the euros did not arrive on the day arranged .
neutral	i emailed ace - fx ( at approx 00 . 00 ) and got back a very fast reponse that the company would investigate and phone me .
neutral	however , no phone_call - bad for customer_relations .
neutral	i emailed again at about 00 . 00 and did then get back a landline text_message ( these are not great ) and an email_saying that delays are very rare and the order would be with me before 00 . 00 next_day ( which it was ).
neutral	the amount of euros was correct .
neutral	i received the laptop well and in time but three was a dead_pixel on the screen which will not go away .
neutral	i have sent emails to cyber_power about this and have received no answer .
neutral	delivery and comms all fine .
neutral	selection box received .
neutral	the coffee was fine , but the decaf doesn_'_t seem to work properly in our machine ( which is brand_new and does nespresso_capsules just fine ).
neutral	bit of a shame .
neutral	the capsules sometimes aren_'_t punctured properly and lose a lot of the coffee to the drip tray making the amount in the cup much less_than it should be .
neutral	i love superdry products ( probably own more than 00 t - shirts , three jackets , four hoodies , etc and have been a customer since my first buy in london in 0000 ) but was slightly_disappointed with my recent_purchase .
neutral	i had to return the item for a larger_size , and even the new xl product feels smaller than my size l windcheater bought three years_ago .
neutral	also , the finishing of the product was not great .
neutral	i had to remove various ends of threads from sleeves , close to zip areas and even the superdry logo ( orange at base of right sleeve ) was not attached well or carefully .
neutral	i opted for the buy one frame get one frame free deal at the beginning of this year .
neutral	initially all was well with a very good free ' home_trial ' service that i would recommend everyone use before buying .
neutral	upon_receiving my frames ( both from the jeff_banks range ) i noticed that the lenses in one pair sat loose in the frame and could be moved slightly .
neutral	in addition the arms of the frame felt loose and could be twisted slightly from side to side .
neutral	the was a no_quibble return process which was easy apart_from having to pay for it to be recorded delivery .
neutral	glasses_direct make it very clear that it is the customers ' responsibility to ensure the glasses arrive and will accept no responsibility if they are lost in the post .
neutral	they came back to me very quickly - the lens problem was solved ( they arrived with complimentary fingerprints on the lenses !)
neutral	but the arm issue was still present .
neutral	i returned them again for a second time ( and paid the postage again - glasses_direct refused to compensate me for costs at this point ).
neutral	i received a call from an optician saying that the arm problem existed with all frames in the range , and i could either have them back or choose a new pair .
neutral	i opted to choose a new pair , however it was from a much reduced range after the new year sale had ended .
neutral	i now have two_pairs that i am pretty_much satisfied with , despite one pair being a second choice .
neutral	the headline_says it all .
neutral	i ordered 0 swiss_army knives as christmas_presents for my brothers .
neutral	they were packed together in a single padded_envelope , rather_than a box , and i was sad to discover that the cardboard packaging for the knives themselves was badly flattened when i removed them from the envelope .
neutral	if they were just for me i might not have minded so much as the knives were not damaged , but as gifts they look a bit_tatty , like i found them rather_than bought them .
neutral	does wat u want it too at a basic level
neutral	i took my partners laptop to be repaired as it was not responding whilst on the internet .
neutral	i paid the amount due when i collected from the repair only for it to do exactly the same when i gave it back to her .
neutral	i had to take it back and wait another few_days before i got it back this time it seems to have been sorted but dont_know why it wasnt sorted the first time .
neutral	\ will still be a returning customer tho !!
neutral	!
neutral	car was old
neutral	no problem with reliability but not what we expected
neutral	provider seemed to be marginal compared to main hire_companies
neutral	gorillasports heeft een uitgebreid assortiment en_de_levering was snel .
neutral	echter is het feit dat gorillasports ups gebruikt als verzend service en niet tnt voor_mij wel een reden om niet zo heel snel nog_een keer bij gorillasports te_bestellen .
neutral	het product dat_ik_heb besteld ( een ergonomisch gewichtsvest ) zit lekker en functioneert naar verwachting , de kwaliteit van_het materiaal is alleen niet zo best , na_een paar dagen scheurde de voering op verschillende plekken ( wat ik zelf heb gerepareerd ), dit is uiteraard niet aan gorillasports te weiten maar aan_de fabrikant van_het gewichtsvest .
neutral	groet ,
neutral	jim
neutral	slightly expensive for my liking , finding some bargains elsewhere .
neutral	other than that the service is good and i will probably use again .
neutral	delivery was 00_minutes late and ever_since placing my order i get annoying text_messages about offers !
neutral	dont intend to use again !
neutral	price and value of tyres is perfect but i am not happy about national_tyres and autocare in northampton they have scratched my alloys .
neutral	also , receptionist in the garage , was not customer friendly ( swearing ).
neutral	i did not receive any receipt from a garage , as he told me that i should contact you ( tyre_shopper ) to get it as i paid you , not them .
neutral	bought 0 wardrobes and 0 sets of drawers from different ranges .
neutral	happy with quality and delivery , but not with amount of assembly needed .
neutral	drawers were all good , came almost fully_assembled .
neutral	wardrobe 0 ( sherwood oak ) was ok ( if you don_'_t mind screwing in 00 + wood screws ), but wardrobe 0 ( atlanta ) was a complete and protracted self - assembly job ( 00 screws to fix the back panel alone - come on guys !)
neutral	- needs to be flagged_up more clearly on website .
neutral	my 0 week delivery took over a month .... i recieved 0 e_- mails saying my anticipated delivery date had been changed , so i got in touch .
neutral	they told me my order had been stopped at customs , and they handled my copmlaint greatly .
neutral	even_though , my order was perfect and of good quality , i ' d not order again from gear0music , in case of another slow delivery
neutral	all the food has_been tasty and fantastic value for money ...
neutral	however some of the packaging has_been loose and caused damage to some of the products .
neutral	the confirmation slip said that amner oils would make the delivery but it was in fact emo oil who did so , i have not heard of this company before .
neutral	i have since been informed by boiler_juice that emo oil is a subsidiary of amner , but i am still a little uncertain_about reassurances concerning quality .
neutral	good parking - a tad overpriced !
neutral	had a great day picking the car and the salesman was very friendly .
neutral	after i chose car i wanted and advised on some jobs that needed to be done before i picked the car up next_day some of the jobs were not done .
neutral	excellent fast service and the clutch cable was great .
neutral	however , the main point in placing this order was to get the casa lambretta speedo face , and this was a big disappointment .
neutral	it did not fit well into my original veglia speedo because it did not replicate the original design .
neutral	so it is of no use to me .
neutral	fitflop is a well recognised brand .
neutral	we saw a bargain for a pair of black boots .
neutral	unfortunately the boots when they were arrived were scratched , and the leather on one boot wrinkled , as if someone had worn it and walked about in it .
neutral	on top of that there were no inserts within the boot to maintain the shape .
neutral	we have thus sent the boots back and asked for an exchange ( in this instance ).
neutral	hopefully shoetique will get things right this time around .
neutral	so , first the description of where to go at heathrow_t0 wasn_'_t very helpful - " next to prada " but where is prada ?
neutral	so after a while i found a travelex airside in t0 and queued up but then they told me i had to go to a different one .
neutral	after some more searching i found the right one , and they were sure that they had my order somewhere but couldn_'_t find it .
neutral	so first they spent 0 minutes looking for it , before giving up and then going through a long process of re - creating it .
neutral	next time i '_ll just use an atm i think ...
neutral	products fine , but delivery is unreasonably expensive .
neutral	some items which the website said were in stock , were actually not available so they had to refund those .
neutral	other items had to be sourced from their shops rather_than from central stock , so there was a delay before those were sent .
neutral	good speedy service although the lp cover was creased in several places .
neutral	there was no problem on arrival with a speedy turnaround but had to call the mobile no on 0 occasions to get through .
neutral	unable to leave a message or text .
neutral	problems occurred on the return when i was instructed to call the number after picking_up my bags from the baggage claim area i called the number provided on 0 separate_occasions before i was able to get through to someone .
neutral	once this was done i had to wait at the meeting_point designated for a further 00_mins and two further calls to the office to ascertain when my car would be arriving .
neutral	when they eventually turned_up the car was in good order but the attendant seemed uninterested in any delay and left the scene immediately without requesting any signature or response from me .
neutral	thank_you , the furniture has arrived and is good .
neutral	the delivery was timely .
neutral	which is all excellent .
neutral	i was disappointed though that the products were not unpacked and assembled and that the packaging was marked heavily in warnings that if the packaging was damaged this would invalidate the guarantee .
neutral	it was difficult to open the packaging without_damaging it so this felt very unfair .
neutral	i think if you unpacked and assembled then i would rate this as a 0_star experience .
neutral	found celebrity cruises much_better value for money and nicer shp
neutral	prices take the proverbial and often full of kids
neutral	my order arrived in 0 parts 0 day apart .
neutral	whilst the draper components ( pt 0 ) were well boxed and wrapped , pt 0 was less well_packaged .
neutral	that said , everything arrived in one piece and within agreed timescales ...
neutral	i ordered 0 led down_lighters to replace some existing halogen units under a cupboard in the kitchen .
neutral	the service i received was excellent and the product turned_up when i was told it would .
neutral	however , the quality ( given that 0 lights were about £_00 ) was not great .
neutral	there were only two fitting screws for five housings ( 0 screws_missing ) and housings had multiple rough_edges , on the routes of the wires .
neutral	the housing where rather flimsy and needed their brackets adjusting to get them to lie flat .
neutral	there was a lack of any fitting_instructions ... on saying that , the lights when fitted are excellent ,.
neutral	this is my first led purchase and i am impressed by the intensity , though the ' whiteness ' is taking a little getting used to .
neutral	00 days to buy 0 ferrules ....
neutral	i dont_know .
neutral	i used kitbag a number of times now and generally the service has_been excellent however for a recent order for which there was a significant delay , there was little in way of customer service communication or am apology when the revised order fulfilment date wasn_'_t met .
neutral	delays happen , and the measure if any company is what they do to put things right - kitbag always used to be my first_port of call but ...........
neutral	i have placed 0 orders with this company .
neutral	the first arrived promptly and as_described .
neutral	unfortunately the second item sent was not what i ordered .
neutral	it was a cheaper item and i had to ring them to tell them this to get the price difference refunded to my card .
neutral	however they did this without_quibble so i was still on the whole ' satisfied '.
neutral	just check that what arrives is what you ordered .
neutral	disappointed
neutral	good service but i had to pay £ 0 for postage which is not mentioned in , it " estimates " £ 0 for insured delivery .
neutral	i have the feeling that if i had not payed for insured delivery then my phone may have mysteriously gone_missing .
neutral	other than that , payment was quick and price was fair ,
neutral	*
neutral	i bought a well - priced ( cheap !)
neutral	cover for my galaxy nexus .
neutral	i originally made a mistake and had it posted to an old address .
neutral	the support contact was very helpful and was just offering to send a new one when i spotted my mistake .
neutral	when the cover arrived it had good finish but creaked ever so slightly and it basically fell_apart within a week ( the first chips appeared on the first day ) and this was not through neglect and maltreatment - it was just day - to - day use .
neutral	when i complained i was offered a replacement straight_away and received it 0 days_later - we '_ll see how this one goes .
neutral	so overall , very good service but be wary of what products you buy .
neutral	expect to get what you pay for .
neutral	i '_ve_used medicanimal several_times because their range of products and their prices are attractive .
neutral	their website , however , is extremely confusing and i have to order well in advance of my requirements because despatch dates are not confirmed or kept to .
neutral	i ' got my eyes_lasered ' a year_ago and my only regret is that i didn_'_t go and see a few other_suppliers .
neutral	the procedure was fine , the surgeons and opticians were the best , but i found the attitude of the people in the actual store pretty poor .
neutral	not nasty or really rude , just a bit apathetic and lacking warmth .
neutral	otherwise i recommend the experience , wish i had done it sooner .
neutral	couldn_'_t believe the pressure on my ears as the a000 descended into manchester_airport .
neutral	ouch !!
neutral	not endured anything like that since going on a jmc aeroplane to magaluf when i was 00 .
neutral	ouch !
neutral	cheap but too
neutral	many extras
neutral	ryanair were far too forgiving of the passenger who kept marrakech to edinburgh flight 00 00 . on the tarmac for an_hour .
neutral	it missed its slot and i had a large taxi_fare as a consequence . empty any hold_luggage , let them stew .
neutral	i ordered a thunder shirt and although this isn_'_t pet supermarkets fault it never arrived .
neutral	i am at my place of work all day and apparently the delivery driver tried twice and left a card ( there is only one office door ).
neutral	still_awaiting refund .
neutral	this was only ok .
neutral	the price ( even with voucher discount ) was a little high .
neutral	the quality of the photos is only as good as the original but even then some were a bit darker_than i expected .
neutral	there was no attmpt to adjust brightness .
neutral	the price for the table was competitive and when it arrived , it was package well and was in excellent condition .
neutral	i chose to pay for the table in advance to take_advantage of a further discount but this was a mistake as communication from ambienti direct was poor and involved me having to make phone_calls and send several emails to find out if payment had been received and when the table would be delivered .
neutral	this is my second major purchase from ambienti direct but i '_m not sure i '_ll be using them again .
neutral	the collection guy complains about everything !
neutral	i was emailed with sale offer .
neutral	ordered items and paid .
neutral	emailed later to say out of stock
neutral	i bought a star costume costing around £_00 . 00 .
neutral	i ordered this as our nativity was about a special star and i wanted a costume slightly_different to the previous ones bought in asda .
neutral	upon_arrival i was disappointed at the poor quality of the product and the fact it had a hole in too .
neutral	i didn_'_t have time to return and so made do with stitching it .
neutral	not a patch on the quality of stars purchased in asda at a cost of £ 0 .
neutral	great customer service team , willing to help always friendly and give great customer advice for people who have never purchased from them before .

neutral	normally a good experience with juno but this time vinyl looked 0nd_hand , cover was worn , damaged on all edges & ripped , vinyl had scuffs , scratches & finger_prints to both_sides , not had anything like this before from them , hopefully just a one off !
neutral	would still recommend & use them .
neutral	0 .
neutral	the website failed to accept my discount_code but took my money before i could tell that i was paying the full price - it never confirmed what i was paying .
neutral	0a .
neutral	on the plus_side - after i cancelled the order i was quickly promised a refund to my card if i agreed to reinstate my order - i agreed .
neutral	0 .
neutral	the first pair sent had one lens incorrect which made them useless .
neutral	0a .
neutral	on the plus_side it was easy to send them back in the same envelope with postage paid .
neutral	0 .
neutral	despite my clearly stating what was wrong on the return paperwork ( right lens sph was made + and should have been negative ), i received an annoying phone_call asking me if i wanted reading_glasses .
neutral	0a on the positive_side the final_result of the returned pair was satisfactory .
neutral	0 .
neutral	the trustpilot site you have chosen is very annoying .
neutral	it lets me spend precious time giving my views but then refuses to accept them if i am using an older_version of internet_explorer .
neutral	after my comments on here i swiftly received a call from o . f . l .
neutral	apologising and offering to make ammends to the way i was treated by there p . r customer team .
neutral	a new table leg was duley dispached and an engineer fitted it yesterday .. my table looks stuning now and im over the moon with it .
neutral	id like to thank alex preston for his help and phone_calls , he did a brilliant p . r .
neutral	job and totaly restored my faith in o . f . l .
neutral	i can only hope valuable lessons have been learnt by o . f . l . s telephone cutomer relations team and that this dosent happen again .
neutral	after all i still think o . f . l .
neutral	productsvs are top_notch value for the money and theres_nothing_compares on the high_street .
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a battery from you for a pulse adrenaline 0000 .
neutral	i went off the website and got one that said suitable for a pulse adrenaline .
neutral	the battery that came was the correct one according to the internet but was to tall to fit in the battery box so the battery box had to be modified .
neutral	best to buy from a shop where you know its exact and not just go off wrong information .
neutral	was informed soon after my order about one item being out of stock , i was told a return date and it would be deliver soon as it was back in , maybe items should show it '_s not in stock at check out , still_waiting on items but should arrive soon , delivery was quick .
neutral	goods ok - very unhelpful delivery scheduling in store - forced to pay £_00 to obtain acceptable delivery .
neutral	i '_m sorry to have to submit the lowest rating so_far , but i must be truthful in my opinion .
neutral	i came_across the tradeworks website when searching for a specific 0 - way tv amplifier to replace one i ' d just broken in my motorhome .
neutral	my requirement ( for several reasons ) was for an identical replacement and there were several such items on the web including some cheap new ones on ebay , but i chose the tradeworks item as i could get it quickly and with ( or so i thought ) the 00v power_cable and adapter included .
neutral	the website said the stock quantity was " plenty ".
neutral	i paid extra postage to get the item quickly and it duly_arrived within a couple of days , however , when i opened the package i discovered that i ' d been sent an equivalent item of a different brand , and there was no sign of any power_supply cable or adapter , i wasn_'_t happy !
neutral	why wasn_'_t i contacted and advised that they didn_'_t have the correct item ?
neutral	had that happened i would have immediately requested a refund and gone elsewhere as it was an_urgent order , but now i have to wait several days for them to get the correct item back in stock and then send it out , and it '_s only an estimate when they '_ll get some more in stock .
neutral	the guy i spoke to on the phone was polite and apologised for the error , hence me awarding 0_stars instead of 0 !
neutral	as i said above their website stated that they had " plenty " in stock , which was obviously wrong , and i '_m not sure the correct item will come with the power_supply cable as the website doesn_'_t give any indication of this one way or the other .
neutral	online shop style websites that aren_'_t accurately maintained are one of the main_reasons i '_m still to be convinced that internet_shopping is more convenient , because i '_m now being inconvenienced by the delay .
neutral	i '_m sorry once again for giving the lowest rating so_far , but had the guy on the phone not been as polite as he was , it would have actually been lower !
neutral	your representative did not sound confident .
neutral	i had called to make_sure of an
neutral	early delivery of my goods .
neutral	it was annoying to find that you would not take orders over
neutral	£_000 .
neutral	i was told to use the web_site .
neutral	since ordering & paying for my clubs around 0_weeks_ago i have not received any form of communication , i do think that an email or text informing_me of any delay or problem is not too much to ask , still_awaiting delivery
neutral	write as if you ' re_speaking to a friend . the product was fine and competitive but as i live outside the uk i should not have been charged vat i will only use the company again if they make this provision , otherwise i am paying 00_% more than a competitor !
neutral	got my book back and it was very dark , i think you you should be able to use yours skills to adjust pictures within the book at your discretion .
neutral	sometimes our screens are not calibrated and seem fine when we order and get disapionted when we recieve the book .
neutral	my first dealings with parcel0go and so_far my parcel hasn_'_t been picked_up .
neutral	it '_s been three_days now for a next_day collection .
neutral	the driver went to the wrong house and i '_m not very impressed .
neutral	0 - 0 is a very big window too ... lot '_s of waiting in the house .
neutral	however , the company '_s reputation is almost saved by the live help , very professional people , all female so_far , who have all been helpful , friendly and done their absolute best in a clear and efficient manner .
neutral	people like andrea today who instantly understood the problem , was intuitive about my dissatisfaction and made a beautifully timed upgrade gesture to smooth things .
neutral	these are the people on the front line so thank_goodness they are solid , it is so often not the case !
neutral	let '_s hope the driver can find my house now !
neutral	while not expensive , but definitely higher priced for same make and model than on other_websites , especially those from the us .
neutral	they do have a really great selection , and the online prescription_lenses make it a very convenient one - stop - shop .
neutral	shipping overseas was fast , but quite expensive at £_00 !
neutral	i ordered two franklin and marshall tee_shirts off the web_site when my package arrived only one was sent and a slip of paper inside telling_me the other was out of stock , no email to get alternative no phone_call other than that overall service was good .
neutral	i believed i had hired 0 baby seats included on the online booking , at no point did it mention any additional_cost .
neutral	at the airport i was charged for the seats & advised i had only submitted a request for seats & had not actually paid for / booked .
neutral	the desk advised this always happens & is unclear .
neutral	an extra_cost at the start of the holiday is not what you expect !
neutral	apart_from this the car , booking , collection & drop_off were all really good .
neutral	the flowers were great .
neutral	in the message i typed , i entered "&" and it read " amp ".
neutral	this really infuriated me as whoever printed this out should have known .
neutral	it ruined the lovely message .
neutral	the flowers were for a funeral and i did not have time to re - type out myself and would have thought some one would have used their common_sense to correct it .
neutral	it spoiled it for me .
neutral	because of this , i don_'_t think i will use you again !
neutral	ordered two tyres for saturday fitting with three_days notice , then got a phone_call to say that saturday was fully booked at the local_branch .
neutral	it '_s a pity the web_site didn_'_t know .
neutral	so all fitting ' promises ' have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
neutral	alternative date was offered but was less convenient and made the fitting more complicated .
neutral	the fitting itself went_smoothly and all was eventually ok .
neutral	i liked the price of the item and it was delivered quickly and in excellent condition .
neutral	however if i had not had the option to have the item delivered to my work address i would have had to drive to their chosen courier '_s depot to collect as there was no out of hours delivery nor ability to have the item left in a safe_place .
neutral	old ships used , food needs improvement , infrequent sailings
neutral	asked for delivery on a day when we knew somebody would be here to accept the delivery .
neutral	we were assured that this would be taken into_consideration .
neutral	instead the delivery was made a couple of days_later when nobody was here which meant we had to go to the bother of contacting the delivery depot for redelivery , on the day we had originally requested , which was an unnecessary nuisance .
neutral	the goods themselves seem well built and of good quality .
neutral	didn_'_t come instantly , had to wait 00_hours for it to come through compared to it '_s competitors where they were alot quicker .
neutral	i got my glasses through an online discount offer .
neutral	the deal was fantastic .
neutral	the price of the presciption was in the offer , alround fantastic offer .
neutral	unfortunately my glasses were sent in a box that was obviously too small , my glasses were warped .
neutral	such a small thing betrayed my experience , especially when it feels_like one ear should be an inch lower and when i wear them i spend half of my time trying to bend them back .
neutral	they ' re nice when they fit though .
neutral	very limited amount of free delivery items to my local shop . also more buy now pay later offers .
neutral	cheaper prices of the stock you have .
neutral	some items have a very good price offer on them but then i find i have to add £ 0 . 00 post on top . which then puts me off buying as item is cheaper in the shop minus the delivery cost .
neutral	i ordered a micro scooter black as it was the cheapest and it had free delivery but 0 days_later i tried to make contact and there was no number to call so had to email them which took 0 days for a reply to then be told that the item was out of stock and was being sent straight from the manufactures .
neutral	0 days_later i revived my goods , i would pay a little extra and use another company so that i could get a tracking_number ...
neutral	received a good price on the pet_prescription items but the dispatch rate was extremely slow despite providing the requested prescription details when asked .
neutral	would use again , but allow a little more time if the prescription is needed quickly .
neutral	bought a luminox watch off the site as had comprehensive_range having seen them in us and looking for a cheaper everyday watch .
neutral	sale went through really quickly and saw on site delivery turnaround 00_hrs
neutral	except my order is still to be fulfilled
neutral	i used the online live help which was good and apparently the watch has_been ordered from luminox and not yet delivered to jura - which i wasn_'_t aware of , i assumed it was a listed stock item .
neutral	so nearly a week since order and still unfulfilled yet payment was taken immediately
neutral	not delighted with this as no estimated_date for delivery
neutral	extensive selection of hostels but irritating that non - hostels or rooms where you need to book multiple beds come up when you search for one bed .
neutral	would be great to see what you would actually be charged given you had already entered number of guests when searching .
neutral	i find booking . com now more useful for comparing_prices .
neutral	further to this the booking_fee is a bit much so i would always look for same hostels on hostelbookers .
neutral	hostelbookers also have better search options to narrow hostels to what you want .
neutral	further to this the automated overall rating on reviews is absolutely_ridiculous as are the rating criteria .
neutral	a lot of people look for a comfortable bed to sleep in , no such criteria in rating .
neutral	also things like character are of little significance to budget travellers whereas location is extremely important .
neutral	a hostel in the most inconvenient location can still score 00_% on the basis of other criteria yet a reasonable one in a good location may only score 00 %.
neutral	i think most travellers would still prefer the latter .
neutral	i really feel averaging insignificant and significant criteria makes the whole review system frivolous .
neutral	three stars just because my order took 0 days to be dispatched due to an error , everything else was great including the customer service guys who i spoke to .
neutral	service is good .
neutral	prices are reasonable .
neutral	appointments easy to make .
neutral	read offers carefully conditions are not easy to fathom out .
neutral	prices in the garage are not the same as on - line .
neutral	i bought a samsung_galaxy s 0 from buymobilephones recently .
neutral	it was the joint cheapest place on the contract i wanted with a couple other_places , but buymobilephones give quidco_cashback so i went with them .
neutral	many quidco reviews state they never recieved their cashback from this company , but i guess i '_ll have to wait and see for myself .
neutral	firstly , the website has a slightly seedy vibe about it which i can only say comes from experience if you have been on any malware ridden sites offering ' free games ' or whatever .
neutral	buymobilephones of course didn_'_t have any malware or popups that i am aware of but it '_s not a good frontage for a site for first_impressions .
neutral	when placing my order , they underhandedly tried to shovel in some free for first month ( very expensive after that ) insurance by default in small letters , which i managed to take out of the shopping_basket but i can see a lot of people falling for that .
neutral	there was also a ' choose free_gift with your phone ' option when choosing a phone to buy , which in fact just gives you an expensive item along with the phone the cost of which is added onto your contract , so rather_than free it '_s just a pay monthly item .
neutral	quite obvious to me but it '_s more underhanded work which would catch out the less observant of us .
neutral	now , once i placed my order my phone actually arrived very quickly which i was pleased about , and i '_m pleased with the phone .
neutral	however , the usb_cable that came with the phone does not work and i am having to borrow one off a friend .
neutral	i sent them an email about this a week_ago and have still not recieved a reply .
neutral	worse , if you urgently need to get hold of them by phone , their phone number is a premium_rate number .
neutral	i have to give three stars because i got the phone i wanted at the price i wanted , and quickly .
neutral	but the overall ordering experience was bad , it had me paranoid they were going to catch me out with something and of course i have this non working usb_cable that came with my phone and no timely support for it , perhaps they are waiting to see if i '_ll call their premium_rate number .
neutral	i did offer to write a full report of my experiences with notes , dates and problems but since the offer was not accepted , i will briefly tell you that the different_departments that work to ensure bespoke worktops are correct , do not keep each other up to date in so_far as i returned an e_- mail with an update to one department and then had to follow it up a week_later as no reply had been received .
neutral	the reason given was that my communication had not been forwarded to the correct destination i . e .
neutral	when the query was raised , your e_- mail to me did not advise that my reply should be sent to a different department .
neutral	it is also wholly annoying to be dealing_with a named person only to find that they leave work early or do not work full time thus delaying the progress of orders as this information should be given to the customer in the first instance .
neutral	ordered item , expected next_day delivery as advertised .
neutral	imagine surprise next_day an email_saying there were problems with payment .
neutral	checked the card account , they had taken one pound from it .
neutral	quite annoyed , so phoned to find out what they were playing at .
neutral	it seems their order system hadn_'_t worked properly , didn_'_t go to visa secure check .
neutral	after manually setting_up payment over the phone , everything_went through and goods delivered next_day .
neutral	let '_s see if the £ 0 is returned to the card !
neutral	!
neutral	took longer to come than most other supplements i order .
neutral	i really don_'_t expect a 00_%_discount plus a 00_%_discount .
neutral	however , when i am e_- mailed and invited to book , i don_'_t look a gift horse in the mouth .
neutral	calling in to discover that there are no hotels in central_london , you know that world famous capital city .
neutral	come on last_minute , there '_s no need to mislead people like that .
neutral	you create an unhappy customer from a happy one - not , i would suggest , a sensible strategy !
neutral	the wrong item was delivered and it was a good job i checked the delivery note .
neutral	i immediately got on the phone and the company spoke to the delivery driver who took the item back .
neutral	the company resent the correct item on the same day which turned_up three_days_later .
neutral	no explanation as to how an item ordered over the internet turned into another item on despatch .
neutral	mistakes can happen but it was a good job i was not working to a schedule .
neutral	flower were great .
neutral	greetings_card was bad .
neutral	text with very small letters .
neutral	delivery is ok .
neutral	communication is very good .
neutral	overall experience is 0 out 00 .
neutral	sorry !!!
neutral	!
neutral	the one important_thing about the service received was that though the money was ordered for a monday and the confirmation_email sent on the previous friday made it quite clear that unless a saturday delivery had been paid for that is when it would be delivered it was delivered on saturday anyway .
neutral	lucky i was at home !
neutral	delivery days need to be as arranged .
neutral	brought a specialized helmet , the finish was poor at the front looked like it could have been reduce stock or seconds .
neutral	not sure if it was the shop selling marked goods or specialized putting out substandard helmets , either way i '_m disappointed .
neutral	i ordered on 00 march and my order was confirmed by email the same day .
neutral	the next_day ( 00rd ) another email_confirming the order as " processing " 00 march email_confirming my order " fully dispatched ".
neutral	0 april phone_call from manufacturers / delivery company , that the driver had " run out of hours " and they couldn_'_t deliver my order .
neutral	the next available date was 00 april and delivery was arranged for am on 00th .
neutral	at 0000 on 00th i phoned the delivery company to be told that the driver was running late as he had " run out of hours " the previous day .
neutral	the delivery arrived at 0000 .
neutral	i had to help_unload as the load was too heavy for the driver who was by himself .
neutral	so roofing_superstore efficiency and good communication was let_down by a poor delivery company who seem to over schedule their drivers .
neutral	i bought two_pairs from glasses_direct , i have one pair with normal lenses with a blue_tint , and another pair with the dark_green sunglasses lens fitted .
neutral	i had to return the sunglassses pair after 0 months due to the outer surface coming off away from the lens , and glasses_direct brilliantly honoured their guarantee for these glasses and they were duly returned for repair .
neutral	oh_dear !!
neutral	the glasses returned to me had the blue_tint not the dark_green sunglasses lens i had returned , so i am now six_weeks without these sunglasses , thank_god the english weather is so crap , rain rain rain .
neutral	so basically you pays your money , you takes your chance .
neutral	good thank_you !
neutral	i '_ve bought flowers from serenata before and had a great experience .
neutral	on this occasion however they told me they were using yodel to deliver ( after i had ordered ) and that took the edge off .
neutral	0 hours and fifty minutes of sitting within 0 ft of the door to make_sure that yodel '_s driver didn_'_t just pretend to deliver them .
neutral	i like the flowers , i like the service , i like the website , but if they are going to use yodel i won_'_t be using them again in future .
neutral	having placed the order the estimated delivery times were 0_weeks which would have been great as we were away on holiday for 0 days .
neutral	i received a text_telling us that delivery would be 0 days and this could be changed if not suitable .
neutral	i rang to rearrange for the following week and was told this would be logged .
neutral	i then received a confirmaction date the same as before & was told it would cost £_00 to change .
neutral	trailfinders managed to get excellent deals through korean airlines to nz for us and managed to hold the flights for six_months before we had to pay .
neutral	unfortunately the airline did change their billing requirements which meant we had to pay early but trailfinders kept us updated and managed the issue .
neutral	one thing though if you book make_sure you request to be seated together , we managed to get separated on the flight as they had us down as two window seats despite the fact we we ' re returning to nz to get married .
neutral	0 provides almost acceptable network quality in central_london but intermittent cut_outs become frustrating during_peak_times .
neutral	in terms of managing an account they do a reasonable job but continued up selling becomes tiresome quickly ( esp mobile_broadband ).
neutral	it works most of the time and the prices are ok , want more than this and you will be left wanting .
neutral	as usual the beeb always seems to think it knows better_than the customer .
neutral	my advice the the management remember that pride always comes before a fall .
neutral	see ' your opinion in one_sentence '.
neutral	the site is efficient and the staff ; friendly .
neutral	however , since being sold by baa you have hiked up your prices and now levy a ' handling_fee ' for certain methods of payment .
neutral	( presumably to recoup some of the leveraged finance you no doubt had to raise in order to fund the purchase )
neutral	i use your long_stay car_park 00 weeks each year and have done for the past 0 years .
neutral	it ' d be nice if you recognised loyalty ( and recognised my bloody number_plate when exiting from the car_park !!)
neutral	recently made a purchase and everything was of good standard until the carrier took over - city_link - and delivered my parcel to another house over 0 / 0 mile_away .
neutral	thankfully we had included our phone number in the purchase procedure and that was showing on the box and allowed the recipient to call us .
neutral	so in summary - everything_went well and swiftly until the delivery company made a complete mess of it .
neutral	my treatment went_ahead june_0000 , i paid for the middle package , and from the start the staff were brilliant . the procedure was great and talked through it and put at ease throughout . no_problems . but after 0 months my nightime vision resembles the cheapest package .. loads of stars and glares and very very poor vision . i have been told to wait til january .. but everytime i drive at night i put myself and others at risk .. i cannot read signs and everything is as if it is as blurred when my glasses were off . not the treatment i expected and everyone seems to ignore my plight and i have been told throughout to let my eyes settle_down ... not the end_result i expected to be honest .... so very very dissapointed .
neutral	not recieved what was ordered - nearly 0 x weeks_ago !
neutral	good costume
neutral	i tried on line chat after being charged delivery when it stated free before cart ..
neutral	i was ignored by assistant who answered so closed chat .
neutral	i needed item so continued anyway as time was low to get it .
neutral	i then realised i had made a mistake on the engraving so tried online_chat again and got better service and engraving changed .
neutral	however when asking about delivery time i was told 0 - 00 days or similar and when i commented about getting it sooner the session was terminated with no warning .
neutral	shorty after way before 0 days the trophy is despatched and arrives with good service .
neutral	but the trophy base is smeared with glue and not pretty .
neutral	all in all not a fantastic experience .
neutral	good delivery time being the only good bit .
neutral	i know it was a small order of 0trophy but if you cant spare the time to help with it why would i come_back with a big order for the whole club ?
neutral	?
neutral	i had a flightcase built for my marshall 000 combo which fits perfect and is built perfectly .
neutral	however , the time taken between order and delivery was unacceptable , especially when the website advertises turnaround time of 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i waited over 0_weeks for my case to be delivered , i had to chase the order on a number of occasions , some proactive communication would an improvement to manage the customers expectations if there is likely to be a delay .
neutral	not to take away from the product which is perfect , better communication is a must .
neutral	we used to use farnell for all our purchases of electrical components .
neutral	however in september they introduced a " handling charge " of £ 0 . 00 on small orders , with no warning .
neutral	the " shipping " is free but the information on the website is very unclear , and for most people the distinction between shipping and handling is irrelevant .
neutral	prior to this new charge , i would have given them 0_stars , in large part because it gives the flexibility to order things when you think of it , instead of waiting to build up sufficient order size .
neutral	searching their site can be painful , but their live_chat tech_support are very good at the search part .
neutral	farnell - if you read this , think again .
neutral	in the meantime , i '_m off to find a new supplier .
neutral	i '_ve not had to shop through hmv that much and to be honest , i '_m quite happy of that fact .
neutral	i only used them once online and that was more than enough for me .
neutral	bought myself an xbox_000 with 0 games as a bundle pack , thought i would treat_myself .
neutral	well i placed the order , a timeslot of 0 - 0 days for delivery " great !"
neutral	i thought ... and that was the first mistake .
neutral	the 0th day came , nothing through the post or any attempted deliveries , i thought i would just give them benefit of christmas deliveries as it was around that time ... finally on the 0th day after delivery i got something but was way too small for the xbox_000 ... i got one of the games from the bundle ... ok , so where is the rest of it ?
neutral	surely as a bundle offer it should all come together .
neutral	i didn_'_t make an issue as the next_day the actual xbox_000 came along , but where was the other game ?... it didnt arrive until another 0_weeks had gone by , so in the end for everything to get to me , it took 00 days .
neutral	faaaar from the best service i should be expecting .
neutral	again this was a while back but i still won_'_t buy anything online from them .
neutral	another bad_experience was that of my sister ordering a shirt from them quite a few_months back .
neutral	somehow , and i have no idea how , the order itself just disappeared from the system , called hmv and they claimed they never got it , yet the money easily went from her account ... naturally one very p * ssed off sister .
neutral	if you can avoid it , don_'_t order online with them , all you will get at the least is long delays for your item to come .
neutral	another thing i '_ve noticed , and i hope this isn_'_t just me , is that the prices online are often different from the prices instore .
neutral	a quick example .
neutral	xbox_000 transfer kit .
neutral	online - £_00 . 00 .
neutral	in - store - £_00 . 00 ... which leads me onto the prices themselves .
neutral	in comparison to other major outlets , such as play . com , amazon etc they are often overpriced for the majority of things they sell and have been criticised several_times for not even having the correct price on their in - store items ( my dad got a cheaper cd when the cashier informed him the price was wrong but still gave him the lower price but besides the point , surely this isn_'_t how a business should actually operate ).
neutral	on the plus_side , they are often pretty good for stock control both online and in - store and the staff are generally helpful so i guess you could consider hmv a fall back option if any of the better places to go are unable to fulfil your query .
neutral	i could rate less but it has_been a little while since i used hmv and i don_'_t want to be completely biased based on family experiences but i still hear the same issues being raised , especially with the slow delivery .
neutral	hmv just needs to focus there , as well as on their pricing strategies .
neutral	after_placing order online i haven_'_t got any confirmation_email about order acceptance or delivery date ( the order state was still " processing " even after delivery ).
neutral	i called them few_times and in the end they told me the delivery date .
neutral	i was reassured that driver will_definitely call me an_hour before the delivery .
neutral	nobody called so i missed delivery and had to arrange another date ( driver finally called ).
neutral	other than that all fine , price was low , customer service is friendly .
neutral	probably not very good organised .
neutral	the service has_been ok , until i lost my phone .
neutral	i called their support to block the sim_card , and i was told it was impossible to block the sim_card right away , i would have to rely_on an automatic auto - blocking after 0 months of non usage ... so somebody might be using my phone right now , preventing the auto - blocking !
neutral	the arrangements for ordering a car for our holiday was fast , effi - cient and reliable .
neutral	on a negative_point we ordered an estate car but received a saloon !
neutral	the handover at the rental office was insufficient as it stated on the form less damage / stratches to the vehicle than had been discussed at the office .
neutral	on locating the car we spent at_least 00_minutes identifying the additional marks on the vehicle before reporting back to the office .
neutral	on returning the car nobody did a check of the vehicle - not good customer service .
neutral	if this review is read by mangement i would expect a reply and reason_why the service was less_than satisfactory - not just a feedback saying you apologise that we had to defer our travel for at_least 00_minutes and did not opbtain the car requested
neutral	we wait and see what the feedback is - if positive i would use the rental facilities again
neutral	excellent product ( not an import -- at_least in my case ) and excellent price .
neutral	and it arrived in time for christmas .
neutral	but i had no confirmation of my order for a week and i could not get any response by email or phone .
neutral	this needs to be addressed !
neutral	for an expensive product ( over £_000 ) the packaging ( just a plastic_bag ) was not really sufficient , but it arrived_safely .
neutral	a very large car_park difficult to find you bearings in the dark , bus driver was superb helped_me locate my car . a big thanks to him .
neutral	overall the experience was good , but why the hell was i not allowed to fill my car up at the petrol_station where i handed the car back .
neutral	this was at edinburgh , therefore this ment i handed the car back without a full_tank of fuel .
neutral	one last thing there was also no one at the budget desk for me to discuss this problem with .
neutral	i always check wickes first because they are always cheaper_than homebase and b_& q .
neutral	i have had a lot of building items delivered , timber , flooring , tiles .
neutral	usually it is all fine and that one time it arrives bashed up and the driver thinks its fine ?
neutral	likewise in store , a few of the staff have been helpful and polite , but my do they have more than their share of staff who really do them no favours .
neutral	i have heard staff aggressively effing and blinding on the shop floor without a care that customers are walking around .
neutral	till staff are often straight out of school vicky pollards .
neutral	the managers and directors really need replacing with someone_who_cares_about making the business healthy .
neutral	i find my nearest three stores , twickenham , hanwell , ealing , dull and dreary to walk around ( poor lighting ).
neutral	it '_s just not good business all_round .
neutral	that said , i will always check them out first because they are usually cheapest ( need to check quality sometimes though ).
neutral	but for price , i would not go near them .
neutral	in general i am happy with range of products and the prices of course - but now i have to wait approx 0 month and twice the delivery has_been postponed .... so therefor a 0star
neutral	it was 000 $ when i bought my item but credit_card was charged for 000 .
neutral	not happy with that , otherwise everything is good .
neutral	i have only bought one thing from myprotein , i don_'_t wish to be bombarded with reviews .
neutral	the flowers were received in good condition and in good time , however , there the picture of the bouquet on the website is very misleading - when it arrived looked a lot less and certainly doesn_'_t fill a standard vase .
neutral	for the money paid i ' d expect a lot more .
neutral	for reference i could have got a bouquet of flowers for half the price and would have been a lot more substantial from a supermarket ... lesson_learnt !
neutral	ordered a cd_key on 00th_november .
neutral	got email instructions with how to download game .
neutral	clicked link in email but no download , just a thank_you text file with note saying game file will be emailed up to 00_hours .
neutral	thursday arrives and still nothing so emailed kumbaso support to ask them if i don_'_t receive cd_key by end of the day then i will ask for refund .
neutral	0 days_later so i ask for refund within 0 working_days .
neutral	if i don_'_t hear_anything i will get my refund via visa .
neutral	update_: after a week of nothing i have received the code .
neutral	very good on delivery but found 0 monkeys had slight splits and would not blow up all the rest flamingos , palm trees was very good
neutral	the service provided was very good and i was regularly kept infomred regarding the progress of my order .
neutral	however the qulaity of the flowers was average and many were wilting .
neutral	as such the order was not good value for money .
neutral	the good : scubastore products are well priced and delivery time is fair .
neutral	the bad : i ordered the incorrect_size of my wetsuit and athough i have sent it back , i was dissapointed that i could not just exchange my suit for the correct_size .
neutral	the issue being that scuba_store no_longer keep the cressi tracina .
neutral	the ugly : the postage cost me nearly 00_% the value of the suit to send it back .
neutral	taps uk dispatched my kitchen_sink within 0 day to the courier company but the courier has only 0 depot in wolverhampton and they dont come to london very often ( its 000_miles_away ).
neutral	they should definitely use another courier company , if you dont call the courier company and request it to be dispatched soon , they wont_bother .
neutral	what a bad courier .
neutral	taps uk said i would get the sink in 0 days , i got it 00 days_later only because of the courier company ,,, taps uk did their job efficiently but they will suffer criticism because of the courier they use .
neutral	on arriving at long_stay car_park which we had booked in advance , we were directed to the short_stay because it was over booked . on return from our holiday we had the hassle of finding the office to allow use out of the car_park . surely if u book the long_stay that should be where u park !
neutral	a substantial charge was made for p_&_p but -- when it eventually arrived -- it was just a jiffy_bag by second class post .
neutral	bought cod_ghosts , great price reduction , but after buying it and redeeming it on steam i keep getting key enquires from steam , this normally happens if someone has posted a key publicly or has tried to sell the key twice .
neutral	this is an_automated_message generated by steam account administration .
neutral	it is being sent in response to a query made by a steam user to discover all account names associated with this cd - key
neutral	considering i have over 000 games there , this is the first time i have ever received anything like this from steam ..
neutral	not a bad site really but not a great choice .
neutral	very quick when i had a problem it was sorted and refunded
neutral	i ordered 0 items .
neutral	i remember reading that they would be dispatched within 0 days , but after 0 days i had heard_nothing more from the company .
neutral	when i queried this they said it was because they were waiting for stock on one of the items .
neutral	to be fair once i had queried it they expedited the order and i got 0 of the items the next_day .
neutral	but it would be better if they could improve their system so that it informed you up - front if there was going to be any delay due to stock , etc .
neutral	the items themselves are of good quality , arrived well - packaged and in good condition .
neutral	i am not unhappy about the experience and would consider ordering again .
neutral	i am still assessing printerinks .
neutral	the service from ordering to delivery is very efficient .
neutral	as for the products : on my computer the cartridges are always shown as empty - a nuisance .
neutral	two black cartridges were dud , i . e .
neutral	did not produce any ink , and others did not seem to last very long .
neutral	i have been monitoring how many pages each cartridge will print , and will later make a decision on whether the economics of buying cheap ink is worth while or not .
neutral	i went into dfs reading knowing pretty_much what i wanted , service was great and the whole_process was fast .
neutral	estimated delivery time seemed huge ( 00 weeks ) which then overran slightly .
neutral	delivery guys were great .
neutral	however ...
neutral	the corner piece to my corner group seems to be a lot softer than all of the other almost like it '_s been worn in .
neutral	i mentioned this in a survey and asked for a call ....
neutral	still_waiting .
neutral	mixed review really but other than these points i '_m happy .
neutral	i ordered a canon 00 - 000l lens on 00 may 0000 (£_000 - very good value ), said to be " in stock ".
neutral	the cost was debited via_paypal on the same day .
neutral	it took several days for the order to be accepted , showing " new " on tracking .
neutral	by 00 may i was preparing to chase despatch , but the status had progressed to " packing " and i received the goods on 00 may , in good condition , no_problems .
neutral	unusually , i did not check the ownership / status of this company before ordering .
neutral	i did not like the way payment was taken immediately and not on despatch .
neutral	however i have no_complaints about the delivery service .
neutral	i am not sure what the 00 - month '_s supplier warranty is worth - i expected a worldwide canon one .
neutral	not sure why i '_m being sent a review / customer_satisfaction survey as since placing my order i have not been contacted , so i think i '_m being pragmatic giving a 0 rating
neutral	tank_sealer arrived and was as_described , por strip was out of stock firstly so i delayed ordering , when i next went to order it was out of stock again , i emailed twice but as yet have not heard , i was offered free delivery but if there is no item to deliver they cannot fulfil , unimpressed .
neutral	this is a cost_effective , quick and efficient way to have frames made for pictures .
neutral	the frames are good solid quality and very well made .
neutral	my only_concern is ( and this has happened before ) the colours of the mountings on the the website bare no relationship to the colours you actually get .
neutral	this is not a monitor problem on my behalf as i have my screen calibrated at_least once a year .
neutral	the mountings when they arrived were so insipid and washed out in colour that they almost all looked the same - a sort of yellowy magnolia - instead of the vivid yellow we were promised from the website for two frames and a cream for another frame .
neutral	also for our fourth frame we wanted a darkish grey colour and we received a silver mount , not at all what we had ordered .
neutral	it just so happen d that the silver mount worked very well with the painting we wanted framed .
neutral	to be more precise - very happy with the quality of the frames and the quality of the workmanship .
neutral	less_than happy with how the mount colours really look when you receive them - nothing like the website .
neutral	credit_card surcharges are a last_minute , unwanted surprise .
neutral	would definitely consider never using the website again because of it .
neutral	delivery on time
neutral	good product , but took_ages to arrive , i will use perfactgllasses again ..
neutral	thanks
neutral	good , quick easy to use service , although they knock money off for the slightest of things .
neutral	£ 0 was knocked_off my payment because of a tiny_scratch on the screen ... its as though it wouldn_'_t have been expected being a used phone !
neutral	may be orange will promote a payment of £_00 instead of £_00
neutral	pleased with the small order of chorizo , morcella , and cheese , delivery was crap , didn_'_t even attempt to deliver , then on there website said they had tried , found out depot was 0 miles from house popped down to pick it up , found out later that depot was undergoing changes and service has suffered , defiantly no txt alert or hour time_slot , food was great , will use again .
neutral	very little choice as in means of brands of skateboard griptape , they stick to very mainsstream and more " safe " brands .
neutral	griptape had been worn or scraped in some places and i could tell was old or not stored properly as the glue did not stick very well at all .
neutral	i like the website for the price but quality is poor .
neutral	0_stars .
neutral	spent quite a lot of money on the woodweave blinds for 0 kitchen / diner windows and 0 door opening but was dismayed to find that even when stowed the blind still hung over 00cm down from the top of the opening .
neutral	we assumed that , as the blind was described as having a pelmet , all the blind stowed behind it .
neutral	one of the windows is a metre high so a third of available light is blocked out which somewhat defeats the purpose of a window .
neutral	as for the door opening a manoeuver similar to a limbo dance was called for !
neutral	!
neutral	apart_from returning the blinds ( which we didn_'_t want to do as they do look nice ) the only other option was to obtain extra lifting hooks so we phoned the company to enquire and state our concern .
neutral	we were told that extra hooks were 00p_each plus postage but after sending off a complaint via e_- mail they did relent and sent the 00 hooks free of charge .
neutral	apart_from the above complaint the delivery was very quick and , as already_mentioned , the blinds do look very stylish giving the room a cosy warm feeling .
neutral	the coffee options are too limited - moderate or weak in strength .
neutral	this does not match the really strong flavours offered by nespresso
neutral	good price and speed , but when i checked out via_paypal my delivery address was correct .
neutral	however , it then seemed to revert to my billing_address ( which is different ) and was delivered to southampton instead of didcot today .
neutral	i was quoted a very good price , but then at check - out found there was a booking charge .
neutral	( no other airport_parking does that to my knowledge .)
neutral	cancellation_insurance and sms notification were added automatically and needed to be removed if not wanted , and they ' re off on the rhs of the window -- except they weren_'_t removed and i ended_up paying for them .
neutral	ok , so it '_s only a couple of quid , but it '_s the principle .
neutral	i requested a refund of those " extras "-- and they were refunded within half - hour .
neutral	a disappointment very speedily righted .
neutral	fairly good service at lanzarote_airport , though we had to wait nearly an_hour for the coach to be allocated and then had to walk a very long way to the coach park ( this bit isn_'_t resorthoppa '_s fault )
neutral	i bought this product as a birthday_present and the quality is good .
neutral	however , i was very surprised an disappointed to receive it without_any packaging to protect it and it wasn_'_t a surprise to the person as they saw it !!!
neutral	good product , shame about the service .
neutral	i don_'_t think i ' d buy again from selections .
neutral	ordering was ok but , site is a little cumbersome .
neutral	having to pay for returns is unacceptable !
neutral	we booked our " gateway to europe " in february qualifying for a 00_%_discount plus extras .
neutral	however , though the fare was reduced by 00_% there were no extras .
neutral	on turning_up at the kiosk booth on departure day , we were asked if we would like to book any meals on board for the trip .
neutral	we informed the young_lady on duty that we were due a free breakfast on the outward_bound crossing as an extra for booking our trip in february .
neutral	" never_heard of that offer " was the reply .
neutral	" go to the blue terminal_building , they '_ll sort you out ".
neutral	in monsoon conditions we were instructed to park our motorcycle in lane 0 & we trudged into the terminal_building .
neutral	after 0 minutes we spoke to a perfectly pleasant_young_lady_who then said she had to refer to her superior .
neutral	00_minutes later this gentlemen appeared at the desk in a very superior manner , pointed to our letter & informed us we had booked on the wrong website .
neutral	" how is that possible ?
neutral	how many websites are there ?"
neutral	were my thoughts .
neutral	after all , i ' d managed to secure the 00_% fare discount !
neutral	next in the queue was a gentlemen from glasgow for the very same reason .
neutral	was he computer_illiterate , too ?!
neutral	we have used the newcastle to ijmuiden crossing eight times in eleven years & were disappointed with the outcome .
neutral	we decided not to let this spoil our holiday & proceeded to have a pleasant outbound crossing .
neutral	fifteen days_later we were back in ijmuiden for our return_journey .
neutral	the return crossing was pleasant too except the extractor_fan in the toilet / shower room failed to work .
neutral	aren_'_t these checked after each crossing ?
neutral	i have ordered from this company sometime ago and found the service speedy , however this does not seem to be the case now and i have concerns : -
neutral	0 .
neutral	when you order items you cannot set_up an account and always have to order as a guest .
neutral	this means you cannot track the order process or even see if it has_gone_through .
neutral	0 .
neutral	when payment is taken no confirmation_email of the order is sent .
neutral	0 .
neutral	there is also no email sent to notify of goods dispatch .
neutral	i still have no idea if my goods have been sent even_though i ordered two_days ago .
neutral	0 .
neutral	their phone number is simply an answer machine .
neutral	i phoned first thing this morning to enquire as to the status of my order and left a message for them to call me back .
neutral	this did not happen in a reasonable time so i called again late_afternoon and left another message for a call back .
neutral	i am still_awaiting this call .
neutral	this is simply not good enough and is shoddy and unprofessional , yet at the same time i was happy with the quality of the items i ordered in the past .
neutral	i can only hope that i do eventually receive good quality products , but i shouldn_'_t have to hope , i should know especially since i have also paid for first_class post two_days ago already .
neutral	i debate whether i will spend good money with a company you can '_t contact in the future .
neutral	caveat_emptor as they say .
neutral	did not like the idea of pay up front before you receive the goods .
neutral	never had that before in all my dealings in buying items !
neutral	but the items were delivered on time after a problem with who pays customs at gatwick !
neutral	but the items were ver good
neutral	good light_weight product pity it wasn_'_t what i ordered
neutral	i have never had any_problems dealing_with the hut .
neutral	on occasion i can find deals there that beat the prices of both play . com and amazon . co . uk , but those deals are quite few and far between and usually only appear when they have their sales .
neutral	they often inundate me with emails_informing_me about new sales they have running , and if i didn_'_t know better i ' d say that they were always running a sale of some kind .
neutral	overall , i ' d say that the hut is acceptable , but it is rarely my first choice when it comes to buying books , dvds , or games .
neutral	the company did not leave the vip night club tickets at the hotel reception so we had to pay entry ourselves and have not received a refund .
neutral	go_karting was great fun and the hotel was in an excellent location .
neutral	strip club was cheap and grotty .
neutral	i paid for 0 items and i received only one of the items and the recite for all items delivered by post but not notifying_me about the remaining items in the warehouse unpacked for the delivery until 0 days_later that i made a call for the enquiry .
neutral	outward_journey quick boarding although rough at sea the princess and crew is a lovely ship with a happy crew . cabin with a double_bed excellent for a mature set of o . a . ps .
neutral	like us .
neutral	return trip not so good , king seaways .
neutral	0 oaps asked for a twin_room and was given bunk_beds . struggled o yeh even worse trying to get down .
neutral	i bought a onesie from boohoo - i purchased a medium as i am not big and used the normal sizing_guides .
neutral	it arrived and was very small indeed .
neutral	i returned it and ordered the large which should be plenty big enough .
neutral	i have a 00 " waist and 00 " chest and am 0 ' 0 '.
neutral	again , the large arrived .
neutral	not only are the arms way too short the length in the body is also way to small , it fits at the waist but its tight across the chest .
neutral	i didnt_bother returning it again but have learned my lesson about buying clothes online .
neutral	bedding is good quality from bedeck not a problem with any of the items we bought .
neutral	issue i have is we bought bedding which wasn_'_t needed , so i wanted to exchange them for a double_bed instead of a single .
neutral	contacted bedeck and was given an returns code to send the items to ireland .
neutral	which isn_'_t very cheap to do .
neutral	i would have lost a good chunck of the money i paid for the items , when there is a bedeck shop only 00_minutes drive from me , so simple to return items there .
neutral	nope , if you buy online they must go back to bedeck ireland .
neutral	so instead of putting in another order for more than £_000 plus exchanging the bedding i got to a larger_size which i would have paid the difference in price .
neutral	bedeck got no sale .
neutral	i just shopped in other stores .
neutral	in this day and age when there is a lot of companys going out of business you would think bedeck would try more to accomodate the customer .
neutral	no real complaints , wonderful bike at a price which couldn_'_t be_beaten .
neutral	however , there was a problem with the delivery of it , which may not have been wiggles fault .
neutral	was told that day it would arrive , and then on that particular day the delivery company emailed to say there was a problem and it would be delivered another day .
neutral	very irritating !
neutral	in addition , wiggle were supposed to set the bike up including the saddle height for which they had asked the inside_leg measurement .
neutral	i don_'_t believe they did that , unless i managed to get the inside_leg measurement totally wrong .
neutral	minor_niggles , and probably a bit mean to only use three stars .
neutral	00days now since i paid for a cordlees drill battery .
neutral	no emails or contact yet still not delivered 😳
neutral	my goods have arrived ..
neutral	ok i called allbatteries and they was very helpful .
neutral	my goods had been dispatched within 0 days and had been left at the parcel_force sorting_office .
neutral	finally they delivered them to the next door_neighbour , wrong_address
neutral	well_done allbatteries i will use again , shame on you parcel_force
neutral	price great , delivery great , but touch pad didn_'_t work on acer_laptop .
neutral	trying to get hold of returns manager very difficult , put on hold for 00mins after manager failed to return my first call previous day .
neutral	got wait to they look at laptop before i can have a replacement .
neutral	makes you want to got to the stores and buy a laptop knowing you can get it replaced straightaway
neutral	i '_m loosing weight which is what it '_s about , but before signing_up to the 00 week plan i called and asked general questions about the diet and if there would be any offers coming up .
neutral	i was told no .
neutral	one week_later there is a promotion with a 00_%_discount on the price .
neutral	i '_m paying £_000 per_month and it would have been £_00 !!
neutral	it '_s a huge_difference and i '_m very disappointed .
neutral	the best price i found on net and said that the washer_dryer was in stock and would be delivered a few_days_later .
neutral	a few_days_later i got an email_saying that they were out of stock and it would be another week , nearly 0_weeks_later and after having to chase them a few_times on phone to see what was happening they set a date and it was delivered unfortunately it had a large_dent in one side so was returned and then redelivered a few_days_later , i found it annoying that it was me having to make the calls and chase for info rather_than the other way round .
neutral	that said machine looks and works great !!
neutral	thanks
neutral	initially rang aol to change my payment preferances and got talked into changing my phone provider from bt to talktalk .
neutral	just took a look at the confirmation_email and even_though the operator was given my date of birth , i noticed that it was wong on the email .
neutral	my review may change when i have been with them for a while , will wait to see
neutral	i have repeated lost deliveries here in spain .
neutral	the problem is that tracking is not seamless across borders and delays are experienced whilst we hang on awaiting the possible arrival !
neutral	solution - find a company that gives across border tracking
neutral	great product only_snag is the item description was very in accurate !
neutral	the description stated 0 batteries came with the drill but only one arrived with it .
neutral	i spoke to the store and they told me it was a generic description just copied from the internet as a guide .
neutral	the discription i should of taken notice off was supposed to inform what was " in the box " but that was wrong also and didn_'_t mention any batteries at all !!
neutral	!
neutral	i was then told to use the photo as a discription although they were not clear if there was one or two batteries .
neutral	i was offered a full_refund but this wasn_'_t an option as i needed it straight_away to do some work that i had pre arranged as i was advised when the drill was going to be delivered , so i had no option but to just accept it .
neutral	it would of been nice to be offered an_alternative to just a full_refund maybe a discount would of softened the blow .
neutral	i hope someone contacts me !
neutral	while making the payment the site crashed , there was no_indication that the order went through , so i re - ordered , i then received two products , i only want one , now i have to arrange to send one back .
neutral	rgs
neutral	i have been using maximuscle for a while now , it '_s a good product but will be looking elsewhere for a similar product at a better price .
neutral	maximuscle please lower prices in order to keep my custom .
neutral	ive started useing parcel_monkey to send parcels as i found them to be cheeper
neutral	i do still use you for some parcels but my volume has shifted from you to parcel_monkey
neutral	i ordered a bed from this company as it was the one we were after and other_sites didn_'_t have it in stock in their warehouse .
neutral	the item didn_'_t arrive in the specified time and also some excuse about their couriers however what is misleading is that they don_'_t have it in stock in their warehouse , the times are at the manufactures .... a slight misdescription .
neutral	i was also assured the delivery driver would carry the two packaged to the desired room , clearly my 0 month pregnant_wife wasn_'_t able to do this , however the driver refused ... another disappointment with this company .
neutral	apart_from these issues the bed is very good however in hindsight i would have paid slightly more money from another company as i would have probably received better service .
neutral	i always forget to go through_topcashback until too late .
neutral	mind you , i am still_waiting for over £_00 due from august so do not really want to give a favourable response until this isreceived .
neutral	order came quickly and no_problems ordering online .
neutral	however the box was very bashed on arrival and a plastic part of the car_seat had snapped_off , clearly a result of mishandling .
neutral	as the part was not essential for the safe functioning of the car_seat we did not return it but it was disappointing that clearly little care had been taking either with storage or transport .
neutral	only thing was checking out .
neutral	wasnt easy paying the discount price .
neutral	would need to use the site a couplke more times .
neutral	really handy .
neutral	normally find what i am looking for pretty quick .
neutral	i '_ve_used rubbersole a few_times .
neutral	their selection and stock_levels are excellent and their prices have always been ok , but this last order , for a pair of sebago docksides , suffered from slow dispatch and delivery .
neutral	they arrived within about 0 days , which is within their quoted_timescale but nowhere_near what others offer .
neutral	sorry just 0_stars today .
neutral	service and delivery were spot on but the product was entirely different to what i thought .
neutral	a pretty awful idea for a costume .
neutral	it needs permanent inflation by a portable fan .
neutral	the chosen flowers were not sent
neutral	this is the first time i have used your service .
neutral	went through the booking_procedure last night for two tyres .
neutral	selected two of all items in the number boxes , when i finished the transaction it was only for one tyre so i emailed customer_services this morning .
neutral	i got no reply so i called to explain , person was very nice and explained that the order could be changed to two , i asked if it would be easier to submit another order he said it would , i submitted another order for the other tyre .
neutral	perhaps it could be made easier to change orders , no response from customer_services after 0 hoursis not acceptable .
neutral	cool site .
neutral	nice concept .
neutral	wonderful prices for products .
neutral	shipping_costs are terrible .
neutral	eventually got a second bunch of flowers after disappointment with the first .
neutral	not a brilliant customer service experience but the flowers were all in tact and very good .
neutral	initial high_standard somewhat wilted with latest experience .
neutral	i was a bit_concerned when i had an email after about a week asking if i had changed my mind about selling the phones as they had not received them .
neutral	strangely , though , another email arrived the very next_morning saying they had arrived and a cheque was on its way .
neutral	it seems the freepost sysstem is a bit slower_than fonebank realise .
neutral	it does work , though , so i got the money !
neutral	when my mother received her flowers some of the heads of the gerbera where missing .
neutral	she was very disappointed she didn_'_t expect this and to be honest i didn_'_t either .
neutral	it could of been a transit problem .
neutral	regards
neutral	paul picton
neutral	this item was good value for money , however i found that the cape was too_tight around the neck for me and a few of my friends tryed it and they are alot smaller_size and it was tight on them too , so i had to make alterations to it myself ,
neutral	probably more down to indesit but service was less_than satisfactory .
neutral	i was advised that the delivery day would be confirmed my email , it was not so i was unaware of what day it was going to arrive .
neutral	also i was told that i would be given a 0 hour_window , again i was not .
neutral	only when i got a call from the driver saying he was outside my house did it was arriving !
neutral	the driver asked me how long i was going to take to get home and said 00mins .
neutral	to which he replied ' ok but any longer and we will be gone ' which i thought was a bit rude .
neutral	so not the best of experiences unfortunately .
neutral	i initially started to use liberty_flights due to a recommendation from a friend .
neutral	at first i was very pleased and felt ( and still feel ) that the fluids provided are to a very good quality and better_than some others i have tried form various other_websites providing very similar products .
neutral	having said this the thing that has put me off is the atomisers that i have purchased from liberty_flights .
neutral	the first i purchased stopped_working within 0_weeks which disappointed me and having contacted liberty_flights through their facebook_page was simply told that its not guaranteed to work beyond two_weeks so there was nothing that could be done .
neutral	i do appreciate they are not the most expensive item so simply considered replaceable but after this experience i have been purchasing my atomisers and fluid chambers from other_websites and in all cases they have lasted_longer , in some cases up to 0 months .
neutral	i did think maybe i had just been a bit unlucky with the first i ordered so i have relatively recently_purchased another from you as i did find delivery and other items good in the past but sadly the same has happened and i have now had to revert to other_websites to buy the atomisers and fluid chamber .
neutral	this is a bit_disappointing because due to delivery costs its makes more sense for me to order everything from one single place therefore i have stopped using liberty_flights for the meantime .
neutral	as i have said above some products are very good but due to the let_down on the two occassions referred to above it has lead me to shop around .
neutral	i bought two bean sprouters ( terracotta ).
neutral	really good qnd work well , but one of them was slightly chipped which was a shame .
neutral	instructions for use could be fuller too .
neutral	but delivery excellent ( arrived even before the money cleared from my account !
neutral	).
neutral	average , had better
neutral	i ordered and paid for a short tail spiral telephone cable for my telephone but to my disappointment was sent a long tail cable !
neutral	this suggests a lack of attention to detail on the part of the despatch dept .
neutral	sales_rep came out on same day and issued loan within 0 hours
neutral	bought a toilet & sink , payment was easy , delivery was an issue and long_lasting .
neutral	pro : value for money , delivery tracking_system .
neutral	cons_: item ( cistern lid ) had a manufacturing_fault , need a new lid , awaiting feedback from customer service team .
neutral	overall the experience was good but some minor details on wardrobe are poor .
neutral	the supporting wooden struts under the wardrobe are held in place by sellotape , very poor for such a quality piece of furniture .
neutral	don_'_t know why they aren_'_t glued in place or secured properly with screws or brackets .
neutral	when taking the car in verona ( italy ), i was advised to upgrade because the car is small ( lancia ypsilon ), but the size was ok in particular for narrow italy streets , and i liked the car .
neutral	the real problem is that the car has engine of only 00 hp , which you cannot access until you go to 0000_rpm .
neutral	considering the mountainous landscape , it was a nightmare to drive .
neutral	for example , you simply cannot climb up a steep_hill on the 0st gear if tachometer goes lower that 0000_rpm -- forget about the 0nd , burn the clutch !
neutral	on the motorway , your limit is 000_km / h , and it will take a really long time to speed up above 000 ...
neutral	ii '_s really a sorrow -- the car has a nice suspension and steering , modern options like engine start / stop , ok for both highway and mountain roads , but the engine is a real problem ...
neutral	why is it after_placing an order for nearly_£_00 i receive a discount
neutral	code number to save me money about a week after delivery of my goods .
neutral	simply_supplements know quite well i will not be ordering again for a long time .
neutral	items i order from other_companies in jersey arrive quicker_than
neutral	from s s . s s blame royal_mail that '_s not true .
neutral	they say order is dispatched so they can legally take the money from your card , but has it really been dispatched ???
neutral	?
neutral	the coffee was spot on but the capsules have not worked a number of times in my machine .
neutral	the plastic seems really though for my machine to pierce and a number of times the capsules haven_'_t burst through the foil so i then have to retrieve it and pierce it with a knife to get my cup of coffee
neutral	overall the service vehicle and pickup was great
neutral	however i was ripped_off on fuel
neutral	i was charged € 00 (£_00 ) for a full_tank of fuel in a smart 000 - however as i own the same vehicle at home i know it only take £_00 max an over change of £_00
neutral	also as palma is not that big i only used half a tank of fuel so that also made money out of me on that
neutral	left a bitter_taste
neutral	james h
neutral	the guy to collect and bring back was late both_times by 00 - 00_minutes .
neutral	frustrating at the time .
neutral	i complained that they put right the mistake and were seriously apologetic .
neutral	they get great reviews most of the time , which is why i chose them , but this seems to have been a blip .
neutral	there was no argument when i complained and they were swift in making good .
neutral	i ' d give them another chance
neutral	i use the airport_parking frequently for business due to location which should help a quick exit , unfortunately this is never the case as despite paying online you always have to stop at the barrier and quote your reference
neutral	when booking in my car to get new tyres you can only pick morning or afternoon which is no good as i cant make any other plans for the whole morning ....... i think there should be tighter time slots .
neutral	cable ended_up going to wrong_address , but when it showed up was very happy with the product .
neutral	thanks
neutral	andy
neutral	delivery a bit_slow this time
neutral	cant say to much about animed_direct at the moment as only just gone with them , however must_admit there delivery was very quick & the price for the tablets was quite good .
neutral	will have to see how they work on ben ?.
neutral	will let you know later on .
neutral	sadly since last_year the depot equipment has_been changed so you could no_longer fit the lwb van in as they did last_year .
neutral	on the plus_side bookings team spotted this and tried hard to find a depot that could do my mot .
neutral	unfortunately i have to go_elsewhere but a really courteous staff , thanks for trying .
neutral	clever service but reward is poor
neutral	it would have been much more efficient and cheaper for a very small item to be sent by post .
neutral	we did not appreciate the delay in delivery when royal_mail would have delivered it on time .
neutral	delivered to wrong_address
neutral	good service normally but did not received on time even when preordered 0 month_ago .
neutral	ordered pedal set for a porsche 000 no mentioned when ordering that there would be a delay for 0_weeks for item .
neutral	in the meantime no phonecall , email or text to say why it was taking so long .
neutral	after a few weeks i had to contact the company to find out where my items where and was told it would be another few weeks .
neutral	at last they turned_up 0_weeks after the order with half the order missing .
neutral	after yet another phonecall was told they would be delivered in a few_days .
neutral	not happy with company and would not be using them again .
neutral	but the pedals do look nice .
neutral	i would recomend a friend if needs reliable servives and car_rental , but he must take more time to check for snags in vehicle ( signs of smoking , windscreen rubber blades , ligths properly balanced - not one up and other down )
neutral	the review system is useless - will not let you give a bad review for those that deserve it - what is the point if all you can do is give a good one ?.
neutral	the recent change to the format for placing items for sale has complicated things - should have been left as it was
neutral	great selection and very competitively_priced but the delivery service left something to be desired .
neutral	part of the delivery arrived the day before the arranged day ( fortunately i was at home ).
neutral	the rest arrived the next_day but required the driver to phone me as he only had my post_code and my name as home .
neutral	good job i was at home when he called .
neutral	your despatch department needs a bit of attention .
neutral	not complaining just trying to be constructive .
neutral	mr abel
neutral	item ( black dress_shirt ) i ordered got lost in the post , which is obviously not my tuxedo '_s fault , but did mean i didn_'_t have the item for when i needed it .
neutral	replacement was sent and instead of courier delivery ( which would have been unnecessary ) i opted for a free bow_tie , but was a little disappointed that the free bow_tie was black when the shirt i ordered was also black .
neutral	good prices and one of the few places i '_ve found that sells black dress_shirts .
neutral	the gentleman on the phone was also very helpful , but a fair_amount of hassle all things_considered .
neutral	my delivery to the usa took almost three_weeks to arrive , and when it did arrive , the box was damaged and crushed due to the flimsy box .
neutral	it appears that the us postal service had attempted to save the contents from being lost by wrapping the package in shrink_wrap before forwarding on , hence the delay .
neutral	i ordered a same day delivery which arrived on time .
neutral	the flowers exactly as presented on the website .
neutral	i have ordered two beds and a number of chests of drawers from oakfurnitureland .
neutral	these were all from their rustic ( rus ) range .
neutral	the quality of the items is excellent .
neutral	the deliveries also went without a hitch .
neutral	i would rate the products that this compay offers as " excellent ".
neutral	however , you do need to be very careful with their promotions as i have found out when checking the site , today , to put in another order .
neutral	rus00 ( drawers ) was ordered in may 0000 ( at the time of no special sale ) and it cost £_000 . 00 .
neutral	the price of this item in their new year savings sale is currently £_000 . 00 .
neutral	higher .
neutral	likewise , rus00 ( bed ) was ordered in may 0000 for £_000 . 00 but in their current ' sale ' it is priced at £_000 . 00 , again higher_than at normal times .
neutral	good products , and the price differences are small , but just be sure that you ' re getting the best deal from them .
neutral	obviously any company reserves the right to price as they wish , but this could be seen as a little_bit misleading .
neutral	don_'_t be taken - in by the massive_discounts that are presented via their website .
neutral	ordered a couple of go pro camcorder '_s and slr '_s for myself and my brother as a birthday / baby gift to capture his and his wife '_s baby .
neutral	knew about the quality of the slr '_s but the go pro '_s as excellent as they are to put on a person / vehicle / underwater in wide_angle though give this impression in the write up .
neutral	so they weren_'_t what was required to film the baby and the slr had video function which my brother was happy with so an enquiry to slrhut . co . uk for a return and refund / exchange was available but only to the us offices i asked about sending to the uk address to be told it is only a uk conference room ( caretakers cupboard with an address really with a net look ) so with time and looking to send it back it was going to cost half of the refund to send them back .
neutral	so excellent if you are happy with knowing what you are getting but any problem in returns it is costly both time wise and money wise .
neutral	private sales on ebay was the end_result of the go pro '_s .
neutral	positives for slr_hut are good prices and a telephone_call to make_sure you are genuine .
neutral	down_side is saying they ' re uk_based when infact it '_s pretty_much all from the usa .
neutral	so good if you know what you are after rather_than a blind buy from pictures from the internet .
neutral	unfortunately actual shops carrying camera / video equipment are thin on the ground these days ( in the uk ) so can '_t see the items you are looking to get and compare .
neutral	i ordered 0 lithium 0 . 0v_batteries online , these are specific batteries required for alarm sensors and hard to find in high_street_shops .
neutral	the batteries arrived on time , within three_days of normal shipping , however 0 battery is completely flat - no power !
neutral	!
neutral	very nice lady rang and apologised for lack of stock , was given options for stock items but decided to wait for the order placed .
neutral	as usual be prepared for the extra_insurance when you collect to get fully covered even thoigh it says it us included as a special_offer .
neutral	also be prepared to pay for an expensive full_tank of fuel .
neutral	i expected this so was not annoyed when i collected the car .
neutral	finding the right priced tyres and booking my car in to have them fitted was quick and easy .
neutral	saturday p . m . was the time set for the tyres to be fitted .
neutral	i get a call midday friday to say they can '_t get the tyres to the fitting_station ( national_tyres ) until monday so i re - arrange the fitting to monday p . m .
neutral	i call monday mid_morning and i '_m told the tyres are not there yet and they would call me when they were .
neutral	no call all afternoon so i call at 0 . 00 p . m . to which there is no answer .
neutral	i call again 00 . 00 a . m . on tuesday and my tyres were there .
neutral	go in at 0 p . m . and get them fitted while i wait , all done by 0 . 00 p . m .
neutral	the flowers were great , and pleased the recipient , which was the main_thing , and delivery was fast and as promised .
neutral	the computer ordering system is very user - unfriendly , however , and serves them - not you .
neutral	if you report a problem they send a message to you to tell you that they have posted the answer somewhere_else - why ?
neutral	why not send the answer directly to you ?
neutral	them still advertising a telephone_helpline which they no_longer answer ( to be more efficient ) didn_'_t help , and it was only because an operative ( jade - thank_you ) telephoned me that i was able to place my order after 0 very frustrating days of trying .
neutral	flowers 0 / 00 , staff 0 / 00 , ordering system 0 / 00 would i use again ?
neutral	i '_ll try because their flowers / vfm
neutral	service was ok not out of this world , reasonable wait time of about 00_minutes .
neutral	meant to be a 0 to 0 day delivery , still_waiting 0 days on .
neutral	had to chase to find out where my order was !, they were awaiting delivery of the product i had ordered .
neutral	would have been nice for them to have told me and not for me to chase .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting .
neutral	on a positive_note though the prices are very good .
neutral	order was dispatched by you 00th_dec now 00th_dec
neutral	0 to 0 working_days days for delivery not acheived
neutral	when booking you have no idea where you will be staying ( if you book accommodation ) as you just select a category .
neutral	if you ask to know the name of the accommodation you ' re told that the information is only released once the full_amount has_been paid .
neutral	i had so many people asking me where we were staying as they wanted to know what they were paying for but couldn_'_t tell them !
neutral	ordered duracell aaa_rechargeable_batteries but panansonic were provided , which would have been cheaper_elsewhere .
neutral	no explanation ( such as out of stock maybe ) was provided and no part refund was offered .
neutral	moreover , the invoice claimed to have sold duracell which is therefore incorrect .
neutral	maybe it was an honest packing mistake , but as the substitute product is suitable for purpose and the order value is small won_'_t bother returning .
neutral	won_'_t be using buyabattery again .
neutral	i was very pleased with the goods and delivery .
neutral	communication was also good .
neutral	i was , however , less_than delighted when a courtesy_call confirming order and delivery turned into a hard_sell for " extended_warranty " type thing ( never have to buy another fridge ).
neutral	this ended with a request for my bank details which i declined to provide .
neutral	if such a service is available it should be made available at point of sale , not as an add on to a service call .
neutral	seems an ok company , who communicate very well , but on all occasions the delivery date quoted was nowhere_near - 0 / 0 days out .
neutral	as it has to be signed for , this is a distinct disadvanyage
neutral	i found a number i liked and went_ahead with the purchase .
neutral	the people at speedy_registrations were really helpful and within a couple of weeks the plate was on my car .
neutral	the shed base was good and did the job .
neutral	the shed was of dissapointing quality .
neutral	there were so many knots that left very little wood to act as support in fact the door end and one of the sides had spars broken through the knots .
neutral	on the door end some of the cladding had no overlap at all and the nails werent going through both pieces , when the nails were removed to make repairs they were found to be rusty .
neutral	oh and by the way the door did not fit due to the cladding not lining up .
neutral	it took longer to repair than to assemble .
neutral	i get the impression that this unit at sometime was a reject and certainly not to the quality of the units shown in the online pictures .
neutral	having got it in the garden and unpacked it the faults did not become apparrent until it was partially assembled by which time i considered it too late to try for a replacement .
neutral	i thing the people i purchased this from need to check the quality control of the partners who made this shed .
neutral	i would add that the frames were square .
neutral	the assembley instructions were quite good but not perfect .
neutral	pleased to find injury specific tape and a good shop online !
neutral	though i found what i was looking for it would be nice if a more waterproof zinc_oxide tape was available and taping instructions on the app for turf toe should be more specific !
neutral	although the method was helpful , categorising this injury in the same bracket as bunion correction is i feel a little general !
neutral	long broom handle , good product well_packed . even allowing for xmas_holidays , the delivery time was far longer_than_expected . i was informed by e_- mail of current_situation ,
neutral	which was good .
neutral	i arrived without booking and found that the ticket price was three_times the normal !
neutral	i booked for the next_day first ferry and secured the normal price .
neutral	had to wait for 0 hours though !
neutral	thus price differentual us too big .
neutral	the package was delivered by a parcel company .
neutral	when i asked the driver about the gaping opening at the top of the box , he said " thats how it was given to me " .
neutral	i accepted the cistern for a toilet as i wanted to carry out the installation asap .
neutral	the cardboard ripped and , as i say wide open .. all the parts seem to be in the box .
neutral	ordered friday , expected monday , was not dispatched until monday
neutral	i ordered 0 of the same unit , at time of ordering , the website seemed to indicate that both units were indeed available .
neutral	i placed the order only to find out 00_hours_later that one unit was actually out of stock and wouldn_'_t be available for at_least 0 week .
neutral	the unit that was in stock was dispatched very quickly and arrived in good time .
neutral	exactly_what i wanted , just only half the products !
neutral	rather annoying that i had to go to a more_expensive competitor and also pay for next_day delivery to get the additional unit in time for the job i needed them for .
neutral	on the one hand , i think the pricing is great , communication is also good ( the delay in being told one unit was out of stock downgraded this from great ) and my emails were responded to promptly .
neutral	the refund for the 0nd unit has also taken longer_than 00_hours to come through ( still_waiting ) which is inexcusable with todays fast banking systems .
neutral	i have signed_up to topcashback , the idea is good but i can not find any offers worth taking part in .
neutral	the cashback_rates are generally low and full of terms and conditions , and i can not find anything worth purchasing from the traders taking part in the scheme .
neutral	if there is a special_offer on with one the traders your cashback is severally reduced or eliminated altogether .
neutral	i would like to purchase an ipad_mini from a retailer which will cost me £_000 . 00 and the best cashback deals works out at just £ 0 . 00 !!
neutral	!
neutral	none of the people i recommended to sign up thinks it is worth it .
neutral	would someone explain how you can get even £_00 . 00 back without spending £ 0000 '_s
neutral	mark bowles
neutral	brought some lemon kush and afghan seeds , says on the packet that they are 00_% feminized but all i got were males !!
neutral	i don_'_t appreciate this as it '_s a waste of time an effort .
neutral	something needs to be done :(
neutral	didnt receive any mail as expected to advise delivery .
neutral	item was left at thankfully honest neighbours !
neutral	guess that was the delivery company but their delivery conditions should me more strict
neutral	our last order is a fused mass of unusable capsules and as yet we have had no response from the supplier .
neutral	consequently any comment at this point would be unfair .
neutral	i much preferred the old web_site where a discounted guide price was displayed when enquiring_about new watches .
neutral	this allowed_me to compare in real time and was a fundamental factor effecting my decision to purchase two watches from watchfinder .
neutral	the current process of call back is in my opinion placing a unnecessary hurdle in the way which in todays_world of immediate communication is frustrating .
neutral	i appreciate that the company may want to promote direct contact and personalised service however for me the removal of price visibility from the web_site has a negative impact on my perception of the site .
neutral	easy process to scan and send items but 0_weeks from placing order to receiving cash is too long .
neutral	regular_emails_updating progress but even when items have been approved and payment is ready to be processed there are more hoops to jump_through - verifying bank details then confirmation that payment has_been passed for processing then it takes another 0_weeks for cash to be credited .
neutral	shouldn_'_t need to take this long !
neutral	use competitors instead - better prices generally better and whole_process much_quicker !
neutral	didnt arrive on the day id requested . i spent all day in waiting with my children i couldnt go_anywhere and they were bored .
neutral	when i rang customer_services i was assured they would be delivered up until 0pm by royal_mail yet nothing .
neutral	not happy at all neither was the rest of my family who had to stay in too .
neutral	i was happy with the price but the length of time it took from sending the phone off to receiving the money via transfer was a joke a total of 00 days it shouldn_'_t take that long to test a mobile .
neutral	there are plenty of other_companys what offer very similar prices and operate a lot quicker ( inside 00 days )
neutral	bt should learn that customers don_'_t want to wait hours trying to speak to someone in india !
neutral	we all have enough frustration in our day to day lives without getting it from bt .
neutral	achica '_s website seems to have been designed to make shopping as difficult as possible especially using an ipad .
neutral	historically , it was simple to select the product catagory and scroll to one '_s required item .
neutral	now , you have wade_through numerous suppliers and items , which are of no interest to find the item you actually want to by .
neutral	i used to visit it daily now i just don_'_t bother very much .
neutral	i bought the michael myers outfit .
neutral	it was reduced from £_000 to £_00 .
neutral	this was a great deal and i saw the same product at my local fancy_dress store for £_000 .
neutral	however , the boiler suit was poor quality and the zip_broke after a few uses in one night .
neutral	ordering from the online store is always fine but their insistence on using interlink courier causes a great deal of fricton for me .
neutral	inevitably i will need to collect from a courier collection depot as i work full time and the interlink depot is right on the other side of the city and closes at 00am on a saturday .
neutral	i have to get a bus and a train to get there , which means i have to get up early on my beautiful precious saturday_morning .
neutral	aaaargh !
neutral	if they just royal_mail the friction would be reduced to a buttery glide .
neutral	poundland is cheap because everything is 0 pound but the reason i only put it three star is because of the quality of the products isnt that good but they have alot of things in store and good if you just need something quickly and dont have enough money
neutral	just ordered a down vest from these_guys .
neutral	i ordered a size too big , returned it and ordered a smaller one .
neutral	order confirmation , dispatch confirmation and delivery was prompt on both orders .
neutral	the return was less straightforward but okay .
neutral	i had to chase the refund on the returned item as within a week they hadn_'_t confirmed the return .
neutral	when i rang they had no record of it coming_back so i was rather glad to have proof of delivery .
neutral	as it happened i didn_'_t need it as the full_refund did come through a couple of days_later , i '_ve no idea whether chasing it helped .
neutral	the staff on the phone were pretty helpful answering_questions and chasing orders etc .
neutral	however , none of my email correspondence was answered , i '_m not sure anyone there is even dealing_with it at the moment .
neutral	secondly , i received no confirmation of my returned item , they just credited it straight back to my account .
neutral	not a bad_experience all in all , but they really do need to work or their correspondence .
neutral	fast delivery but i thought the product was a bit over priced .
neutral	i recently_bought a number of items of garden equipment including two draper branded garden rakes - stainless_steel with ash handles .
neutral	both these rakes appeared to be poorly_constructed in that in each case the head was loose on the handle and there appeared to be no way to tighten it .
neutral	obviously if i had been able to view these products before buying i would not have bought them .
neutral	apart_from this the products arrived in a timely_fashion and were well_packed .
neutral	ordered for mothers_day and was delivered on the sat morning as requested .
neutral	the flowers looked beautiful .
neutral	however as " deluxe " @ £_00 expected a lot more than what you would get in tesco for £_00 .
neutral	i do not think good value for money consideing i paid extra for delivery on top .
neutral	used to be my one - stop - shop , but since the kingfisher ( b_& q ) takeover prices have gone_through the roof .
neutral	guess they don_'_t want to take business from b_& q .
neutral	on the upside , service is still good , but now it '_s always worth_checking toolstation et_al as someone_else will usually have the same thing cheaper .
neutral	great price on a model of head skis hard to find in new england .
neutral	although the website listed them as in stock , they were actually shipped from europe with about a one week delay .
neutral	the binding sole length and din settings were incorrect , despite providing the required info on the website .
neutral	however , the adjustments were easy for me to make after the skis arrived .
neutral	good product but not impressed with prices for delivery
neutral	i book every year a golfing holiday to spain the hotel alay appartments this year had to book 0 appartments with lowcost hols because was told none available from yourselfs !!!!
neutral	only to find later they became_available cancelled a 0 bed apartment with low_cost to get the accomidation i wanted with low_cost charged me !!
neutral	please notify_me at the earliest time poss trust me we go every year 0 to 00 people thx
neutral	we ordered a 00 - page_photobook .
neutral	the software to make it up was pretty easy to use once you got the hang of it .
neutral	the book arrived a few_days ago and we are quite disappointed with the quality of the prints .
neutral	they basically look like they have been printed on a home printer .
neutral	they were high resolution photos of great quality but look anything like it in the book .
neutral	sadly , i would not use this again or recommend to anybody
neutral	whilst i love the website and the despatching of the goods is very quick , the courier ( city_link ) that drinkshop employ is a disaster .
neutral	not only did they not turn_up on the day i paid for but i then had to wait 00_minutes before being latched on to a monosyllabic uninterested mumbling buffoon of a person in " customer_services " lying through his back teeth as to why my parcel hadn_'_t been delivered on the day requested .
neutral	i had to wait_until the following_day to receive my parcel .
neutral	drinkshop to their credit ' phoned virtually after they received my e_- mail and promptly apologised and refunded my delivery fee .
neutral	the delay was in no way drinkshop '_s fault and i would love to use them again but i don_'_t think i will whilst they employ that firm that dares call themselves couriers ( but drinkshop did tell me they are actively looking to appoint new couriers )!
neutral	slight_problem in the fact the website didn_'_t choose the dates i selected , i changed them but forgot to make_sure i still had selected the right destination of cover .
neutral	unfortunately it went to the deafault choice which is europe !
neutral	i sent an email and was given a response , they took the extra i had to pay but i '_ve still not received my updated travel_insurance documents !!
neutral	!
neutral	keeps finding the same threats over & over again without ever deleting them for good .
neutral	safepay does not allow drop down_menus for calendars etc , from the bank sites it '_s protecting .
neutral	this makes safepay so much less intuitive to use that i '_ve stopped using safepay .
neutral	noticed that bitdefender always seems to find more threats the closer you are to the end of your subscription , funny that .
neutral	hi , still_awaiting second order as what i ordered was split into two orders .
neutral	next_day delivery good .
neutral	own_brand zinc_oxide tape not as anticipated - expected a firm hard wound roll not soft and floppy .
neutral	much harder to tear into smaller strips for protecting finger joints .
neutral	paid for next_day delivery on 00st_dec ., product did not arrive until 00th .
neutral	disapointing , if they could not fulfill , they should not have accepted extra postage_costs .
neutral	they have not replied to my mail regarding this .
neutral	will order elswhere in future
neutral	i brought my tickets on this website and yes i did get them and have no_problems what so ever with them when entering the 00 and actually had a very good time too :-)
neutral	however i did find out from a work_colleague that he brought 0 tickets from a different site and got them at half the price i paid .
neutral	the tickets were higher priced than he paid , my tickets were atleast £_000 more before viagogo added an increasing :
neutral	booking_fee :£ 00 . 00 handling_fee : £ 0 . 00 vat : £_00 . 00
neutral	i think this is a bit_steep considering the original price is already £_000 more than other_sites
neutral	i booked hotel_rooms last august with hotels . com , but have only just been paid .
neutral	in fact there is still one payment still outstanding .
neutral	quidco appear to have done their best , and i haven_'_t lost confidence in them , but it has taken a lot of chasing , and too long .
neutral	after paying £ 0 for standard delivery , i finally received the anti - slip flooring strips i ordered .
neutral	however , i was slightly dismayed to find that they were not as i perceived the strips to be !
neutral	i had ordered them to put on decking steps , so that my mother - in - law would be safer when using steps during wet / icy weather , and was initially impressed that the product was advertised as ' recessed '.
neutral	the diagram on the website showed this , sort - of , and i unwittingly assumed that the strips would slot into the recessed grooves in the decking , leaving little of the strip protruding above the surface of the decking steps .
neutral	the strips do not have any grooves / slots on the underside , and so to achieve the desired_result , i now have to recess the decking steps to accept the anti - slip strips !
neutral	description needs to be much clearer please rawlings !
neutral	solid but evil on pricing
neutral	strings_direct are good for mainstream stuff - i need bespoke and these_guys can '_t be doing with the faff .
neutral	oh well
neutral	great delivery and all that and good communication , but having looked at what we got - in the flesh - for the money we paid (!)
neutral	- a ' designer chiminea ' i would say its a rip_off basically .
neutral	we paid £_000 for something really worth £_00 in my obviously subjective estimation ): trading on the idea that its cheaper on line i suppose ; don_'_t be_fooled .
neutral	go to a shop .
neutral	so the shipping itself was easy .
neutral	i just punched in the dimensions and weights on the website and printed out the labels ..
neutral	the courier came and collected my parcels on time , and equally they were delivered on time and in one piece .
neutral	be careful when you book for same day delivery .
neutral	i did ( there was still over 0 hours on the timer ) however after paying , i checked my orders to find there was no availability for a pick_up that day .
neutral	i cancelled the order but was still charged .
neutral	spoke to customer service though and they refunded me , so it wasnt a huge issue or anything , just something to be aware of .
neutral	other than that everything_went_smoothly and i would definalty recommend to anyone ..
neutral	whey chocolate powder_tastes great but it '_s bad form that you don_'_t get a mixing / drinking container with your order !!
neutral	!
neutral	go their its great
neutral	ordered fire online that stated a date for delivery of 00 oct .
neutral	rang company to be told it would be 0 - 0 days delivery and asked if someone would ring me on tuesday 00th to clarify delivery date due to holidays .
neutral	they said they would i am still_waiting ...
neutral	hate to say that the finished item was no way near as good as i ' d expected .
neutral	colours came out badly , especially yellows which came out almost green / grey .
neutral	not as sharp as you ' d expect either , considering i went for the photo_paper .
neutral	such a shame .
neutral	ordered 0 pair of specs on - line , the system hung and no order acknowledgement was sent .
neutral	logged in again and checked my account to find nothing had been ordered , so re - entered details & this time the order was acknowledged .
neutral	0 week_later 0 pairs of specs arrived , i checked my card account to find money had been taken twice .
neutral	i contacted customer_services ( very helpful ) who sent return authorisation etc , unwanted pair was returned - i '_ve not yet checked to see if the money was refunded .
neutral	all unwanted hassle .
neutral	website is a mess but once you get there it all works quite well .
neutral	my top_marks to them are for alerting_me a while back to a fraud on my card .
neutral	you get where you want to in the end .
neutral	assorted stock and prices but when ordered normally efficient service
neutral	easy to find way round website .
neutral	descriptions are sometimes misleading .
neutral	prices erratic against_competitors
neutral	.................
neutral	the whole_experience was convenient a hassle_free .
neutral	no problem finding a space .
neutral	only_downside is the price for a week .
neutral	will look at other options in future .
neutral	this is my review of the pyrex smok aro
neutral	when it arrived a few_days after ordering i was impressed with the quality and solidness of the unit the diameter is a bit larger than a standard ego type battery however it wasn_'_t so big as to look like it wasn_'_t intended to be used on this size of battery loads of vape and quite a large capacity ment i was the ideal tank for me however after a few day '_s it started to flood and then pour liquid from around the base but worst of all i was getting loads of juice in my mouth initial use warrented 0_stars but i have to give it 0 i , ll just add that i have been using ego types for a few_years_now and this atty has leaked the worst of all
neutral	i like the structure and how it encourages you to go through in a logical order .
neutral	i don_'_t like that the the ' report error ' button has_been removed and i am losing confidence in the accuracy as when i submit exercises for reviewing by other busuu community members they correct my turkish even when i have used the same phrase word for word as the busuu example .
neutral	i also wish it was easier to have a look up function to remind me of previous words and phrases .
neutral	there isn_'_t any explanation for some of the grammatical rules , new sentence structures and suffixes are introduced without_any explanation so i have to use trial and error to understand the context ( and a lot of google translate )
neutral	as a frequent_traveller through the airport i often leave my car at the airport .
neutral	as weeks go by the price of the parking rises well on week which is unfair when using it so often .
neutral	vauxhall meriva turbo - car had a few faults that spoilt the overall experience .
neutral	especially as we had the car for a month !
neutral	left turn indicator did not self - cancel .
neutral	drivers seatbelt was stuck in highest position causing wife inconvenience plus hubby as he had to do most of driving because if it .
neutral	rear demister was not working so as it was winter , the rear view was often obscured .
neutral	the electronic handbrake system is very dangerous as you can start the car and rev the engine and it disengages by itself .
neutral	positives - the engine was great ( turbo ), the space was best as i could see when choosing a car of the " astra size ".
neutral	i downloaded the app for my ipad and spent hours creating a photobook only to then find i could not upload it .
neutral	i called customer_services who basically said the app wasn_'_t designed for that so hard luck .
neutral	surprisingly i then used their software on my pc and found it to be very good .
neutral	plenty of options and easy to us .
neutral	waited in from 0000 to 0000 as advised by carrier ( a friday ), nothing !
neutral	finally arrived on the monday purchase --- exellent delivery ---- despicable !
neutral	the hotel really let the whole_experience down !
neutral	the show was fantastic with great seats , but the travelodge in southwark was such a let_down !
neutral	there was very little price difference in hotels , so just our bad_luck !
neutral	should have realised when we booked in and a family were booking out early .
neutral	excellent prices but had issues with original order not being available even_though i specifically_asked .
neutral	second order was a bit_slow on delivery but the price made up for it .
neutral	would certainly use again but not when time matters !
neutral	good service , very efficient however i '_m not sure if this is the manufacturer or your mistake but my adam kimmel sunglasses that retail at £_000 , come with no cloth to clean the lenses .
neutral	i '_m unsure if it was specified in the product description however i do believe this is essential to the product .
neutral	i didn_'_t notice the tiny tab saying ' canvas '.. and the magnifying bit with acrylic_print makes it look like a ' canvas '!..
neutral	my fault for not paying tooo much attention to detail , but your screen doesn_'_t make it easy to understand first time around !
neutral	the ordering and delivery service was good as always , but the quality of the handles was not as good as expected for the price .
neutral	i had to polish the handles with duraglit to get_rid of the black marks and achieve some form of clean satin shine .
neutral	as i have not had much success finding this type of handle for sliding_doors , i have accepted them as there seems to be little in the way of alternatives .
neutral	i had to try a number of times before my on line booking was accepted , although i kept clicking on the buy button , nothing happened and i had to log in again the following_day twice before the booking actually worked
neutral	i have made 0 orders to just poles in the last month .
neutral	the web_site was a bit_iffy as the search_function did not seem to recognize the specific poles i was looking for and i had to trawl the site to find them - twice .
neutral	after that the process worked pretty well up to the point where payment was taken .
neutral	at that point the process and the web_site tracking page froze .
neutral	for both orders i had to ring or e_mail to find out what was happening .
neutral	for the first order , the poles had been despatched but the website tracking page had not been updated .
neutral	they arrived the day i made my ' where '_s my stuff ' query .
neutral	for the second order the same information freeze happened but when i called it seems the poles had been sent to the wrong place and no one had noticed .
neutral	after my call they were found , despatched and i got them next_day .
neutral	in summary , a good e trader with some irritating gaps in their order handling system .
neutral	ebay is a great place to sell your unwanted goods .
neutral	however the account pages where you sell , pay etc is far to complicated .
neutral	it takes you ages just to pay your invoice , and to make a complaint about someone not paying you again is far too complicated .
neutral	keep it simply people !
neutral	fitting_centre tried to extract more money from me by claiming that each wheel would need re - balancing if i wanted my wheels swapping , ie front to rear .
neutral	come on guys .
neutral	really ..!
neutral	the car that we upgraded to was not available for hire on the web_site however it was displayed , the guy at the hire_desk in san_francisco commented that this is a common_occurrence and catches people out , therefore $_000 dollars later we got our car .
neutral	as there was 0 people and baggage we really had no choice , but the car at we originally chose stated that this would be the correct_size for our party .
neutral	all cars should be available to hire on the web_site as we would not have to stand such large additional_charges when collecting from pick_up points
neutral	the website was easy to navigate .
neutral	my order was delivered quickly and in perfect_condition .
neutral	however , the product itself does not work very well .
neutral	they are advertised as allowing the toddler to feel they have done a wee but without the mess .
neutral	when our daughter does a wee in these it pours out like regular knickers !
neutral	luckily she seems to be getting the hang of potty training but we have found this product useless .
neutral	placed an order for 0 pairs of shoes .
neutral	0 pairs fine - good fit .
neutral	0 pair way too big and very annoyed to discover that the cost of return for refund is down to the customer .
neutral	makes me think_twice about where to place my next purchase .
neutral	technician unable to locate wheel_locking_nut .
neutral	offerered to get them off for £_00 and then i would have had to have them replaced !!!
neutral	had to return home to check .
neutral	found in a couple of minutes to be on left hand_side in marked compartment in boot .
neutral	a one minute phone_call would have established location rather_than a four hour experience for me !!!
neutral	!
neutral	got what i wanted second time round .
neutral	i have used wheelspin_models a lot in the past and they are normally very good but i have not received my last order .
neutral	the idea is grate i managed to get the job_done but .. shiply taking £_00 before paying for a delivery service that '_s the cost of a 00kg parcel under common services ups parcel_force etc .. makes shiply only useful for large expensive delivery '_s beyond 00kg otherwise you '_ll be paying double if your items 00kg or less .
neutral	i used this service to shift a 000kg item so i was happy to pay for this sort : d
neutral	i ordered a flat - pack sideboard online and xdp were the courier .
neutral	good points are that they delivered it on the chosen day , were friendly enough and called ahead .
neutral	bad points are that my flat is on the second floor but they would only deliver it to the first floor , leaving me to carry a 00kg package by myself .
neutral	the seller is at fault for choosing a courier that won_'_t deliver above the first floor , but i would '_ve thought they ' d take it up one more flight of stairs .
neutral	great service .
neutral	the tent wad a quality branded product at the lowest_prices i could_find on the web but i was a bit disappointed by the very poor dpd delivery who couldn_'_t find our house .
neutral	all went well with the setting_up of the sale , good notification of when the tickets had been sold .
neutral	however , the payment was not made within the stated 00 days , hence only 0_star_rating .
neutral	( i am still_waiting for my payment .
neutral	i have been in contact with seatwave and expect a positive_outcome soon .)
neutral	i found cyberpower quite helpful , but if they would have asked me what i wanted the computer for , who it was for , how i wanted it to look as well as perform i would have changed what i ordered and been much happier with my sons new computer .
neutral	i also felt that they didnt take critisism too kindly , i . e ., when i was unhappy with the care taken with the packing .
neutral	however all seems well now that it is up and running , even if i did have to fit some extras myself !
neutral	!.
neutral	first time i '_ve_used this company - it was the cheapest on the web for husked sunflower seed i was after .
neutral	delivery was exceptionally quick .
neutral	next_day if i recall_correctly .
neutral	quality was mixed - i order 0 separate bags of the largest_size .
neutral	the first was very dusty ( more than i would normally expect ) but the sunflower_seeds it contained were fine and , ultimately healthy and usable .
neutral	the second was the same quality as i would expect from any other bird_food supplier - that is with little dust and healthy sunflower_seeds .
neutral	not sure if the dusty one was just that - a one off - but would consider_using again to test .
neutral	the website was great , the booking process easy .
neutral	the flights were substantially_cheaper_than booking directly with the airline operator ( strangely ).
neutral	not too impressed that the booking_fee was a substantial 00_% of the original fare .
neutral	could not fault speed of delivery but item was damaged .
neutral	suggest bubble_wrap is used in future
neutral	i have selected a product with a " low stock " status , added it to the basket and paid for it .
neutral	after this the stock status changed to " out of stock ".
neutral	i thought i was lucky and got the last one .
neutral	how wrong was i ...;( the next business day i was contacted by taschen paradies and advised the product is out of stock .
neutral	they failed to explain_why it was " low stock " before placing my order and only changed to " out of stock " after the payment .
neutral	either their stock_levels are out of date or the booking system is rubbish , as if i place the last available piece into my basket and pay for it i should have it .
neutral	they have offered me other colours and in the end i have agreed with a different_colour as cancelling the order wasn_'_t a solution from my point of view .
neutral	the suitcase was delivered from germany to uk within 0 business days and it was trackable throught its journey .
neutral	overall i would recommend this company but should your desired product / colour be " low stock " you better check with them if it '_s actually in stock .
neutral	i contacted mr_memory to seek advise on upgrading my ram from 0gb to 0gb .
neutral	the assistant came back very quickly and pointed me to their web_site to the correct product for my laptop .
neutral	however it was only after purchasing that i discovered windows 0 00bit systems can only utilise a maximum of 0gb .
neutral	whilst this is not their error the assistant could '_ve ask this question to establish if the purchase would be of use .
neutral	anyway , fast delivery , good price , good communication , etc .
neutral	so cant really fault on their service just disappointed i cannot gain benefit from my purchase .
neutral	0_star for my recent_purchase of my guitar bag , got help on the phone about what one to get and came on time , very happy .
neutral	although when i ordered my guitar i was promised next_day delivery because i had spent so much , that was a lie .
neutral	then when my guitar was meant to come all the accessories came but no one told me i would have to wait another day for my guitar and when i called i felt the person was clueless to where and when my guitar was actually coming .
neutral	the delivery time was very very slow with no communication so i didnt know if my order was on its way or not and when i tryed and tryed and tryed and tryed to call them the phone clicked me off every time so i didnt know if the company was still in business or had been shut_down .
neutral	cheap to buy from but to stressful wont recommend or use again .
neutral	fit ok but plastic on driver side is slippery when wet , not good .
neutral	i would recomened tho .
neutral	all good but one the smoke_detectors does not work so have asked for a replacement .
neutral	ordered a front_wheel hub for the skoda , the staff i spoke to where very professional and soon sorted what i required at a agreeable cost .
neutral	delivery time was said to be on the thursday of that week which would have been great fix the car weekend , wrong part did not arrive_till monday_afternoon also it was not complete what i had ordered .
neutral	back on the phone again , they questioned my order till they found the invoice and had to send the rest of the parts out , they came the next_day .
neutral	just like 00_% of places that you order form who gives a fxxk any more ,
neutral	i went online to purchase 0 tyres for my daughters car
neutral	prices were good , details for payment appeared simple ,
neutral	on one side of the form all the details relating to the driver and her car ,
neutral	on the other side of the form payment details ( card_holder , me )
neutral	made payment , simple yes !, no !
neutral	once paid the invoice pops_up , which requires you to print it off ,
neutral	as i made this payment on the internet using my laptop , guess_what no printer attached ,!
neutral	the same would apply if you accessed the site with your tablet or smartphone !)
neutral	cant save to file as it wont let_me select that option either !.
neutral	to top it all it says on the invoice that the card that made the payment needs to be presented when she attends to get the tyres_fitted !
neutral	so this means that i will have to go with her ,( the reason i decided on an online payment was so she could go herself )
neutral	so why did i bother to go through all this online then ?
neutral	:-(
neutral	i will now have to contact the branch direct tomorrow to see if this is the case !
neutral	disappointed with this as it has now caused me the stress i was hoping to avoid
neutral	perhaps i should have just drove into kwik_fit !
neutral	now i have finished this report at their request i cant post it without accepting " trustpilot & partners using cookies for stats , social_media and marketing , meaning i will prob now be bombarded with unsolicitated mail and spam !
neutral	item was delivered to next door_neighbour .
neutral	no note through the door or anything to state this was the case .
neutral	coat itself is excellent , brilliant quality and no_complaints there .
neutral	i paid an extra £ 0 for next_day delivery to n_ireland & was very disappointed when my new bluetooth sony sbh00 head set didn_'_t arrive for two_days !
neutral	to be fair to handtec , when i contacted them they informed me that the order was placed after 0pm cut_off point for next_day delivery .
neutral	if i ' d have been better informed when i choose £ 0 next_day delivery that i wouldn_'_t actually receive it for two_days , i ' d obviously not have chosen to waste £ 0 & just simply waited on normal delivery .
neutral	not a good use of hard_earned_money these days !
neutral	stephen morrison
neutral	n_ireland .
neutral	the flowers as usual with serenata were both beautiful and fresh .
neutral	however upon_receiving a notification of the delivery of the flowers i waited expectantly for a delighted response from the recipient .
neutral	after no response was given i rang the recipient , hence ruining the surprise and finding out that the flowers had been delivered by the shed in the garden .
neutral	it is a shame that the quality of the flowers was diminished by the poor delivery and as a result rocked my faith in the serenata service which until now had been my chosen company for flower delivery .
neutral	once ordered the service was pretty quick .
neutral	answering initial enquireis from customer was on the slow side though .
neutral	meets most genaral needs but recently seems to have replaced some real favourites - of ours - with own_brand imitations : disappointing really .
neutral	first time we have used cabrera_medina .
neutral	booked 00 months in advance , car collection could not be better very slick with very pleasant and efficient staff plus very easy process to drop car back off . but our fiat_000 was marked or dented on nearly every panel plus bits of trim missing here and there , it had over 00000 km on the clock and was looking tired , also no cd or map in car as advertised , it went ok but every other person we saw on the island seemed to have a nice clean and shiny car to drive .
neutral	this was not what we expected from the smartest and best hire company on the island
neutral	i have had both good and bad experiances with interparcel .
neutral	on occassions the parcel has not been picked_up from us , and when phoned the staff have not been very helpfull .
neutral	there is no loyalty with interparcel , so i sometimes switch to another parcel service .
neutral	i do object to the high cost phone lines , this puts me off using them sometimes as other_companies offer 0000 numbers ( free phone_calls ).
neutral	the parcel rates seem to be in line with other_companies .
neutral	as do their parcel insuance rates .
neutral	much_cheaper to have your own goods in transit insurance .
neutral	ordered tyres this morning for fitting at my local centre tomorrow .
neutral	just had a call to say no stock and none in country , also no idea when it will be available .
neutral	why offer tyres for sale when you know they are not available .
neutral	poor !
neutral	on the whole it was ok .
neutral	i bought a brake bleeding aid as i have no friends which i knew would be a tube and bucket but this draper model claimed a ' valve ' so i didn_'_t need to worry .
neutral	this turned_out to be a rusty screw and a cut in the tube .
neutral	i knew i was going to be over paying for this tax on the ignorant but that was a bit much .
neutral	i will look_elsewhere in the future .
neutral	i '_m struggling to form a consistent opinion about made .
neutral	one one hand , some of their furniture ( table , lockers , couch ) is excellent .
neutral	minimal_assembly and good quality products .
neutral	customer service which was responsive and pro - active .
neutral	four_stars .
neutral	on the other hand , some of their furniture is really of questionable quality ( particularly their fjord dining_chairs ) and in some cases doesn_'_t flag clearly just how much self - assembly is required ( probably wouldn_'_t have bought them had i been aware of that point ).
neutral	when something did go missing ( a couch , one item from an order of about ten ), customer service bizarrely got sloppy and indifferent ( took me multiple calls and emails to get a response ).
neutral	two stars .
neutral	would i order again ?
neutral	i '_m honestly not sure .
neutral	i ' d consider it but it '_s not an automatic ' yes '.
neutral	all as expected will no doute use you again
neutral	i wished to purchase 0 cartons of isogel but you ' quantity limiter ' would not let_me , so i reduced the qty to 0 .
neutral	i understand_why it is there but when it is applied to a harmless product like isogel , it is very irritating .
neutral	sincerely , trevor coombs
neutral	super easy to order on line - and arrived very quickly .
neutral	the guy_who dropped it off practically threw it at me and then i had to carry it myself 000yrds to the house .
neutral	he was there for no more than 00 seconds - a bit rushed i felt !
neutral	!
neutral	once in the house and all packaging was removed after a few_days , and then my son noticed a pencil sized stab hole - oh_dear .
neutral	not done by me , but ...
neutral	... i guess i can '_t return it now .
neutral	the upside ao . com are cheaper_than most retailers and deliver on time .
neutral	the hotpoint dryer is great .
neutral	downside the guy whom rang me and confirmed delivery also sold me the extended_warranty which i didn_'_t want and has since cancelled . i hate being sold anything on line and i wish ao . com would just send a polite letter asking if we wish too extend the warranty .
neutral	my other opinion is why would i need an extended_warranty when i have bought a so say good product ?
neutral	there was nothing wrong with the service or the flowers i ordered .
neutral	i got a text at 00 :_00am saying " your flowers have left the building ."
neutral	cute .
neutral	nice_touch .
neutral	thank_you very much .
neutral	they arrived at around 0pm .
neutral	by that point i was starting to think they hadn_'_t just left the building but they ' d gone to las_vegas to take up residency at caesar '_s palace ( like elvis in 0000 , in case i '_ve lost you ).
neutral	they were delivered by yodel , and came in a box .
neutral	i don_'_t like flowers being delivered in boxes .
neutral	it '_s not right - they should be delivered by a florist ( not a courier ) and should be open to the light and the air .
neutral	all - in - all , not much to complain_about .
neutral	but i won_'_t be buying again .
neutral	i have only used the site twice but my current third order i have been waiting almost a week for a ' guaranteed 0 - 0 day delivery ' which i paid for ?
neutral	i have emailed to question the whereabouts of my order with no reply as of yet .
neutral	i am hoping this is a one off .
neutral	cewe on the whole are good quality with fast turnaround .
neutral	packaging of there books is terrible - had many damaged .
neutral	customer_support very poor .
neutral	first purchase price excellent so i ordered - not in stock , don t know when came the reply , but website said otherwise and item subsequently became_available and was dispatched so maybe a 0 / 00 .
neutral	second order wrong item dispatched and product id blacked out on item sent but to their credit refunded cost of item when contacted and was told to keep it , so again 0 / 00 a shame the websites promise is let_down by poor stock updates and incorrect picking from stock .
neutral	holiday_autos remains a good compelling way to go about car_hire .
neutral	we '_ve tried other car_hire_firms and have been disappointed .
neutral	however holidat autos are not as hot as they used to be .
neutral	foe example the ' clever dick ' ' marketing push of damage_waiver_insurance is a real turn off in my opinion .
neutral	please get_rid of the prompt boxes that keep_coming up during and after the on - line booking .
neutral	it '_s naff .
neutral	our latest malaga hire from budget / avis was probably the highest mileage vehicle we '_ve had with lots of bumps , dents , paint scratches etc .
neutral	with an excess of 0000 euros hanging over us , it meant going around the vehicle noting all the things missing from an all ready long list of faults .
neutral	not good from a car pick - up fun perspective .
neutral	come on holiday_autos , we expect better ' customer championing ' from you .
neutral	i bought 0 low_voltage lightbulbs (£_00 something pounds ) because of the 00_%_off promotion emailed to me as a previous customer , but paid the full_amount .
neutral	a bit_miffed , so i '_ll probably buy in a local_supermarket next time .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	only two of the four tyres i ordered have arrived at the garage and they fitted those to my car .
neutral	the others have so_far not appeared .
neutral	i will then need to visit the garage again
neutral	just to note : black_circles always deliver the tyres together .
neutral	some times there is quite a gap from order to getting the products , some of the products seem of poor quality , mainly the packing , some are virtually_impossible to open without causing pain .
neutral	also important information i receive from my doctors about problems with some tablets , when i have rung pharmacy to u they were not aware .
neutral	the reason i purchased this item was because it was a bit different from what everyone_else were selling .
neutral	i liked the idea that a single_rose would be presented in a nice red gift box , however when delivered it didn_'_t arrive in the gift box that had originally caught my eye .
neutral	i understand that it says on your website terms that a substitute would be provided , but as a customer you expect to get what you pay for and therefore would have been better if you had advised me that the item was different to what i expected to be sent so that i could have cancelled my order .
neutral	in all i '_m rather disappointed , but the person i sent it to was still pleased , so i guess thats all that matters .
neutral	i think the payout was quick and discreet .
neutral	been meaning to get in touch as i was distraught at having to wait so long for my supplements due to the incompetence of your delivery service .
neutral	i believe that i should be compensated for this poor experience as ultimately you have chosen to use them .
neutral	apart_from that , ordering on the site was perfect .
neutral	after the product failed to arrive i contacted the company twice to be informed the courier had lost it and another one would be dispatched .
neutral	it arrived 0 days_later but the package_containing the screws was missing .
neutral	i contacted the company again and was told another pack would be sent , which it was .
neutral	not once did the company contact me and it was always me chasing the order .
neutral	even after the hasslei have given the company one week and nobody has contacted me to explain or even apologise .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	it transpires it was the manufacturing company , grange , who let the side down and not internet_gardener who were completely_unaware of the situation .
neutral	internet_gardener contacted me immediately to apologise and therefore will use them again .
neutral	we shop at tescos regularly but also sainsburys , waitrose and m & s .
neutral	tescos are good but their pricing strategy leaves something to be desired because of short_term variability , although their coupons are attractive , unlike sainsburys , whose coupons supplied at the checkout are unwelcome because most of the stuff sponsored is unwanted .
neutral	so , tescos together with sainsburys are worthy of three and a half stars for range of items sold .
neutral	best quality of products and service is undoubtedly to be found at m & s and waitrose .
neutral	despite a disapointing flash banner on their website suggesting ' free delivery ' - this comes with some caveats that were not mentioned by the sales staff even after having a conversation about needing the kit quickly and then after the delivery date had passed , discovering that it had not ben sent yet due to being ' upgraded ' to free delivery - the kit is good quality and after a small rant on the phone they shipped it next_day for no charge .
neutral	good tickets but at double the actual price .
neutral	arrived in good time and as advertised .
neutral	great show , just a shame that the people sat next to me paid half the price i did !
neutral	i wanted a quality product so i decided to spend a bit more on a door catch .
neutral	the product turned_up on time and was well_packaged .
neutral	the catch itself had some small scratches on but they were on the underside so i wasn_'_t too concerned .
neutral	then i tried_unsuccessfully to turn the knob but the mechanism was rusty and didn_'_t work .
neutral	i soaked it in wd00 and after a while , it worked satisfactorily .
neutral	i then fitted the catch but the screws provided were not good quality and one of them sheared .
neutral	anyway , the catch is now installed and is fine but for the price paid , i don_'_t feel that the quality was up to the standard i wwas expecting .
neutral	ordered a canvas_print for a customer , the print quality was excellent as always with jessops but there were marks on the canvas on arrival on the black areas which sadly spoilt the moment , needless to say i still have it .
neutral	i bought an audi_a0 window winder for my daughter '_s a0 which arrived at my home the next_day - perfect but not essential .
neutral	i then ordered an a0 headlight for my other daughter to be delivered the next_day at her home 000_miles_away so it would be there for me to fit a couple of days_later .
neutral	when i arrived - no headlight !!
neutral	rang the helpline ( no order number as i didn_'_t take it ) and they found the order " oh_dear it doesn_'_t seem to have been processed " even_though i had a e_- mail_confirming the order but , and this is the important bit , no e_- mail saying it had been shipped .
neutral	it was rushed out for the next monday - the day i was leaving so i had a real rush fitting it .
neutral	it was the wrong light for that particular a0 ( 0 . 0 quattro ) as it only had the single bulb unit - but the new glass fitted the old unit and that was all i wanted so by the end i was sorted !
neutral	!
neutral	have ordered a couple of items on this site .
neutral	on boyh occasions the delivery was very slow however i did oreder with the standard delivery
neutral	boarding and administration and the like went very well .
neutral	all good manners and smiles .
neutral	finding my cabin and navigating around the ship was easy - peasy with staff on - hand to assist those who could get lost in a cupboard .
neutral	the rooms are small as would be expected but the upper bunk is too close to the ceiling and hopeless for me at 0ft .
neutral	long enough but no headroom .
neutral	a bit stuffy but overall not too bad and i slept through both out and back .
neutral	bars and entertainment were pretty good although i didn_'_t really indulge much .
neutral	everyone seemed to be having a nice time and the bands , although not to my taste at all , were free after all and quite entertaining .
neutral	food .
neutral	i didn_'_t try the ' restaurants ' as the prices were eye - watering .
neutral	i had fish and chips at the ' cafe ' and it was probably the worst f &_c '_s i have ever had .
neutral	the fish was re - constituted fillet with batter like lead .
neutral	the fat had joined the two into an amorphous tasteless mass that sat in my stomach until i arrived in ghent .
neutral	at 00euro it could and should have been so much_better .
neutral	breakfast was fundamental .
neutral	i had the continental as i wasn_'_t going to risk , nor afford the cooked breakfast .
neutral	coffee and tea were fine and staff reasonably efficient although sometimes the queue was daunting .
neutral	all nice people serving though which is always nice .
neutral	overall nothing remarkable , but on the way back i purchased my own food ( salad and the like ) as i wasn_'_t even going to consider a cooked meal .
neutral	generally 0 / 00 .
neutral	food 0 / 00 .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	after_reading some negative_reports i tried to cancel my order via_paypal .
neutral	i was too late and it had been completed
neutral	my suspicions were confirmed when i didnt get a confirmation_email after i had purchased through paypal which is normal .
neutral	i didnt get a reply form my email enquiring_about the lack of confirmation_email .
neutral	but ..... it turned_up !!
neutral	on time 00hrs and as_described .
neutral	the relief .
neutral	my fears were_unfounded .
neutral	recommendations to company : please send the purchaser a confirmation_email , it would stop any doubt about your company .
neutral	you only get 0_stars .
neutral	if you had better communication it would have been 0_stars .
neutral	regards
neutral	philip , sthfrance
neutral	have bought from this site and found the good '_s suitable for the older members of the family , nice stuff though , postage fast and return '_s are no problem .
neutral	unfortunately despite a great deal and fantastic personal service on delivery , the item was let_down by a badly_damaged front_wheel .
neutral	i had to pay to have it straightened out and then had to work on it to reduce the effect of a dent in the rim .
neutral	probably shouldn_'_t have accepted the wheels but thought i could fix .
neutral	flowers were nice and delivered in time , the only problem is that the greeting_card was missing so they had no idea who had sent them !
neutral	your presentation is over the top and the idea of free_gifts is tacky but your service is fine and the flowers admired .
neutral	i '_m very surprised you should be sending me this since i '_ve already sent you an email .
neutral	how you respond to that will be what counts .
neutral	mike
neutral	ordered my tuxcedo , came next_day good service
neutral	when trying it on the button was sewn on two inches
neutral	higher_than the button hole very disapointed in the quality
neutral	returned it that same day for a refund . decided to buy localy so that i can see the quality .
neutral	i wanted a fender gig_bag and their site showed one identical to one i already have at a great price .
neutral	delivery was quick , however the bag i received was not the one shown in the picture .
neutral	i appreciate product ranges change over time , but this one is definitely inferior with only a small accessories pocket and just one shoulder_strap ( although the description says " straps ").
neutral	you always take a chance with websites , but it is a shame the picture had not been updated .
neutral	the price was excellent value , the car was scratched , dented and battered but drove safely , although i had swapped the first one offered as the brakes were on a hair trigger .
neutral	sadly i did not read the contract , as having thought i heard hand it back full , it clearly said empty and they refused to give me a refund at the counter , effectively doubling the cost of the hire .
neutral	i have written to ask but we will see .
neutral	looks good , nice materials but slightly wrong shape
neutral	i have been with o0 since they were cellnet .
neutral	i recently wanted to downgrade my tarrif as i was paying far too much for for the minutes and texts that i actually use .
neutral	they stated that i could not reduce my taffif until my contract was up .
neutral	they did however say that i could increse my tarrif ...
neutral	they are quite happy to get more money , but won_'_t give any back .
neutral	i think it '_s time for a fresh network come december !
neutral	sound and light indicator does not work despite batteries being supplied ... not sure why ... have checked everything i can .
neutral	the product purchased was fantastic , no issues .
neutral	but would i buy from them again .... no .
neutral	why ?
neutral	because trying to get it delivered involved me having to book a day off as the delivery department has no concept of customer service .
neutral	they give you a date and then txt a time after and if not convenient you have to cancel and retry .
neutral	we tried to ask for a delivery any afternoon after 0 :_00pm and they could not accommodate us , so after 0 cancelled delivery slots i booked the day off .
neutral	this was ridiculous service .
neutral	they give you a date and time for delivery and if you can '_t make it ask if there '_s a neighbour who could take the delivery ?
neutral	or even told us that they could leave our delivery unattended on the driveway for us , personally i think asking for delivery any time on any day after 0 : 00 should not have been a problem .
neutral	selected fitting pm the next_day after ordering and tyres did not arrive .
neutral	assistant at chosen fitting_centre could not tell me when they would arrive except that it would probably ' be tomorrow now '
neutral	asked_him if he could contact their distribution warehouse to confirm delivery but said they were a different company and he could only check on the computer .
neutral	the computer say '_s ' no '!
neutral	not good enough , at the very least you should be able to say where the tyres are and when they will be delivered .
neutral	i found dealing_with your company and the supplying of the tyre '_s great .
neutral	but the fitting company you recommened to fit my tyres were a let_down , their attitude was poor , i felt it was because they were not supplying the tyres also i do not like tyre_fitters who use who use air powered tools to tighten wheel_nuts .
neutral	they stripped the threads on one of my wheel_nuts and did not even have a thread tap to repair it and thats only a few minutes work .
neutral	had to do the job my self .
neutral	so to me the tyre_fitting company in dundee was very poor service .
neutral	so if i do get tyres or recommened a friend i will suggest we find a good tyre_fitter to have tyres delivered to .
neutral	re booked insure and go travel_insurance recently , checked prices on comparison_sites and insure and go website .
neutral	prices apear cheaper on comparison_sites but level of protection advertised does not see to tally up with any schemes i found on the companies own web_site .
neutral	i have insured with them ( claim free ) for many_years_now and dissapointed that there is no form of recognition when you renew with them and no no claims discount_scheme available .
neutral	what we got was very good but not worth the money even at half price .
neutral	the experience with booking the car was great .
neutral	what let this down was the car from argus '_s partner goldcar .
neutral	they did not have the car i ordered so we were ' upgraded '.
neutral	when i say ' upgraded ' take that with a pinch of salt .
neutral	the car a fiat_punto grande had dents in every panel , the windows were filthy , the rear doors opened intermittently using the remote and the windows in the rear would not go up or down .
neutral	i was told that was all they had ..........
neutral	the cost of filling up @ 000_euro is a joke , but i understand that money has to made somewhere .
neutral	the fuel ' lack of economy ' was unbelievable - a full_tank on a small island like lanzarote was used in 0 days that was usually without aircon .
neutral	as said before argus i cannot_fault - but you really need to look at your rental partners .
neutral	flowers were as ordered & delivered on time .
neutral	the greetings_card was worded as requested but i do think serenata could print the text in a larger & more attractive manner
neutral	product ok slow delivery
neutral	i don_'_t expect the best customer service from a website that '_s pushing products like these_folks do , but at times they ' re just flat out disappointing .
neutral	the site '_s tricky to navigate if you don_'_t know what you ' re looking for , so it '_s best to browse somewhere_else and then come here with the exact product you want in mind .
neutral	also , never trust their shipment process to just go through .
neutral	plan on babying the entire ordering_process all the way up until it ships .
neutral	sometimes it feels_like these_folks aren_'_t even interested in making a sale .
neutral	the lenses were neither tightly nor robustly fit into the frame .
neutral	i order from gd 0 years_ago .
neutral	they were perfect .
neutral	this time round , the standard must have fallen from the good old days .
neutral	every time i squeeze the frame , gently , i hear an unpleasant squeak from the frame .
neutral	also the exact_same shaped frame , which looked the same and was made in sweden before , is only same in its shape but not quality ; it seems to be poorer quality chinese copy .
neutral	not too happy but i '_ll deal with it .
neutral	the website itself is very user_friendly and has lots of good options and the price is great .
neutral	however , it '_s difficult to know exactly_what sort of car you '_ll get from the actual renter so hard to book with certainty .
neutral	i tried to get an astra because of good boot_space , but the fiat_000 i was offered didn_'_t cut it so i had to upgrade .
neutral	i also needed to extend my booking due to a medical emergency , so i called the renter direct .
neutral	this meant i was without insurance_excess_waiver , so i raised a ticket on your website asking how to extend the policy term .
neutral	sadly i never_heard back , which means i am exposed to greater risk .
neutral	good price but would visit one of your other branches next time
neutral	after booking , received several calls regarding additional_insurance including scare_stories_about driving in italy and the personal costs to me if involved in an accident .
neutral	despite eventually giving in to the pressure and paying an additional £_00 for what i thought was adequate cover , i had to provide a card upon_arrival against which they froze £ 0000 which they would have used in the event of an accident on thr basis that i could claim back any monies taken from the £_00 policy minus fees and expenses , etc .
neutral	in the event no accidents so no issues , but the whole push to sell insurance did leave a bad_taste in my mouth .
neutral	hi , car ok car a bigger one than paid for so well pleased .
neutral	as mobility impaired would have preferred an airport pick_up .
neutral	i should have read the details , my fault did not even think it would entail a mini_bus_ride for 0 km to a rental site off airport .
neutral	was pitch black and had to collect car scratches and all in the dark .
neutral	operator went round car for 0 minute with a mobile_phone torch which really was not the best way to collect a car .
neutral	knowing that when we took the car back any marks could have been said as down to us as there was no way that we would have known as it was so dark !
neutral	anyway all ok on departure but did not really like that .
neutral	i know that this is a common way of doing things and came up again with this ' in the dark ' collection ' in geneva as ell .
neutral	very open to possible arguments re scratches damage etc .
neutral	apart_from that cheap nice car very good value .
neutral	but would have and will do next time collect on airport and in daylight or a lighted area .
neutral	ja
neutral	just what you need if your on a budget but check the items .
neutral	mine had a tear down the seam which needed stitching .
neutral	ordered a 0 door car ... but was given a 0 door which was a bit_tight with all the luggage ..
neutral	wanted to get going , so did not ask for a change ... car was new and clean .
neutral	the glasses were delivered very quickly however there are two slight_scratches on the frame .
neutral	they are not a big deal however i would of expected them to be in pristine_condition
neutral	in_spite of vat free condition offered , and further mention that the credit would show at the end of the transaction , it did not .
neutral	i declared myself an amputee and i have a dis_- baled driver card .
neutral	i consider myself duped !
neutral	colin g mead .
neutral	i bought branded glassware so the quality was already known .
neutral	wineware delivered promptly and safely .
neutral	everything was fine .
neutral	nothing to report !
neutral	flowers were just left on the doorstep for anyone to take
neutral	some products are worth purchasing trough this website such as the specials they be having .
neutral	however the price of all the products are cheap but when you get to the final price which includes shipping / handling it adds up to the same / around price the you would most_likely pay at gnc .
neutral	they turned_up to install a yale system which turned_out to be inappropiate to fit and their advice was to add more which would cost me another £_000 approx .
neutral	great but do you have any advice that would cost me nothing more .
neutral	in the end we upgraded the system to a visonic which cost us another £_000 and seemed a lot better_than the cheaper looking yale system .
neutral	everything was rushed and they seemed as though they couldn_'_t wait to get out .
neutral	the advice was as minimal as possible and when i asked a question it was yes / no as if i should know what to do .
neutral	needless to say when they departed there was an issue and due to there haste they forgot to put a splitter in the phone connection to enable me to use the internet .
neutral	simple but if you don_'_t know then it causes lots of problems because i got on to my provider and ran all_sorts of checks and all come out ok .
neutral	i traced it back to the fitters .
neutral	lots of wasted time later i called the fitter up who when questioned_why he missed something so obvious , appologised and said he was late and needed to get to the next appointment .
neutral	very quick in taking my money for extras which are expensive from them but not a problem wasting my time .
neutral	0_weeks_later i haven_'_t heard a word from them and no call to check if all is ok .
neutral	spent £_00 on flower & gift package .
neutral	order was delivered on arranged day , but was unfortunately left by a secluded door , with no note of the delivery through the main door of the address .
neutral	the gift was not received by the recipient until 0 days_later , after i ' d phoned to check she had received it .
neutral	the flowers were fortunately still in good condition .
neutral	phone_calls were dealt_with well , and sender agreed to replenish order if flowers not in good condition after 0 days .
neutral	sender also discussed issue with the delivery firm .
neutral	0_stars to imogenstone .
neutral	the purchase went_smoothly but i didn_'_t receive the tracking_number when the item was shipped and when it arrived to my city , dhl didn_'_t inform_me of its arrival , after 00 days of its arrival at dhl i contacted scuba_store about why they didn_'_t send me the tracking_number so when they did give it to me i tracked it and found that it arrived at dhl 00 days earlier so please fix this issue with tracking_numbers delay and with dhl not informing the customer of his package arrival .
neutral	i ordered a black phone case and received a brown one , wrong_colour but the case is good .
neutral	very quick dispatch .
neutral	when i set_up my broadband account at my new address 00 months_ago , i told bt that i would use my old netgear_router so there was no for them to send one to me .
neutral	having experienced some difficulties a few_months later i contacted bt and they said they would send me a new router .
neutral	it never arrived , and after perseverance i got my netgear_router working and didn_'_t pursue the matter again for some months when the same problem with my old router occured .
neutral	on contacting bt they said they would send me one .
neutral	this time it arrived and within two_days !
neutral	setting it up using the cd and booklet provided proved a problem as the cd '_s instruction was asking to use the lan cable to connect to some other device portrayed in the booklet , which i did not have .
neutral	fortunately , a friend who i mentioned this to , came around and set the router up wirelessly without recourse to the cd .
neutral	had this been better explained in the booklet , i might have been able to do this myself .
neutral	i have used viovet for some time and had assumed i could trust their pricing without checking .
neutral	however a small item ( dog training treats ) on my last order proved to have been charged with a fifty percent hick (£ 0 . 00 instead of package printed £ 0 price ) on the printed price on the package .
neutral	when i complained it was dealt_with straight_away - but left me thinking i should check prices in future .
neutral	its a shame my trust is on hold at the moment .
neutral	poor service with regards to emails_advising of dispatch etc - having to guess when my parcel will arrive should it have even been dispatched
neutral	no issues with customer communications and delivery but incredibly disappointed at the volume of flowers included in the package , given the price .
neutral	good product , decent website .
neutral	returns expensive which is an irritant .
neutral	not easy to go back to product list when you ' re reviewing a product in detail / adding to cart
neutral	your chemical stickers seem to be all over the records and products you sell , i guess its cheap promotion but its extremely annoying if you want nice clean artwork on your vinyls .
neutral	many of my friends have the same opinions
neutral	you can go to the site and find lots f ideas for water saving - awesome !
neutral	a lot of products are out of stock , and they announce it to you after you ve set the order
neutral	emma made this happen for me in terms of getting the item delivered - she gets 0_stars .
neutral	prices are great - definitely 0_stars .
neutral	huge problems getting in contact with the company and 00 day delivery time caused me a lot of worry - i honestly thought i ' d been_scammed .
neutral	the goods delivered were perfect and exactly as ordered .
neutral	if they had said on their web_site that delivery would take 00 - 00 days then i would still have ordered from them and would have been happy to give them 0_stars .
neutral	idea for moving money but beware of disputes as they empty your account before asking you
neutral	we choose workwear_express for their professional looking website & extensive choice of garments .
neutral	although the staff were always polite and friendly we were over charged on our order , & it took several weeks and several phone_calls before we were reimbursed the amount .
neutral	we also did not recieve proofs of our art_work until chased for over a week after order had been placed , and never received the swatch of the stitching .
neutral	however the final product received is great so all '_s well that ends well
neutral	even when i had mentioned that a certain time limit to deliver was important due to our travel schedule ... the item was very late .
neutral	nobody replied on the request as well .
neutral	a product was not in stock .
neutral	they have sent the money back to us straight_away .
neutral	good service but ..
neutral	i rather had seen in while ordering .
neutral	i ordered 00 prints 0x0 " and a further 00 prints at 0x0 " two_days_later .
neutral	this was my first experience of this site and i used it as it was accessible direct from photoshop elements .
neutral	the choice of print size appears to be restricted to the two sizes mentioned , and there are no facilities which i could_find for cropping , printing some id on the back of prints etc ..
neutral	there is no choice of type of paper ( e . g .
neutral	glossy or satin ).
neutral	surprisingly , having uploaded all 00 to the 0x0 boxes ( the only option ), i then had to change each one separately to 0x0 , as i could_find no way to select more than one at a time to change them .
neutral	i only kept going because i had already spent a lot of time on it .
neutral	the prints arrived and are of very good quality .
neutral	a few which did not conform exactly to the size specified were printed on slightly_larger paper which is not a bad idea .
neutral	unfortunately , they arrived in completely random order , making it necessary to spend a lot of time going through more than 000 computer images to get them back into date / time order - important for a holiday record for example .
neutral	i then visited the site and found loads of vouchers which i could have used - it may explain_why this site is more_expensive than some others .
neutral	i also noted that prints are definitely not given any prominence on their site , which begs the question of why they are the only printer accessible direct from pe00 ?
neutral	it may be that they do not realise that a lot of keen amateur photographers use elements , or else there is more profit in their other products .
neutral	either way , i cannot see myself using them for prints again , which is a pity as the print quality is high .
neutral	third year with multitrip .
neutral	prices not increased too much .
neutral	renew automatically online but they give plenty of warning as renewal approaches with advice on how to cancel auto_renewal .
neutral	phoned re query - good response .
neutral	however have tried_phoning their medical_screening ( 0000 number ) held on for 0 mins then they offer ringback ' without losing place in queue '.
neutral	they phoned back 0 hours_later by which time i had given up and gone out .
neutral	other times there has just been no ring back .
neutral	very frustrating and if the medical_screening results in a high cost the opportunity to cancel the policy ( in 0_weeks ) is fast running out .
neutral	had my first argos experience today in northfield birmingham , i was greeted_by a large group of potential_customers being turned away from the store !
neutral	on closer investigation the reason for this outrage was conveyed to us by rodger , rodger is the deputy_manager i know this because pinned to rodgers chest was a big shiny badge confirming his status within the argos organisation .
neutral	roger was informing the congregation that under no circumstances was he allowing anyone into the store because of a system failure , rodger told us that the problem will take 00_minutes before the issue is resolved and that we should come_back then ……
neutral	one lady asked could she enter the store to browse through the cetology as she was not sure what present she wanted to purchase , rodger the deputy store manager said no , even_though the store contained a number of customers doing just that !
neutral	i asked rodger the sales prevention office , sorry the deputy_manager with the big shiny badge if he could confirm that the item i was looking for was in store he said he was unable to because the system was down ,
neutral	i asked rodger with the big shiny badge for the number for customer_services , rodger asked why !
neutral	i informed rodger that if he was unable to assist me then customer_services would , ( at that moment i noticed that the shiny badge was beginning to lose some its shine )
neutral	the customer service department were able to confirm that the item was out of stock but i could order it i must_say they were very polite and helpful .
neutral	my name is john i have my own business and i have a retail shop , shiny badges mean nowt .
neutral	how you treat people is the key .
neutral	i wonder were the manager was , and worse still when a potential customer leaves your store will they come_back .
neutral	and finally ….
neutral	are today ’_s deputy managers , tomorrow ’_s managers ?
neutral	delivery quick , packaging fine - descriptions , however , leave a lot to be desired !
neutral	how you get 0g of something into a 0 . 0g serving is quite beyond me - but that is what the label said !
neutral	and how you can call something ' pure ....' when '....' is only 00_% of the total volume is again , quite beyond me .
neutral	so , for those reasons - which is either a lack of attention to detail or an intention to mislead - leads me to think that it would be quite dangerous to put my faith in their products when - as an athlete - you need to be sure exactly_what you are ingesting .
neutral	i will not be back and i would not recommend on that basis .
neutral	it was great until they sold shares - now there are too many problems , i can '_t see my wall , haven_'_t for a few_days now , i know others too with same problem .
neutral	it is a great way to stay in touch , i just wish they would leave it how it was before !
neutral	!
neutral	yes the prices at 0game are sometimes extremely competitive however i have received none uk release games which are then not able to be traded in .
neutral	so if your ordering a game that you may eventually trade in then just realise that some places will not take non uk titles .
neutral	the game will still work on your console and have english instructions etc
neutral	just as my review says becareful
neutral	i found optimalprint quite convenient in designing my daughter '_s wedding order of service booklets .
neutral	however the number of fonts and design choices available was quite limited .
neutral	the speed and delivery of my order was very good , and quality was fairly high .
neutral	the design facility was quite basic but in my case turned_out to be adequate .
neutral	the discount i received made it reasonable value for money although without discount it would in my view would be a bit expensive as all i would be paying for is the card and printing .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	ordered a photo mug for a colleague and it arrived with a couple of small scratches on it and there was not enough time to reorder or get a replacement in time .
neutral	i have had a number of items in the past with no_problems - i would have tried to sort something out with jessops if i had more time - a thing to remember in future .
neutral	the item was well_packed with no marks on the box , so possibly just a small_glitch in the run up to christmas , will use jessops again though as this is the first issue i '_ve had .
neutral	waterproof but uses batteries too quickly in auto mode
neutral	ordered prescription_sunglasses , but they arrived as " clear ", so no tint sunglasses .
neutral	i am not sure what kind of quality control they have undergo before they get dispatched .
neutral	to be honest i was at_least expecting a hard case for the sunglasses as compensation , but unfortunately nothing but the sunglasses arrived in the post .
neutral	i had to wait over 0_weeks for delivery and sending out sunglasses with no tint at all tells_me that there is not too much or very little of a quality control .
neutral	having had some jasmine tea in china town , london with a group of friends , i thought that i ` d try and relive the experience at home but so_far , sadly it hasn ` t quite lived_up to my expectations .
neutral	the ` london ` tea was brewed in a pot and being surrounded with the usual female banter , i loved it but at home i tried just a single temple in a mug with an audience of hubby and the kids so my next step is to try the ` pot ` idea and see if that makes things better .
neutral	i did find that the bare mug of tea tasted a bit too flowery and slightly acidic for my liking although after a little sugar , it was much more palatable .
neutral	cuppaco as a company was very efficient and easy to deal with and although the single pack of temples came in an extraordinarily over - sized box , it was undamaged and arrived promptly .
neutral	i haven_'_t seen my trainers yet as i phoned up a minute after having placed the order and explained that my billing_address was my old address ( my ex girlfriend '_s house ).
neutral	as the site automatically makes the delivery address and the billing_address the same , i had to put my old address as the order would only process the billing_address .
neutral	i was told that i should email to request that the delivery address be changed .
neutral	which i did .
neutral	then you still sent them to my ex girlfriend '_s flat .
neutral	i haven_'_t seen the shoes yet .
neutral	i will eventually but it '_s a bit poor and a hassle i could do without .
neutral	please check emails in future .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	broadband_speed rating found talk_talk slower_than virgin_media but much much_cheaper and easier to understand billing process having been with virgin for a number of years desided to swap as virgin was getting very expensive to use .
neutral	cost of phone_calls line rental etc .
neutral	talk_talk much_cheaper . and better customer service too .
neutral	too many hidden_charges in virgin usage not told until i told them i was switching then tried to offfer a deal , but could , nt match the savings that talk_talk allowed_us to make .
neutral	the furniture arrived promptly with some minimal damage , not caused_by delivery men , and shelf_supports missing .
neutral	after sales service stated they would send shelf_supports and i received 00 supports for 0 shelves , had to contact them again for another one !
neutral	which they sent a few_days lateall this over a weekend meaning unable to put up shelves for 0 days !
neutral	the damage was slight and they ststed they would crdit my account with £_00 . 00 which was geatly received and they said they would send a £_00 polish kit to polish the indent / scratch - i received a repair kit : now looking for a craftmans !
neutral	be warned !!!!
neutral	they continually state ' you read the condition of sale ....'
neutral	extremely dissapointing service but th efurniture itself is of very good quality
neutral	putting_together my photobook was fun and easy .
neutral	it was for a work project , not personal .
neutral	the problem came when it came to ordering it .
neutral	the software would just not recognise my work postcode and there was no way to continue ordering .
neutral	several calls were put in to the customer_services team , who assured me they would look into it .
neutral	one of them wasn_'_t aware of the problem and seemed baffled , saying they would get the software developer to look into it .
neutral	somebody_else already was aware of the problem which made me think why they hadn_'_t fixed it before !
neutral	in the end , i was forced to order it to my home address but customer_services never made any further attempt to contact me .
neutral	as the system is automated , there was no way they could prioritise my order from the normal 0 - 0 working_days , even if the fact i couldn_'_t place the order was jessops ' fault .
neutral	i would use the service again but next time , i hope they have fixed the problem with their software .
neutral	when i go on a ferry for two hours journey after driving for long time i just want one thing : to be able to sit_down comfortably .
neutral	it looks_like this is not the priority of dfds , but trying to squeeze more money out of the passenger pockets in terms of coffee , gambling , or shopping areas .
neutral	that would be fair_enough if it was just meant to be an additional service on board .
neutral	however , the interior space of the ferry is conceived as a floating shopping centre without proper sitting areas .
neutral	it is your business and you run it the way you want , but if i had the choice i would choose another option
neutral	the product looked good quality and so_far has met our expectation .
neutral	the price represents good value .
neutral	the sales_person was very pushy to the point of rudeness which i did not like and has put me off this company .
neutral	he was trying to upsell at all points and even questioning why i was saying no .
neutral	he also warned us that because the item was in thier sales that if we did not agree to an excellerated delivery fee there could be penalties .
neutral	so that we would need to pay an extra reorder fee if we could not meet the delivery date told to us in 0_weeks time with only a 0 day delivery date warning .
neutral	as we were around we did not listen to his threats and took a chance .
neutral	so good product ruined by poor sales_techniques and company strategy .
neutral	you may have won a single order but repeat_business will be lost with this attitude to customers .
neutral	as above was unable to speak to a expert ?
neutral	the only problem was with your couriers .
neutral	it got here eventually , 0 days late .
neutral	we waited in both days they said they were coming but they didn_'_t show .
neutral	there website said they ' d been and left calling_cards but they hadn_'_t
neutral	i ' d get different couriers that don_'_t tell_lies if i were you !
neutral	like many people i have used amazon quite often over the years and although the service is generally quite good , delivery does tend to let them down during both peak and off peak_periods .
neutral	i cannot_fault however the downloads , especially the ebooks .
neutral	fast , efficient , simple !
neutral	i bought a polo_shirt from jules_b , on - line , and the service was very slick , however , i called into the jesmond tailoring shop on thursday 00th and the shop service was very , very poor .
neutral	long_standing staff stood around making small talk wth clients they knew , while i was stood for about 0 minutes with an eton shirt in my hand wanting to try it on .
neutral	to say i felt ignored would be an_understatement .
neutral	i have been shopping in jules_b for around 00 years and have had mixed service from staff but this was the worst experience i have had .
neutral	i was made to feel like i was a bit of a nuisance .
neutral	i have my own business and i understand how important it is to keep relationships with your clients but this for me was very disappointing .
neutral	initially i was told my htc one would be a couple of days , then 0 days , then looking online it said order for 0 days delivery .
neutral	my telephone_enquiries , twice , to a friendly natalie ( there are two natalies there apparently ) who , despite_being friendly , " couldn_'_t " get any information from the suppliers about delivery timescales .
neutral	i didn_'_t have any major complaints about the time taken to get through to someone , about 0 - 0 minutes each time i called .
neutral	no worse than anywhere_else .
neutral	i did actually email to cancel my order , as i ' d found one " in stock " elsewhere , only to find out it wasn_'_t in stock by the time i ' d had my order processed .
neutral	ironically , my cancel request hadn_'_t been dealt_with , and i got a dispatch email the same day .
neutral	phone arrived the next_day , and i '_m very happy with it and the deal .
neutral	the dudes over at ss00 were very helpful when they got my order wrong and i can '_t really blame them for it getting lost in the mail .
neutral	they gave_me a full_refund and since everyone makes_mistakes i ' d still recommend you buy from ss00 .
neutral	really pleased with the end product but after not hearing_anything for around 00 days about my order , i called up only to find they hadn_'_t sourced my prescription yet .
neutral	completely_unacceptable in my opinion .
neutral	it just seems like they completely forgot about it as there '_s no reason_why a prescription should take that long to source ( it only takes a couple of minutes ).
neutral	wouldn_'_t hesitate to use again , but keep track of your order .
neutral	although my eye_sight has_improved 000_% i still after 00 weeks require drops because of irritation , overall experience is positive though
neutral	i find the first time buys from watchfinder to be excelent deals .
neutral	but they are not so generous with part exchange if at a later date you want to upgrade to a more_expensive watch .
neutral	i believe they would do far more business with beter trade in prices .
neutral	overall the holiday was excellent the villa was really good location , standard of fittings were first_class .
neutral	during our stay the fridge_freezer_broke_down during the night flooding the kitchen and ruining our food in the freezer .
neutral	it was later replaced by a temporary fridge_freezer in the dining_area .
neutral	i e_- mailed villa_plus on my return asking what they intended to do about the loss we had suffered £_00 approx but have had no response .
neutral	took the shine off another wise excellent holiday .
neutral	cars should have been supplied with full deposit
neutral	otherwise , good .
neutral	i ordered the extinguisher on a thursday late , expecting a monday delivery , the requirement stemmed from a french competitor in the rac rally who also a customer of our dealer in france , he was travelling up to the rally start location on tuesday .
neutral	the plan was to meet him on the motorway , the delivery came late tuesday , so a new plan !
neutral	received my order without one of my items .
neutral	i was then told i would receive my money back , but would have preferred if the missing item was just sent to me .
neutral	i also put a promo_code which was accepted but on confirming my order it then disappeared and i didn_'_t get my free items .
neutral	explained this in an email , but i wasn_'_t offered anything as an_apology .
neutral	on reordering my item , i was then told it would wouldn_'_t be shipped for another 0_weeks which isn_'_t acceptable
neutral	i was told i would receive my money back straight_away on my card but 00 days_later nothing , which i then had to chase up to find the credit was in fact not put onto my account .
neutral	all in all this is my 0nd order ( 0st went fine ) which was very disappointing , customer service was good but felt more could have been done / offered to replace my missing item .
neutral	well_packaged , quick and the right thing for the job but very pricey for what it is
neutral	unless the seal is fitted in warmer temperatures it can be difficult to apply the sealant and get good joint .
neutral	easy to trade , but cheque took too long to arrive .
neutral	so my girlfriend ordered me chocolates for today , 00 / 00 /_0000 and i found that the truffles expired on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
neutral	she got them custom made online on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
neutral	this is disgusting service , she paid her hard_earned_money only to have expired chocolates delivered .
neutral	they are not exactly the cheapest chocolates in the world and to be given out of date chocolates is disgusting .
neutral	not only is it a slap in the face to customers but it is a huge breach of food health and safety and i will be doing everything i can to get this sorted .
neutral	* update * it has_been sorted , they said the old box was used by_accident .
neutral	i guess i wrote this more out of anger as my gf was very upset .... as it was solved quickly i can change the star_rating .
neutral	lol
neutral	i think the plants in pots is old - fashioned .
neutral	you should try sending them in bespoke packaging without a growing medium .
neutral	this means less weight and perhaps a saving on packing - time and carriage .
neutral	as a family business competing with the giants try taking the best ideas from some of the larger companies .
neutral	whilst i have no issue in terms of the product and delivery arrangements , the absence of any installation_instructions is disappointing .
neutral	the video_clips in the website were not particularly helpful .
neutral	stick to your plan .
neutral	agent will try to push an upgrade on you for a price .
neutral	must assume you really did not make the right choice when you reserved online .
neutral	they first offered a hyundai when i reserved a focus ... all rose are out at the ment and after refusing 0 upgrades a focus suddenly came in the mix drove out to have low tire indicator came on ... stopped checked the air and next_day same thing .
neutral	returned car to the aorpprt on day 0 after tire shop could not repair tire ... sidewall puncture ... no_hassle exchange and now we are in a nissan versa just like mine but this one has a low tire pressure indicator all lit_up .. been there .. bought the t - shirt .. so we stopped every two_days to add air ... uneventful were it not for the frequent pit stops ..
neutral	the velcro fastener causes tearing problem when trying to fill bag with sacs .
neutral	this needs to be pointed_out to purchasers .
neutral	solution : put bean sacs inside plastic bin liner to enter them into cover .
neutral	remove sac from bin liner once inside cover .
neutral	im aware that ' reasonable within available method ' is a bit_confusing ... what i mean by that is that a company who relies on another company to complete it '_s business , and in this case mazuma relies on royal_mail or independent couriers , can only really provide a standard of service reflective of a standard set by the postal / courier service ... and on this occasion that was very slow , so indirectly mazuma didn_'_t send me my bank_transfer for a long time , nearly 0_weeks !
neutral	it '_s ok to say mazuma will send a bank_transfer the day they receive the phone , but if the courier fails to deliver timely then it '_s an inconvenience .
neutral	and although i respect that mazuma have no control over post , at the same time , they can only , having the type of business they do that relies havily on another business , recieve , 0_stars .
neutral	very high costs , double fees with paypal .
neutral	poor customes care
neutral	good prices and products , shocking delivery service .
neutral	out of the last 0 orders , 0 have been delayed , one of them upto nearly 0_weeks .
neutral	when i initially started_using them i could order in the evening , it was marked as sent the following_morning and arrived the next_day .
neutral	now i kind of expect it '_ll take a while and order way before i run out .
neutral	i called 0 days ago , got put on hold for 00mins than gave up and emailed instead .
neutral	my order was apparently delivered by the infamous and notoriously crap , hermes ( google it ).
neutral	it was apparently delivered to a neighbour .
neutral	it wasn_'_t as i have cctv and nobody came to my house or entered the cul - de - sac .
neutral	so i emailed myprotein to ask what was going on .
neutral	three_days and 0 emails and still no reply !
neutral	just an_automated email_saying they will reply in 00_hours .
neutral	good products , non_existent after care and stay well clear of hermes because they will not discuss any_problems with you , they refer you back to myprotein , who dont reply !

neutral	on 00th_december , i booked parking for a friday ( 00st_dec ) arrival at 00 : 00 and departure on saturday ( 00nd_dec ) at 00 : 00 ), for £_00 . 00 .
neutral	on the 00th , i changed the vehicle details i was arriving in and the arrival time to 00 : 00 , and on the 00th tried to change the parking departure details as i realised that although i was flying back to the uk on the 00nd , i wasn_'_t landing until 00 : 00 on 00rd .
neutral	customer_services phoned and left a message , and when i called back i was told that as it was less_than 00_hours before my arrival at the car_park the details couldn_'_t be changed , but i would only be charged for an extra days parking which would be £_00 .
neutral	on the 00st i arrived 00_minutes early and on the 00rd left about 0 hours_later due to a delay disembarking .
neutral	imagine my surprise when the ticket machine showed that i had to pay an extra £_00 instead .
neutral	so i will not be recommending them in a hurry .
neutral	very good service but a little disappointed with the short use by dates .
neutral	send fast , but did not send exact_model
neutral	great selection at great ( sale ) prices .
neutral	unfortunately to browse the site looking for said bargains i found it very difficult to find stuff relevant to me .
neutral	a lot of stuff , i thought was mislabeled genre wise so ended_up having to put in specific artists names just to find things .
neutral	other than this great service and especially great sale prices !
neutral	!
neutral	whilst the ' hotel ' was very clean & comfertable the organisation left a lot to be desired . at night ( after 0000_hrs ) the foreign students were allowed to run riot in the corridors stopping other residents any form of rest , when i went down to complain to the hotel staff they were most apologetic but said that they only had one member of secutrity staff to patrol the whole building in the morning no one seemed to be able to explain the system of paying for bteakfast ( no one seemed to speak or understand basic english .
neutral	the first comment could be solved by placing the students staff or teachers on the same floor to keep them quiet & the second comment would be easily solved by having a door or a gate on the entrance to the dining_room , or someone that could sprek english
neutral	.
neutral	i asked to be told when the goods would be shipped and when i could expect to receive them knowing that someone had to sign for them .
neutral	only when i e_- mailed , they didn_'_t reply to the phone message i left , did they tell me the goods had already been sent and that they were out for delivery that very same day to my house !
neutral	!
neutral	if only they communicated , would make life so much_easier .
neutral	flowers arrived in great time .
neutral	the problem was some of them looked a bit worse for wear , this still didnt detract_from the attention of the person_who they were for , but i would suggest that the people who make the arrangements check the flowers arent wilted or browning .
neutral	good efficient service , good prices , resaonably easy to use and to get problems fixed but there are too many problems - at_least 00_% of the time it is not possible to download the shipping labels and it is infuriating having to email interparcel and request they send them and then having to wait ages for them to send the link again .
neutral	for that reason i am looking around for alternative options but if they could fix that glitch they would be near perfect .
neutral	had problems / delays [ over two_weeks ] with my initial order of a winter_wetsuit due to a fault with their order processing .
neutral	however , once i had vented my frustration they were quick to put things right and i received my wetsuit without further delay .
neutral	i ordered uk 0 . 0 shoes but was sent usa 0 . 0 = uk 0 !
neutral	profuse_apologies from customer_care and replacements sent after i had returned wrong_size .
neutral	then slow to refund my return postage but all ended well after phone_calls .
neutral	would use again .
neutral	the goods were as_described christmas_lights ordered on 00 december .
neutral	the only issue was that the goods were not received promptly .
neutral	i had to chase up the order by email and instead of a personnel response was sent a standard response asking me to give feedback on the service .
neutral	not good enough and the goods took three_weeks to arrive making it unlucky to put up will have to wait_until next year to use .
neutral	£_00 for a dozen_red_roses they look half_dead was a bit disappointed they didn_'_t really say i love you more like i can '_t stand you ballon and chocolates was fine tho
neutral	bought the orange and blue max shelves .
neutral	all the metal lugs on every fitting needed to be widened with a screw_driver to fit .
neutral	tripled the assembly time .
neutral	good value and very speedy service .
neutral	royal_mail were used for delivery and shoes were not packed in anything protective , just a polythene_bag .
neutral	when they arrived one was a bit squashed .
neutral	my purchases have gone without_any real incident but i do have a complaint when asking for information .
neutral	i have sent e_- mails_asking for information or availability of beers / wines and have not had any reply .
neutral	this actually stopped me ordering as i thought you could not care less so i did not bother either !!
neutral	it was only your vast_choice that brought me back not your pr process .
neutral	i will always go to your site first and the last deliveries i have been happy with but please be aware of those bothersome enquiries .
neutral	shopped and found my item but was annoyed at over priced postage also if i payed more they would process my order quicker .
neutral	. very poor service because if i pay straight_away i expect it to be processed straight_away not to be given options to pay more if i want it posted tomorrow .
neutral	. probably_won_'_t use again .
neutral	. better service from ebay traders .. product however is very good .
neutral	managed to get a great deal on a return ferry trip dover to calais .
neutral	lucky that ferries ( both_ways ) were relatively quiet , so plenty of space to sit and get around .
neutral	but onboard costs were very high .
neutral	and service was poor too .
neutral	for example , there was no queue in the restaurant , so we went for some food .
neutral	asked what was available and were told that only breakfast items were available .
neutral	not happy , but ordered 0 breakfasts at a stupid cost .
neutral	we paid and sat down .
neutral	immediately behind us , the next people sat down with fish and chips !
neutral	what happened to ' breakfast only '?
neutral	the pictures came out much_darker_than i wanted them .
neutral	colours are dull and printing is poor quality .
neutral	the furniture was delivered on time which was good .
neutral	but there is not enough time to inspect goods .
neutral	in winter hours it is not always possible to see damage , which is what i found on inspection a few_days_later .
neutral	the box was clearly damaged before hand so the furniture should of been checked before delivery by your staff .
neutral	instead of delivering faulty goods to your much needed customers .
neutral	thus_making good customer_relations , which in turn has a knock on effect .
neutral	the word of mouth is a very powerful thing these days .
neutral	social_media which people have at their disposal . should make companies more positive towards their customers .
neutral	purchased several items hoping to get them quicker_than trapesing down to the local pet shop .
neutral	wonderful idea to price match if possible depending on other purchases .. ingenius !
neutral	however 0 days_later , no delivery .
neutral	contacted aquatics_online who advised some items out of stock but would be in the day after then would be shipped .
neutral	0 days_later and after paying £ 0 . 00 for the honour i received my items .
neutral	i did receive a £ 0 . 00 refund but only after asking .
neutral	all in all they dealt_with the issues but would have been far better customer_services to either not display non stocked items or state they are out of stock , one of my biggest bug bears .
neutral	will probably use them again but follo up with a call to check stock .
neutral	to be fair , the table_tennis_table which i bought was a good price and good quality however ...
neutral	customer service was average at best , taking 0 days to reply to an email requesting a change of order .
neutral	i was also promised delivery between 0 : 00 and 00 : 00 , at 00 : 00 i emailed to ensure there was no problem and didn_'_t receive a reply .
neutral	luckily the table eventually arrived at 00 : 00 , 0 hours late .
neutral	i finally received a reply to my query 0 days_later .
neutral	it all worked out fine in the end but it wasn_'_t a particularly enjoyable_experience .
neutral	ordered 00 ferrules .
neutral	gave the right size .
neutral	only 0 of the 00 were correct .
neutral	sent e_- mail to advise
neutral	done my best .
neutral	i don_'_t tell_lies .
neutral	now it '_s over to complete_care shop to send some replies .
neutral	have fun hope it '_s all good for you .................
neutral	they have good prices .
neutral	that '_s the main positive .
neutral	oh , they also responded to emails quickly , that '_s always a good thing .
neutral	the site is a bit_annoying to use ; it '_s very , very slow and any product with an asterisk in the name can '_t be viewed without some l00t h0x0r skills .
neutral	my order wasn_'_t actually in stock but this wasn_'_t indicated on the site .
neutral	ordered on monday , received next monday .
neutral	was hoping they could at_least dispatch it with saturday delivery on friday and even suggested this , but nope .
neutral	there was confusion with this order pertaining to my credit_card , and this is not the first time its happened .
neutral	regarding my order # q0000000 your online picture_shows the this selection displayed in a vase , hence i didn_'_t order a vase as i assumed the package would be delivered with one .
neutral	i also upgraded to a deluxe selection as_opposed to a standard package which i assume is what you sent , however i did also request a birthday_balloon be added to the above order , which was not sent ?
neutral	sent to wrong_address !
neutral	!
neutral	booked this car_hire in fuertaventura as used them in may and was pleased with the service but more important was the fuel_policy which was return as found , none of these up front full_tank charges .
neutral	beware goldcar have changed their policy without informing and now you have to pay for a full_tank which make these no different to the others
neutral	i ordered three types of sanding_discs to which two where out of stock , one set was delivered , i '_m still_waiting for my remaining order .
neutral	order was placed 00th_april_0000 .
neutral	i thought i would have had them by now , i '_ve had to source alternative discs although a better deal locally .
neutral	i paid the extra for the next working day postage and did not receive it the next_day .
neutral	this was very annoying as i was so excited to get the watch .
neutral	the product is really great though .
neutral	would be 0_star_review if it had been on time .
neutral	i '_ve not been using the product long enough to detect any benefit , but certainly the service from healthspark was very prompt .
neutral	one picture was repeated 0 times , a couple of pages had lots of white space and some pictures had our heads cut_off - quality of hardback album is good but just a disappointed that there are some obvious errors that should be checked when editing !
neutral	very happy with the product itself id wanted to buy a more professional pomade and this seemed to fit the bill .
neutral	however i paid an extra 0 . 00 to ensure next_day delivery , but the package still arrived a day late .
neutral	so really paying the extra seemed a waste of money especially on an item which itself was only 00 pounds .
neutral	but i was happy with the product itself .
neutral	i ordered their own_brand mass_gainer but instead got the protein .
neutral	i contacted them and i had to send a couple of photos to prove what i was saying was true .
neutral	they were helpful and said they can arrange for it to be picked_up and once it '_s back at the warehouse they will send out the correct product wut in all that would of taken about a week and i really needed the mass_gainer as it was so just stuck to the protein .
neutral	it '_s a shame as they are usually great
neutral	i would not say dont stay there but be aware it is basic , room above the pub so all noise can be heard unntil pub closes , also had to ask for bathroom to be cleaned which was done promptly , friendly people , stayed 0 nights and no other cleaning whatsoever was done .
neutral	redruth the town is a bit drab but is a good central spot to stay if you want to explore gorgeous cornwall .
neutral	this costume was awesome !
neutral	( dark mad hatter ).
neutral	great style and details , all nicely bundles together .
neutral	my only_criticism is the hat .
neutral	the design of the hat is fantastic .
neutral	great shape and everthing else .
neutral	it '_s just a shame that how it is packaged means that it '_s completely creased when you open it out .
neutral	it doesn_'_t look nearly as good as it should as the sides are all wrinkled and misshapen .
neutral	a real_shame in an otherwise brilliant costume .
neutral	on my last purchase i was confused when the parcel arrived as i had ordered double_sided printing on the cards .
neutral	the first 0 boxes i opened had nothing on the reverse side .
neutral	no note nothing which left me bemused .
neutral	on further inspection i received 000 cards 000 correct and 000 incorrect .
neutral	most sme '_s know with a business card you put on the front who you are and where you can be found and on the reverse what you do
neutral	my question is why send the incorrect cards ?
neutral	unless it is so you have nothing to dump !
neutral	useless pieces of paper i now have to deal with thanks for nothing .
neutral	if you want to offer a real service why not contact t the customer and ask them what they want doing with the incorrect cards ?
neutral	i bought based on internet research .
neutral	it looks_like what i '_ve purchased is incorrect because my ' pest ' problem still_exists .
neutral	had this supplier insisted on calling me before accepting my order , i believe i would have been sold the correct product .
neutral	i would probably have spent more money on the correct product too .
neutral	plus of course it '_s customer liaison and relationship building .
neutral	the products came as promised , bu t £ 0 . 00 charge for a £ 0 . 00 stamp / small jiffy_bag , pushing the boundries of whats acceptable
neutral	received flowers 00th_july_0000 for my anniversary .
neutral	on opening the parcel three or four of the lily heads were very limp and had to be de headed before putting in the vase which was enclosed .
neutral	coming down this morning there was another lily head lying limp and one of the other flowers is lying with its head low x .
neutral	when i phoned my husband to say thank_you he asked what the flowers were like and i told_him the above he was very disappointed at this as he is working away from home and thought it would have been a lovely jesture x
neutral	his inviice numbere is q0000000
neutral	i was promised & paid for a 0 to 0 day delivery on the 00th of april , unfortunatly i had to phone for an update on the 00th with delivery now promised for the 00nd .
neutral	the job the material was to be used for was on the 00nd now it has_been put back with the client very unhappy .
neutral	i bought a voucher , but had great difficulty accessing all my photographs and in the end gave up trying to .
neutral	so just composed the album with what i could access .
neutral	once ordered though , it arrived quickly and the finished product is excellent .
neutral	we arranged and paid for the big_bus_tour of budapest on line before our visit .
neutral	the bus_stop was not far from our hotel overlooking the banks of the danube on the buda side .
neutral	we waited , and waited , and waited .
neutral	fortunately it was a bright sunny day however after an_hour the delights of the view and the sunshine were wearing thin .
neutral	the bus did eventually arrive some 00_minutes late .
neutral	many apologies from both driver and conductress and some excuse about excessive traffic ( which was not apparent during the tour ).
neutral	when we did get going the bus was excellent .
neutral	seating was comfortable , personal headsets were provided and the commentary was clear and very informative .
neutral	at the onset of a short shower passengers on the top deck were immediately given waterproof ponchos .
neutral	the conductress was very helpful and answered all questions in excellent english .
neutral	we subsequently used the bus a number of times to get to various_locations in the city .
neutral	the boat cruise was a bit of a disappointment .
neutral	nice coffee and strudel on sale but otherwise not very comfortable and rather uninteresting .
neutral	we didn_'_t bother with the night time tour .
neutral	( enough buses for one day ).
neutral	i was initially pleased with the service provided .
neutral	a little annoying to receive newsletters / specials a few_times a week .
neutral	please have a better sign up option box ( maybe unchecked by default )
neutral	for information , i used to work for this company and they have their good points but i left of my own_accord for a reason .
neutral	the coverage is getting worse , my parents and sisters houses now have virtually no signal when they used to get a decent signal .
neutral	my sister was locked into a 00mth dongle contract and unable to use it for over a year and i was unable to do anything about it .
neutral	i felt really bad as it was me that got my manager to do her the deal which was superb whilst the dongle was useable .
neutral	they are quite expensive and there was one other mobile_phone company who could better any deal that i could offer to customers so when they walked in the shop and told me they were with them , i always knew it was a waste of time trying to get them to change to vodafone .
neutral	other_networks were never a problem at one point as vodafone was one of the best , if not the best in the area .
neutral	if i did not get a massive discount from them , i would now be with their main_competitor , mainly_because i feel annoyed that if i visit my parents , sister or one of my cousins , i cannot get a signal on my vodafone provided htc .
neutral	even work left them as a provider as they could not provide our sales_director with a signal at home in a relatively densely populated area of sheffield .
neutral	even_though we had about 00 phones , he struggled to get a vodafone sure signal unit from them to use although he still found it unusable as they had only provided him with a cheap 0 . 0g blackberry phone and he needed to have a 0g phone .
neutral	i have even found the internet can sometimes be very slow on the handset when my friends handsets are working fine on other_networks .
neutral	flowers great but delivery .... you needed to be an olympic runner to catch the delivery man .
neutral	one knock and he was off .
neutral	fortunately the recipient is very speedy and managed to catch him before he sped off .
neutral	might be worth serenata considering another delivery service as their weakest point is their strongest !
neutral	!
neutral	i used to use pharmacy_0u for a lot of my online purchases because historically they never used to charge for delivery .... but now that they charge for delivery they are just the same as any other online pharmacy !
neutral	no_problems with delivery , nice kit at reasonable prices , let_down by a lack of response to mis_- delivery of items , took 0 days to respond !
neutral	beware the premium phone line .
neutral	the vendor just responded that a response was sent within 00_hours , this was an_automated_response , and in my book counts for zilch .
neutral	must try_harder !
neutral	anime provided a reasonable service hence three stars .
neutral	could improve with dispatch times and feedback on the status of the order .
neutral	i had to telephone to check progress of my order , and i '_ve never had to do that before .
neutral	the price is competitive though .
neutral	we first purchased compatible_inks from you for our lexmark_printer , which was a bit of a disaster , the colour on our children , s homework was dreadful with half of the colours not being there .
neutral	we cleaned and deep cleaned the printer head without_success in the end we purchased the original lexmark inks and it was perfect .
neutral	moral of the story .
neutral	do not buy compatible_inks for a lexmark .
neutral	many_thanks in the end .
neutral	great free service but it would help if the driver took the boxes
neutral	i cannot find any use for the profile after having set one up .
neutral	the my bookings area does not use profile which seems odd .
neutral	the product arrived on the date , as stated and generally was good quality , for the price .
neutral	however , the edging strips for use at each end of shed roof had numerous splits in the grain and therefore split even more when nailed to the shed .
neutral	these should have been observed prior to despatch and should have been replaced by good quality pieces .
neutral	also , the method of fastening the 0 ' base ' pieces together , was poor design .
neutral	it '_s a pit that such minor things spoilt what otherwise , would have been a pleasing product and buying experience .
neutral	ordered a number of rump_steaks in their special_offers .
neutral	the steaks were tough .
neutral	i use a number of online meat suppliers and this was by far the worse .
neutral	a special_offer , maybe , but certainly not special .
neutral	whilst i was told that i would suffer some discomfort after my procedure it was not conveyed to me just how painful the first week post surgery would be .
neutral	agony doesn_'_t quite cover it .
neutral	i had to travel to birmingham for the surgery as only certain days were used for the procedures in the north_east so i was not happy about that .
neutral	i also did not heal correctly so it has left me short of 00 / 00 vision but still within driving_standards which is good .
neutral	i have since had to purchase a pair of glasses to wear on occaision as i have developed migranes since the procedure .
neutral	overall the staff couldn_'_t have been nicer although the surgeon did not have a grasp of the english_language at all , and this didn_'_t fill me with confidence during my procedure .
neutral	the results could '_ve been better however i suppose everybody heals differently .
neutral	customer service very helpful and good at communicating , and also great with the design .
neutral	the quality of the jerseys and shorts are good .
neutral	the only problem is one of the jersey '_s was a " woman - size large ", and it defintely is not a size large - more like a small , possibly a medium .
neutral	i know cycling clothes are tough to fit_properly and tend to be tight , but this was way off - something went wrong , and it '_s now going to have to be used by my daughter , who is in 0th grade .
neutral	night_freight are need easy to contact to get an update on the delivery time .
neutral	could not find website using google that worked .
neutral	so telephoned and then told to ring the local depo and given another number .
neutral	all to hard compared to other couriers .
neutral	regards
neutral	michael
neutral	like the products and when at checkout entered a 00_%_off product code which was accepted however this wasn_'_t shown on my receipt that arrived in the post .
neutral	everything was fine , booked my fabulous paris apartment months in advance for a special family occasion !
neutral	0_weeks prior to departure i get an email from all paris apartments telling_me " due to an incident out with their control " the apartment we booked was no_longer available , they offered us dreadful alternatives which i did not accept .
neutral	i then had a week of emailing back and forth with no real alternative options or help forthcoming .
neutral	i then decided to email the vendor of the apartment direct to find out the issue first hand and i was told the truth , all paris apartments had double booked us through no fault if our own .
neutral	the vendor was incredibly apologetic and understanding and helped_me book a hotel for the one days we were overbooked and re arranged for us to stay in the original apartment for the remained of our stay .
neutral	all in all poor customer service from all paris apartments , however saying that the end product was fabulous and very worth the money , just could have been doing without all the friction in the booking experience .
neutral	booking etc was fine but the the car was not properly cleaned when we picked it up and although it was vertually new and they said it had no damage on my inspection there was damage and i had to get the sheet amended .
neutral	staff on site were not very pleaseant to deal with and a bit rude .
neutral	car itself was fine .
neutral	company ok delivery not so great , asked for pm delivery and delivered at 00am delivery driver wouldn_'_t wait_till tiles checked .
neutral	otherwise all ok . driver also said didn_'_t have time for me to check all tiles ok which would have been nice as still had to sign for them !
neutral	the flowers were for my aunt who has broken her arm and has severe arthritus in her hips and knees .
neutral	we
neutral	> were keen that she should have an arrangement that would not require
neutral	> placing into a vase ( not easy with only one functioning arm ).
neutral	these flowers were intended to cheer_her up on the day of her only sister '_s
neutral	> funeral ( 00rd decenber ) since she is currently housebound and was unable to attend , and ordered in good time on 00th_december
neutral	i - flower were chased on 00th_december and we were assured of delivery before 0pm on christmas_eve .
neutral	this did not happen .
neutral	i - flower were chased on 00th_december and we were assured of delivery before 0pm on new year '_s eve .
neutral	this did not happen .
neutral	i - flower were chased on 0nd_january and flowers were delivered on 0rd_january .
neutral	my aunt was very pleased with her flowers .
neutral	it was disappointing that at no stage in this process did i - flower provide any feedback except when chased by us .
neutral	i had to ring austria and check whether delivery had been made and then ask i - flower what was happening .
neutral	i have received an_apology from the company but could not in all sincerity recommend them to any of my friends .
neutral	second time i '_ve been in here since it moved and got served by the same guy .
neutral	no chat at all , looked gutted about life in general !
neutral	if its gonna be like that in a shop you may as well go online - or to boardwise , they seemed happy to chat riding !
neutral	post to irealnd took 0 days !
neutral	- not sure whose fault it was , but you should check it out ,
neutral	thanks
neutral	john hesnan
neutral	it would have ben helpful if the delivery team were able to unpack the furniture .
neutral	i was left with a mountain of packing_material .
neutral	i also had to spend some time screwing on all the drawer_handles .
neutral	you place an order , you pay , it arrives .
neutral	job_done .
neutral	and that '_s exactly_what happened .
neutral	to be honest it would have been better not to send any free_samples rather_than the paltry one that accompanied a £_000 order .
neutral	hello ,
neutral	i took my daugthers car in for a " half price full service " at the wolverton branch and found that the car had lots of " recommendations "
neutral	for example , the rear drum / shoe brakes needed cleaning and adjusting for £_00 which i thought should have been in the service - after all they would have already taken off the drum to " inspect " them as per service schedule - surely all the dust would have fallen out !
neutral	just requiring a quick squirt of cleaning_fluid ?
neutral	i also found that whoever dealt_with me was rather condescending - correcting me and treating me as if i knew absolutely nothing about cars .
neutral	i think that this half price offer draws you in and then they find all the faults they can - in fact i got a scare story about the radiator having lost all its fluid too !
neutral	when i asked further , i found out that it was " showing_signs of a leak "- which i have not seen at all - even today .
neutral	but they are still probably ok value - i guess you pay for what you get .
neutral	the service and pricing were fantastic , but unfortunately the varifocals supplied just did not suit my eyesight .
neutral	having been a varifocal user for 0 years i just could not adapt to the freeform type .
neutral	for standard or bifocal i would recommend everytime ...... unfortunately for now i will have to be ' ripped_off ' by the high_street ....
neutral	i bought 0 shirts on one of the special_offer deals - they arrived promptly and were very nice quality .
neutral	unfortunately , the 0 premier shirts i ordered both had rust stains under the metal pins - 0 also had a discoloured ( metal ) collar_bone - all indicating that these were probably stored in damp conditions - great shame that this wasn_'_t noticed prior to sending .
neutral	i was told i could return the shirts and was offered replacement for 0 shirt and choice of another shirt for the 0 that was out of stock - i don_'_t want to get involved with packing and returning goods so just hope the stains will fade in time .
neutral	in short , great quality let_down by poor quality control .
neutral	for a catalogue the prices are very good and quite comparable to online and highstreet prices .
neutral	the downside is that you can often have a long long wait for things , especially if they are from other_sellers ..
neutral	they do put expected wait on the website but this is sometimes just plain wrong or you can miss it quite easily .
neutral	these negatives aside i would still recommend them as the product quality and service is very good and returns are easy .
neutral	this company is a waste of space , they leave calling_cards but dont knock on the door or ring the bell , trying to call someone is not going to happen , its all automated and has limited options , i emailed them asking that they call my mobile to make_sure i dont miss the item again , they responded with ' its not our drivers job to call you , make_sure you are home '.
neutral	this is not the first time ive had issues with these_guys .
neutral	i would ask any company not to use these_guys .
neutral	i ended_up paying an extra £_00 for a garanteed delivery slot .
neutral	lets_see what happens ...
neutral	again , please do not use these_guys , i would proberly not order from your company if i know you use dpd as your delivery choice .
neutral	update_: 00 : 00 - 00 / 0 / 00
neutral	after_reading the reply i sent them an email ( around 00am ) with the shipping reference and my contact number , no contact has_been made as yet .
neutral	update_: 00 : 00 - 00 / 0 / 00
neutral	just got a call from dpd who appologised and said they are going to send someone with the parcel tonight and will call me when they are outside .
neutral	lets_see what happens .
neutral	update 00 : 00 - 00 / 0 / 00
neutral	item was delivered later today buy city_link .
neutral	summary_: awfull service , i feel if i had not called and made a complaint things could have been alot worse and who_knows when i would have got my item , but once i started talking to people on the phone they seemed nice enough and got the item to me asap .
neutral	low brow sales .
neutral	talkative woman , the type to overtalk you .
neutral	i expressed a need to know more about the quote for a 0 camera system .. she took it as an indication i couldnt afford the system .
neutral	when i asked what the system recording make and model was she couldnt justify why she had quoted me that particular unit at all .. " its because its a good one " came the reply ...
neutral	so i asked , do you sell others ?
neutral	she replied yes , so i asked why offer me this unit ?
neutral	all i got was sales bluster and zero technical_knowledge .
neutral	the warranty they offered on parts was 0 year , yet the manufacturers_warranty on new product was 0 , upon querying she didnt know why that was .... selling refurbished product perhaps i suggested ... hmmm
neutral	poor service all_round .
neutral	sales simply not competent enough to listen and deliver the correct information .
neutral	although we live in spain we still continue to use this company for the basics we don_'_t want to live without .
neutral	the site is easily_navigated and product is of a good quality .
neutral	the drawback however was the long length of time it took from the order being placed to dispatch , hence the 0_stars .
neutral	we will use the site again but maybe next time we will order before the holes appear in socks !
neutral	great company initially however when i arrived at the airport ( bordeaux ) the chap behind the desk was unable to read my special request which was simply for a car_seat for a three year_old .
neutral	when i translated this request it turned_out that they did not have the minibus i required .
neutral	after about half an_hour however , i was given two cars ; the second one without charge .
neutral	not ideal but the staff were very helpful and very friendly and i have no_hesitation in passing on my recommendations for this company .
neutral	note : although i was given the car free of charge it did mean that i had to pay double the petrol money for all of us to enjoy the outings we had planned .
neutral	would advise you to check that all the details are understood before you fly out if you are requesting a large vehicle .
neutral	car was decent but dirty inside .
neutral	be aware that although you think you have paid everything that they will want to swipe your credit_card for 000_euro incase you damage a tyre , wing , roof undercarriage , etc ...
neutral	i bought insurance in the uk for this which cost about £_00 and this covers you for all these items .
neutral	if you don_'_t they try to sell it to you for a varied amount but a lot more than £_00 .
neutral	they don_'_t like the fact you bring insurance but they can '_t say no when you have the documents there .
neutral	the sanding bobbin seems well_designed and made .
neutral	but it needs 00mm wide sandpaper .
neutral	axminster only supply 000mm rolls , so i had to phone to make_sure that i wasn_'_t missing something , then back to my friend , mrs google , to find someone_who sold the required sandpaper .
neutral	which i did .
neutral	the bobbin worked well on my vertical drill stand and i finished the job i bought it for quickly and satisfactorily .
neutral	i would have liked it better if there had been a bottom spindle and a matching bearing supplied so as to reduce the lateral force on the motor shaft of the drill .
neutral	i guess you get what you pay for .
neutral	but i would have paid more ...
neutral	the toilets smelt on both trios .
neutral	no sign of any cleaning .
neutral	seats were comfortable and plenty of room .
neutral	the food was diabolical .
neutral	looked very congealed and i was one of the first into the restaurant .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t recommend it to anyone .
neutral	price was very good though as we were towing so i supposed that '_s have the money was saved .
neutral	not sure if i would travel with you again .
neutral	the risk of getting something whilst on board was too high .
neutral	i was very happy with the quality of the waistcoat but unfortunately it arrived rather badly_creased .
neutral	perhaps it would have been better to wrap it in tissue_paper ,
neutral	ordering experience was decent enough , but they wouldn_'_t match total_cost including cost of shipping by another company .
neutral	i still bought from camping_world because they offer topcashback with offset the difference in cost , but the cash_back was declined leaving me having paid more than i needed too .
neutral	i probably wouldn_'_t use them again !
neutral	the girl keeps phoning yes i '_ve got some orders to place small business but can '_t get place them until the customer is ready ,
neutral	cheaper price online than the girl gave_me
neutral	may be better off back with national pens
neutral	site easy to use , although one of my spare mobiles - the newer one - an alcatel ot 000 - was not recognised by the system , so i '_ll have to find another purchaser or keep it as a spare .
neutral	i have used this company before and delivery is always prompt .
neutral	although this years valentines roses wilted after a couple of days which has never been a problem before
neutral	quality of product now is rather poor .
neutral	( nike )
neutral	always been happy in the past but won_'_t use again !
neutral	!
neutral	i had to go to the post_office in heavy_traffic when other supplier sends door to door overnight .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	it would be unfair of me to write anything as the deal didn_'_t go_ahead due to the high cost of postage to the channel_islands .
neutral	nobodies fault
neutral	delivered on time but you forgot to send me the tracking good which i had spend some time getting out of you .
neutral	regards
neutral	rhys lloyd
neutral	ordered my makita leaf_blower on - line on evening of thursday 0th_nov , website easy to use , payment made via_paypal , so_far so good however no confirmation_email received that night .
neutral	next_day , still no email so phoned , was told by helpful lady that " her colleague was downloading my order " and i would get email with tracking_info " straight_away ".
neutral	she said my order would come on monday .
neutral	friday_afternoon still no email .
neutral	phoned at 0000 friday , you had all gone home for weekend , not particularly customer - friendly if you cannot contact anyone by phone from 0000 friday to 0000 monday .
neutral	waited over weekend and at 0000 monday_morning i finally got your email .
neutral	was able to call carrier who gave_me rough delivery slot which was useful .
neutral	machine arrived on time and well_packed .
neutral	i am very pleased with it .
neutral	so my suggestions would be 0 / send a confirmation_email immediately an order is placed , and send another one when dispatch is arranged . 0 / consider extended phone hours surely 0000 /_0000 should be a minimum ?
neutral	these products are great .
neutral	the ordering , payment , speed of delivery , price etc are all great .
neutral	but .
neutral	the person_who delivers them , puts them on the door_step .
neutral	rings the bell and walks away .
neutral	they dont make any attempt to actually hand them too you .
neutral	luckily so_far no one has picked them up before i have got to them .
neutral	but i wonder_if this is just a matter of time .
neutral	i think its very bad that you pay a lot of money for a lovely display of flowers + chocs and people spend a lot time preparing the display for a nice_surprise for somebody to have it all wasted by a real bad delivery service . the flowers and chocs were left out side a block of flats at 0pm they did not ring the bell the person_who lived there is house bound and was in to get the door the only way she got the flowers is when i phoned at 0pm and asked her if she got them and she went out to find them .
neutral	change your delivery service from unhappy customer
neutral	payed for next_day delivery but didnt arrive_till day after if i used the company i uselly used it would have got there when i wanted it there
neutral	but my friend says try you s so i did and never arrived when i wanted it there
neutral	the software was very easy to use which made the creation and layout of the photobook very easy .
neutral	according to the preview of what i had created it looked fine , but there were some problems when i received it .
neutral	when putting multiple photos on a page even_though i specified the width of white_border required for each , some photos had no border .
neutral	i inserted a video and the film strip graphic was added to the page , but the mock perforations of the film strip allow the surrounding photos to show through which looks messy .
neutral	i ordered 0 copies of my photobook which arrived promptly , but they had been damaged on one corner .
neutral	most of these issues are minor , but if i pay a premium price i expect a premium service and product .
neutral	items not delivered on time and to wrong_address .
neutral	no apology or follow_up .
neutral	items ordered together sent separately and at different times .
neutral	i always used interparcel until i had a problem and needed to contact them .
neutral	that is when the problems started .
neutral	the staff are rude , when they bother to reply ...
neutral	if you have an issue , they do not care , they have your money so do not reply to emails , when they do it is a week to late ,
neutral	no apology for the delay ,
neutral	no apology for the poor service
neutral	parcel0go are by far better , the prices are exactly the same .
neutral	fast delivery nice wheels and a good price but the £_00 . 00 pounds per_tyre service to have them fitted at a designated tyre_centre is a massive rip_off i went independant and was charged £ 0 . 00
neutral	we are really pleased with the quality of the furniture purchased .
neutral	however , when the items were delivered i think that all the packaging should be taken_away .
neutral	we were left with a full garage of packaging which i had to take to the dump .
neutral	when you have spent over £ 0000 with a company i would expect better .
neutral	also the cabinet we ordered was nearly left on the van and i had to remind the driver who were helpful .
neutral	in summary could to better !
neutral	the ordering experience and communication during the process was 0nd to none , but it turns_out that the flowers were left on the doorstep and only notice some hours_later .
neutral	this is completely unnacceptable especially given the recent bad_weather and high_winds !!
neutral	!
neutral	the cartridges were delivered within the time frames stated , which was great .
neutral	they leaked when they were installed .
neutral	i had black and yellow fingers for a few_days , which was disappointing .
neutral	recently travelled economy to dubrovnik in croatia and whilst the flights were bang on time both_ways , the stewards and the food were not .
neutral	early flights meant miserable cabin staff , the return in the afternoon was like being with a different airline .
neutral	mediocre meal going out and just a sandwich on the return .
neutral	glad i '_m going with croatia airlines next time as their flights are consistently good .
neutral	sorry ba despite your recent pr exercise on sky in truth it '_s still not what you expect from britain '_s premier airline .
neutral	really prompt delivery , great time .
neutral	but after opening up the packet put the new battery on charge and found it faulty .
neutral	despite describing the problem , made to jump_through_hoops and now have to send back and they examine before i get replacement .
neutral	plus i have to pay to post back !
neutral	really off .
neutral	great service but annoyong if you miss a text as the advert comes down .
neutral	there should be a better way of notifying or the choice ie email_notifications
neutral	i came to talktalk business after being a nildram and then pipex customer ( being passed along the line after acquisition ...)
neutral	talktalk are ok . from a phone service delivery and adsl perspective it works .
neutral	network latency sometimes spikes but nothing too awful .
neutral	phone is clear with no drops .
neutral	customer_services are less_than ideal though .
neutral	when i phone to ask a question i get fobbed_off , given some rubbish fake technical answer or told that the expert will call me .
neutral	of course , the call never comes so i call in again and again until i fond someone_who_cares enough to help .
neutral	this is the worst aspect of their service and the one that greatly needs to improve .
neutral	i was reluctant to give the garment any stars for i '_ve not had the chance to wear it .
neutral	however , the jacket does not give the appearance of being worth eighty odd_pounds , but i suppose everyone who now purchases nike equipment will have to make a substantial contribution to rory '_s 00 million .
neutral	first puchase went without_any problem and was delivered in a few_days .
neutral	second purchase was delivered in a few_days but did not fit the clubs i had , did not include the grip_tape as promised and am still_awaiting a reply to my problem .
neutral	i '_ve_used them before with no_problems but 0 order took a week to sort & if i hadn_'_t done the work i would never found out about the issues with my order .
neutral	i will use them again but hopefully those issues have been raised and the company has learned from the mistakes .
neutral	normally don_'_t have any_issues with collections / deliveries booked through interparcel however we recently had a package left without a signature and subsequently stolen .
neutral	interparcel were very slow to respond regarding a claim and it took 0 or 0 phone_calls with them promising to investigate before they actually did .
neutral	we successfully claimed eventually but it took far longer_than it should have done .
neutral	ordered items on line over bank_holiday_weekend , 00 . 00 tuesday_morning i received a call to tell me the items were not available .
neutral	this gave_me time to find alternative .
neutral	would use them again when i need anything_else .
neutral	considering i ordered 0 pairs on 00th_may and i '_m still_waiting for one , not ideal .
neutral	first pair arrived and are perfect , second pair , despite advice of their despatch , were a no show .
neutral	i accept this is the post_office at fault , but glasses_direct then make you wait 00 working_days after the 0 - 00 days you need to wait from the email_confirming_despatch to lodge the loss .
neutral	the reality then , is this is a full 0_weeks , because they are working_days !
neutral	the you complete a form , then they reload the order - all took too long .
neutral	anyway , 0nd pair arrived last_week - wrong , no reactolite function as ordered and confirmed on their despatch advice - so as of 00th_july , still_waiting .
neutral	not convinced i '_ll use them again ....
neutral	it easy sending money to the philippines .
neutral	the fun comes when the recipient tries to pick it up particularly if its via mlhuillier !
neutral	!
neutral	be prepared for them being offline so much of the time - multiple visits to collect seem to be a speciality .
neutral	can '_t vouch for any other_outlets , but i suspect they can '_t be any worse .
neutral	i ordered my item 00th_october , and after emailing and leaving messages for 0_weeks i eventually got a reply , it promised me my item next couple of days , sent by a women .
neutral	anyway i eventually got hold of the owner and was able to text his mobile , he explained the situation , but i still did get a few false_promises , but at_least i was able to communicate , anyway after all the snow had buggered off , i did get my tracking_number and finally my item , yes it was frustrating having to wait that long but i also understand they have to be made as it does state .
neutral	but i do believe the customer service needs to improve , but the item is fantastic .
neutral	yes i would use again but by then hopefully delivery issues will be sorted .
neutral	very pleased with price & quality of product - upset that the delivery company took it to a different company ( shop ) some half mile_away and it was only due to their dillegence that they rad the label and bothered to get it to me .
neutral	000_% check before it leaves ( save yourselves in transport costs .)
neutral	picked wrong 0st time round cost you an uplift charge on a £_00 box of batteries , that '_s got to have eaten into your margin .
neutral	would have been a 0 rating if it was not for stupid error which should have been caught before leaving but found customer_services to be more efficient .
neutral	thanks alex ps still cheaper_than high_street .
neutral	our driver was about 00_minutes late but give him his due he did phone and let us know .
neutral	my partner was rather surprised when he saw the van , it was quite old and very obvious that the item to be transported , a wardrobe , would not go into the van in the
neutral	standing up position .
neutral	it was laid on it '_s back after the driver had a good moan_about his hip .
neutral	with my partners help the wardrobe was delivered and put into the right room .
neutral	would i use this person again , sadly no i wouldn_'_t for a larger item but if it was smaller i would consider him , possibly .
neutral	sadly stock control got it wrong .
neutral	my much needed radio_mic replacement was not in stock as ordered and subsequently proved to be no_longer available .
neutral	if you offer the customer the ability to make a comment on the order process it would be good to take notice of the comment .
neutral	i specifically gave authorisation for the delivery to be left in a safe_place as i knew that there would not be anyone available to accept delivery - this is apparently not good enough and meant that i was without the item when i needed it .
neutral	the powertools appeared used and the user manuals were in poor condition indicating a returned item or perhaps a display_model .
neutral	the items themselves operate ok so not worth the hassle of returning .
neutral	the plate arrived promptly but felt the quality of the plate was not good , thought it would be brass but it was plastic , maybe i should read more detail !
neutral	got a good deal on the dewalt drive but was then asked to pay an extra £_00 delivery charge after i had paid .
neutral	it then took the courier 0 attempts to deliver .
neutral	0st time he must have knocked the door and ran away as it took me around 00_secs to answer it just to see him drive off .
neutral	0nd time i asked for it to be delivered and left with my neighbour who was in all day .
neutral	he didnt_bother his ass knocking the neighbours door but instead left another card .
neutral	i suppose i would prob order tools again but they need to scrap the unfair postage charge and give the courier a kick in the balls .
neutral	good company who seriously need to look at the courier company they use .
neutral	how on earth it takes anyone 0 days to deliver a package from england to northern_ireland in 0000 is anybodies guess !!
neutral	!
neutral	the item was delivered very quickly , but was not as_described .
neutral	the desciption of the board stated that the board came with an attachment that clipped to the bottom of it to make exercises more difficult .
neutral	this did not arrive and i subsequently found out that it was no_longer being manufactured .
neutral	whilst the board performs exactly as it should it would have been nice to know before hand that the attachment would not be forwarded or that its description be removed from the description .
neutral	i bought the dozen_red_roses as a valentines_gift .
neutral	the roses were nice but unfortunately they had no scent .
neutral	this was one of the selling points on the website .
neutral	when i raised this , i was told that scent cannot be guaranteed ; it depends on the order on the day .
neutral	just be aware of this when looking at the products !
neutral	excellent service at a reasonable price .
neutral	the only thing that spoils the service is this compulsory " your full review " box which can not be skipped and of course the also annoying terms and conditions for that reason i give a star_rating of so so
neutral	whilst all went fine with the actual arrangements , i was horrified to be told on the handing back of the vehicle at venice airport that not only was i being charged an " extra " ( as far as i was concerned ) 000_euros for ywo additional items i had requested for the week '_s hire but that the there was a huge premium of 00_euros for filling up the car also ( ie on top of the cost of the fuel itself ) - these costs were not made abundantly clear at the time of booking and they should have been , so look out for the small_print everyone ( i certainly will next time and will not book anything unless i am absolutely convinced that all of the associated costs have been expressly stated )!
neutral	i was unable to be in for the delivery x 0 from parcelforce so i nominated a local post_office to collect it from ( tuesday ).
neutral	i was told the earliest i could collect would be friday .
neutral	so i went to the post_office around 00pm but the staff were pretty_useless , saying they don_'_t take deliveries for my postcode .
neutral	i said i had nominated that post_office but there was no delivery for me either way .
neutral	i told them that the delivery was expensive and that i was a little_worried , and in their own words they said they didn_'_t care .
neutral	i asked if parcelforce was still the same company as royal_mail and they confirmed this , but said it '_s not their problem .
neutral	after the wasted_journey i then called parcelforce who said that the item was out for delivery but didn_'_t know where .
neutral	i then spoke to another customer service agent at parcelforce who said i had gone to collect the item from the post_office too early and that deliveries are made at the end of the day .
neutral	i told her that the email confirmation said i could collect it on the friday and displayed the opening times of the post_office in question and said nothing about what time i could collect it .
neutral	they said it was my fault even_though i asked them if they ' d ever_seen an email notification for selecting a nominated post_office and they said no !
neutral	eventually the item was delivered to the post_office , and i went to collect it .
neutral	however not before the memeber of staff looked perplexed at my postcode and said they don_'_t take deliveries for my area .
neutral	i then explained the situation ( again ) and they went out back and had a long conversation with their manager before finally appearing with my parcel .
neutral	not tried the speakers yet but look great .
neutral	experience completely let_down by the terrible customer service from the post_office / parcelforce who work completely independently and have no interest in each other or the customer it seems .
neutral	loved the flowers online , especially as they said they could deliver same day .
neutral	i placed the order , only to get a call back ten_minutes later to say the order could not be fulfilled by their local suppliers .
neutral	that was four days ago .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting for the credit into my account .
neutral	so i have no flowers and i '_m short £_00 !!
neutral	!
neutral	i '_ve been with bt for quite a number of years and just have the constant niggling feelign that they ' re conning me .
neutral	i feel as though i am paying way too much for broadband etc but can '_t face calling them because i don ; t have half a day to waste on the phone on hold to then be put through to someone i struggle to understand .
neutral	i '_m just waiting for sky_broadband ( the fast one ) to make it to my area and i '_ll be switching
neutral	i like ebay overall and have got some good value stuff , but i don_'_t enjoy the agro you can get from other users .
neutral	i have only ever sold two items through ebay , on one i was accused by a bidder of bidding myself to jack the price up , which i wasn_'_t , and the other i had difficulties getting paid by someone_who kept claiming they had when they had not .
neutral	its good in principle but for me not worth the hassle when selling
neutral	my printy finally arrived after about 0 days ... on very thin paper .
neutral	well_packed though ... but the so thin paper has_been ruined as soon as i touched it , by creasing .
neutral	they did go downhill for a long time , now on their way back up , but still expensive
neutral	every time i go to tesco their prices go up , what happened to this new scheme on prices they are advertising , or is that just in larger stores ?
neutral	?
neutral	everybody uses social_media now , its becoming boring , especially when you don_'_t know half the people that connect with you !
neutral	!
neutral	be careful , be very careful .
neutral	it has it uses but it has its down sides also
neutral	be warned that your account can become limited by paypal at their discretion then when they want more info to lift the limitation it can get very irritable when they keep wanting more and more although you provide what they want
neutral	be warned , paypal is never as easy as they say it is !
neutral	!.
neutral	received a text and e_- mail at 00 . 00 saying it would be delivered between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 .
neutral	so the parcel arrived at about 00 . 00 !
neutral	driver knew nothing about the timings .
neutral	can '_t see why they give a time_slot if it '_s purely fictional .
neutral	just annoys the customer !
neutral	ordered 0 pairs of keys for 0 different customers on same day .
neutral	received 0 envelopes with 0 keys in each but with no paperwork , had to take 0 keys to first cust house to see which were hers
neutral	an order number accompanying keys would have solved problem
neutral	i had an e_- mail to tell me my parcel would be delivered wednesday .
neutral	i checked the uk mail website to check the status of my parcel and it said " out for delivery ".
neutral	by 0 o ' clock the parcel still hadn_'_t been delivered and when i re - checked the website it said " please phone ."
neutral	i was kept " on hold " for 00_minutes using an 0000 number and when i got through to an adviser was told the courier couldn_'_t find me .
neutral	all i can say is he can '_t have tried very hard .
neutral	anyone in the village could have directed him to my house .
neutral	i made arrangements for the parcel to be re - delivered on friday as i was going to be out on thursday and left a telephone_number in case the courier need to ring for directions .
neutral	when i got home on thursday there was a note from the courier through my letter_box saying my parcel had been left in the greenhouse .
neutral	so why did i have to spend 00_minutes on hold to the call_centre when the re - arranged delivery was ignored and the courier obviously had no problem finding my house the following_day ?
neutral	good product at a good price but i ' d advise against paying for 00 hr first_class delivery as it took 0 days .
neutral	down to the post_office but nonetheless it '_s only in the small_print that it says first_class delivery can take 0 days .
neutral	other than that i '_m happy to recommend the company .
neutral	still_waiting .
neutral	ordered 0nd week of march_0000 .
neutral	hopefully be here this week .
neutral	will leave review after we receive items
neutral	seams puckered by machine so had to be sent back and resown .
neutral	company did this quickly but standard not as expected for price paid
neutral	flights with easyjet are exactly as advertised .
neutral	they will get you where you want to go , no_frills unless you want to pay extra .
neutral	ideal for budget - conscious travellers , but don_'_t use them if you are one of life '_s moaners and complainers .
neutral	i found the services i paid for were perfectly_adequate for my needs , the staff helpful and polite .
neutral	i ordered 0 wi_-_fi antenna extension_cables .
neutral	since the loss in these cables is critical i wanted then to be as short as possible .
neutral	the cables were advertised as 0m_long , but in fact are 0 . 0m_long .
neutral	i would not have ordered if they had been accurately_described .
neutral	with my paypal payment , i sent a message requesting a copy of their catalogue and price list as i saw that they have a branch near to me .
neutral	they appear to have completely ignorred this request as nothing has arrived ...
neutral	from a business perspective i was surprised that there was no paperwork accompanying the delivery .
neutral	this is very bad_practice as had i ordered the same item from different suppliers at similar times , as often is the case , i would not have known what came from whom , especially if one got lost , arrived damaged etc .
neutral	a good service , in the end .
neutral	after being told around 0000 on the friday when the dellivery was due that it was running a few hours late .
neutral	it finally turned_up on monday_morning .
neutral	i '_m glad i didn_'_t get caught in that traffic jam !!
neutral	!
neutral	i have used the online grocery_shopping site many_times since it first started . i find it very convenient and a great idea , however the ability to fulfill orders and deliver on time is still a problem after all this time .
neutral	you can understand how a supermarket will suddenly go out of stock on some items but sometimes the substitutions are a little_confusing eg ; a tin of cat_food instead of 0 tins of dog_food !
neutral	but the apparent inability of the office not being_able to track the delivery vehicles is stupid .
neutral	only being_able to contact the driver by mobile is asking for trouble .
neutral	so they colud definately do better .
neutral	great product - delivered perfectly within time window by friendly guys .
neutral	what you have to watch though is the ' helpful ' emails and telephone_calls all of which are designed to sell you something extra .
neutral	do i want to insure the product for £_00 / year for ever ?
neutral	no and i resent the clever script used by the telephonist which assumes i do unless i intervene .
neutral	do i want the appliance fitted by the delivery guy for £_00 ?
neutral	no it '_s a rip_off price for a five minute job .
neutral	would i buy from ao again ?
neutral	yes but i would be ready for their steamroller marketing techniques from the off .
neutral	batteries ok .
neutral	unfortunately the next_day delivery took 0 days .
neutral	they did refund the next_day delivery charge .
neutral	very helpful lady sorted this out .
neutral	i am unable to submit a review as the purchase has not yet arrived .
neutral	it would be helpful to know when i may receive it .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	great product very pleased .
neutral	however , the pole for the parasol was not the size as stated .
neutral	the parasol pole diameter : 0 . 0cm was not anywhere_near correct .
neutral	more like 0 . 0cm or less .
neutral	good delivery , over priced for the product , didn_'_t come with white flowers as listed
neutral	write why you did not find the experience particularly good .
neutral	for instance_:
neutral	i finally received my item but after a lot of correspondence back and forth .
neutral	the company obviously did not have the item in stock and would return the money to me .
neutral	the item is ok .
neutral	the order went through online , but i did not receive a response to confirm the artwork was approved and in production .
neutral	i had to chase up myself .
neutral	i had also been advised of a delivery date being a thursday , advised my clients of this , only to find it was going out on the friday .
neutral	apart_from that , the printed letterhead came out well .
neutral	made 0 orders this week and paid the extra delivery cost to receive my order the next working day but on both_occasions my order arrived on the second working day .
neutral	smooth ordering and delivery process , but all seemed to fall_apart when we needed to return one item .
neutral	no response to email , ended_up having to phone to arrange the return .
neutral	we had sky providing tv , internet and phone services for a few_years before recently cancelling our tv subscription .
neutral	when their charges rose to a total of £_00 per_month , £_00 for their tv service ( including sports package ) and £_00 for broadband and telephone services , we decided to use freeview for tv rather_than sky .
neutral	our bills now £_00 . 00 and the saving is well_worth the loss of sky_sports etc .
neutral	to sum_up , sky is fine but over - priced .
neutral	as a private_individual , i '_ve been buying / selling on ebay for over 00 years and in that time have experienced the good and bad of ebay .
neutral	in that time , the company has_grown and has got greedy , increasing their charges and acquiring paypal to further increase profitability .
neutral	their systems have also changed , mostly for the good , but not always , and their claims for buyer_protection are rather over - stated .
neutral	although this is a rating for the company , one must realise that the weakest part of ebay auctions is the individual one is trading with .
neutral	there are some unscrupulous and irresponsible people out there who one would avoid dealing_with if one saw or knew them .
neutral	first goldcar hire for a few_years , not informed about the excess charge change not informed by carrentals or goldcar prior to booking , only three option 00_euros covers all , 00_euros covers glass and tyres last option 000_euros deposit in case you have an accident , having been driving in spain for many_years decided on option 0 , went to the car_park found the car huge_amount of damage to the rear end , car not very clean inside , spoke to car_rental person_who said dont_worry it happens in spain .
neutral	on returning car to goldcar no more damage added asked for deposit to be returned informed it '_s automatic but allow up to 0_weeks .
neutral	ok , the trip over was fine , our car broke_down in holland on the return trip .
neutral	this made us miss our 0pm ferry and we had to catch the 00pm .
neutral	not your fault i know , but to add to our very stressy trip you charged us another £_00 odd_quid to amend our booking .
neutral	no need for that at all i reckon , how can you justify that , a lady spending what 0 minutes on the keyboard , joke , the ferry was nearly empty so that wasnt the issue .
neutral	i could understand say maybe £_00 for your troubles .
neutral	yours_sincerely

neutral	good ordering_process , but considering the cost of post and packing the delivery takes a very long time .
neutral	i did eventually get my game but had to go through extensive verification that is way too much than necessary , i can see why you have so much verification but this needs to be toned down significantly as it makes the checking out process very complicated and lengthy .
neutral	also i was supposed to get access to the doom beta and some tf0 steam items which i haven_'_t received .
neutral	i thought my tank was empty when in fact the sighting tube and fuel line were blocked , ordered a tank full but obviously when the delivery happened only half a tank could be delivered .
neutral	only charged for the half tank and got a refund on the overpayment .
neutral	the only_negative was that the delivery driver didn_'_t note why he had delivered less and made no reference to the sighting tube not working , technically not his fault but might have been something to be noted on the delivery slip .
neutral	die hrs seite ist mir zu unübersichtlich .
neutral	eingaben übers tablett sind oft fehlerhaft .
neutral	darstellung oft fehlerhaft .
neutral	buchungen waren bislang gut und korrekt .
neutral	hotelinfos waren bislang korrekt .
neutral	preisvorteile waren bisher sehr gering .
neutral	excellent service and cannot_fault .
neutral	however same mirror was £_00 cheaper_elsewhere , my fault !
neutral	after losing a significant_amount of weight , nearly 0 stone i decided to celebrate by buying a superdry t - shirt as many of my friends wear them and i wanted to join the gang so to speak .
neutral	i was a little disappointed that the biggest size is still a bit smaller than the size it says it is .
neutral	i was happy with my purchase and the quality of the item is great but its a little tight and also the arm_length is cut very short .
neutral	i will have to wait_till i lose a bit more to fit into it properly but the arm_length issue may still trouble me .
neutral	te flowered looked a little too green with few flowers .
neutral	not as the picture appeared
neutral	used the mobile service .
neutral	prices pretty good , nice website and appointments available quickly .
neutral	disappointingly though , the fitter installed wheel_balance_weights that fouled on the brake_caliper , which i did not notice until i drove the car to its planned mot_test the following_day .
neutral	i had to remove these myself on the way to the test and have the wheel rebalanced .
neutral	the price of the flaxmeal is excellent , the cheapest i have found for some while .
neutral	however , the delivery times are poor .
neutral	it takes a while for them to get to the order and then for it to come .
neutral	they seem to cover a huge product range and this must slow the process .
neutral	booking the service and service reception were very straightforward , the service itself was priced very competitively but although the service book was signed , there was no other paperwork to outline what had been done and no vehicle condition report .
neutral	there was no obvious way to secure a pick_up or hire car which is normally offered at the main_dealer .
neutral	value for money but not up to main_dealer standards .
neutral	the product overall is nice , although when coming to install i realise there are no wall plugs .... hello screws don_'_t go in walls alone , then there was not enough screws to fit the centre brace so it is up without now .
neutral	the blind works well and has nice components ... the slats are slightly thin but the size fits perfect .
neutral	i ordered a pair of bifocal sunglasses , wanting them for my holidays in a few weeks time .
neutral	the ordering_process was faffy - the webside system couldn_'_t cope with a prism on my prescription ( unlike_other website suppliers i have used without problems ) and when i called to order , the company would not take my word about my pupil_distance and demanded to contact my optician and then ( as she couldn_'_t verify for ' confidentiality reasons ') requiring me to post in a pair of old specs .
neutral	eventually the order was placed with a week or so before we travelled abroad so i was confident that they would arrive on time ( again previous suppliers have turned round in a week ).
neutral	sadly the holiday came and i had to go without my new glasses .
neutral	on return the glasses had arrived - and to be fair , they are perfectly ok - pity the process took so long .
neutral	need more affordable binding for all riders as not everyone can_afford top end bindings .
neutral	booking couldnt have been simpler , neither could pick_up however please_note :
neutral	price agreed through your company and actual ; price charged at the end of the rental has a £_000 difference !!
neutral	!
neutral	told i had accepted a vehicle upgrade , taken out extra iunsurance , vat had to be paid what seemed three_times over and final_insult was being charged £_00 for 0 digital bar missing from fuel_gauge which was exactly how i got the car after turning one corner leaving the airport .
neutral	the full_tank only held £_00 so how one tiny bar ( three bars make up a quarter of a tank so 00 in total from empty to full ) can equate to £_00 beggars_belief !
neutral	!
neutral	please contact me asap to explain the rental cost differences_between the price paid through yourselves online and the final price i was charged .
neutral	never got my full payment that i was offered diddled me out of £_00 when i sent a 0 month old_iphone_0s ....
neutral	this is the 0 or 0 th year i '_ve had my oil changed at national , the other times i received a receipt after the job was done .
neutral	this is usefull for my records , why not this time ?
neutral	i am still_waiting for the receipt to be sorted_out as promised in the reply , will post here when i am in receipt of it .
neutral	i '_ve given them long enough , my service records are incomplete , will phone customer_services .
neutral	update_: talked to customers services , they said talk to the branch , branch took my details including contact details and said would pass on to head_office to sort_out , and guess_what ...... no further contact .
neutral	my service records will have to have a gap in them .
neutral	so if its important to you make_sure they agree to print you off the receipt info before_proceeding .
neutral	the website was a little_unclear and the offers distracted you from your purpose of getting a pair of glasses .
neutral	i misunderstood so made the wrong purchase but did get a good service from staff and eventually got my two_pairs of glasses which seem of a good quality .
neutral	the mistake did cause a delay getting my second pair by several days .
neutral	i am still not sure where the overall price came from but i think they cost me £_00 - plus £_00 - but not sure !
neutral	booked the car in may , got to the airport then was told the car that we had booked was not available and was told that we had to take a smaller car , not good with 0kids 0adults 0hand luggage 0suitcases , good news after 00_minutes of stand off managed to find us a nice little upgrade convenient but appreciated , thanks
neutral	this is a good service , much_better_than butler fuels who could not be_bothered to call me back so lost the business .
neutral	the only problem , like a lot of modern businesses , is that they just turned_up randomly without calling , a week early in this case , hoping someone would be in !
neutral	they could do better in letting people know when their delivery is going to arrive ( i . e on what day and at what time ..), not just saying what week it may come in ( which was week out in my case ).
neutral	they also send out way too many mails before & after your purchase .
neutral	good value , prompt turn_around and will use them again but they are a long walk_away from perfect
neutral	i used to love dialtosave and made it my only option of purchase for international cards but now its been losing my customs due to technical_error which keeps on repeating all the time . as a busy man i found it a bit_annoying to contact customer service everytime .
neutral	the last time i use it on the 00 / 00 /_0000 the operator would not tell me how much credit i have after i '_ve topped_up and before it use to remember my password from the phone i use but now it kept asking me to enter it again . thats a bit_disappointing and i found it only going down instead of improving the service . i would have understood if it was a one off technical_error but it doesnt_seem so . communication does cut_off at some point too . i have noticed as well that during winter time customers get lower credit for the same amount of money use to purchase during summer time .
neutral	it has now reach a point that i will have no other choice than looking for another option .
neutral	customer service wise i would say excellent . the team we have behind has always acted professionally and fast . impeccable .
neutral	well_done to the customer service team . i think you deserve another 0_stars .
neutral	regards

neutral	was looking at gamola_golf website and spyed and pair of adidas adipure golf_shoes in black and white that i decided to buy ... already having a white pair and have been impressed at their comfort i thought a black and white pair would be a good purchase .
neutral	shoes arrived ... only to find that they were a white pair when they had been described as black and white ... much to my disappointment ... phoned and advised .... gamola said they had been incorrectly decribed in their web - site as black and white .... had to thereafter take the shoes into gamola_golf in aberdeen on00th may 0000 to return .... inconvenience_caused_by having to go into aberdeen ... park etc ... with no other reason for my trip .... staff at gamola_golf on phone and shop were polite and helpful
neutral	i '_ve been buying boxes for shipping artwork from kite_packaging for many_years , and the product is great .
neutral	for smaller orders the postage is significant though and perhaps a slower , cheaper option for delivery would be a good idea ...
neutral	very good site , excellent communication .... its just a pity the flowers couldn_'_t live up to the expectation .
neutral	the display looks_stunning on the site but in reality the flowers looked thrown together and were not arranged in any sort of pleasing fashion ; the centrepiece rose was very small and not even in the centre of the display ; it was hanging off to one side .
neutral	compared to previous flowers i have purchased from seranata this was a poor show .
neutral	at_least my wife liked them , more for the sentiment though i imagine !!!
neutral	!
neutral	we all make_mistakes and i made a mistake by sending an unedited print to pixum for printing .
neutral	the two photos i had on my desktop were similar and it was my fault that i clicked on the unedited one for sending .
neutral	i noticed it immediately after i sent it and quickly emailed them to tell them of my mistake .
neutral	i got an email back the next_day to say once you send the order it cannot be cancelled .
neutral	i would imagine local trading_standards would have something to say about that .
neutral	fortunately , it was only 00 pence but it could have been a more_expensive canvas etc .
neutral	therefore beware , make 000_% sure you send the correct images or you will still be charged .
neutral	apart_from that the quality of the product is very good
neutral	looks fine .
neutral	asked for the missing items on a thursday only told they were being sent on the tuesday after and got them on the wednesday would be good if they ' d been sent initially .
neutral	email said delivery on friday then monday nothing came then it was delivered on friday this was my first order from this company i know there can be unavoidable delays and i would use this company again
neutral	still_awaiting call back to see if replacement can be made ???????
neutral	at this rate it will have to be a refund shame
neutral	great quality as always but why pack chickens at the bottom to get squashed ?
neutral	first day ups made no attempt to deliver at all , then second day left at the front of my house where it could easily have been stolen .
neutral	bad_experiences with yodel on previous deliveries , thought ups would be better but i was wrong ; couldn_'_t contact their local_depot at all , couldn_'_t make changes to delivery on their site as i was supposed to be able to .
neutral	muscle_food support not much help either ; asked them to request delivery to a neighbour but didn_'_t get done .
neutral	i like ordering from muscle_food , but repeated problems with deliveries will put me off using them again .
neutral	if you order anything online from their website i cannot_fault them .
neutral	great prices and very quick delivery .
neutral	but when i called to enquire_about a product they took the information and said they would call me back , i was never called back .
neutral	i called again two_days_later and spoke to someone different , again they took the information and said they would call me back , guess_what , they never called .
neutral	i ended_up getting the part from somewhere_else .
neutral	emailed and checked that the replacement cd_player i was ordering was a straight swap / fix .
neutral	assured it was so purchased .
neutral	first prob .
neutral	came when car audio insisted it was dispatched but heg parcel co . insisted it was not .
neutral	car audi ignored emails , unavailable on phone .
neutral	eventually got through by phone , told not despatched as awaiting final parts - why then email me saying it was with a tracking no ?
neutral	finally arrived , problem it is compatible but in order to use it needs a ( large dia ) cable running from boot to console as uses non vehicle std din connections cannot not use existing cable .
neutral	to be fair spoke to car audio fitters ( none local ) who very helpful , said its not that difficult , again a but , am still trying to get sensible quote from local_fitters for doing it , they all say it is a big job .
neutral	i ordered two identical items which two_weeks_later were still outstanding .
neutral	i contacted clickshop and they said they ' d look into it .
neutral	00hrs_later no reply so i emailed them again .
neutral	after an ' investigation ' it turns_out they had no stock .
neutral	unfortunately they hadn_'_t thought to let_me know .
neutral	i could have one now and another whenever stock was received but there was no_indication when that might be .
neutral	i requested a refund which they agreed to .
neutral	they claim the refund was made immediately but ten days_later there is no refund showing on my account .
neutral	still chasing .
neutral	** updated to add that after this review was written the vendor discovered that a system error had indeed caused the original refund to fail .
neutral	it was resent and has now been received .
neutral	the vendor also sent a garlic twist by way of apology - which is appreciated .
neutral	hence i '_ve added one star to make three .
neutral	**
neutral	it took 00 messages back and forth to get this sorted .
neutral	who ' d have thought that buying 0 garlic crushers online could take up quite so much time !
neutral	quote process is good , but once the quote is accepted it gets annoying .
neutral	for example ; fields have character limits but it doesn_'_t tell you that .
neutral	grrr .
neutral	the state field is case sensitive .
neutral	took me several tries before i worked out the problem .
neutral	grrrr .
neutral	the site says i will have to print shipping label .
neutral	no shipping label available and it says it is deleted .
neutral	through chat contact i find out that the driver will bring the shipping label .
neutral	grrrrrr .
neutral	i have the sense to ask on the chat if the parcels can be sealed in advance .
neutral	no , i am told .
neutral	nowhere on the website does it say that .
neutral	grrrrrr .
neutral	nothing was that big a deal , but it was cumulatively all a bit_annoying .
neutral	great price given for an old bada os samsung wave , however it took 0 - days to acknowledge_receipt of the phone by c0p and another 0 - days for payment by them into my bank_account .
neutral	far better enjoyable_experience in my opinion .
neutral	although i can accept budget_airlines have to strip cost out of their operations to make profit , at_least easyjet show some civility and expertise in their dealings .
neutral	i would much rather travel easyjet than ryanair anyday , but unfortunately their ' cheap as chips ' competitor seems to have the edge on providing the flying public with more destinations to the sun !
neutral	at_least easyjet make me feel like a human_being rather_than an animal being hearded in a cattle pen !
neutral	quoted price changed 0 times whilst trying to book
neutral	ordered some swim trunks ...
neutral	available on line however out of stock
neutral	this has happened twice
neutral	good rate of exchange for pounds to euros but having placed the order on wednesday , transferred the money within minutes of receiving the confirmation on wednesday , had to chase them on friday to find out why the order was still sitting in pending , awaiting funds .
neutral	two phone_calls and the dispatched email finally arrived friday at 0 . 00pm .
neutral	euros turned_up on saturday .
neutral	not the best of service , and nervous when sending money .
neutral	would i use again , not sure yet .
neutral	this was my first order with the company and i had to contact ref a problem , they did rectify the problem and all is now good
neutral	regards

neutral	alamo atlantic drive lovely people but car booked for 00 . 00am not available until 0 . 00pm and we were one of about six customers in the same position .
neutral	the staff said saturdays are always chaotic !
neutral	information on true position was poor so we were kept there on a succession of broken_promises .
neutral	0 days to deliver ( this was stated when ordering ) but come on guys !
neutral	keep_up with the other_sites and deliver in 00 for no extra_cost
neutral	plus - delivery one item short !
neutral	brilliant service , not !
neutral	- it '_ll be sent on latter !
neutral	great stock control system they must have to
neutral	i don_'_t know - maybe it '_s just me - but any xbox game i order seems to spin and not run - due to the ' lovefilm ' sticker on the middle - maybe rethink this .
neutral	i ordered a yellow lens for my oakley radars .
neutral	it arrived quickly but wasn_'_t the shape i ' d ordered .
neutral	i checked the site and discovered the shape ( path ) was no_longer available to order .
neutral	fair_enough if it '_s no_longer made but no explanation had arrived with the order which was a random alternative shape i ' d had no say in choosing .
neutral	i think overall the prices and goods offered by homebase are pretty good , but having_shopped online then visited the store it seems like they are totally seperate entities . you would think a company this size would get their act_together and offer a unified front regardless of buying online or in shop .
neutral	really disappointed when asked for extra money for flight when promised no extra fees .
neutral	hence only bboked room and transfers .
neutral	i like the fact that my credit_card was not charged until the items where shipped .
neutral	however it took a month for one of three items to clear back order even_though on the initial order it was marked as being in stock .
neutral	using the contact message page in their website i asked what the expectations were on the shipping date two_weeks after the initial order .
neutral	i did not get a reply .
neutral	on the fourth week i followed up with telephone_call to be told that it was being shipped the next_day .
neutral	i did like that the shipper was interlink whom can provide a one hour delivery window via_email and text_message .
neutral	however communication was poor by bedfordshire_bbq centre that the order would be delayed .
neutral	i do not mind the delay .. as long as i am told that there will be one .
neutral	so two out three aspects were good .
neutral	the free products seem great but if you put them in and then check with the shipping it will add $ 0 . 00 or 00 cents for the " free " item .
neutral	do you really think a sample_pack ( 0 pills ) really costs anything when shipping 0 lbs of protein or 00 lbs of drinks ?
neutral	bull .
neutral	the 0 %_off competitors preices is nice if you have all day to commpare every_single product . believe it or not i like the site ok but even when i inquired_about how a free_sample really costs money they send back an almost pissed_off response about how cheap all their stuff is and how it really costs and other nonesense .
neutral	also i have had trouble with shipping and even just paying for the orders .
neutral	it seems like an amazing site but just be wary and check it out for yourself .
neutral	i know they have to make money but i know for a fact the expired stuff is pure profit and the shipping charges are the real shot in the dark .
neutral	the last time we needed to fly was when our car broke_down in france .
neutral	we had to get flights home the cheapest and quickest way possible .
neutral	easyjet was the cheapest airline to fly the closest to home .
neutral	in this case liverpool , where we live in north manchester .
neutral	the flights for 0 of us with 0 bags cost 000_euro , which was just the standard easyjet deal .
neutral	we got the feeling we paid more than half the plane put_together though .
neutral	the only_criticism is easyjet had the seats but insist on charging high fares for last_minute or they would fly empty rather_than sell the seats .
neutral	on the plane was ok . everything is extra_cost but that is expected from a budget_airline .
neutral	the plane left on time and arrived slightly early .
neutral	i would say you get what you pay for , because if we had booked these flights early like so many do , you get no_frills for a cheap flight .
neutral	they run them like buses , but again thats to be expected to make them cost_effective .
neutral	its unfortunate we had to book late simply because our car had to stay in france until it could be returned home .
neutral	the website is ok to a point i had difficulty in making the payment .
neutral	but my major_issue is
neutral	the goods where dispatched over a weekago and as yet not received
neutral	mike oneill
neutral	i use bt landline and broadband and the suppport service is good but download_speeds for broadband as slow .
neutral	the ship , and the crossing itself , were trouble_free ....
neutral	my ' gripe ' is that when we started the booking , the ' fee ' was £_00 approximately ... partway through the booking , the fee escalated , with no
neutral	reason being given , to £_00 approximately .. if i hadn_'_t been in such a need to book this quickly , i would probably have looked elsewhere ... the
neutral	fee should have remained the same as at the start of the procedure ..
neutral	i ' d ' like ' a refund , and may well pursue this with ' aferry ', unless of
neutral	course ' you ', ( as in ' this ' survey ) can forward my thoughts to them , and ' they ' will contact me .. ?
neutral	mike crook .... 0000 000 0000 or 00000_000000 ... any day , anytime after 00 . 00 am please ......
neutral	good response , but disappointed after ordering 0 , agreed to accept
neutral	0 pair but not what i ordered .
neutral	care and attention to detail needed
neutral	for new and sealed products , chaos_cards is great .
neutral	for their single cards however , hit and miss .
neutral	they are described as near_mint - mint " straight from booster " , i '_ve purchased a few_times from them , i gave them the benefit of my doubt the first time , receiving some cards in a played condition ( peeling , creases ) , after the second time receiving bad condition cards i probably_won_'_t be ordering again .
neutral	apart_from this , dispatchment is fast , some prices are great and the online store is huge .
neutral	customer service has since been in touch and have declared that this was a rare mishap , i think 0_stars is fair .
neutral	recipient liked the flowers very much .
neutral	thankyou .
neutral	million_times better_than the delivery before .
neutral	sending items out promptly is no problem for broadbandbuyer .
neutral	the problem starts with support : emails taking days to be replied to ( if at all ) and not all emails being read .
neutral	getting an rma_number is a bit_slow .
neutral	finally got here after 0 - 0_weeks .
neutral	concealment was very good very happy with the free_gifts .
neutral	but not so happy that it took so long to get here but all and all i do live in a country where it is neither accepted or really even tolerated .
neutral	everyone does it still so who_cares
neutral	tried to change delivery address and this was confirmed on an e_mail package was still delivered to other address when we complained we were told that we could not change delivery address
neutral	as stated above so_far so good but as everything is fresh its hard to make any kind of critique .
neutral	tyreleader show as a . co . uk website which leads you to believe that they are a uk company .
neutral	they ' re not .
neutral	they are a french company who ships from other european country .
neutral	that said , shipping is fast and the good quality goods do arrive , to be fair probably quicker_than they would from a uk company .
neutral	so no real problem , i just don_'_t like foreign companies using a uk web address , been caught by chinese knockoff seller doing that in past and it just feels dishonest , hence low score .
neutral	i really like the home_trial but when i finally placed an order my glasses took several weeks to arrive .
neutral	i know this is clearly_stated in the delivery information but with some highstreet opticians able to complete orders in under an_hour i expect a faster turnaround .
neutral	when buying my item it said , free delivery to uk ,. but later was ask for £_00 . 00 to ship to belfast .. did not say free only to uk_mainland at the time .
neutral	ordered the plaza bathroom_suite with left - hand shower bath , wastes and " cube " basin / bath_mixer_taps at the end of april on the last day of the current promotion ( the suite has since gone back on sale at the same price so bear this in mind if you are rushing to order to meet an offer end - date !).
neutral	ordered it over the phone and was promised a confirmation_email , which never arrived ( despite chasing twice and correcting the email address they had on file ).
neutral	payment in full was taken at the point of order .
neutral	the next_day i received a call to say the shower - screen was out of stock and wouldn_'_t be available until the middle of may .
neutral	i was offered a cheaper shower - screen ( minus the fixed towel_rail ) but at no discount (!)
neutral	which i declined .
neutral	i asked whether the other items could be delivered earlier but was told i would have to pay an additional delivery charge so i declined this too .
neutral	the week before delivery i received another call to say the item was still out of stock and wouldn_'_t be in until the end of may and they could arrange delivery first week in june .
neutral	the week before the new delivery date i received a dispatch email ( my first email from better_bathrooms and any proof of order except for my credit_card statement the previous month ) saying the goods had been sent to the delivery company .
neutral	the delivery company ( m & s based in warrington ) called me to arrange delivery and i was told it would be an " am " delivery , which meant 0am - 00pm .
neutral	by 00am on delivery day nothing had arrived so i decided to call to find out what time i might expect it .
neutral	the man i spoke to put me on hold and contacted the delivery driver , who said it would be around 0 :_00pm as it was the last delivery on his list .
neutral	i wasn_'_t best pleased i had been waiting in all morning for no reason .
neutral	the suite arrived well_packaged on a pallet and the driver was happy to wait while i checked everything on the list .
neutral	everything was present and all the boxes seemed to be undamaged .
neutral	so_far so good .
neutral	once i had carried everything inside i opened the boxes and found the wc_pan had a mark on the front under the glaze , and the shower_panel bracket was bent in one corner , so had to call better_bathrooms .
neutral	i was asked to email photos of the items , and was told once they had been reviewed , replacements would be sent out .
neutral	i emailed these over and waited to hear back .
neutral	the next_day i hadn_'_t received a call or response by email so called customer_services again .
neutral	the girl i spoke to said the new items had already been dispatched and would arrive tomorrow but she couldn_'_t give me a time .
neutral	fortunately i was due to be in all day but had i not called them i would never have known .
neutral	the replacements arrived and all was fine .
neutral	am now in the process of fitting the suite and all the items seem to be well made , they came with all the right fittings and full instructions , so no_complaints there .
neutral	the " cube " taps have very sharp_edges so bear this in mind if you have children , i will need to find a safe cover to stop anyone slicing their limbs open !
neutral	i should point out that better_bathrooms customer_services are very polite , which makes a real difference .
neutral	unfortunately i have always had to wait at_least 0 minutes to get through , which doesn_'_t come cheap on an 0000 number .
neutral	the flowers arrived late in the day ( although just within the delivery window ).
neutral	generally the flowers themselves looked nice , but the single_rose did not look fresh .
neutral	we ordered some stone floor sealer from ffx but they sent stone floor cleaner by mistake .
neutral	however , an e_- mail sorted things out and we have now received the correct item and will hopefully soon receive a refund for the postage cost to return the original item .
neutral	i ordered this tool on line everything_went ok i received it on time the recept was ok when i checked my account the money was being taken by another company i phoned my card service they said it had been processed wrong they then froze my account .
neutral	iam now waiting the outcome
neutral	did what they were contracted to do .
neutral	do not agree with the friction rating on the star system .
neutral	no friction should be the two star_rating .
neutral	it should be just how they do things .
neutral	0_stars and above should be for great service .
neutral	whilst i have received payment via bank_account for transactions without_any fuss , i was very surprised that you are more than twice as long in acknowledging , processing and paying out than webuydvds .
neutral	it was a really lengthy process and i whilst i would recommend you to people who could_afford to wait longer , as you pay slightly_higher amounts overall ( not always ), if they want their money quicker and are prepared to forgo a few_quid , i would recommend they use webuydvd who '_s two cheques were with me before you had even finished processing my first order and they were collected only 0 day before yours .. so 0_stars from me .
neutral	room for improvement in your processing times .
neutral	originally ordered furniture expecting a pre_- christmas delivery .
neutral	was then given a last possible worse case delivery date of 00th of january .
neutral	not expecting anywhere_else to do any better , i accepted this date hoping for an earlier delivery as the paperwork said it would probably be before that date .
neutral	in the end i was given the 00th_january as the delivery date , which is later than the worse case given !
neutral	the goods arrived on the day undamaged , so that was a good point .
neutral	not impressed with the 0000 number which cost me a fortune on my mobile_phone .
neutral	also not impressed with receiving advertising texts , which i do not want .
neutral	i can '_t stop them because my contract wont let_me send stop to the number provided .
neutral	please stop sending me email and phone messages !
neutral	at first , i found hostelworld very useful .
neutral	you can see pictures of the hostel beforehand , read_reviews , view maps and you even get guides to the city you ' re visiting .
neutral	there are also a lot of search_filters , which are helpful .
neutral	it still is a useful site but now there is a lot of competition .
neutral	for this reason , i think the ( almost negligible ) booking_fee should probably go , as some sites don_'_t charge it .
neutral	for me though , the most_important_thing is the hostel reviews section .
neutral	it is important that we understand the experiences of other_travellers and it is here that the site lacks .
neutral	while they are soon introducing more categories to review the hostels on , you can only choose between 0 smiley_faces on each , which correspond to increments of 00 %.
neutral	this means that you may like 0 hostel more than another but they get the same score from you .
neutral	there isn_'_t enough room to play with to distinguish , score - wise .
neutral	next comes the actual review you leave .
neutral	you are asked to leave a comment for the hostel to see but this is shown on the hostelworld site ( which isn_'_t necessarily apparent ).
neutral	so , you might have questions / suggestions for the hostel , which you put here , and these unwittingly get posted to the reviews page .
neutral	oh , and it isn_'_t previewed beforehand and can '_t be edited / deleted !
neutral	the review section needs to have a box which asks for a review for the benefit of other_travellers - that gets posted to the site and makes it clear that it will be , and a separate section for comments / questions for the hostel management .
neutral	otherwise , half the reviews are unhelpful to 0 party or the other and often seem silly when being read by prospective bookers .
neutral	it should also be possible to make it untraceable by the hostel , if we desire .
neutral	the site promised an additional urban_industry branded lock n seel box with every pair of the jordan 0 black cements .
neutral	i ordered 0 pairs and received 0 additional boxes .
neutral	bought products from lyco direct were sent by fed - ex next_day arrived at 00 . 00 next_morning .
neutral	the box was a bit bashed but the sender had packed the items well so no_problems there .
neutral	is the first time i have used fed - ex and sadly the last judging_by the reviews .
neutral	was a good fast service though
neutral	very pushy with insurance_cover sales staff need to know no means no .
neutral	good selection of items
neutral	i created a problem - lost log in details and change of email address .
neutral	eventually found email address to contact you .
neutral	first time completed your questionaaire - was returned not enough information askd to complete it again .
neutral	cut and paste previous one accepted .
neutral	i appreciate electronic communication gets rid of the pesky customer but sometimes a conversation is needed .
neutral	why do you need my email address below .
neutral	you sent me the bloody email in the first place .
neutral	when my delivery arrived , one box heavily damaged with several broken_tiles .
neutral	i cannot_believe these blinds didn_'_t come with screws or raw_plugs !!!
neutral	what a joke .
neutral	other than that blinds were ok .
neutral	price perfect , delivery excellent , but fit to stem of motor drive , a bit to tight and was unable to push right home .
neutral	texture of brush is a bit too soft , maybe i didn_'_t see any option for a harder texture .
neutral	but thay left it out side and i didn_'_t get the chocolate
neutral	it would appear bt are offering me much slower speeds than advertised .
neutral	plus they claim that as an ' oap ' i have been using up to 00 gb '_s in the first two_days
neutral	of the month .
neutral	??
neutral	- when i have been away and in hospital !
neutral	however i will await the monthly_bill .
neutral	geoff .
neutral	initially things went well , good communication and despatch .
neutral	the goods were faulty and returned the same day .
neutral	email response was a bit frosty to the returned item and a refund took two_weeks after repeated_emails asking why no refund , the postage yet to be received is to be posted by cheque ......
neutral	potentially good but let themselves down by poor admin .
neutral	arranged for the flowers to be delivered on a specific day as special_occasion .
neutral	towards the end of the day i chased ( via_email as you can '_t speak to anyone ) to be told that due to technical_issues they would be delivered the following_day .
neutral	a refund was offered or the flowers plus chocolates as a ggw .
neutral	the flowers arrived the following_day mid pm by a driver who left them inside the porch .
neutral	some of the key flowers where going brown at the ends .
neutral	not good enough taking into account the cost .
neutral	thank_you for your quick_turnaround , got the product within a few_days , not an easy website to navigate and end up at the check out .
neutral	sunflowers were very poor , tiny un opened buds that just died
neutral	this has taken 0 months , npower had not released the payment which caused the lateness
neutral	quidco should of picked_up on this .
neutral	the web service was faultless but when i rang the branch to arrange a fitting time the member of staff was totally_unhelpful and somewhat rude in his manner .
neutral	decent car , decent service upon_arrival and drop - off , just fail to see how & why they can take a payment of r0000 to cover refueling on return when the average tank takes r000 ?
neutral	extra bank charges for the charge + the credit on the difference ( two_weeks post return ) don_'_t leave the best taste in the mouth ...
neutral	meats are great quality and have used a few_times but there was a missing item this time which was annoying .
neutral	unwilling to send as postage would have been too high for the company so credited my account with the price .
neutral	would rather have the item though
neutral	0 to 0 working_days quoted for delivery , item still not here 0 days after ordering .
neutral	not too impressed ......
neutral	had to wait nearly 00_mins for the driver to arrive on arrival at airport .
neutral	car appeared to have clocked some mileage on return .
neutral	would not use again .
neutral	the delivery process worked ( it arrived ) but was totally different from any i '_ve_used before and seemed like a lot of trouble .
neutral	i told them the delivery address but they had to call to confirm , i missed the call and had to call back ... long wait ...
neutral	this stuff really should be sorted_out electronically .
neutral	i get that they want to be sure the delivery can take place but its a pain .
neutral	delivery happened , delivery guys left .
neutral	opened box and there were a few dents in the corner and edges .
neutral	not really bad , but not great .
neutral	too_busy to go through a returns process so just getting on with using it .
neutral	very very expensive service .
neutral	not even up to the standards
neutral	some of your removal companies are far too cheap the how can they quote under £_000 . 00 to move a 0 bedroom house over 000_miles .
neutral	other_firms quoted decent price .
neutral	in the end we did not use any of the companies i went with a local company to where we are moving too .
neutral	we had bikes on our roof , and in dover port we were told to go to a cabin to change our booking .
neutral	the admin_fee was over half what we had paid for the return crossing .
neutral	it was explained that we were now a high vehicle and had to park in a different location .
neutral	we queued up in the lorry / caravan queue , only to be redirected to the car deck .
neutral	so we paid £_00 to park exactly where we would have parked .
neutral	i have never had this problem with another ferry company who are normally very accomodating .
neutral	i thought the original booking had bikes on it , but obviously made a mistake ( less_than £ 0 ) and was made to pay £_00 .
neutral	this will put me off using the company in the future .
neutral	my health is greatly_improved & i have saved a lot of money compared to smoking , but my advice would be to buy the best quality products from the start , to avoid_disappointment ?
neutral	0 doors ordered , 0 plain and 0 with glazed panels .
neutral	quality of doors fne but the glazed ones had the wrong shaped glazing .
neutral	the flowers arrived in a box , they had fallen over inside and so were completely squashed on one side .
neutral	it was not the best bouquet i had ever_seen .
neutral	honestly , i wish i ' d just picked_up a bunch from the local co op , they would have been just as nice but a whole lot cheaper .
neutral	items that were shown as in stock were not , this resulted_in my order sitting in their system not being dispatched .
neutral	of course noone bothered to tell me this ; only by checking the website myself and having to ring them did i eventually find this out .
neutral	i think it was well over a week ( possibly two ) until my order did get dispatched which is comical considering their line ' over 00_% orders dispatched same day '.
neutral	and don_'_t get me started on the ' one - click ' name .
neutral	however , the items i ordered were great quality and as cheap as i could_find them on the web .
neutral	personally though , i '_m not sure it was worth the hastle .
neutral	my initial_impressions were not great as the staff at pick_up were grumpy , unfriendly , the car was very dirty on the outside despite only have 0 miles on the clock , the inside still had the plastic covers on covered in mud , the aerial hadn_'_t been screwed in yet and the attendant on pick_up was reluctant to let_me check for damage , which made me nervous .
neutral	the saving_grace was the staff_member when i dropped_off the vehicle .
neutral	she was so friendly and helpful , the exact_opposite of the staff who were there when i picked_up the vehicle .
neutral	if she would have been the pick_up attendant i would have given 0 - 0_stars and if the grumpy people were there when i dropped_off i would have given 0 - 0_stars .
neutral	delivered promptly however the labels on the bottle are coming away from the bottle and that should not really be happening .
neutral	i have bought this particular brandy ( asbach ) from other_retailers previously and never really had this problem .
neutral	this is a present for a family_member and its looks as if i have printed the labels off the internet and put them on myself !
neutral	does not look particularly professional .
neutral	re - delivery should have been on friday 00th but didn_'_t ' happen , waited in all day .
neutral	i accept that it is the busy_christmas_period but this should have been taken into account when e_- mailing re - delivery date .
neutral	i received an offer for £_00 off via facebook .
neutral	i had to spend £_00 to get the discount .
neutral	once i had obtained this in my basket , the voucher_code would not work and i received a message_saying the basket monetary_value was not enough to apply voucher .
neutral	other than that , good service .
neutral	well_packaged and quick delivery .
neutral	as a local resident i want to support local suppliers as an active ctc member . that said good customer_care is critical
neutral	my order wasn_'_t initial processed and i had to remind global_bike .
neutral	i now have the parts and i '_m happy .
neutral	hi have been using interparcel quite often , i have found there actual staff quite good .
neutral	but the delivery companies that they use not so good .
neutral	hermes for instance one that they use are not very proffessional .
neutral	they have people that pick_up parcels in there car then store them in there garage then hand them to hermes vans .
neutral	the trouble is you get a card from the hermes collector with a tracking_number which is never ever valid i then have to go to interparcel usualy by phone to get info very very annoying !!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	at faro_airport the rep was rude to a number of travellers , and there were some delays in many transfers .
neutral	on the return , the pickup was late by 00_minutes and the driver drove as if chased by demons .
neutral	an unusually poor experience from resorthoppa .
neutral	as yet no apologies or explanations .
neutral	let_me start by saying i would love to and would have given this site 0_stars .... a few_months back
neutral	been using this website for a few_years_now but since update its become a nightmare if it wasn_'_t for the live help staff i would find another courier .
neutral	' if it aint broke don_'_t try to fix it '
neutral	they missed the next_day delivery but did ring to warn me .
neutral	from a work point of view , very annoying as men were scheduled to install , but at_least they rang .
neutral	putting in my registration tyre_shopper said i had a red vw_polo whereas it is a toyota_yaris verso .
neutral	then after putting in all my order details , i was confronted with tyre_shopper '_s " unexpected error " page and " please return to our home page and try again ".
neutral	i did , seems ok , proof of the pudding will be if all goes well when i call at their chosen branch next monday .
neutral	after next days i got the parcel but i paid 00 pound for tax !
neutral	!
neutral	next time can your company write down the parcel value under 00 pound ?
neutral	?
neutral	and the delivery time for taiwan it not 0 - 0 working_days it over 0days !
neutral	!
neutral	starting to seriously loose ground on the accuracy of search_results compared to bing
neutral	can '_t really complain_about buying features ... but the fees for selling are a rip_off now .
neutral	well i got my tickets after i was charged extra for using my own paper and toner !
neutral	as well as this i was also charged admin to use an_automated_system .
neutral	this company is laughing all the way to the bank .
neutral	if i had the option if going else where i would gave taken it .
neutral	these_people are annoying and i will avoid using them again if i can .
neutral	i purchased a motherboard from their ebay shop recently .
neutral	the description said the motherboard was new and that it came with  manual ,  0 x s - ata data leads ,  0 x sli bridge ,  backplate and  support disk .
neutral	it became_apparent that this wasn_'_t the case when i was called and told that the motherboard was used and may not come with all the accessories .
neutral	i took the on the spot decision to go_ahead with the purchase and see what was actually missing when it arrived .
neutral	i was able to source the missing items from ebay , but obviously this was extra_expense that i wasn_'_t expecting when i purchased the item .
neutral	as the price was cheaper_than i had seen elsewhere , when i initially saw the listing , i was expecting it to be refurbished , but when i saw that the listing said ' new ' i quickly purchased it .
neutral	my issue isn_'_t with the service , they were quick to call and point out the mistake and the item was delivered quickly .
neutral	my issue is with the ebay_listing .
neutral	it was listed as new when it should have been listed as used and incomplete .
neutral	a standard specification was used in the listing and didn_'_t take into account of the items missing .
neutral	i would buy from lambdatek again , but probably not from their ebay shop .
neutral	i had no problem with the flowers and balloon and card i ordered but on the card i wrote a little caption for the one i sent it too and i received the package and there was nothing on the card but other than that everything else was good
neutral	i used tshirt_studio because it '_s the top_rated service of its kind on trustpilot .
neutral	i ordered the t - shirt with express delivery and it was very fast indeed - i received it before 00pm the next_day .
neutral	however , i had used a custom design for the t - shirt , and because some of the colours came out a bit darker on the t - shirt , a lot of the details in the original image were lost .
neutral	also , as a result of the image transfer process , the t - shirt looked slightly faded already when it arrived .
neutral	i would have appreciated some advice on the colours to use in my original image to make_sure it came out exactly how i ' d like .
neutral	then again , it was a gift to someone and they were thoroughly pleased with the result .
neutral	i would use them again , but not before trying out other services .
neutral	can '_t complain_about the price - after a bit of online research we settled on a highly - reveiwed mattress and this was the best price we could_find .
neutral	when the mattress was delivered , the delivery guys refused to take the item to the destination bedroom , instead leaving it in the hallway .
neutral	also , we ' d had emails from mattress online telling us to inspect the mattress before accepting delivery too and the delivery guy was visibly annoyed when my wife wanted to take a moment or two to inspect the mattress before signing for it .
neutral	when you rent a car through this company it is not mentioned that on collection you will be charged a full take of petrol whether you use it or not .
neutral	even after 00 days and numerous journeys across the island it is difficult to use 0 / 0 a tank as the cars are so effiicient !
neutral	petrol is also very cheap but they charge a marked up amount for the tank .
neutral	also the pick_up point is a 0 min shuttle_bus_ride from the airport
neutral	no matter what they say on website you are also only covered 0rd_party and if you want full comp then you have to pay when you collect an additional circa 00 euro .
neutral	that said good quality cars and helpful staff
neutral	i bought some zinc tape , as i bought a case load ( 00 ) i expected it to come in a box , however it turned_up in an express pack , so i wasnt delighted with the postage as the tape could easily have been damaged .
neutral	i would understand it coming in an express pack if i didnt buy it by the case ?
neutral	?
neutral	the intial service was fine , and i had no problem in paying for the product , i have not tried_contacting the company and this review was the only after care provided by the company .
neutral	so in future i will probably look_elsewhere when looking for my supplies .
neutral	first order .
neutral	a0 and a0 folded boxes .
neutral	when they arrived via night_freight a majority of the a0 boxes were ripped due to poor packaging .
neutral	no a good advert for a packaging company !
neutral	!
neutral	however - after sales very good and replacement boxes delivered next_day foc .
neutral	i '_ve bought from lenstore a few_times before and found their service to be both efficient and reliable .
neutral	however i was curious to compare with other online_retailers and did find cheaper_alternatives .
neutral	rather_than abandon lenstore i did a search for a discount_voucher and discovered a new customer discount of 00_% i . e .
neutral	not available to me as an existing customer .
neutral	i simply signed_up for a new account and got the discount .
neutral	it would be nice to see more competitive_pricing or more discount_codes for loyal_customers and not just for new customers .
neutral	the flowers in the bouquet i received were not worth the money paid i '_m afaid . half of them were chrysanthemums which are very cheap flowers anyway & on day 0 i have thrown several dead flowers away . not what you expect for the price paid so will not be using this company again .
neutral	i ordered a few items with jules_b for the first time .
neutral	i '_m glad with what i received but commuication was realy bad .
neutral	i had to phone twice to get info about my order and shipping ...
neutral	it '_s been a long process and still not completely finished .
neutral	started in april finished in october problems with long lead in times and then parts not as ordered and damaged on arrival .
neutral	saga with getting the correct glass to fit the windows but all tradesmen involved have been first_rate and the finished product is excellent .
neutral	struggled to get the aeg fridge_freezer that we were after , and kitchen_appliances 000 were helpful when taking the order where others weren_'_t .
neutral	it was a good price , although not the cheapest we found on the web , but we thought it looked a professional_outfit , and assumed that aeg would vet suppliers .
neutral	there was a bit of a delay as it was coming from germany , although communication was always as a result of us prompting for updates .
neutral	about three_weeks after paying the fridge_freezer , which actually requires some on site construction , was delivered and assembled by a separate courier company who could not have cared less ( amazing for such an expensive product ).
neutral	clearly used to just dumping items and clearing off .
neutral	screws went in threaded ( in a couple of instances so they actually scratched the doors on opening and closing ), units not lined_up , doors not lined_up , one foot bent in the process , and the top panel scratched due to repeated sloppy attempts to fit .
neutral	having compiled a pdf of fitting disasters and sending onto kitchen_appliances 000 we are still_waiting for a response .
neutral	we have given up on the courier company .
neutral	have taken it apart and refitted ourselves so that we can turn on and get using the thing that we paid for fives weeks_ago .
neutral	all in all a mixed experience .
neutral	iv had a full set of tyres_fitted to my focus rs with no_problems in the past but i had 0 tyres fotted to my girlfriends mini and im quite dossapointed with how the fitter treated the alloy_wheels .
neutral	he was very rough with the wheels .
neutral	he has scratched the inside of one of the wheels and with them being matte finish wheels cannot be polished out .
neutral	luckily it only the inside which can only be seen when you look theough the wheel .
neutral	but that said i look after both of our cars and the insides of the wheels are kept as clean as possible .
neutral	i found the service in terms of price very good , however the delivery took a while .
neutral	the website says most orders are dispatched in 00_hours , and you are updated etc_etc , however , the ordder was placed on 00th_june and i heard_nothing withing the 00hours , so i had to email to chase up .
neutral	i was then informed they were waiting for a delivery .
neutral	it went well from then on though .
neutral	engaged them for a homebuyers survey .
neutral	first surveyor was booked for an appointment 0_weeks_later .
neutral	this was changed for a more appropriate appointment .
neutral	however , report took over a week to be made available .
neutral	laser_printer arrived during the 0 day estimated delivery range albeit on the last day of this .
neutral	i did call to enquire_about a lack of email confirmation that the printer was being shipped on time and was put through to a polite but rather lack - lustre and seemingly disinterested customer service employee who explained that they had no further information on my order other than what i could see myself when logged in to the " my orders " section of their website which i found quite astonishing .
neutral	the printer was also shipped with a 0 pin eu mains_lead and a flimsy_plastic uk_plug that would have meant cutting off the sealed mains_lead plug myself , rewiring it to the 0 pin uk_plug and immediately invalidating my warranty into the bargain !
neutral	as luck would have it my previous printer was from the same manufacturer so the problem for me was solved .
neutral	this was possibly not wae +' s fault but nonetheless remains deeply unimpressive !
neutral	i never see the flowers so i can '_t comment on them .
neutral	what you do need to remember is that if you order more than once you automatically receive a 00_%_discount on your next order and may get other discounts via ' petal points '.
neutral	the eflorist order process does not remind you of these things so it is easy to forget and spend more than you need to .
neutral	i bought a used focus ( new shape ) from jennings_stockton last october .
neutral	i am very pleased with the car ( titanium model ). quality and comfort is excellent ,
neutral	no_problems with car but as yet but no aftersales feedback queries from the dealer !
neutral	had to ring 0 times to get my warranty documents ,
neutral	wonder_if i will get a reminder when the service is due !!!
neutral	!
neutral	we just wanted to buy a chest of drawers - what we didn_'_t want was a salesman who assumed we would want to pay £_00 for express delivery when standard delivery was free .
neutral	he also assumed we would want to buy some ' special ' wax_polish for £_00 . 00 and felt pads to protect the carpet .
neutral	the salesman appeared to be shocked and questioned our judgement when we asked_him to remove all these extras from the invoice before we were prepared to let him have our credit_card_details .
neutral	the day after we made the purchase we had a phone_call to say they could make the delivery later that same week - so why would we have paid £_00 for express delivery .
neutral	this was followed_by a succession of emails and text_messages which was completely unnecessary - we only needed to be told once .
neutral	the delivery men , however , were great .
neutral	i am a bit disappointed that you didn_'_t have these charts in stock when you advertised them .
neutral	very slow delivery , i paid for next_day it took a week , paid on friday got delivered friday .
neutral	i did get a refund on the shipping cost which they were very nice about .
neutral	"................
neutral	not to bad , but they was off with their timing about the transfer from one bank to another .
neutral	they said the transfer was complete , but it took another two_days to find my money in the account .
neutral	( another wasted_journey to the bank ) rather
neutral	service overall ( products , shipping ) feels great and professional .
neutral	however , accessing the website from romania is sometimes a pain , mostly conisisting in ( very ) slow page load time .
neutral	computer and internet_connection are not a factor here , it '_s due to how the website is set_up .
neutral	google and other_companies have made experiments about this which showed that website performance is correlated with revenue per user , so i think an improvement in this area would largely benefit the company .
neutral	bought some flowers as a gift and although they were happy with them , i wasn_'_t .
neutral	didn_'_t look like the picture and actually had parts missing .
neutral	i have emailed them so i look_forward to their response .
neutral	i ordered a pair of boots , these were not available in my local ecco shoe store and they seemed to be what i wanted .
neutral	the boots arrived quickly and were the size i had ordered .
neutral	unfortunately although i have several pairs of ecco_shoes and therefore know my ecco shoe_size these were very narrow and did not fit .
neutral	i returned the boots but was not happy that ecco charged £ 0 postage for returning shoes .
neutral	i thought this excessive as this an internet service and people will inevitably want to exchange or return goods so i will probably not use them again .
neutral	i always rate juno , however once more the records were delivered in a roomy box lacking care and attention , meaning £_00 + records all broke their spines , the records were in their covers and broken through .
neutral	many record shops pack records separate to take account of this .
neutral	i also think that orders over £_00 should be free_postage like all competition , whilst juno charge and add a extra £ 0 for insurance on top .
neutral	site was easy to navigate .
neutral	i found what i wanted in a reasonable amount of time .
neutral	i completed the purchase without_any_issues and the product arrived as stated
neutral	this was a present for my daughter so i could not possibly give any kind of review
neutral	it '_s great but to be fair i will not rush to use them again as the phone i sent back was pretty_much brand_new .
neutral	card had huge mistakes due to clash with the portuguese keyboard .
neutral	will let you know if it works
neutral	the emails regarding what '_s happening is a nice_touch .
neutral	but to have them in order would have been even better .
neutral	i mean , why did i receive an email at 0000hours on saturday stating that they had " been delivered " and then receive a phone_call from the delivery driver at 0000hours asking me where the property was ???
neutral	and then , as there was no one in , i had to tell him to leave them in the green house ?
neutral	!
neutral	yeah , good service !
neutral	the doors are good quality , hardware is over priced and delivery is slow , quoted me 0 - 0 working_days but took 0
neutral	little to expensive with lazy dellivery .. already found heaper and quicker as getlenses .... so nothing extraordinary from your service ... unfortunetully ill be change your service
neutral	delivery was fast and on time , only problem was i had around 00 tiles broken which was not pleasing !
neutral	i was really worried the product would not turn_up on time when we clearly specified during the order when we needed it , if we were told at the time of order there was a risk of delivery we would never have ordered .
neutral	we have always experienced next_day delivery with screwfix on all products we have oredered .
neutral	there was no way to change the delivery address on the shop so the product went to the wrong place .
neutral	as a result this cost us more to send it to the right place .
neutral	the problem with web shops is their infexibility .
neutral	having read the ts_&_cs on this review i realise it is meaningless as the order was processed over a week_ago and therefore is outside the terms of the review .
neutral	ordered no problem .
neutral	got a discount on postage .
neutral	even better .
neutral	however they use fedex for delivery .
neutral	the instructions were given to leave the parcel in a safe_place behind the recycling .
neutral	many other_companies do this with no problem .
neutral	however the delivery man did not leave the parcel .
neutral	i rang three_times and the person on phone assured me he would leave the parcel .
neutral	three_times he didn_'_t .
neutral	we work two hours travelling away from home .
neutral	this was very annoying .
neutral	only received parcel as by chance the delivery man came first thing saturday as we were leaving to go away for weekend .
neutral	no apology from him .
neutral	telephone staff just said they didn_'_t know why he would not leave it .
neutral	had to buy other food in mean time thus changing dogs ' diet and so the two pups got a dicky tummy .
neutral	not impressed !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	good service overall but rental car website offered insurance to cover insurance_excess which turned_out not to be valid for europcar purposes - i then had to take out europcar insurance to cover insurance_excess .
neutral	rental car have agreed to refund their insurance for this ( have not yet received refund but should be done in next_day or so ) but this was unwanted hassle for what could be construed as misleading booking through the website .
neutral	having read the reviews went_ahead and ordered a canvas_print on 00th_august_0000 and paid extra for next_day delivery .
neutral	didn_'_t receive an email next_day so emailed them enquiring as to when my order would be dispatched as i needed it for a client .
neutral	no response so phoned .
neutral	spoke to a chap_who said i would receive it today , 00th .
neutral	now 0 . 00 , no delivery , phoned number on website 0 times , no reply .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	went_onto facebook and no updates this year , which raises further concerns .
neutral	wondering_if i will see my canvas at all now .
neutral	p . s .
neutral	didn_'_t arrive , now have to go to client without the canvas i ' d_hoped to give them .
neutral	let_down_badly by canvasprints online , i '_ll be looking for my money back .
neutral	pps arrived on 00th , well - packaged and good quality , so i will amend my star_rating from 0 to 0 .
neutral	the lack of any customer service , delay in canvas arriving despite paying the extra for next_day delivery has taken the edge of my first experience with this company .
neutral	goods arrive very quickly .
neutral	very reliable .
neutral	i went with foneback . com after checking several mobile_recycling , as fonebank . com promised the highest price .
neutral	i was a little disappointed i needed to provide my own envelope ( unlike when using envirofone ).
neutral	a few_days_later i got an email to say the phone had been received , checked over and my cheque would be posted out to me first_class the same day .
neutral	the cheque finally arrived a week_later , the date on the envelope from fonebank . com '_s franking machine indicated it was not posted on the same day , but rather some 0 day after they told me !
neutral	my booking was not your system and caused some problems .
neutral	the item i ordered was not in stock and i received an email_advising that i would be contacted when it was dispatched .
neutral	this was a number of weeks_ago and whilst i understand that the item may still not be available , i would welcome an update email perhaps every three or four weeks .
neutral	we received a great car from thrifty .
neutral	it was new and ran well for our trip .
neutral	the only issue was that we waited 00_minutes at logan airport for the thrifty shuttle to pick us up and then waited another hour at the thrifty office to get the car .
neutral	it was hot that day and the wait was very difficult .
neutral	on the positive_side , we received very good service when we finally got to the registration desk and received a very good car with a full explanation on how to reach the highway .
neutral	next_day delivery as requested and paid for of tub chair and bar_stools did not happen .
neutral	i was left to speak with the courier company only to find that my contact telephone_number had not been passed on .
neutral	dpd the couriers tried to deliver to the wrong street address and would not attempt delivery on day despite their mistake .
neutral	managed to secure next_day sat delivery and once had contact details were able to communicate_effectively with expected delivery times .
neutral	order received was incorrect .
neutral	unable to contact lakeland on sat morning .
neutral	sent email on saturday and got no reply until tuesday pm only to be told that fri would be next available delivery day .
neutral	after some to and froing and significant delays in mail responses this was accepted but far from the original next_day delivery expected !
neutral	dpd turned_up at the wrong street again but at_least on this occasion could contact me so could rectify mistake .
neutral	products good quality but service let_down by not taking ownership of the mistakes made .
neutral	good or great service can only be measured on company ability to deal with things that go_wrong .
neutral	average service on this basis
neutral	took well over 0 days to get payment , a good service but not 00_hrs
neutral	not the best site ive looked at and not many promotions or loyalty schemes like skybet or betfair unfortunately
neutral	i should like your labelling system to be simplified .
neutral	living in the modern computer age , 00 + year_old people have difficulty coping with complex ' down - loading and filing systems .
neutral	my most_recent experience was most distressing .
neutral	often items are resonably_priced when compared with other online stores however the free delivery option is not next_day and can be slow .
neutral	we don_'_t own a car anymore but rent for holidays and long weekends for which we find the annual_policy good value .
neutral	however i find this dual lead driver thing confusing - i suspect that i am paying for it unnecessarily .
neutral	moreover their on screen form is a real_pain in the **** insisting that you chose from alternatives in a drop down list that offers no alternatives .- seriously unfriendly .
neutral	we get a lot of our stuff from screwfix , who have amazingly fast and reliable delivery , so ffx seemed slow by comparison .
neutral	also had to chase after delivery driver when i realised that he had failed to deliver the most_important of the two packages , although clearly that is not an ffx problem .
neutral	however it would have helped if the the email from ffx had warned me that the one item was inevitably going to be delivered as two packages .
neutral	i have used them a couple of times : great service but they need to be more circumspect in their choice of products and make it clear if they are a discontinued product e . g .
neutral	energizer hi - tech led 0in0 torch / lantern - lantern is fine , torch useless , instructions pathetic .
neutral	food very good , treated well on arrival , views excellent , staff very good , rooms clean but could do with updated , maintenance on balcony could be updated , privacy partition between rooms on balcony is required , carpets need to be lifted and floor boards screwed down to stop creaking , which is an unacceptable noise . but we enjoyed the break and would still recomend the hotel mainly for the food and lovely staff .
neutral	jimmy brown .
neutral	went to collect my order but the two co - workers kept chatting to each other , stopping whatever process they were doing each time they asked each other a question .
neutral	my experience would have been a lot smoother had they just concentrated on the job in hand .
neutral	0 items were ordered , one sent immediately and delivered within a few_days , the second item took over 0_weeks .
neutral	i made an order for worktops to be delivered first week back in work 0000 , the order was delayed but then rectified .
neutral	0st order was good .
neutral	missing hot_rods but these were sent out by fedex next_day .
neutral	following that my 0nd order i had been sent the wrong type of worktop , paod for next_day delivery which wasn_'_t the case .
neutral	offered delivery refrund which didnt show .
neutral	they did however they gave_me 0 whole litre of danish_oil for compensation .
neutral	the prices are good .
neutral	and i would still recommend them .
neutral	just check ur order and be blunt and push customer_services as they are fairly rude .
neutral	i received the order in reasonable time , but this item king of shaves super skin face scrub 000ml spilled almost_half inside the package over other products .
neutral	i would be glad to receive a replacement .
neutral	i was happy with the delivery service and the ease of use from the website .
neutral	but i was not happy that the flowers were wilting in under 00_hours despite adequate care .
neutral	for this reason i will not be using this site again .
neutral	bought 0 items , via internet option , two arrived promptly , 0rd was delayed but prosol did not know or advise me .
neutral	chased by telephone , and the lady answering was courteous and said she would look into things .
neutral	asked for a copy invoice mailing and she did this immediately .
neutral	awaiting 0rd item
neutral	i look to the likes of chemist_direct to stock the products that high_street chemists no_longer stock - so it '_s a pity that chemist_direct can '_t seem to get hold of proper selsun shampoo .
neutral	apparently the company want us all to buy tiny ( expensive ) bottles .
neutral	and if i go into a high_street chemist and buy 0 small bottles of liquid paraffin i don_'_t expect to be quizzed by the pharmacist on what i intend to use it for - and i would expect the same privacy on chemist_direct .
neutral	but those criticisms aside , chemist_direct has a reasonably wide stock and delivers quickly .
neutral	three and a half stars .
neutral	flowers very good delivery not so good i was behind front_door when driver delivered he never knocked or rang bell dropped flowers on the step and walked_away
neutral	i am , like most teens - on facebook .
neutral	i make about 00 posts every day ( much to the digression of my friends ) about everything ranging_from my day at college , quotes , music , film - all_sorts .
neutral	ive been using the service since late - 0000 and have watched the many updates .
neutral	the problem with facebook is it keeps wanting to ' tamper ' with itself - which is just making it worse , and terrible to use .
neutral	instead of looking at making the website run faster , produce less errors etc they seem to find it more useful to introduce futile additions such as ' the light box ' ( or theatre mode for viewing picture ) or changing the layout of my newsfeed etc .
neutral	there are so many problems with facebook ; i question why ' we ' all use it still .
neutral	i understand its such a hive of activity ; but so is google - and they don_'_t seem to have a problem ( thinking of all their services mail , search , checkout , translate , maps , picasa , buzz etc_.)
neutral	?
neutral	im not the only one to think this .
neutral	on a postive note ; it has revolutionized how we all communicate with each other - and everything which used to be seen as ' private ' ends up on facebook , and we are now communicating with each other 00_hours of a day .
neutral	being_able to ' look through the keyhole ' at other_peoples lives ..... it is an astonishing thing facebook - its just so broken .
neutral	if facebook are reading this ; then here '_s my message .
neutral	ok , you '_ve sorted_out the privacy ( great thanks for that by the way :) ), but now can you look to sorting_out the stability and performance of your website ?
neutral	instead of tinkering with stupid things that no - one wants , and look crass ( i . e .
neutral	light - box ).
neutral	hope they are still trading can access the site today !
neutral	use an amazon local voucher tyo buy flowers , but on the checkout page you have to enter payment details even for a zero balance !
neutral	if you use a paypal_account to do so , the system crashes . doesn_'_t inspire_confidence .....
neutral	note : this is an edited review based on recent contact with glasses_direct .
neutral	glasses_direct have a great site , great glasses selection , and are very quick and efficient at taking orders and despatching glasses out to you for both trial and personal use after purchase .
neutral	i had an issue after receiving my new glasses .
neutral	despite purchasing the thinnest_lenses online – the site suggests these are the only thin_lenses available – they arrived and were noticeably thicker than my existing same prescription high_street glasses .
neutral	i was initially told this was down to choosing a half rimless_frame – the glasses needed to be thicker simply to fit .
neutral	the glasses were returned , and a no_quibble refund was issued .
neutral	i then ordered ultra_thin premium lenses against my second choice of now full frame glasses .
neutral	on arrival , they were still thicker than my old same prescription_glasses .
neutral	i posted a review here on trust_pilot , and glasses_direct got in touch .
neutral	it appears that the thinnest_lenses they offer online are not the thinnest_lenses you can get – hence the difference_between the pairs i own .
neutral	this is very misleading on the site !!!
neutral	at no point is it made clear that thinner_lenses are available but not available to purchase online .
neutral	my glasses were again returned , the new super thin ( 0 . 0 ’_s , not 0 . 0 ’_s ) were put in and posted to me .
neutral	these are the same thickness as my old glasses !
neutral	at last !
neutral	the whole_process was quite infuriating , but handled very well by glasses_direct .
neutral	their customer service is good .
neutral	buying glasses online can work , if only they didn_’_t mislead customers online !
neutral	orderded infurn '_s " big_boy " bean_bag at the start of november_0000 as part of a groupon deal .
neutral	stated delivery was 0 to 0_weeks .
neutral	in the end , delivery took 00 weeks .
neutral	i did email customer service , and did receive a prompt reply which directed me back to their website and their order tracking_system .
neutral	the delivery date issued by that system did change a couple of times .
neutral	the product itself is a copy of the " fat boy " beanbag , right down to the same colour and style of label as the fat boy ( instead , it reads big_boy )
neutral	seems of solid_construction , and decent material and a good copy all_round .
neutral	could of done with a little more padding , in my opinion .
neutral	that said , the total price i paid for the product was around 00_% of the cost of an official fat boy .
neutral	you get what you pay for - this is a good copy and a good price .
neutral	customer service and delivery on par with this .
neutral	don_'_t go crying to groupon either - they are actually the worst when it comes to customer service , trust me ...
neutral	when i ordered my jumper the advert stated it would come in a presentation_box however when it arrived it was just packaged loose in a bag !
neutral	i ordered my parts on good friday .
neutral	this seemed ok with jk giving me feedback by saturday that the order was completed etc .
neutral	come monday interlink had contacted me by text to say my parcel will be delivered on the tuesday .
neutral	i booked a days hols for the wednesday so i could fit the parts only to then find out that interlink had not received the parts from jk in time ( allegedly ).
neutral	the delivery was now wednesday at 0pm .
neutral	i wasted a days hols as it rained in the afternoon so could not fit them .
neutral	i am not happy .
neutral	booking was fine till checked out .
neutral	then sms charges , cancel insurance and booking_fees added with no warning and no option to decline !
neutral	i booked a vw_polo diesel with centauro at murcia_airport for a week and was quoted a price of € 00 . 00 but when i collected the car i had to pay an additional € 00 . 00 for excess_insurance plus a whopping € 00 . 00 for a fuel_tank of diesel which incidentally is more than it costs me to fill up my bmw_000d at home .
neutral	the total_cost was €_000 . 00 but to make_matters_worse centauro converted the payment to sterling without asking me at a shocking rate of exchange and i ended_up paying £_000 instead of the £_000 that it would have cost me if my own credit_card company had converted the euros to sterling
neutral	as above plus i thought some of the material was quite superficial and in one area the content was wrong re bandura '_s social learning theory .
neutral	in answering per the manual , i was informed my answer was wrong .
neutral	on researching on the internet , i found the marker was correct to tell me my answer was wrong , so the manual was wrong .
neutral	i brought this to attention , but no response came .
neutral	in one module , i even had suggested answers which were clearly for the guidance of markers rather_than students .
neutral	good service overall as i got what i wanted in the end but was initially told the plastic i wanted wasn_'_t available ... lucky for me i knew it was and when the operator went away to check his answer changed .
neutral	had to purchase on company credit_card which is not ideal for me as i work for a global engineering company and wanted to set them up on our approved supplier list .
neutral	this for some reason is not as easy as it should be and may hinder future orders .
neutral	overall i would recommend though .
neutral	plus a very good website , give the web designer / programmer a pay_rise !
neutral	the trophies were cool , very nice and great value for money .
neutral	you customer service is great too .
neutral	but what makes it a nightmare experience with you is the using of dpd delivery services !
neutral	0 .
neutral	delivery arranged for friday - all day nothing - even receiving and sms and email about aprox .
neutral	delivery time , then email that nobody was home !!!
neutral	without even calling_card being left on doors .
neutral	0 .
neutral	re - arranged delivery for monday and pay £_00 .- to be here before 00 am .
neutral	this doesn_'_t happen again .
neutral	during my investigation what '_s going on , they told me they had problem wi driver on friday - therefore they lie to me about " nobody being home "!!!!!
neutral	then they promise to refund ( didn_'_t happen either ) and redelivery before 0pm , this didn_'_t happen again and you send sms and email again that the time will be 0 - 0pm !!
neutral	!
neutral	0 .
neutral	i was furious and call your centre , they manage to dpd delivered the items before 0pm afternoon !
neutral	only few_days , 0 hours and extra pay !
neutral	this is unacceptable !
neutral	p . s .
neutral	if i rate my all experience it '_s 0_stars !
neutral	if i would rate your company it '_s would be 0 .
neutral	putting 0 !
neutral	sorry your choice of delivery let it big time down !
neutral	compared with ebay this website is hard work .
neutral	have bought 000 items from ebay .
neutral	product arrived late ( monday instead of friday ) due to their delivery problems .
neutral	product fine , good price but no refund of extra i paid for ' next_day '.
neutral	flowers arrived in good condition and looked beautiful but within 00_hours had to throw out the gerberas and roses were all wilted
neutral	love oak_furniture_land '_s products .
neutral	i think the prices are good which helps .
neutral	sadly the delivery options do not match up to their products .
neutral	only deliver during week days - don_'_t offer a saturday delivery .
neutral	also can '_t give a delivery slot until the day before delivery .
neutral	customer_services were unapologetic regarding their limited delivery & even proceeded to tell me that research had found that most people work at weekends and are at home during the week , hence the weekday only deliveries !
neutral	the prices were better_than any others that i could_find quickly , and they delivered in 00_hours .
neutral	however they did not require a signature and left the goods visible in my front porc even_though i was in the house !
neutral	my only_criticism is cartridgeshop send my order by multiple deliveries .
neutral	this is not eco friendly and is also inconvenient .
neutral	if i am not in to receive the package , i have to drive 0 miles to collect it from the post_office depot .
neutral	one trip is acceptable but two was not .
neutral	this is the only issue that could make me look_elsewhere which i do not really want to do .
neutral	value_incontinence are easy to order from , but you ' re not told when the delivery will be .
neutral	because it '_s a large box - you really need to be there waiting !
neutral	too many_times due to the lack of pictures and an item description i have ordered the wrong part ie : z00 & zep00 part no '_s too similar , then when i realised i ' d ordered the wrong part i was refunded my money after ordering the part i wanted & told this part was now out of stock & and has_been now for 0_weeks .
neutral	this is bad customer_relations
neutral	so - so .
neutral	some good bits , some less good .
neutral	all is well with purchase except the incredible high cost but all you vet based companies know this but unfortunately you are all the same greedy . i am hoping to take this up with my local mp m . davenport
neutral	i purchase 00 cup handles for my kitchen draws and cupboards excellent choice look stunning however 0 of the handles had not been tapped to the correct depth , minor_problem i had to purchase some washers to fix he problem .
neutral	because amazon sell many of their products through third_party sellers , you never know if you ' re actually ordering from amazon themselves or someone_else .
neutral	when my order arrived poorly_packaged and late from a company i had never_heard of , i wasn_'_t very happy !
neutral	good service backed_up with a one to one telephone contact .
neutral	i was surprised that having a uk company address the camera came from the states , but it did arrive quite quickly and in good order .
neutral	however , the second battery purchased with the camera was an after - market copy ( not nikon ) and in - spite of its price ( not cheap ) didn_'_t work .
neutral	also , there are cheaper sd_cards available in the uk on the internet .
neutral	so overall the shine was taken off the new toy by a poor product but i can '_t complain_about the service .
neutral	talk_talk get a lot of flak but other than changing my contract without telling_me i have found their service ok
neutral	the customer service was great , the virtual terminal did the job i was looking for , just found a cheaper service else where .
neutral	i remember when signing_up to payment sense i was told i could terminate the contract anytime .
neutral	so emailed to cancel my service to be told i have to pay for the next 0 months , this is very annoying , as i can '_t use the account but still being charged .
neutral	it may only be £_00 but its a little_harsh to charge me for something , i can no_longer use .
neutral	arrived with zip tags loose in the wrapper .
neutral	since then one has broken ( not a huge problem as this zip has two ends .
neutral	good size bag .
neutral	good idea and easy to use website .
neutral	just it seems very slow to be able to collect your money and also there seems to be a lot of problems with merchants not giving you your money ... staff seem very friendly and helpful ... i probably will not bother any more after i get my money this time .
neutral	item as_described , not the cheapest i found the product but in stock with next_day delivery .
neutral	upset that even after ticking the box asking for no junk emails i still get them ???
neutral	?
neutral	the delivery and customer service was excellent and no_complaints .
neutral	my only issue was that i paid £_00 too much for the makita_impact_driver .
neutral	i called the shop to no_avail !
neutral	should have gone to its or even [_external_reference_].
neutral	online shopping is not always the cheapest !
neutral	the lesson here is to shop around however much you trust someone .
neutral	my order was dealt_with effectively & efficiently .
neutral	although there was a 0 week delay with delivery i was kept_informed_throughout and when they arrived i was happy with the service i received .
neutral	my only_criticism would be that if goods are out of stock at the time of ordering perhaps the website could say so before the order is placed .
neutral	the price is good , tyres provided as stated with a friendly service .
neutral	however , at national they would only do the basics .
neutral	my wife had front tyres_fitted and she asked for them to be swapped with the rear_tyres as recommended by the manufacturer .
neutral	they refused and waffled on about why .
neutral	obvious they just couldn_'_t be_bothered .
neutral	disappointing , as otherwise okay and value for money .
neutral	juno have a very strong selection of items , in different genre '_s of music , although sometimes a bit_pricey , but they do have sales reguarly so if your willing to trawl_through the pages upon pages of items your bound to find some noteworthy items , one downfull that they do have is most companies offer free_postage once you reach a purchase value of £_00 unfortunetly juno do not offer this .
neutral	flowers arrived on time .
neutral	apperently they were very nice .
neutral	no faults there .
neutral	the do communicate too much and i don_'_t appreciate being on mail lists i didn_'_t subscribe to .
neutral	i am caring for a friend with a tumour .
neutral	unfortunately he needs to use a bottle to go to the loo now .
neutral	my first order was ok prices and delivery fair
neutral	the next order i placed on friday and paid for 00 hour delivery but it was not processed till monday meaning it came tuesday - thats 0 days .
neutral	in addition some of the bottles had a flaw and leaked .
neutral	will look for a new supplier
neutral	i ordered a watch from iconic_watches as advertised on their website i paid my deposit and received an email_stating 00 - 00 days for delivery i anxiously waited 00 days then got in touch with iconic_watches to find out what was going on .
neutral	i received a reply that they were going to get in touch with their suppliers and would be in touch .
neutral	i then received a further email_stating that the watch is no_longer available .
neutral	in iconic_watches favour a refund of my deposit was promptly paid but why o why do they advertise watches they do not have and cannot obtain and still take a deposit .
neutral	i could of at the time of placing my deposit with iconic_watches obtained the exact_same watch from an other company guaranteed in stock albeit at a cost of £_00 more but in hindsight £_00 on a watch costing over £ 0000 would have been worth it .
neutral	my experience with iconic_watches has therefore been a negative one and i would have second and third and forth thoughts before i place another order with them in other words never again .
neutral	often out of stock of many products , and you never find out until they ' re at your door .
neutral	otherwise fine .
neutral	i ordered a cup and 0 cards , cost me £_00 special delivery charge !
neutral	too expensive , otherwise a valuable service .
neutral	customer service is prompt .
neutral	well_done .
neutral	unfortunately indifferent to all the others providers ...
neutral	bought 0 tyres on the tuesday . fitted on the thursday . bought 0 more on the thursday .
neutral	fitted on the saturday .
neutral	only problem was they had increased in price by £ 0 a tyre in 0 days and the second order would not let mr use my tesco_club card
neutral	thought i paid full cost when i pre_- booked , paid £_000 for 0 days when i pre booked but then got hit for an unexpected additional_charge of 00_euros for winter_tyres when i collected car at the airport !
neutral	changed computers and original camera did not work on the new w0 set_up .
neutral	e_- mailed them twice with no response .
neutral	bought another camera and it '_s the same as the one i have .
neutral	loaded the cd and my old set_up worked ok .
neutral	so buying is great , talking to them afterwards isn_'_t .
neutral	it was very easy to make the booking through opodo and i saved about £_00 on the fare quoted at the same minute by ba directly .
neutral	when i came to try to upgrade the return flight from world traveller to club europe while i was out in romania i found that ba would let_me do this with them , as i usually do , as they informed me that i needed to speak to my travel_agent .
neutral	ordered a b_& m watch for my wife '_s birthday in june and expected a prompt , seamless , delivery process .
neutral	my experience was some distance off this expected mark .
neutral	reflecting objectively , i have listed the pros and cons below .
neutral	pros_:
neutral	0 . the listed price on precisiontime was about 00_% lower_than nearest competition .
neutral	0 . you do get a person at the other end of the line when you call in customer_care .
neutral	they are genuine and possess an intention of resolving the issue
neutral	cons_:
neutral	0 . shortly_after ordering , i was updated that the order may involve a delay as ' pick_up ' from source is delayed .
neutral	this frustration persisted till the birthday and was only saved by an_urgent last_minute courier .
neutral	alternate arrangements needed to be made at my workplace .
neutral	i was compensated by another bit taken off the list price
neutral	0 . company did not offer manufacturer '_s warranty .
neutral	there is limited undertaking from pt
neutral	0 .
neutral	there was a prominent scratch on the bracelet .
neutral	upon informing customer_care , pt assured that they will offer replacement bracelet links but i was expected to visit high_street to enact the repair ( and bear expense ).
neutral	to sum it up , pt offer a budget service , competent prices and uk_based customer_care , but lack of attention to detail and difficulties of logistics may leave you with a sigh of dissatisfaction ...
neutral	everything about the purchase was very good , the wardrobe was very competitively_priced and good quality .
neutral	it was not initially clear whether deposit payment had gone_through and i need to call to confirm this and this resolved .
neutral	the worst thing was the delivery - the drivers would make no effort to deliver to room - all that was required to manoeuvre was to remove doors to move - other_firms delivery firms have been helpful and assisted ( indeed another delivery firm delivering another item from a different form ultimately assisted getting the wardrobe_upstairs with little major effort or difficulty - i think a better delivery contractor is required .
neutral	i decided to stick with you , tempted by a message there had been another order in my postcode , even_though the oil club had a cheaper price per_litre .
neutral	but £ 0 discount = virtually nothing on a £_000 + order .
neutral	i '_ll be switching to oil club next time - you know how much you '_ll be paying - no gambling on the slim odds of a decent discount .
neutral	i spent over £_000 in two_separate transactions , on both_occasions delivery was later than_expected .
neutral	i ordered the outwell country road awning package and got 0 separate_deliveries at separate times ?
neutral	this meant staying in to receive 0 separate_deliveries .
neutral	however i must_say that the end product is fantastic and would rate it 00 out of 00 .
neutral	i have used holiday_autos for many_years and have always been very satisfied .
neutral	but this year one of their rental providers ripped me off with this new fuel_policy that some are using .
neutral	instead of returning the fuel_tank full they now want it returned empty and then to charge you way over the odds for a full_tank .
neutral	they said they were going to charge my credit_card 00euros but the bill came through a few weeks_later as 00euros .
neutral	the tank size was only 00 litres !
neutral	so they basically charged me double .
neutral	if that ’_s not a scam then i don_’_t know what is !
neutral	returning a car with no fuel is a horrible experience .
neutral	i got lost driving around lisbon and the fuel_gauge went to zero .
neutral	it was a very stressful last day of my holiday and left me feeling very bitter about the car_hire experience .
neutral	unless holiday_autos start indicating which cars are from a fuel scam provider before i book , then i won_’_t be using them again .
neutral	hi , all went well until i printed details out at the end .
neutral	there was no delivery date .
neutral	so i had to ring to confirm what was on the system !
neutral	if the date was on the confirmation , no problem .
neutral	we had a free upgrade from a fiat_panda to a merc b class which was great , albeit it took a few mins to work out how to start the thing ( no manual in car ).
neutral	the only_downer was that despite having been told the contrary , the car was not available for collection at the airport .
neutral	we had to wait 00mins for a bus to the off - site carpark ( which actually was only circa 0km away and would have been probably quicker to walk there .
neutral	as always delivery good but disappointed with the flowers .
neutral	even this morning they look tired .
neutral	in hindsight i would have been better picking flowers up from my local_supermarket on the way home from work .
neutral	had been waiting to put an order together when i got an email with the halloween free_postage offer so decided to take_advantage of that .
neutral	despite trying numerous_times to enter to code we could not get it accepted so ended_up having to pay for postage , being a weekend we couldn_'_t phone the office to get any assistance either ... not the end of the world but a real frustration that marred an otherwise positive_experience .
neutral	the kit we ordered did arrive quickly , well_packaged and is as we hoped .
neutral	it often pays to shop around rather_than using quidco - it '_s not unusual to find someone selling something cheaper_than a quidco retailer , even after taking the cashback into account .
neutral	also , my purchases never , ever track .
neutral	i have to raise a ticket every_single time i buy something through_quidco .
neutral	ordered twice_now for in store collection .
neutral	easy online , stock arrives in store on time , but the service received in the poole store has really put me off .
neutral	for a company that bleats on about how great their customer service is , disappointing experience both_times i '_ve been in to collect .
neutral	arrange pick_up for southampton now !
neutral	!
neutral	no friction at all .
neutral	the delivery was late that '_s all .
neutral	i wanted to put a new battery in my best watc for holiday but it didn_'_t arrive in time .
neutral	the capsules don_'_t feel as well crafted as the original nespresso ones - they are thickish plastic instead of foil and the foil cap that is pierced by the machine is tougher .
neutral	as a result actually pulling the lever feels_like it '_s a lot tougher than it should be .
neutral	occasionally it just doesn_'_t work and you have wasted a capsule .
neutral	this possibly negates the cheapness of the capsules .
neutral	all that being said the coffee_tastes good .
neutral	all in all , worth a try , but if your machine doesn_'_t like the capsules it may not work out any cheaper .
neutral	has a couple of bad_experiences where orders have been placed on - line but due to the overnight process not running or some excuse no goods turn_up which is annoying but what makes the problem worse is the attitude of the people you have to speak to .
neutral	they try to apportion the blame back on the customer instead of going the extra_mile .
neutral	if you ' re desperate then try you luck otherwise find someone more professional .
neutral	had problems with plaqcing order due to bugs in the website , received a short delivery , but in both_cases an email got a fast response and solved the problems .
neutral	use of the website was with ease , a real positive being you could enter your car_registration_number , and this then pointed you to the appropriate tyres for this make and model of vehicle ( without the necessity to input tyre rim sizes etc ).
neutral	a slight_issue is when you '_ve made the online purchase it asks that you print the invoice and take along to the branch , the assumption , of course , is you have a printer to hand !
neutral	overall good so_far and just waiting to see if the service at the branch matches when i go in at the appointed fitting date and time .
neutral	i ordered my products on line on 0th_march and followed the tracking via the website .
neutral	all was going ok until 0th of march when there was a note saying " goods damaged - returned to depot " then nothing happened !
neutral	no one contacted me so i contacted ds by phone on 00th_march when a new order was generated with a brief apology .
neutral	this has_been received today 00th - all good .
neutral	i was disappointed that i had to call to chase my order as i was left in the dark about what was going on !!
neutral	i appreciate that things go_wrong but it '_s what '_s done about it that counts !
neutral	the products i ordered are fine .
neutral	expect lots of emails , often duplicated .
neutral	if you write to them you '_ll get an_automated_reply_stating that they ' re receiving unprecedented amounts of correspondence .
neutral	the email that tells you your order is in the laboratory and be ready in 0 to 0 days is overly optimistic .
neutral	this company are very slow .
neutral	made four purchases , and two were fine ( a reduced price meal , and a set of dishes ), but two others were not .
neutral	a ' local ' day out turned_out to be impossible to get to from where i live unless you had a car , but wowcher refused to refund saying i needed to contact the seller , who never replied .
neutral	another item , travel wallets , were absolute_rubbish .
neutral	i had to pay the cost if returning them before i got a refund , so i lost money there .
neutral	some items are worth purchasing , but be very careful that you know what you are buying as descriptions can be misleading .
neutral	wowcher seems to step aside when you have a problem and leave you to argue it out with a third_party .
neutral	buy from wowcher if something interests you , but use some caution as it '_s not like buying from [_external ref .]
neutral	whose customer service is 000_% reliable .
neutral	we are regular one way hirers of cars from nottingham to heathrow and southampton and we use alamo / europcar .... so they know of us and there has never been a problem .
neutral	however , this time , because of a ' change to their computer system ' the guy at the nottingham office typed in all our details and said ' computer says no '!
neutral	and started asking for further id .
neutral	- luckily we had a bank_statement on us ( less_than three_months old ) as well as our driving_licence and passport and heathrow air ticket information .
neutral	- after at_least half an_hour messing_about we were given a car ...... not the one we had booked ( a small compact car ) but a people carrier !!
neutral	and made it sound that we were privileged to be offered a ' free upgrade ' - we hate large vehicles both to drive ( as it feels_like you are driving a bus ) and from an ecological point of view .
neutral	- the real reason for the allocation was that there were no small vehicles to be had .
neutral	- we should have been offered compensation for not being given the type of vehicle we had reserved rather_than been made to feel the company was doing us a favour !
neutral	we choose not to be on the electoral roll as it lessens the potential junk_mail we receive and cuts down the possibility of being a victim of a scam and / or have our identities stolen .... if you believe the same .... think_twice before you use europcar / alamo to hire your next car no matter_how many_times you have used them in the past ...... because their computer is likely to ' say no ' - not a good start to a holiday when you need to get to the airport in a hurry !
neutral	!
neutral	i thought i would try this product for quality and cost .
neutral	both of which are good .
neutral	the down_side which wasn_'_t clear is that the pods a individually_wrapped and can '_t be stored in the normal way like nespresso_capsules .
neutral	so i now have cupboards full of boxes rather_than use my stylish worktop display stand !
neutral	canvas we ordered , arrived after a lot of trouble , it was very dark , we contacted ellen dobson of you frame it , who advised she would look into it and get it lighter and send a new one out , the canvas arrived but it was the same still dark not the same as original file we sent , as we were so disappointed as the picture was of our_wedding_rings we wanted it right , we emailed ellen dobson and asked for our money back , surprise_surprise no answer or reply , so they are very good and prompt at sending canvas_prints out , but if you want a refund not so quick
neutral	a bit disappointed steve from hoddesdon
neutral	brought one item which i wanted which was fine .
neutral	but then for days i was sent emails from them with all there promotions .
neutral	having failed to gain_access to the royal gallery for an exhibition during the palace opening period ( when lots of people get booked into the gallery whether they use it or not ), i decided to book online .
neutral	the operator didn_'_t seem able to understand my question as to whether i was booking for a specific time_slot or for the whole day .
neutral	nonetheless i went_ahead with the booking and the ticket got us in ok . on the negative side , if you buy a ticket at the gallery itself , it '_s then valid for future entry over the coming year ; this is not the case with tickets bought online .
neutral	company responds to emails and gives good answers , but streaming videos even on a 00m broadband link is somewhat hit and miss - think i managed 0 out of 00 successfully , and that is with a virgin 00m broadband link and a brand_new internet samsung_tv .
neutral	shame , but thats_why they lost me as a customer .
neutral	they recently_moved to silverlight , whatever that is - maybe that improves things ...
neutral	had a few problems that has put me off - see a good price deal but then notified it '_s out of stock - even_though site still says it is in stock .
neutral	also , easy to get conned on not paying the best and required postage unless you have your wits_about you when ordering .
neutral	regarding my recent_purchase from frost_auto restoration , i ordered my welding cart / trolley via ebay and the item was delivered to my door a day earlier_than_expected , brilliant service .
neutral	however , i had been sent a pair of vehicle dolleys by mistake .
neutral	following a phone_call to frost , the wrong items were repacked by myself and collected the following_day as arrange .
neutral	my welding cart / trolley arrived two_days_later , again excellent postal service i expected from frost .
neutral	however , when assembling the item i found two parts ( plastic spacer caps ) missing .
neutral	i could not be_bothered to phone frost again and made nylon spacers on my lathe at home .
neutral	i should not have do that and i am disappointed with frost this time , as their service is usually first_class .
neutral	play are competitive but are slow on the sending out of goods , never expect a product if preordered to arrive on release day !
neutral	this is play '_s fault .
neutral	free delivery fine , game etc do the same butt game send out 0 days beforew at 0st_class , whereas play send out 0 days before and we still dont get it for 0 - 0_weeks !
neutral	be prepared to wait for goods off play , at_least 0 - 0_weeks .
neutral	it all started so well !
neutral	fitter arrived on time and got on with the job efficiently , but then broke the fixing on one of my tyre pressure monitoring sensors .
neutral	fitted tyre , but i was left with an annoying tyre pressure system failure alarm on dashboard .
neutral	surprisingly , event_tyres fitter didn_'_t carry tpms spares , implied the problem was my fault , and left me to get the problem fixed .
neutral	got upset when i refused to sign that the car was left undamaged .
neutral	so what i ' d thought would be a quick tyre replacement job turned into a saga .
neutral	had to buy a new valve stem and reassemble the sensor myself .
neutral	fitter did return to replace the sensor foc , but it would have been so much_better if he ' d been properly prepared with spares .
neutral	tpms are becoming mandatory and event_tyres need to get up to date to handle them without giving the customer grief !
neutral	it would be easier to deal with 000vet if they accepted scanned copies of prescriptions by e_- mail , which some other_suppliers are doing now .
neutral	instead you have to post the prescription to them and wait for as long as it takes for the prescription to arrive before they send out the medication .
neutral	annoying with pop ups and their own version of pro tab .
neutral	very pleased with how smooth the first half of the process was .
neutral	the site is nicely put_together and easy to use .
neutral	a message i sent to customer_services to check the address i entered was correct was replied to quickly and well .
neutral	you don_'_t get big_bucks for most items but for guaranteed cash for unwanted stuff i wouldn_'_t expect to .
neutral	i ' d read a few reviews ahead of doing this that said you have to wait a bit for the cheque , but i thought that '_s ok accounting for time to process the stuff and admin etc .
neutral	i had a confirmation within a few_days that the cds i sent had been approved and my money would be processed soon .
neutral	0_weeks_later i sent a message to see where things were at .
neutral	they said there had been a problem with their system and things had been delayed , but it would be processed in the next run .
neutral	this may have been the case , but judging_by other similar comments from others it left me feeling that they were just holding it as long as they could .
neutral	maybe they want to wait_until they make the money back in sales before sending it out , or just hold it for a bit to make some interest .
neutral	can '_t help feeling there is a dishonest side to this otherwise good service .
neutral	i do resent being told " you must stay in to receive these goods ".
neutral	i don_'_t mind good service but like rhetoric checking on the service should really only need to be done sparingly and then again when you feel something may go_wrong .
neutral	that is unless you are delivering bars of gold .
neutral	honest_opinion , well over the top message wise .
neutral	i order , i pay , its despatched and its delivered and then only when i decide to receive it .
neutral	the service was very very good but to repeat once more too over the top so only 0 / 00 which was a shame .
neutral	i buy of many retailers and do most my buying online
neutral	its coming more and more common to give a text or phone when parcel is due
neutral	within the hour , for someone to stay in from 0am - 0pm just to recieve a parcel is to much for someone at home
neutral	the hardback cover feels a bit cheap and has some bubbles on the spine already .
neutral	the kodak site i used had a beautiful finish on the cover and a leaf of tracing paper to cover the first page , which a lll just gave it a better quality feel .
neutral	the quality here didn_'_t really match the price
neutral	overall good customer service .
neutral	delivery company leaves a lot to be desired as parcel turned_up soaking_wet and i had to unpack on door_step as it fell_apart .
neutral	the moisture tester was not exactley_what i had expected .
neutral	i thought that i was getting a tester from ' rapitest ' but it was actually from ' tenax '.
neutral	the company ( fleet car_rentals ), with whom economycarrentals had placed the business , did not have a car for us and passed us on to nova car_rentals .
neutral	they also did not have the car requested but supplied us with a higher_grade alternative and honoured the agreed rental rate .
neutral	what more can i say .
neutral	good stock , good email comms but as the title .
neutral	although i have been happy to renew i '_m unhappy that this is automatic and than it is not clear how i might opt_out if i so wished .
neutral	as i proceeded the system logged me out , when i got back in everything was still there except free delivery had been changed to £_00 . 00 next_day delivery , extra .
neutral	took a long time to get the system to change this back to 0 - day free delivery .
neutral	almost gave up ....
neutral	en_el contrato de_la_reserva del coche , la compañia te decia por escrito que no havias de pagar franquicia , sin embargo quando vas a recoger el_coche te cobran 00 € de suplemento si quieres la franquicia a todo riesgo .
neutral	luego con_el deposito de_la gasolina es otro engaño , te obligar a pagar el deposito lleno y te cobran el_precio que_les da la gana como 00 € y si no gastas la gasolina , se lo quedan ellos .
neutral	al principio el_precio parece muy barato pero cuando te empiezan a cobrar todo a parte ya no lo es tanto .
neutral	!
neutral	we ordered 0 set of ladders .
neutral	00 / 00 , a really good service to use , but check stoke levels by talking to someone if you need the quick .
neutral	when we ordered our ladders online , there was no notice saying that they only had one set in stock .
neutral	i had to call customer_services , to get them to deliver the set they had , or i would still be waiting , great staff , easy to talk with , well trained , but as a company i would find it hard to order from them again , if the items we needed where urgent or time critical .
neutral	we are still_waiting for the second set to be delivered .
neutral	we ordered nine days ago .
neutral	overall the o0 experience is good , billing and customer helpwise i have no_complaints , the 0g_network needs improvement and further enhancement .
neutral	in addition i think the 0g_network growth has come to a standstill as o0 applied for planning permission to upgrade their transmitter not 000_yards from my house over 00 months_ago and they were granted permission but still have to do the upgrade , let just hope they do it within the life of the planning permission .
neutral	i '_ve_used_tyreshopper a few_times now with excellent results , but on my most_recent order when my wife went to get them fitted they hadn_'_t had the tyres delivered . this put my wife '_s day out completely if you book a morning slot you expect them there , she arrived at 00am they still hadn_'_t been delivered at 00am .
neutral	can '_t fault the fitters though they were very helpful . probably a blip because this does seem to be a very competitively_priced tyre site .
neutral	i '_ve had a mixed history with studiospares .
neutral	i would start by saying that the company has_been going for many_years , is an ' industry standard ' key competitor and despite what i will write in this review i would definitely use them again and again .
neutral	however , they use dpd to transport their parcels and this lets them down a lot .
neutral	i '_ve had next_day deliveries not arrive next_day , no apology from the delivery company .
neutral	when phoning to enquire with studiospares , they couldn_'_t get through so gave_me the number to call , which was never answered .....
neutral	also , they have mis_- advertised sizing of products that i have purchased resulting in too little area of an acoustic tiles product arriving ( by a long margin !)
neutral	but they did resolve my complaint to my satisfaction .
neutral	just check the size before placing an order to avoid_disappointment .
neutral	overall , an excellent company to deal with but the delivery service lets them down in my opinion
neutral	the box that the tools were delivered in was damaged , ripped down one corner and also looked like it had been dropped .
neutral	when i spoke to the delivery driver about this he was very of hand about it saying it wasn_'_t his problem and quickly got back in his_van and drove_away .
neutral	when i checked the contents of what i had ordered no items were missing and none had managed to be damaged .
neutral	i would like to think more care should be taken due to the tools i had ordered were precision tools and were not cheap .
neutral	i hope that this was a one off and wont happen again in the future .
neutral	i '_ve only tried the lamb casserole as yet .
neutral	it was very tasty .
neutral	but there were too many potatoes & too little meat , in my opinion .
neutral	as usual , anything really useful is discontinued , e . g .
neutral	lucozade sport with caffine , but the jelly beans are still good , even if one has to order them in industrial quantities .
neutral	well they are not the quickest in processing orders .
neutral	but they are more than quick enough to take payments in full long before dealing_with your order .
neutral	made an other order last thursday money was removed from account 0 hour later then my account on ebuyer updated to items wont be sent until 00th for delivery on 00th .
neutral	a week to process an order ...
neutral	made an order for £_00 . 00 with an other company and selected free delivery , got email_telling_me delivery is 0 - 00 days ... then got an email 00_mins later telling_me parcel has_been collected by parcel_force to track item click this link after 00pm .
neutral	checked tracking after 00pm to find my item was on its way and for delivery next working day ...
neutral	ebuyer should take notes on speeding things up a bit .
neutral	bought a 0 drill pack and on delivery only one drill was correct and took the the batteries i had bought whilst the second drill had a totally different battery required .
neutral	office arranged for collection and eventually delivered the correct drill .
neutral	if you stay more than 00_minutes a firm called g00 may try to recover a £_000 for breaching parking terms .
neutral	i think this can results in a bad_experience for the shopper that shops or stays too long .
neutral	i will consider booking with holiday_autos again ...
neutral	but ...
neutral	i do not agree that they have a policy of one having to pay over the odds for a full_tank of fuel , and you have to bring it back empty .
neutral	you cannot do this as you may not need a full_tank for your trip and it is dangerous to try and drive back to an airport on an empty_tank , very risky .
neutral	it is no more than a blatant rip_off and taking the consumer as a mug .
neutral	low rental rates but very high hidden_charges in fuel do not make them as competitive as i thought .
neutral	i also found out that this wasn_'_t the actual policy of the rental company that supplied the car but just that of the individual policy / agreement that holiday_autos use .
neutral	very sharp cynical practice in my opinion , designed to rip_off .
neutral	i called the actual car_hire company supplying my car , and they amended my booking to be full to full .
neutral	come on holiday_autos , you let yourself down with a cynical money_grabbing practice .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	few orders placed from them never arrived due to poor courier service , however if you dint receive your goods , next will make_sure you keep waiting for good few weeks before outcome .
neutral	however quality is great and items are reasonably prices .
neutral	customer service is good too !
neutral	our village group found a few suppliers 0 or 0 pence_per_litre cheaper , for the same day delivery .
neutral	this makes a significant_difference if , say 0000 litres are ordered .
neutral	it turned_out that it was the same company tanker which delivered my boilerjuice oil , as delivered all the other villagers ' orders , at the same time , except cheaper for them !
neutral	i had stupidly ordered a couple of hours too early ...
neutral	i ordered 0 bolts about 0 / 0 inches long and 0 washers and they were delivered in a small box not a lot smaller than a shoes box , the box had fragile on it crazy .£ 0 delivery as well for 0 bolts is a lot . there should be a normal post option for small items .
neutral	bought a new broilking last_week - no problem at all .
neutral	however wanted spare grills etc for my old one which i will give to my daughter and have made three phone_calls to them giving them the part nos etc .
neutral	three promises to phone back and stiil no contact .
neutral	very disappointing having just spent almost £_000 with them .
neutral	orders accepted with no stock , charge carriage on different orders but arrive all together ?
neutral	, i am unable verify all items charged are delivered due to mixing orders and not sending complete , recieving invoice for goods advising 0 days yet 0_weeks_later still not recieved i am not sure that what i have paid for i have recieved , i have ordered a lot of items and havnt the time to keep checking and chasing sorry but not that good a service
neutral	i share images on facebook , upload videos and all_sorts but i hate the timeline idea please take facebook back and stop updating it you make it worse just take it back scrap this timeline nonsense and leave it alone please
neutral	the product had clearly already been opened and the taped closed , product is poor quality .
neutral	but very quick delivery
neutral	this is a well put_together kit which is simple to fit and appears to work well .
neutral	not acceptable is the ridiculous cost of shipping a parcel of less_than half a kilo . this could have come by mail for approx .
neutral	£ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i have had much heavier_items come by carrier in the past for a fraction of the £_00 . 00 which you charge .
neutral	delivery good disappointed with flowers looked cheap which they were not .
neutral	sadly , the last time i used herbert woods , the handover of the boat was sadly_lacking and we were late setting off .
neutral	my party had arrived early and did not_necessarily expect to take the boat early , but it was already moored and available for any maintenance .
neutral	we completed the necessary_paperwork and went off for lunch and a pint .
neutral	on our return there was limited work being carried_out on the vessel , but that dragged on way past the appointed handover time , and with no direct communication from anyone about what the problem was .
neutral	this was late october and it was nearly dark before we got away , severely restricting our activities that day .
neutral	otherwise , things went pretty_much smoothly and we enjoyed our late break on the broads .
neutral	however , with the increasing prices , i really do expect the vessel to be ready on time .
neutral	i ordered a couple of bottles of torres 00 , my favourite brandy , and the experience was satisfactory , more or less as i would have expected .
neutral	nothing outstanding , either good or bad really .
neutral	the package was delivered by parcelforce and they allegedly have a tracking_system , which rarely told me anything more than ' in progress ', but it was delivered in around the timescale i would expect
neutral	a clean and tidy villa with no extra frills .
neutral	kitchen needs_updating ( 0 ring hob not big enough ) shame about the ants .
neutral	secure and private_pool_area , no garden .
neutral	large lounge / diner update tv to also allow portugese channels
neutral	we had a discussion on the insurance .
neutral	i was sure everything was payed , but the man at the desk told me that i wouldn_'_t get the car if i did not buy a full insurance .
neutral	at last we agreed with an other price for the whole car , but i '_m not sure at all why i had to pay more then at the moment of the booking , and why that was needed .
neutral	the products are always good quality and well priced , and the in - store staff are helpful .
neutral	on line shopping is good , with prompt delivery , but the returns process is awful .
neutral	you have to take the item back to your local_store , which for me defeats the benefit of on line shopping .
neutral	worse still , having driven all the way to the store , returned the item and got a refund , if you order a replacement in store you don_'_t get free delivery .
neutral	so , unless you get a very helpful member of staff who can find a way round that , you have to go home , log on , and re - order on line .
neutral	it '_s a good idea but the price per_litre wasn_'_t great .
neutral	however the driver came in pretty poor conditions and within the timescales provided .
neutral	the cost of postage was excessive for a light product
neutral	0_stars for roses - 0_star for delivery as it was right day .
neutral	came back at 00 . 00 at night after a meal with friends to find a very soggy box partially wedged under the car .
neutral	it had been pouring with rain and extremely windy while we were out .
neutral	i specifically_asked it to be put in our enclosed porch which was unlocked .
neutral	in fact i noted that the label stated " leave in porch ".
neutral	however that was hdnl '_s fault and not that of the flower company , serenataflowers . com .
neutral	miraculously , the flowers were wonderful , 00 red_roses , well_wrapped inside the box ( needed to be ) and in good condition .
neutral	would recommend flowers but not delivery .
neutral	this is the 0nd time that i have used event , the 0st time was hassle_free .
neutral	this time however wasn_'_t .
neutral	i placed an order on the 00th_nov with fitting for 00th , i was called on the 00th to say that the tyres where not available and they couldn_'_t fit on 00th .
neutral	i re - arranged for fitting on the 00rd , on the 00rd i had a call from the fitter saying he was in derbyshire and couldn_'_t make it .
neutral	i re - arranged again for fitting on 00th .
neutral	a long time to wait for 0 tyres .
neutral	the service was not convenient or hassle - free .
neutral	not sure if i will use again .
neutral	the flowers which arrived looked pretty but there were few flowers mainly chrysanthemums dressed with lots of net and coloured cellophane .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	will not use website again .
neutral	i wanted to point out as a matter of feedback that a karcher_window cleaner should not be sold the way you sell it .
neutral	i bought the cleaner from you and paid for delivery . having read the instructions i saw that you had to buy cleaning_fluid to use the machine and it could not be used with any other products . your website should be designed offering the detergent as an optional_extra and it was ridiculous having paid for delivery that i then had to go to the store to buy the cleaning_fluid . the operator kept on repeating the same information as_opposed to taking it on board and advising your buyers and website .
neutral	segundo o site as entregas demoram 0 a 0_dias úteis .
neutral	com uma encomenda feita ainda durante a manhã de 0 de maio paga com cartão de crédito , só foi expedida no dia seguinte ( 0 ) e recebi a encomenda na morada indicada no dia 00 .
neutral	tive 0 experiência completamente distintas , normalmente a pior é sempre a que marca o_serviço que experienciamos .
neutral	a probikeshop devia ter este tipo_de situações em consideração e tentar de alguma forma compensar os seus clientes .
neutral	" mais vale cair em graça do que ser engraçado "
neutral	items ordered not yet received
neutral	after having a good experience online with national , the online person was polite and quick with responses i went into national to have 0 tyres_fitted .
neutral	after the car was taken in it took 00_minutes to fit 0 tyres ?!?
neutral	no communcation as to how long it would take to do these , but apart_from that no_problems .
neutral	good communication
neutral	very enjoyable holiday for two_weeks with fantastic weather .
neutral	the only_downside was that the cleaner hadnt started cleaning by the time we arrived ( she was walking up the path the same time as us ) and the villa wasn_'_t the cleanest villa_plus property we have stayed in .
neutral	previous years in corfu have been spotless with numerous visits through the week .
neutral	our pool was also closed was a few hours as the ph was wrong ( we found this out after a couple of our party were unwell ).
neutral	with these aside , the villa was in a great location with stunning views - a car is essential although those that are willing to walk ... its only only a 00 min stroll to the main coast path .
neutral	was booked in for an am appointment , travelled 00 miles to garage in the morning only to b told that the tyres wernt in yet !!!
neutral	finally had a phone_call at 0 . 00pm saying tyres were in .
neutral	00 miles in total , waste my time aswel , if i ' d wanted them fitting in the afternoon i would have booked an afternoon !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	il serait intéressant de favoriser les clients récurrents , je loue bcp et personne ne m ' offre une réduction ne serait - ce_que 00_% ou un service supplémentaire ...
neutral	aussi négocier des contrats au mois avec_les compagnies pour_les clients de_la lcd .
neutral	la concurrence est en place ex auto escape a d ' aussi bons tarifs , les 0 dernières locations je les ai faites chez eux car les tarifs avec_des loueurs premium ( avis europcar , sixt ...)
neutral	aussi afficher le logo du loueur a coté de chaque tarif , afin de savoir avec quelle compagnie les clients vont passer .
neutral	( pour moi il est important car je voyage souvent a l ’ étranger et parfois en fonction des loueurs des conditions spécifiques sont en place , restrictions surplus , non couverture par l ’ assurance , limitations ...) donner plus de transparence au client .
neutral	i ordered this dishwasher online as my old one was about to pack up it didn_'_t say out of stock so when i rang up after a week i was surprised to be told they were waiting on delivery and they would ring back to advise delivery date which they didn_'_t i rang the following_day and got another unfulfilled promise when i rang the third time . i eventually received a date .
neutral	two and a half weeks after the order which came
neutral	had i been advised of the delivery problems i would have looked elsewhere
neutral	apart_from that delivery arrived fine
neutral	i do not believe a company should sell a £_00 ticket for £_00 , after all what would we all say if tesco or asda sold a tin of beans marked as 00p for over double the price , lets just say we wouldnt buy them .
neutral	still having said that , the company and my experience ( forgetting the price for a moment ) of the company is favourable .
neutral	always love the gear and prices - always get_stung by tagging on the vat at the end of the order .
neutral	not standard and not good - obvious blag to generate sale with low upfront prices .
neutral	prices are still good with vat inc - no need for underhand sales .
neutral	i ordered a chainset from merlin_cycles which came promptly but was not as ordered ( wrong spindle length ).
neutral	i informed them of the mistake and they happily agreed to replace with the correct_size and refund my return postage_costs .
neutral	i confirmed at this time that they definitely had the correct version in stock and was assured they did .
neutral	a week_later i received an email_informing_me that they actually did not have the correct sized product and couldn_'_t get any in , i quickly received a refund including my postage cost .
neutral	the extra couple of weeks delay in getting my bike back on the trails , caused_by having to source and order a new part again , has_been really frustrating .
neutral	i very happily dealt_with rich on monday of this week ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) via telephone_number 00000_000000 .
neutral	he was very helpful and a package was agreed .
neutral	included in which was supposed to be a set of sony stereo dj headphones .
neutral	rich informed me these would be sent with the phone handset which i received today , however only the handset was included .
neutral	i was told that i should expect to wait five days for receipt ( so i am not panicking ) but i was told they would come together and they have not .
neutral	i have now chased this via two emails on 00th and 00th of september so_far with zero response .
neutral	despite an aim to respond within_00hrs .
neutral	i also called during my lunch_break today ( 00th ) and was given vague and unhelpful answers .
neutral	the monday ( 00th ) evening after arranging my upgrade i was quite literally telling my friends to use you .
neutral	by the 00st i wavering and now i am starting to get frustrated .
neutral	please can you review and advise when i can expect to receive the headphones ?
neutral	kind_regards will
neutral	great design , sale prices good and delivery quick however one pair had a small hole in so is not waterprrof .
neutral	given i paid £ 0 . 00 not worth the hassle of returning !
neutral	i have not yet received my order , so can '_t comment on that .
neutral	what i can advise is to be very wary of their quoted prices in currencies other than gbp .
neutral	i assume unintentionally , sigma_sport '_s gbp / aud exchange_rate implicit in their aud prices is way off , so prices look really good .
neutral	but , when it comes to paying , you ' re forced to pay in gbp , therefore incurring the real exchange_rate charged by your bank / credit_card provider .
neutral	beware .
neutral	i usually visit subway outlets whenever i go to london .
neutral	i like subway sandwiches but they are overpriced .
neutral	i still prefer visiting subway for their quality of food and good service .
neutral	flowers where very fresh and should last some time .
neutral	but quantity of flowers poor .
neutral	you could buy similar amount of the same flowers at less_than £_00 . 00 from a good florist .
neutral	paid extra £ 0 . 00 for de_luxe service .
neutral	not sure what i got for this .
neutral	appriciate that delivery costs are including but £_00 . 00 is poor value for what was delivered .
neutral	i think this website is an excellent idea , i use it often to book train_journeys from london across_europe .
neutral	the execution of the booking system is excellent , but i '_m missing a few essential features , such as the ability to split journeys or choose longer stop - overs .
neutral	i also had trouble booking sleeper trains in italy .
neutral	i had to go to the trenitatlia website to identify which types of ticket were still available , before then booking through the excellent online ticket booking system offered by loco0 .
neutral	i guess there is always a trade - off between simplicity of the user_interface and flexibility allowed , and i '_ll watch the development of ( and continue to use ) this site in the future .
neutral	not too much difficulty using , wuld be good to have an itierary confirmation page before submitting booking just to check .
neutral	page time out on first usage after only a few minutes which was irritating but price hadn_'_t changed so ok
neutral	flowers arrived sometimes twice in one day but sweets were orderd twice for th children but havent arrived
neutral	had my mother waiting till half 0 at night for these
neutral	the problem is that the possibility of " duty " was not mentioned during the purchase .
neutral	had it been i might still have continued with the transaction .
neutral	now , however , there is a loss of trust so it is not likely that i would use your company again .
neutral	the other thing that now concerns me is " guarantee " if there is a problem as you are difficult to contact .
neutral	you have not responded to any of my emails !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i was a bit disappointed after requesting that the packaging be unmarked it arrived with a big sticker on it saying jaques outdoor sports_equipment so my husband who took the delivery probably now knows what he is getting for christmas !
neutral	so don_'_t order if you want a surprise !
neutral	i bought a pair of vibram running_shoes which have worked out great and as advertised .
neutral	the only problem is i paid for next_day delivery to my office , received a delivery slot but it never arrived .
neutral	courier company ( interlink / dpd ) couldn_'_t shed much light on why and they promised to have it on a ' pre 00 ' delivery the following_day .
neutral	which also didn_'_t happen .
neutral	they eventually arrived the day after so 0 days late .
neutral	first world problems i know but it '_s an easy thing to get right .
neutral	excellent site
neutral	great company and staff
neutral	not happy with all the hiden costs and adons .
neutral	all prcing should include the add_ons and hiden costs
neutral	website tends to be very busy
neutral	sometimes old promotions are not removed so disappointment is felt when one comes to order .
neutral	the product ordered had been damaged before transit , and the replacement was sent to the wrong_address .
neutral	these mistakes were handled very efficiently and courteously , but they shouldn_'_t have happened in the first place .
neutral	i needed to replace the rollers in my shower_door because they did not work .
neutral	a plumber who i asked to come in , broke them getting them off .
neutral	i got in touch with the supplier of the shower_door who said they didn_'_t supply parts ; my only alternative was to buy a new door ( along with the rollers ).
neutral	ha !
neutral	i measured up the dimensions of my door then looked at the range available at showerseal .
neutral	couldn_'_t be sure they were appropriate but bought two different sets of top and bottom_rollers .
neutral	the rollers arrived - there were no instructions .
neutral	my victoria_plumb shower_door was there without rollers .
neutral	eventually the rollers were on the door and eventually it worked .
neutral	you can tell i am not a diy person .
neutral	moved to action by the venality of the original supplier ( v plumb ) and grateful for showerseal for providing an_alternative .
neutral	instructions would be useful .
neutral	i ordered some australian salmon cut steaks .
neutral	the meat was tasty but not as tender as i would have hoped .
neutral	the flesh was much paler than i am used to in steak and i wonder_if the meat could perhaps have been hung longer .
neutral	cheap and an exceptable delivery time maybe could of been quicker , but price rules so i will_continue to shop with animed .
neutral	i find your web - site design poor by comparison with other_sites .
neutral	it is not as easy as some to find products and checkout requirements .
neutral	i had 0 " system error " warnings in the space of one order and had to telephone to check that my order had been actioned .
neutral	i have no concerns about the products themselves or the speed of delivery which were both good .
neutral	upon purchasing my products i made it very clear , on more than one occasion , that i did not want the 0 year care plan .
neutral	even stating that i would rather purchase another piece if something drastic should happen to the furniture .
neutral	he then totalled up my bill and i settled up using my credit_card .
neutral	when i got the receipt i noticed that the 0 year care plan was added .
neutral	i pointed this out and after a debate the manager gave_me a refund .
neutral	i felt it was quite sly of the salesman to do this and felt it was in bad_taste .
neutral	the items were delivered quicker_than_expected and the delivery service itself was commendable but i felt that the whole_experience was marred_by the issue in the store .
neutral	apart_from sending the incorrect metal out , it happens , but not to keep the customer informed about the carriers replacement deliveries - is simply bad .
neutral	i had to chase on a number of times , and was told they would call the carrier , chase & call me back ... this didnt happen .
neutral	in the end i had to ring the carriers & explain my predicament .
neutral	the local carrier staff were really helpful & sorted my problem out .... still_waiting for that call back tho !!
neutral	!
neutral	excellent product , the first order did not arrive although the courier had claimed the driver had been and left a card at the address .
neutral	i was in all day and there was no card in the letterbox .
neutral	after the third day of waiting the courier web_site showed the order had been destroyed .
neutral	after_contacting shower_seal they dispatched the order again and it has arrived successfully and on the correct day .
neutral	if i need some more shower_seals i will use this company again but i will not be recommending their courier .
neutral	i ordered 0 items from offtek .
neutral	the items in themselves i '_m more than happy with easy for me as i '_m fairly confident around computer equipment to fit and use .
neutral	what was a disappointment was the time waiting for these items to arrive in the post , now admittedly i chose the freepost_option ( royal_mail 0nd_class ).
neutral	but i did not expect to wait 0 days for them to be delivered .
neutral	the items spent 0 days with offtek after they received my payment and a further 0 getting to me .
neutral	i did in fact email sales at offtek to asked for an update on my order as each day i checked it had the same order status , they have never replied to that email to date ..
neutral	so all in all products fine , but not scoring big on communication with customers or speedy delivery .
neutral	i '_ve not decided as to whether to use offtek again having had this experience .
neutral	not an update merely a quick reply to mr . cooper - he may note i did say in aoriginal post i contacted customer_services - they never replied , i did ask in that email for an update on my order ..
neutral	thanks .
neutral	craig .
neutral	i was only informed the day before delivery that the supplier was late in delivering to plumbnation so it would be a week late .
neutral	having already arrnaged a day off work this was a bit too last_minute for me and i would have preferred a bit more warning , or at_least some kind of compensation .
neutral	this firm is good but they do pester you !
neutral	this is the 0th email in a week plus a postal catalogue plus a personal call - its really ott .
neutral	whenever you ask an expert supossed provider for advice , and such provider wanted to be recognized as a trustable one , that '_s what they should have said in an such above summarized case .
neutral	this facts happen to you don_'_t trust them even if they are proud of its good rating service marks or they select the better of them for impressing purposes ...
neutral	the lady_who answered my call was friendly enough but i got the feeling that she wasn_'_t taking in what i was telling her as she repeated a lot of questions and her recounting of details i told her wasn_'_t accurate .
neutral	the proof of the pudding was when she asked me , towards the end of the conversation , which ankle i had broken .
neutral	i would '_ve thought she ' d have gotten this most_important detail nailed_down at the start .
neutral	still , the whole_process wasn_'_t too bad and the follow - up work done by the solicitors has_been very good .
neutral	the box was sent to our registered address and not to the factory address as requested .
neutral	great prices , advice and delivery , but my varifocals are not that good .
neutral	no matter where i view through one lens i don_'_t get a sharp mid - distance image .
neutral	they ' re good for close work , reading and watching_tv but not for more distant vision like driving ...
neutral	the national_tyres site is easy to use and appears to offer a greater selection of tyres than other national_chains .
neutral	i was actually happy with the price quoted for 0 dunlop_tyres only to be left with a sour_taste after clicking the accept customer survey button after making my purchase .
neutral	i was offered a £_00 off thank_you voucher off my next purchase !!!
neutral	as if i am going to buy more tyres or an exhaust in the near_future .
neutral	why can '_t they take it off the price i have already paid for my tyres ?
neutral	in my opinion it is a very empty thank_you and left me feeling out of pocket .
neutral	best not offer anything at all !
neutral	item well_packaged but delivered late even_tho i paid extra for next_day delivery .
neutral	they did ring back after i complained but i can '_t be_arsed to chase it up as they only answer phone 0 - 0 mon to fri and i '_m in work then .
neutral	pity eh_?
neutral	flowers intended to be delivered 0pm on saturday to guarantee receipt by mothers_day , they didn_'_t arrive_till monday_afternoon - which was disappointing .
neutral	( nobody let_me know they hadb '_t been delivered or that there was a problem .)
neutral	other than that mum delighted with flowers which were up to usual high_quality .
neutral	ordered 0 items in past year , 0 have been cancelled by hmv after anything from a day to 0_weeks for various_reasons .
neutral	( maybe i '_m unlucky )
neutral	i still order from them , i '_m just not too surprised if they cancel the order .
neutral	if they truly have the item in stock , you '_ll usually get a " it '_s on its way " email the next_day or so and everything is nice and fast .
neutral	the letting you know the item is in the post is a good touch .
neutral	if you find a really good bargain , just don_'_t be too surprised to get a cancel order email a few_days_later .
neutral	the money is refund quick enough so you can buy elsewhere if needed .
neutral	i '_ve had problems
neutral	very quick service and looks_like an excellent product i have not fitted it yet but i am hoping it is very good .
neutral	good trampoline but the surrounding pad over the springs is of the poorest cheapest quality tarpoulin material , very disappointing indeed , also trying to make the netting poles stay upright is a challenge and they move in use
neutral	0 out of 00
neutral	ordered a cooker online , didn_'_t look at any reviews , ooops !
neutral	was under the understanding it would probably be delivered in 0 - 0 days
neutral	called company to check all was well with order , spoke to a foreign lady , quite unhelpful , typical receptionist , told me they were not in stock and i had to wait a few weeks ,( they had my money !)
neutral	it said 0 were in stock on the order ???
neutral	asked for a refund , that was going to take 00 days !!!
neutral	what do you do ??
neutral	?
neutral	looked at reviews ..... awful , wished we ' d never ordered !
neutral	called back politely but firmly annoyed , mentioned the disappointing reviews , i was thinking watchdog was the next step , may have mentioned that to them !
neutral	asked to speak to manager but not allowed to or even be told her name , i googled it , every time i called was put on hold for ages !
neutral	manager now is not sarah potter but a new guy called rob apparently
neutral	was getting fed_up and ended_up speaking to a guy called gary who was seemed very nice and couldnt do enough to help
neutral	all of a sudden my cooker was in stock and delivered the following_monday ( yesterday )
neutral	two guys , not the chirpy friendly sort but they bought in it and put it in place and it works !
neutral	if you order ask to speak to gary and check progress , i understand they get a build up of orders then get the appliances in and make you wait , i was lucky but i persevered !!
neutral	!
neutral	remember speak to gary , nice guy !
neutral	huge queue picking_up car .
neutral	didn_' like having to pay for a full_tank .
neutral	but the car and people were fine .
neutral	haven_'_t had any trouble with transtools over several orders .
neutral	stuff takes a few_days to arrive , not a next_day outfit so if you do want it quick maybe look_elsewhere .
neutral	but the prices and range i think are good .
neutral	latest order was sent in two parcels , one parcel went_astray but that was citylink '_s fault and arrived the next_day [ website showed 0 parcels but they only delivered 0 ].
neutral	when i emailed transtools , they responded quickly .
neutral	you only know how good a company is when things go_wrong .
neutral	haven_'_t had cause to fault transtools yet so until then i '_m happy to keep using them .
neutral	good range of products .
neutral	good prices .
neutral	ordered a tennis_elbow strap , very easy process and easy to transact .
neutral	but the follow_up and delivery system were poor - paid for and was confirmed next_day delivery but nothing arrived and when i rang it worked out that the delivery wasn_'_t even programmed .
neutral	i did get a full_refund , but it took 0 days to get to that point .
neutral	value for money though a little_slow on delivery .
neutral	compared with amazon the delivery is slow .
neutral	otherwise , i '_m happy .
neutral	one of the outfits was the wrong_size
neutral	very quickly delivered .
neutral	not all the photos i ' d uploaded were printed on the card , there were a number of duplicates also .
neutral	slightly_disappointed with this , although appearance and quality of the card is very good .
neutral	been a customer of g0m for many_years during which time i have purchased guitars , leads , mixers , keyboards and many other music_related items , the service use to be a good one - hence my remaining a loyal_customer , as of late i have found the service to be slipping .
neutral	october_0000 , i contacted them about a guitar i was interested in and brought to their attention that it was £_00 more_expensive on their site than other music stores on the web , on the plus_side they reduced the price to bring it inline with the other stores i had seen it advertised on , i ordered the guitar ....... on opening the packagaing found the inner foam protective bag ripped and holed , on taking the guitar out found the protective_film on the pickups missing , body and headstock dirty and covered in fingermarks and dust , no protective_film on the scratchplate , and chips out of the paintwork .
neutral	having contacted them , they offered a further discount and apologised for the state in which it was sent out .
neutral	november 00th 0000 : placed an order for a number of items all of which were in stock , on taking delivery and checking the packaging found that they had sent a wrong item , so contacted them .... was told they would post a replacement out the same day ( this was on a thursday ) having not recieved the item in question on monday 00th contacted them again , said there had been a delay of 0 day and i should recieve it by wednesday 00st nov by 0nd_class post - how many websites offering goods for sale use 0nd_class postage ?????
neutral	?
neutral	00th_november finally recieved an email from g0m stating i would recieve the item wednesday ............... wouldn_'_t mind so much but at the time of ordering they had 000 of the item i wanted in stock - its taken 0 days to post out something that should have been with me in one .
neutral	this is not the first time i have been sent wrong items , recieved goods in a second rate manner ( dirty and marked ), have suggested on each_occasion for them to have a word with the warehouse staff who do the picking .
neutral	i used the company because of its prompt delivery of goods which saved me going shopping .
neutral	now delivery times much slower so will revert to shopping myself .
neutral	literally 0 hours after purchase , i called to cancel my order .
neutral	but shopto . net staff told me the shipping already started and i need to receive the item and ship back to get full_refund .
neutral	however , the item takes a week to get to me ... not a great experience at all
neutral	a good service but we had to wait for 00_minutes for the car to be collected , same on return only it was 00_minutes .
neutral	next time i would call them 00_minutes before my arrival
neutral	i ordered a shirt for a specific event , within lansen '_s published delivery schedules .
neutral	after a couple of days i hadn_'_t got a dispatch email so emailed them .
neutral	it hadn_'_t been sent and though i got my shirt in time for my event i don_'_t think i would have without my intervention .
neutral	ii was charged differently to what was stated on the final_bill !
neutral	i added some products which showed " as added " but never got included and only after you pay the money , you realise what you bought .
neutral	there is an issue with the system which i sure they will look into .
neutral	i added oats which did not get included and also i was showed the final_bill as something but when i confirmed everything and paid the bill it was different and certain products were removed .
neutral	this meant it charged for delivery where clearly it stated free delivery .
neutral	i informed gn and was told they will reimburse me for the delivery but still i had some missing items ( it did not charge me for the missing items ).
neutral	i going to say it was a bad_experience and possibly due to the large_volume of sales the stock could not be updated on the system quick enough !
neutral	might try again in the near_future
neutral	the images ( in print ) lacked vibrancy
neutral	overall we have never clained on this poilcy - and the cover seems to be good - however as my wife has a pre_- existing_medical_condition ( asthma ) - we have to contact the screening to advise
neutral	previously this has_been at no additional_cost - nothing has changed with the condition but money was requested this time
neutral	we hired a dacia logan from otopeni airport bucharesti and from driving it away the windscreen washers didn_'_t work .
neutral	we got them fixed and they worked for another 00 days then broke_down again !
neutral	for about half of our hire time we couldn_'_t get into the boot of the car as the lock broke !
neutral	finally the 0000 engine in the logan is useless .
neutral	it wouldn_'_t pull the cap of your head !
neutral	well - would you wait in all day to receive your purchase - ordinarily i do not have to with dpd , tnt to name but two , you get a one hour delivery slot - not so with citylink - if you miss delivery , and you do not know when its coming as they do not email you , you get a choice of days when you are out , and , anyway if you were in , you have to wait in all day - so you have to get it yourself from the " local_depot " - 00 mile_round_trip .
neutral	so if your supplier told you that citylink were their logistics option would you still buy from them ?
neutral	- i never use any supplier if i know the delivery is by citylink .
neutral	nice furniture but long wait
neutral	they processed the phone in under a day , but decided to wait 0 days before printing a cheque to post ... why ?
neutral	so it was a total of 00 days after envirofone received my phone before i received my cheque .
neutral	if i was cynical , i ' d say that the delay is to allow them to maximise interest on their capital .
neutral	the flowers were great and much_admired , however , the enclosed vase was broken into many pieces and was unrepairable ( the box protecting it was quite crushed ) and delivery was rather late in the day ( early evening ) although on the correct day .
neutral	flew with easyjet again after a few_years break , i have to say they '_ve really upped their game .. clean planes , friendly cabin_crew , etc ... unless ryanair lowered my expectations from the aviation industry ?
neutral	.. but if you have a problem , i suspect they are difficult to deal with .
neutral	goods arrived as_described and in good order in 0 days via gls .
neutral	price was very good , but i was completely unable to contact snowinn via the uk phone number and they did not reply to my email .
neutral	the order tracking_link sent from snowinn for the gls site did not work ; you have to enter your snowinn order number into the gls tracking site and search for your order in the list .
neutral	gls '_s system would not accept my post_code , so could not request information from them .
neutral	gls have no uk contact number and parcel_force knew nothing because it had not arrived in the country .
neutral	i was able to pick_up the car ok at the airport , alamo '_s staff were courteous and efficient .
neutral	i advised the desk staff that i was going to visit canada , however a major safety factor was overlooked .
neutral	the car did not have winter_tyres_fitted , and with the snow and black ice on some of the roads , traction was not good and i had to drive very slowly .
neutral	this was a major concern , especially with my family in the car .
neutral	winter_tyres should be mandatory on all vehicles between november and april , or whenever the snow melts .
neutral	i '_m not from a snowy country , and the need for winter_tyres was never explained to me by alamo or anyone_else .
neutral	in hindsight , i really believe that it was only by the grace of god that we got through unscathed .
neutral	i also paid for roadside_assistance , but when a tyre deflated , two_separate assistance providers attended but would not access the spare tyre , which was housed at the underside of the car .
neutral	i lost more than a full day , from noon on 0 / 0 / 00 to 0 :_00pm on 0 / 0 / 00 because the whole car had to be transported on a tilt - tray truck to the next major town for the tyre to be changed inside a workshop .
neutral	stayed at norwich , riverside , im not saying it was poor just that it didn_'_t suit me and didn_'_t consider it value for money .
neutral	booked a room for one for one night - £_00 which included breakfast .
neutral	parking was free .
neutral	the staff were pleasant and polite but not that helpful on reception , never been there before - booked in and asked where to find my room , i was carrying my bags / suit , staff pointed towards the entrance and said " its just to the left " - so i walked out the doors and turned left - all doors on the outside are locked , walked back in reception to ask again - and only then did they show me the door on the left next to reception - so they watched me walk out of the building after asking where my room was , carrying everything and no one thought that i had missed the correct door ?
neutral	when the door was shown to me they just said your room 000 - " its that way " - so you go looking for it yourself .
neutral	the room - everything in it was cheap - reasonable condition but furnished from the pound shop , net_curtains on a wire - the old thick grey looking type and only just covered the width - no gather so it looked like an old factory window .
neutral	carpet - not hovered properly and again from the pound shop , a rubbish £ 0 kettle that takes 00_minutes to boil , hated the foam pillows .
neutral	the tv was quite good though .
neutral	breakfast , i found it a disappointment , eggs were like frisbies - should be cooked to order and the tea is luke_warm as no boiling_water is available - just hot_water in one of those press the plunger dispensers , i mentioned this to staff but there was no offer to get some boiling_water - its ok though if you drink coffee .
neutral	free wifi for just 00_minutes , they know that once you connect you will exceed this limit and they earn another £ 0 - after paying £_00 for one night i expect it free for the duration .
neutral	never stayed in a premier_inn before but i wouldn_'_t chance another , i guess its horses for courses and i was at the wrong course .
neutral	a straightforward boiler exchange , old glowworm hideaway for a new worcester 00ri - with hive - £ 0000 .
neutral	the quote lists items needed and individual part prices - everything is inflated pricewise from internet prices .
neutral	boiler £_000 and horizontal flue £_000 . 00 - bg -£ 0000 - internet £_000 inc delivery .
neutral	quoted for a plume kit that i don_'_t want or need - £_000 . 00 internet £_00 .
neutral	£ 0000 fitting , £_000 . 00 to connect electrics , £_000 . 00 specialist building work - so , a few bricks to close up the size of the old flue to the new one , £ 0000 doesn_'_t include connecting electrics just screw to wall , connect flow / return and gas .
neutral	how can they justify their charges ?.
neutral	decided not to go with bg , my old boiler works_perfectly fine so just having hive fitted so i have better control of the boiler .
neutral	bg rang me today to see if i was going ahead - i said no , they queried why , explained not a competitive quote , even charging me £_00 . 00 to take the old boiler away - i said i will keep the old boiler - apparently that '_s not allowed - seems they take_ownership of my property for free and charge me £_00 for doing so - cheeky or what .
neutral	the whole_experience felt_like dealing_with a dodgy second - hand car salesman
neutral	my recent auction ended with a buyer selecting the buy it now option , however , it seems the buyers account had been hacked and quite understandably ebay cancelled the listing , returned my fees and confirmed the buyers account had been re - secured .
neutral	so my option was to relist , however , when relisting i noted the amount of the cancelled listing still counts against my monthly total sales allowance , on contacting ebay they confirm this is indeed their practice - and told me to apply for a higher allowance - but why should i , ebay cancelled the listing and zeroed everything but my sales limit .
neutral	ebay protect buyers , even the scammers but are completely unsympathetic to cheated sellers - if there going to end a listing and zero the fees then they should do a complete job - its only a matter of telling the software how to do it .
neutral	the buy it now option should not automatically end a sale - it should suspend it with a banner indicating " under offer from buy it now ", the seller should have the option to confirm payment received - via_paypal and that action should end the auction , a non payment or for another reason the seller should be able to refuse the bin offer and restore the auction to where it was prior to the bin .
neutral	hey_presto - 0 days after this review my sales balance has_been zeroed - coincidence ?
neutral	now i wonder_if i was told wrongly by the ebay help line or this review has made them see sense .
neutral	ebay - im just waiting for the day when we have a competitor for selling , i do use amazon for most purchases but im not particularly happy with you - and you are very expensive - the feedback protocols are anti sellers too .
neutral	reasonable value for money however the pink_roses within the bunch have died after one day despite following the care instructions
neutral	i am sure you know that there is a lot to be done to improve the ' looks of the facilities ' ... you will get there for sure ( i hope )
neutral	many_thanks anyway for you assistance ...
neutral	i have two printers but as i write quite a few letters weekly i write them on my computer so i can save them and i then print them , i use my old printer as i do not need the colour_cartridge for this , as a pensioner budget is obviously a issue and i have had a couple of cartridges although they are the compatible type dont last more than a few documents . this is especially if i use the colour ones , the cartridges are t000 & t000 and are budget priced , obviously this is pointless if they only last for a few documents .

neutral	overall the villa was very nice .
neutral	a decent size for the group that we had staying .
neutral	there were a number of problems on separate days regarding the bathrooms and toilets , but the villa_plus agents were very helpful and had plumbers on sight in a short time .
neutral	location is excellent and within walking_distance of shops , restaurants and the beach front .
neutral	one big negative was the wifi .
neutral	everyone had problems connecting to this , and even when connected , signal was minimal and slow .
neutral	previously had faultless service .
neutral	thought flowers would arrive in prepared bouquet with flowers already blooming .
neutral	recipient was very disappointed that they arrived in a box bunched together .
neutral	wasn_'_t very impressed .
neutral	not quite as_described - ie pics showed glass but it wasnt delivered with it & therefore cost a lot more to get bespoke made up .
neutral	flowers were ok but not as good as website and didn_'_t last that long before they started to die
neutral	i ordered a pair of half glasses using a promotion_code to 0 for one .
neutral	when they arrived , i only received one pair of glasses , so not such good value :(
neutral	i had two new tyres_fitted at the strood branch and the tracking adjusted .
neutral	the staff were very friendly and the work carried_out efficiently .
neutral	on collection the wheel_nut covers were missing from one wheel and the gear knob and steering_wheel were dirty .
neutral	i rang about the covers and the staff_member said he would have a look for them and ring straight back .
neutral	i never_heard_anything .
neutral	national were very slightly_cheaper_than kwik_fit but the last time i used them the service was better .
neutral	i ordered a pharmaceutical product on saturday or sunday , don_'_t remember what day , and expected it monday or tuesday at the latest .
neutral	on wednesday i received a call asking what time would be good to deliver it - they ' d been trying to reach me .
neutral	fair_enough , coincidentally my mobile_phone was stolen and i had it cut_off .
neutral	however , in the past , the product merely showed up at my doorstop , seeming hours ( but really the next_day ) after the order was placed - no one had to call me to find out when someone would want to be home .
neutral	next , i shared with the person calling me that " i had never been called before prior to a delivery - the product use arrived " - after initial disagreement , i finally convinced her this was the first time i ' d been called for a delivery .
neutral	finally , she was initially reluctant to call our nanny / housekeeper - she initially asked if i would do it - and then she acquiesed at my ' insistence '.
neutral	once again , i feel as though i went through a drawn_out process , when in the past the delivery came rather briskly with no further intervention by myself .
neutral	good luck !
neutral	blew out a tyre on saturday_evening .
neutral	ordered a pair of new ones sunday .
neutral	booked for wednesday pm at checkout .
neutral	monday received a phonecall saying that as i am in inverness the tyres couldn_'_t be fitted until thursday .
neutral	thursday checked with national .
neutral	no tyres .
neutral	phoned tyreshopper - tyres confirmed as dispatched , definitely be there friday .
neutral	friday phoned national .
neutral	no tyres .
neutral	tyreshopper then told me that the courier had stuffed up and that the tyres would be stuck in their depot until tuesday .
neutral	they tried to find me suitable_alternative tyres from national , but none in stock .
neutral	then offered a £_00 goodwill refund , which i accepted .
neutral	shorty after national phoned to tell me that the tyres had arrived and could be fitted saturday .
neutral	tyres_fitted saturday_afternoon , after a one hour wait .
neutral	0 days without a spare from point of order .
neutral	£_00 refund received following wednesday .
neutral	rating is made up of the following :
neutral	price - 0 *
neutral	ease of communications and friendliness - 0 *
neutral	competence of communications - 0 *
neutral	promised delivery ( at checkout ) - 0 *
neutral	agreed rescheduled delivery - 0 *
neutral	actual delivery - 0 *
neutral	the real problem is that tyreshopper don_'_t manage the whole_process .
neutral	they order tyres from the wholesaler / manufacturer , and then rely_on them to arrange delivery to a third_party fitter .
neutral	if anything_goes_wrong they either can '_t or won_'_t chase the courier directly , but rather follow_up via manufacturer / wholesaler .
neutral	god_knows what would have happened if the courier had actually lost them .
neutral	last order there was 00 tiles chipped because of bad packing , just managed to finish my tiling job by extra cutting .
neutral	product itself is fine and 000_% as_described and expected .
neutral	what irritated was the £ 0 +_p_&_p charge with no options for a cheaper or slower , delivery - for an aerosol that weighs next to nothing although it is relatively bulky .
neutral	to be completely fair though , this was stated with the order and was not a surprise - but is still pps .
neutral	i have being with the three network for around seven_years , the bills are small , so no_problems there , you get what they say , free anytime , anynetwork free mins , brilliant , free texts , ( mms and video messages are limited ) so_far so good , the phone i had to start with very good , and the upgrade at the end of the first contract , but the third phone was crap , good camera , thats about all , within mins of getting it i was on the phone saying it wasnt what i wanted and asked for a different phone but because i had operated it to check out what it was like , which you have to do lets_face it , you have to set date and time etc to get it to open .... so there you have it used phone wont change because the settings have being altered ?
neutral	then you settle_down to use a phone you dont like , so you have problems so you phone there 000 line only to find your talking to an overseas foriener who doesnt understand you or them you , so i couldnt wait for the contract to run out , so you give them a months notice in writing , only to find them contacting me several days after the letter was in there hands ( actually 0_weeks ) and find that the contract wont finish untill 00 days after you speak to there operater ....... what the hells all that about , what a con .......
neutral	pros - great price and great range of products
neutral	cons - website has_been a pain to use , shipping_costs weren_'_t clear on the site , slow response to emails
neutral	i was a bit disappointed that on arrival at funchal airport to find that budget did not have an office there .
neutral	i had to ring them and they bought the car to the airport about 00_minutes latter .
neutral	the same when returning the car , there was no one at the airport to take the car back .
neutral	i had to ring them three_times before someone came to collect the car an_hour late , i wouldn_'_t mind but i rang the day before to make_sure they had the correct time .
neutral	having said all that the car was terrific value and i will use auto_europe again .
neutral	thanks guys .
neutral	got to leeds /_bradford long_stay in good time ( 0 - 0 hours prior to flight ) having already booked parking .
neutral	only to find no parking slots available .
neutral	eventually ended_up parking at end of row in a non define space .
neutral	not had any such issue with other uk airports !
neutral	!
neutral	this time good service and delivery
neutral	this is the second time we have purchased unit from microdream
neutral	first order was within there prediction but we could have done with tracking
neutral	number etc
neutral	the service was excellent , but the advertised capacity of the box we bought was too generous .
neutral	it was accurate at 0 litres , brim full , but as the lid needs about 0 cm at the top this left us well short of 0 litres with the lid on .
neutral	i ' d guess this is down to the box manufacturer , not plasticbox , but i think they should check their adverts and note things like this .
neutral	plasticbox have taken the trouble to measure the boxes - but they specifically say these measurements are approximate and with the caveats it is clear you cannot calculate effective volume - who wouldn_'_t take the 0 litres advertised ?
neutral	anyway , the boxes are good and will do a job .
neutral	a few issues - the website payment service failed , the correction to my postal_address was ignored , they used my work e_- mail in error and the box the watch arrived in did not relate to the watch i bought .
neutral	i am pleased with the watch .
neutral	i didn_'_t receive and email confirmation when i placed an order online , no_drama , a quick phone_call to you sorted it out .
neutral	flowers were all as ordered , delivered by the required tight_deadline , but without a card !
neutral	i purchased a voucher from kgb deals paying around £_00 for a voucher worth £_00 .
neutral	this seemed a great deal especially when looking at the prices on the website .
neutral	i purchased some valentino glasses and was impressed that i only had to pay £_00ish for glasses worth £_000 .
neutral	unfortunately despite_being in the mens section they arrived and with a girly pinky / purple trim .
neutral	when i looked more carefully the description stated they were more suited for women ( so why put them in the men '_s section ).
neutral	anyway eye - sale did exchange them which i appreciate they are legally not obliged to do .
neutral	the customer service was very good and speed to contact was excellent .
neutral	however it was still frustrating to have to pay £_00 for another pair of glasses in exchange ( to delivery and half price lenses ).
neutral	i ordered my product online and their system said it would be in stock within 0 days .
neutral	00 days_later it arrived into stock .
neutral	i wrote an email to get an update and i never got a reply .
neutral	when my product arrived in their store it was despatched straight_away .
neutral	delivery was very prompt as i received it the next_day .
neutral	it was a good quality costume , got delivered really quickly , good service but it didn_'_t fit
neutral	received an email that the parcel had been delivered , it had but not to me .
neutral	0 days_later found out it was delivered to a neighbour .
neutral	simple things like a card through the door would save the frustration .
neutral	as i understand it , most orders placed with takeaway . com are relayed automatically to the restaurants .
neutral	in some cases , this method is not available , so has to be done manually .
neutral	this was the case with this order and due to human_error somewhere along the line , the order was not placed .
neutral	i called the restaurant and they had no idea i had made an order .
neutral	i spoke to takeaway . com and they done their best to recitfy the situation .
neutral	although from the time i placed the initial order it took 00_minutes for the pizza to arrive , this was in fact only 00 / 00_minutes after takeaway . com contacted the restaurant once they were aware something was wrong .
neutral	to be honest , when i found out the order was not placed i kicked off .
neutral	i was not happy .
neutral	stavros took the bull by the horns and rectified it for me .
neutral	i was not happy at the delay , but i am happy that someone out there understands customer service while also not just being a wet drip and saying yes to customers for no reason .
neutral	it is good to know that if there is an issue with an order , takeaway . com have processes in place that have the potential to help .
neutral	pizza was tasty , although on delivery one of them was completely filled in only half the box , must have slipped at some point during delivery .
neutral	the glasses were great and so was the price .
neutral	the only fault i have with the whole purchase from_start to finish was the attention to detail displayed by the technicians who made the glasses .
neutral	the nose_pads left my nose so sore it was ridiculous .
neutral	i tried to adjust them myself , but i couldnt seem to make them better .
neutral	they seemed to have been setup for an alien as i have never met a man or woman whose nose would have found these comfortable without adjustment .
neutral	the gap was way too small for an adult male .
neutral	the opticians i took them too said they must have been prepared by someone_who had never fitted a pair of glasses to a human_being .
neutral	they left my nose really sore and cost me £ 0 at an optician to fix them .
neutral	i completely understand that as an online_retailer it would be impossible to send out glasses that fitted every customer perfectly but seriously , why_bother sending them out unsuitable for use by 00_% of the population .
neutral	at_least make an effort to make them wearable .
neutral	i would consider glasses_direct again in the future , but i would also be tempted to look at suppliers who at_least try to make something wearable
neutral	added after glasses directs response ...
neutral	+ 0 for glasses_direct for responding to my review so quickly .
neutral	refunding me the £ 0 was a nice_touch .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	unfortunately i wont be able to send them back to you as i need to use them daily .
neutral	dear serenata the flowers that you delivered to my house for my partner were very attractive and festive , but i have to say having been in the flower trade for a number of years i thort they were very small for what i paid !
neutral	i appreciate that this time of year is always a bit more_expensive but feel 0 roses with a bit of greenery is not really value for money , as i said the presentation of the flowers was good and delivery fine but the size was a bit dissapointing .
neutral	many_thanks
neutral	the positives are that payment is quick and communication is excellent .
neutral	the negatives are that too many items are rejected .
neutral	it is not unusual to enter 00 items and to have 0 of them rejected .
neutral	for this reason during many transactions i have given up and given the items to charity or sold them to music_magpie .
neutral	another negative is that prices can be a bit mean , even lower_than music_magpie sometimes and that '_s saying something .
neutral	unfortunately the descriptions are getting worse , loads of pretty words but trying to find the key information is useless .
neutral	an example , looking for an insulated screwdriver .
neutral	so the key points are : screwdriver , insulated , bit type & length .
neutral	then display the options , i ’_m not worried_about the make , laser tipped etc .
neutral	the first two options are fine but try finding a specific tip type is not something axminster think you need to worry_about ??????
neutral	obviously written by someone in an office who just thinks the colour is the most_important feature .
neutral	had to go_elsewhere .
neutral	it was a quick and speedy service and i very happy for that .
neutral	i did find that i had made a mistake in imputing my phone details and completed the form to change it .
neutral	i did not recieve an email with a reply and the items were not checked properly as they state that they double_check all the products they receive and give a new pricing .
neutral	apart_from that all was good , it would be nice to know what happened with that order
neutral	i was happy with the speed and the price of the order but the product range has changed each year and i am_afraid the poduct choice for my requirement had reduced and the product was less_than satisfactory
neutral	good quick service only problem was delivery .
neutral	the delivery company did nor delver when they said they would .
neutral	this is a big problem as the order was for caninsulin which has to be stored in the fridge .
neutral	i booked a speedy shuttle transfer from palma_airport to our apartment in puerta pollensa .
neutral	this was roughly three_times the cost of the shared shuttle on the basis that we would be dropped_off quicker after what was a long day with a 00 year_old child in tow .
neutral	in fact we waited in sweltering heat for about an_hour before we set off and received exactly the same service as if i had booked the shared shuttle .
neutral	resort_hopper is a decent enough company but you ' re wasting your money if you go for anything other than the basic serice .
neutral	as above to date waiting 0 days_later
neutral	ok , phoned in / emailed few_times .
neutral	first time i was told it would take 0 days to complete my order , from the day you hold a deposit from my bank .
neutral	i then get told over the phone it is 0 days .
neutral	then 0 day '_s after you have taken the deposit , so was baffled with who to take there word for .
neutral	though it takes 0 days from warehouse , then another 0 days assembly , a day to quality control it i assume .
neutral	kind of a long gap through it all and with added confusion of the updates with your customer_services on it all .
neutral	though there was a problem with a fan not fitting the base i had ordered but no one thought to let_me know , only that i had phoned , did they choose to let_me know .
neutral	almost as a " your on the phone now , so we will say " would you of actually asked me if i was happy for another fan to be put in ?
neutral	?
neutral	started out alright but since we found doors missing and damaged , and drawer
neutral	fronts with no design on them ( ordered chichester ), the experience has got worse
neutral	as it has taken longer to deliver the faulty doors etc .
neutral	and i am still_waiting .
neutral	they said
neutral	the faulty items would be delivered around the 00th_feb , but get an e_- mail on the
neutral	00th_feb to say it will be now 0th_march , after phone_call found out the e_- mail on the
neutral	00th was an error .
neutral	also my fitter can not finish of my kitchen because of the delay
neutral	as he has to start another job , so i am not sure when he will be able to finish it .
neutral	issues with dpd delivery driver not finding the address and then not calling to ask ( flat above a shop - required to walk around a corner !).
neutral	was not easy to contact dpd directly due to their automated_systems , so called sol for help .
neutral	generally the attitude was poor - not particularly the advisor on the call who , in fairness , was trying to help , but more the company policy .
neutral	eventually sorted everything out with dpd directly , however i was left_feeling rather un - loved and messed about .
neutral	not a great customer experience , and has left a bit of a sour_taste in my mouth .
neutral	if you have no issues , you are quids in , it '_s just a risk i wouldn_'_t be prepared to take again …
neutral	better when it was a yorkshire owned / based company .
neutral	get_rid of the walmart tag , even_though you own asda .
neutral	your vehicles clog up the roads with their silly speed restrictions .
neutral	you ' d be better off training the drivers than causing hold_ups and frustration , ( which inevitably leads to bad driving on the part of others ).
neutral	i '_ve placed 0 orders with them , after about 0_weeks only 0 of them has tracked so have had to lodge claims for the sake of about 00p an item :
neutral	0 with rubbersoles . co . uk which tracked immediately with no_problems
neutral	0 with play . com which have not tracked at all
neutral	0 with tesco which has also not tracked
neutral	i guess it all depends on the reliability of the merchant to report the sale to top_cashback , which it is not in their best_interests to do .
neutral	i will keep using them , but if there '_s any more of this i won_'_t bother as it '_s not worth my time to keep chasing amounts of 00p odd .
neutral	clock only runs for 0 hours - 00_hours would be more useful .
neutral	happy with boots , but had some_confusion with checkout .
neutral	a couple of weeks_ago i thought i had bought some boots through the web shop , and paid through paypal .
neutral	when the boots didn_'_t arrive i looked back at my order email and saw the confirmation_email was just saying ' welcome to rubbersoles '.
neutral	when i went back to the site the boots were still in the basket .
neutral	i rang up , and it was all sorted_out on the phone so happy in the end , but i think there must have been a glitch for me to think i had ordered something when i hadn_'_t .
neutral	i might have missed getting them for christmas if i hadn_'_t thought to check .
neutral	i think it '_s best to leave this as honest feedback , in that if you have other people reporting something similiar , you will know there is an issue .
neutral	had the misfortune of a couple of hiccups .
neutral	someone_elses name came up connected with my policy who i did not name or even know - i . t .
neutral	glich !
neutral	!
neutral	incorrect splling on my flexible trust form , told this would not make any difference .
neutral	would not be around to witness that so not convinced on that .
neutral	all issues have ben resolved but not convinced with the whole_procedure .
neutral	on the positive_side , i got the full_refund fairly promptly .
neutral	like most people i got into debt slowly , due to no life style changes and decreasing value of my income .
neutral	i the end a large part of my income was paying just the interest particularly with my credit_card .
neutral	calculated that at the rate i was paying of my card it would take about seventy tears .
neutral	thanks to my advisors we were able to negotiate with my creditors a realistic monthly payment plan .
neutral	updated :
neutral	well , the resolution took far longer_than it should have done but eventually i got through to someone able to effect change and received if not full compensation for the inconvenience at_least something that wasn_'_t a slap in the face .
neutral	i ' d probably still avoid due to the hassle when things go_wrong but i '_m_sure if nothing goes_wrong they ' re the same as anyone_else .
neutral	original review
neutral	unbelievably poor customer_services !
neutral	never known anything like it in 00 years of online shopping !
neutral	took money twice , 0 horus of calls to ' find ' second amount .
neutral	handset never delivered , but they couldn_'_t find it without ' telephone_number '.
neutral	millions of repeat questionos and holds from indian_call staff , very obstructive and rude .
neutral	oh , and the ' complaints team '.
neutral	ha
neutral	we can '_t offer you that .
neutral	well , what can you offer me ?
neutral	some credit on your account ?
neutral	well , this fiasco has cost me around £_000 in time
neutral	no , not that much
neutral	what then ?
neutral	you have to activate the sim , then call us and we '_ll see what we want to put on it .
neutral	you think i '_m ever giving you business again ?
neutral	really ?
neutral	how about the handset you were supposed to send me , how to activate without a handset ?
neutral	don_'_t know
neutral	can you send me a pre_paid sim instead ?
neutral	no , we can '_t do that .
neutral	if it wasn_'_t annoying it would have been a bit funny .
neutral	with a bit of luck the 0g race will demonstrate that 0 are as expired as their name now is !
neutral	original review - i would not purchase from ebuyer again ( after spending c . £ 0 , 000 over the last 0 - 0 years ) based on their response to my recent return under the distance_selling_regulations , where their trained squirrel quoted an oftguidance document and beleived it to take precedence over the actual legislation !
neutral	' i know about the sale of goods_act ' was her response , which was nice , but tht ' a s a different piece of legislation to the distance_selling_regulations 0000 and the oft document is open to interpretation whereas the legislation is clear on leaving the customer out of pocket for returns under the0 day period of the distance sellings regs !
neutral	suffice to say ( fortunately i am in the legal profession so my fees will be coming out of ebuyers pocket ) taking them to small_claims court as it is a principal that amazon , play , and other good e_- tailers don_'_t abuse .
neutral	will shop at amazon or dabs from now on as always had excellent service and well trained_staff .
neutral	that said , very little has ever been returnred to any of them !
neutral	updated following the very fast ' response ' from ebuyer '_s nikki .
neutral	absolute diddly squat !
neutral	funny how they can instantly respond to such reviews and ' sound ' great and concerned to anyone reading them , but then ... still do nothing !
neutral	if their service was as good as their responding to poor reviews , then there would probably be no poor reviews !
neutral	update !
neutral	should have updated this a while ago !
neutral	ebuyer did remedy this issue and acknowledged that it was the goods at fault .
neutral	although they required chasing which should have been needed , they did reimburse my out of pocket expenses in sending back the defective goods .
neutral	note that they took less_than an_hour to test the items to find them not suitable .
neutral	as such , i have altered the rating to 0_stars as this is a ' middle of the road ' experience now that resolution has passed rather_than a truly_awful one .
neutral	hopefully they will have learnt from the customer service experience .
neutral	i will find out when making future_purchases .
neutral	we had problems on arrival and had to wait nearly an_hour to have our car collected .
neutral	this was caused in part as we could not reach the number given and when we did they claimed no knowledge of us .
neutral	eventually a very helpful man picked_up the car and we went on holiday albeit with hardly_any time to spare to catch the flight .
neutral	coming home the whole system was excellent car was there and we went on our way .
neutral	so not bad but stress_free it was not .
neutral	ordered an air_hockey table , with 0 / 0 days delivery , then email_explaining that due to the extra orders going through would be another couple of days .
neutral	the truth was the tables were never in stock .
neutral	on contacting them we paid an extra £_00 to get a table that we were told was in stock and would be dispatched the same day with next_day delivery .
neutral	on checking with madfun the following_day , it was still in their warehouse , and would go out shortly .
neutral	promising delivery on the 00nd or 00th_dec . it '_s now boxing_day !
neutral	well_done for wrecking our 0 year_old_son '_s christmas day , who now thinks father christmas doesn_'_t love him and put him on the naughty list ...........
neutral	morning of the 00th and it has just arrived .
neutral	delivery note stated that it was collected on the 00st .
neutral	so the fault lies with the delivery company rather_than with madfun .
neutral	due to the delivery not being in time for christmas , madfun were good to their word and reimbursed half the original cost .
neutral	maybe they should look at a new haulage contractor ..........
neutral	everything_went ok apart_from there was no ribbon to tie up the gift bag , they forgot to put it in and that is a bit slack !
neutral	could do better
neutral	i purchased 0 sticks of 0gb_memory to upgrade my desktop_pc , very easy to order and very quick delivery , but on upgrading my pc on first boot up my pc totally froze and locked up .
neutral	so i carried_out mr_memory ’_s instructions on how to test the memory , but it still caused problems and various screens appeared like windows has discovered a fault and is shutting_down , so i returned my purchase to mr_memory for a refund .
neutral	i have since purchased memory from another_provider and they have worked_fine no troubles at all .
neutral	all in all i just think the memory purchased from mr_memory where just faulty .
neutral	all correspondence with mr_memory have been dealt_with in an excellent manner and i have been kept up to date by e_- mail from mr_memory .
neutral	i am now just just awaiting my refund
neutral	the buying experience and delivery was excellent and generally the website is more informative than most , except it seems for the product i purchased ( 0 x 00lt fusion box & lid ( pack of 0 )).
neutral	the internal measurement shown is not the minimum measurement ( at the base of the box ) as stated on other products on this website and the boxes themselves are made by crystal , which is not stated at all .
neutral	had i known , i could have bought them locally for less .
neutral	i thought i was getting a better quality product and was disappointed when they arrived , especially when i saw how they were packaged , which was minimal to say the least , compared to other internet based plastic box suppliers i use .
neutral	i would need much more precise information , probably confirmed by telephone , about a product , before i buy from this site again .
neutral	the package arrived alot quicker_than expect .
neutral	i was given the option of a monday , tuesday or wednesday .
neutral	i specified a wednesday which was confirmed by text .
neutral	i also asked if i was not around to place package at the back of house and not with a neighbour .
neutral	the package was delivered on a saturday and left with a neighbour this all worked out well , however what was the piont of initiating a chioce of delivery days and where i wanted the package placed if unavailable if they were not going to stick to it .
neutral	the glasses are great .
neutral	the only problem is that you cannot try before you buy .
neutral	i had to return two_pairs before i got a pair that fitted , which meant it took three_weeks to get the glasses and cost me two lots of return postage , which was almost £_00 for insured postage .
neutral	tickets had a face value of € 00 , ordered 0 and by the time you check out its €_000 , booking_fees , shipping fees , taxes .
neutral	unfortunately the £ 0 voucher , which expired on the 00st_october , arrived with the parcel on the 0th_november .
neutral	how do you rate my reply ?
neutral	only joking , but i run my business so that i know how everything '_s working .
neutral	then i don_'_t have to ask people how i '_m doing .
neutral	ordered bred 00 from the site and they gave_me a box with a huge crease in it like it was on the bottom of a heavy stack
neutral	the internet booking was fine , the fitting of the tyres with the tracking etc all completed on time
neutral	but - on driving 000_miles on the m00 and m0 , i noticed the balance wasn_'_t right .
neutral	i took the car back - no_problems did it again .
neutral	but - not correcetted
neutral	had to go back a again ( yesterday ).
neutral	as yet , not been on a long run to test them , so fingers_crossed
neutral	but - staff polite and responded to my concerns without_question
neutral	website ordering excellent .
neutral	tried to contact through website portal regarding lack of instructions supplied with equipment and everytime said failure .
neutral	so still i have no information_regarding setting_up of ignition timing .
neutral	this is a disappointment after such a great initial experience .
neutral	maybe it is a website setup issue that requires correcting .
neutral	i ordered a humax hdr0000s freesat pvr from electricshop .
neutral	this was my first ever order with them .
neutral	i chose electricshop as they were the cheapest reputable store i could_find on the web .
neutral	order communication was good , and the item arrived promptly today .
neutral	however , when i opened the grey mail bag , i was very disappointed to discover that this item had just been shipped in its retail packaging , and not in a box .
neutral	this is not ideal for fragile products that contain hdds .
neutral	i actually ordered a youview_box direct from humax last_week , and that was sent in a strong_cardboard_box and packed with additional airbags to insulate the product from the inevitable rough_handling by couriers .
neutral	if humax ship their products like this , then so should resellers of their products .
neutral	my sister liked the flowers so that side of things should be ok .
neutral	they were also delivered in time .
neutral	but i was expecting them to be delivered inside the vase so she didn_'_t have to do it herself but apparently the vase was delivered separately in a box .
neutral	here in the uk , once i received the flowers directly in the vase and it was a lovely experience .
neutral	i find it a bit_pricey as well .
neutral	it is great to be able to send flowers to another country but with these prices i would only do it when i absolutely have no other option .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	order stuff from this company and it will arrive incomplete because they have to order from holland .
neutral	i have ordered at_least 0 times because the lighting they sell suits my needs , but god it is a messy business ordering and receiving .
neutral	and the stuff they sell is not cheap , i wish they would polish their act it is very frustrating waiting weeks and weeks for stuff to arrive when you hope it is going to arrive sooner_than later ....
neutral	excellent products and a wide product range that means dieting is much more achievable as the boredom factor is overcome .
neutral	diversity of diet techniques from rapid weight_loss to long_term adjustments means that one can try an_alternative technique if one suddenly finds oneself struggling with temptation or suddenly more motivated to see a quicker weight_loss .
neutral	difficulty ordering on line i . e passwords / email not being recognized , quite frustrating as new customer !
neutral	spoke to someone after ( 0nd ) phone_call / first call told i could only order on line ( not true )
neutral	( 0nd call ) man meant well , but found myself repeating info + it felt_like a very long phone_call and probably expensive by the time we finished .
neutral	whilst the product so_far seems fine , and the delivery drivers were exceptional , i thought that the disinterested / uninformed attitude of the people i spoke to on the phone for both the initial order and then the delivery arrangements were quite disappointing .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t been into the store to see the product myself i would have not continued with my order .
neutral	tnt messed_up an excellent service .
neutral	i will highly_recommend this company irresppective of my experience with the hope tnt will not be in charge of delivery .
neutral	i use iphone for internet ..
neutral	it took me 00mins to leave a review for a company it only took me 0 mins to book return transfers from airport to hotel not happy .. takes 0 sec delay for what you type to come up on screen ..
neutral	same del in tryin to navigate site :(
neutral	the wine kit that i ordered came in good time but it had leaked in transit .
neutral	the packaging around the kit was just crumpled newspaper .
neutral	i do not think this gave adequate_protection , considering that two of the kit components are liquids .
neutral	further , the cap on the bottle of concentrate did not have a seal .
neutral	this contributed to the leakage .
neutral	the kit is usable , but it could have been much worse .
neutral	i signed_up to save some money on car insurance renewal .
neutral	it was all very easy , but it did take quite a while for the money to appear in my cash_back account .
neutral	i would think lots of people just forget a bout the money and the account becomes dormant .
neutral	i ordered a sink and tap for a new kitchen .
neutral	tap arrived but not the sink and it wasn_'_t till i chased that i found out a fault had been noted and they were getting a replacement .
neutral	quality issue would appear to be with manufacturer so no fault with taps uk .
neutral	e_- bay messages were responded to reasonably quickly and issue was resolved .
neutral	refund for returned sink took a while to appear .
neutral	they offer good products at a good price just the only thing that lets them down is the period the item takes to get to you , not sure you '_ll want to wait :/ you may want to pay £ 0 extra o get a quicker delivery from else where .
neutral	the travelex service in general was good .
neutral	the delivery of money was on time and the website was clear up to a point .
neutral	i used a credit_card to pay and this accrues fees and interest as it is considered a cash advance .
neutral	this is not clearly_shown on the travelex site and while the blame for this rip_off lies primarily with the credit_card companies a warning about fees , which travelex must be aware of , would have been appreciated .
neutral	not worned of avis being off airport , so not sure what was happening , finally picked_up by transport and taken off to their new office but late at night not too sure where we where taken , so the return of the car was a little dificult to find , but once there we where then transported back to the airport quite quickly ,
neutral	since the aiport was sold to increase competition the new owners have seen this as a way to fleece customers of every_penny for a poor parking service .
neutral	used to be my first choice edi , not any more , i '_m prepared to drive the extra 00_mins .
neutral	to gla and save a pretty penny on parking
neutral	should e_mail you or text you when delivery has_been made so that you no the goods have arrived like most on line shoping do
neutral	i don_'_t order much from amazon anymore , i find their prices tend to be more_expensive than other_companies and out of the 0 recent orders in which i paid for a timed delivery i have only received 0 on time .
neutral	however i did receive the money back for the delivery
neutral	i stayed in all day to make_sure that my delivery slot of 0 . 00 am to 0 . 00 pm was covered .
neutral	nothing arrived , sent an e_- mail , received a phone_call next_morning telling_me to contact the delivery firm .
neutral	i did so after waiting 00_minutes to get through ( not a free call ), to be told that i had been out when the driver called .
neutral	this was manifestly untrue and they had no time or details to back up their statement .
neutral	they agreed to arrange delivery for 0 . 00 pm today - duly_arrived although driver rang for directions , surprising if he had already called yesterday !
neutral	don_'_t let your firm down by using substandard logistics , the service is a total package and the deliverers are your agents .
neutral	unfortunately late but that was prob down to my local postie not knowing when valentines_day was
neutral	good selection of products but delivery would be cheaper to post small envelopes / packets with royal_mail
neutral	0 %_discount offered by steve on email did not apply to toad park which i have booked
neutral	this company has a two online shops ryan spares and pipelagging . com , as well as selling through ebay .
neutral	their range of products is vast , including many lines not available off - the - shelf in the main trade warehouses . in all the orders i have placed so_far i have not experienced the usual ' out - of - stock ' issues i get elsewhere , delivery has_been fast and reasonably_priced .
neutral	my only_niggle is that as a vat_registered company , i require vat_invoices for all my purchases .
neutral	these are not issued by default .
neutral	i have had to on occasion phone up and ask for my invoice , the people there are very helpful and quickly email me the invoice , but i ' d rather not have to phone in the first place .
neutral	the pipelagging website has a registration process where it even asks for my company '_s vat registration_number , i must have filled in this field 0 or 0 times , but each time i log in again this field is blank .
neutral	system is great .
neutral	felt_like_cattle in cattle class .
neutral	would prefer to pay more for a bit more luxury so won_'_t hurry back
neutral	flowers were greatly recieved and enjoyed , however delivery was not acceptable . for mother '_s day was told delivery driver just left them on doorstep and left , no attempt to see if anyone in .
neutral	not entirely_satisfied with this service .
neutral	the chairs are excellent with clear assembly_instructions and each set of screws etc came with a spare .
neutral	what let them down was the delivery service .
neutral	they were meant to text / email us on the day with a time of delivery .
neutral	stayed in all day to get the delivery time sent at approx .
neutral	0pm with a delivery time for 0 hours_later ( between 0000 - 0000 ).
neutral	nothing arrived and no explanation either .
neutral	phoned the supplier as there was no contact number for the delivery service to be told that someone called thomas had refused the goods - they had obviously gone to the wrong_address .
neutral	two_days off work with no compensation offered .
neutral	i bought a nice bunch of flowers for my girlfriend online through serenata with free next_day delivery .
neutral	the flowers arrived as promised but did not look amazing , there was no water left in the pouch they were transported in and some of the flowers looked withered already .
neutral	i was away when i ordered them so did not see them until the following_day ( when they still looked a bit withered ) but not the best impression for my gf to receive them like that .
neutral	can '_t fault delivery service though !
neutral	parcel was given to a neighbour and delivery driver put a card through my door with an address written on it that doesn_'_t exist
neutral	major problems dealing_with city_link had to phone four times and was told i would hear back from them that day , didn_'_t hear back till day after and was asked if i could pick it up from where it was delivered ....... address doesn_'_t exist amatuers
neutral	finally got my parcel after knocking on every door
neutral	only problem i had was with yodel delivery , they deliver 0 days a week when i '_m at work and couldn_'_t ring to arrange a suitable time for next available delivery .
neutral	as it happens they delivered in the evening of the second visit but whether that was them using common_sense or pure like remains open to debate and caused me some concern as i was desperate for the parts .
neutral	if royal_mail used and i was out i could collect from their sorting_office the next_day .
neutral	all other respects the service , parts and contact were excellent and always has_been in the past .
neutral	good and quick turn_around on my order .
neutral	however received a faulty item , but their returns procedures was quick .
neutral	the only problem is i paid for next_day delivery which was fine but with the item being faulty it never get used , making the next_day delivery a waste of £ 0 . 00 plus the cost to me to return the item .
neutral	sort something with delivery & returns and then you have a good and recommended service .
neutral	all good just slightly worrying that the web - site booking gives no details at all of the room except that it is a double .
neutral	also , i know breakfast is served at the hotel but breakfast was not an option with trustpilot .
neutral	i wish the site was more user_friendly ; being_able to view all supplements related to what a user is searching .
neutral	i believe this would help in overall sales proffits , and helping the consumer to find the best supplement for them , seeing how supplements are different for every body type .
neutral	it took 0_weeks from placing order until i received it .
neutral	i opted for the free 0nd_class delivery , i wish i hadn_'_t , i could have walked the 000_miles to their location and collected myself and it would have been quicker .
neutral	on a positive_note , they offer good choice of products and competitivly_priced .
neutral	started over a month_ago , had eye_test - ordered two pair of glasses from glasses_direct - order accepted and imeadiate payment taken .
neutral	left it 00 days before i contacted them , unable to trace the order - after several minutes ordered traced but had not been processed ( 00 days wasted ) i must_admit the girls on the telephone were very helpfull .
neutral	having found the order i was told that the would give the order priority - 00 days_later i received the glasses !
neutral	however , one pair i could not see through , obviously the wrong prescription - both orders had the correct prescription .
neutral	glasses_direct again apologised and i returned the glasses to them .
neutral	by this time a 00_%_discount was being given ( i only received 00_%) having spoke to the supervisor a 00_%_discount was given .
neutral	i also asked for 0 pair to have photo chromic lenses ( again i thought i had ordered this type ) the supervisor offered a 00_% reduction , which i accepted .
neutral	i received both_pairs within 0 days and happy with the purchases .
neutral	would i purchase glasses from glasses_direct again very doubtful
neutral	even_though i paid for the extra chocolate with the flower , the person did not get any chocolate .
neutral	item arrived on time and was quite cheap , but customer_services were very poor indeed when something went wrong
neutral	good service , but not a great range of selections for my industry type ( solid fuel ) but have to give them a bit of leeway due to the fact that it is a niche_market .
neutral	can believe that if i was going with a run of the mill industry ( tiling , hairdressing etc ) it would have been a breeze to use .
neutral	still happy with the final product though .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	very efficient , just the bouquet was a lot smaller than what i expected .
neutral	other than that smiles all_round .
neutral	i '_ve_used easyspace for years and they '_ve got increasingly more_expensive compared to many other_companies out there .
neutral	service is pretty reliable for my little sites and no real issues to speak of .... but they don_'_t seem to offer anything that can '_t be had elsewhere for a lot less money .
neutral	i '_ll be honest , this review dates back to products i bought nearly a year_ago from bath_empire and it looks_like they may well have improved the quality of the items i got so to be fair to them i give this 0_star_review .
neutral	the shower_tray i got was low qulaity fibreglass with metal support frame underneath with 0 feet , one was wonky and the whole tray flexed so it meant i couldn_'_t have a shower with the wife as the weight made it flex too much and would not maintain a good seal against the tiles .
neutral	ok so not every tray is made for 0 but this tray flexed with just me standing on it and i '_m 00 stone .
neutral	shower_mixer was poor quality with no wall fitting ( they '_ve changed this now ) so i didn_'_t have an easy way to fit to wall then plumb .
neutral	in the end i didn_'_t use any of it and bought some branded ( and bs stamped ) products .
neutral	so £_000 spent and i '_ve flogged it all cheap via local ad to just get_rid of it .
neutral	there '_s a lesson here , pay_peanuts and get monkeys .
neutral	they let_me know when the flowers had left with the dispatcher , and nothing else after that .
neutral	my wife works until 0 : 00 and i would have appreciated some kind of update or assurance that it would arrive by a certain time ( it just says " on the day " - does that mean they might be delivered at midnight ?).
neutral	anyway , flowers arrived at 0 : 00 so all was fine .
neutral	i just would have been less nervous_about everything all day if they had said it will get delivered by 0 or something .
neutral	i have to apologise for the previous review .
neutral	all the extras are written down if you scroll_down below the headline price .
neutral	lesson is to be alert when booking !
neutral	stephen martin
neutral	i work away , and wedding_anniversary coming up so thought i would send flowers with small extra gift ( cake ).
neutral	they both arrived on time and flowers were nice but cake had happy birthday on it instead of anniversary , not a big deal but i did email company mentioning this , got reply back saying they would look into .
neutral	three_days have passed and no apology etc .
neutral	as i say , no big deal but a bit of feedback from serenta_flowers wouldn_'_t have gone a miss .
neutral	ordered an item .
neutral	delivery was due 0 - 0 days .
neutral	after 0 days i ' d heard_nothing further and after chasing was then told the item was due into stock later that day .
neutral	i subsequently received the item whilst i was away - so at_least 00 days after original order .
neutral	if i ' d known it would have been fine , just needs more communication .
neutral	kenable offer a large range with good prices .
neutral	0 out of the 0 items i ordered have arrived in good time but i '_m still_waiting for the third and kenable have given no advice of when i might receive it .
neutral	there was no_indication that the item was out of stock at the time of ordering ; typically , this was the item i needed most .
neutral	do not book a collection when it '_s cold - it will not get collected as all their couriers are afraid of snow , ice or even the prospect of snow and ice .
neutral	it took 00 days for one of my parcels to be delivered !
neutral	their service is the cheapest door - 0 - door service .
neutral	all items can be tracked online .
neutral	customer service is poor - i am still_awaiting a response to a delay claim .
neutral	every order i place i seem to have to return something because the item is faulty , sized incorrectly or not as advertised .
neutral	customer service staff are not too clever by the responses i get , they appear to fail at the basics of reading an email .
neutral	additionally , when i item is exchanged , they automatically add £ 0 . 00 p_&_p again and every time i have to email and ask them to refund it - getting very tiresome !
neutral	good joe browns range and £ 0 . 00 next_day delivery is great value .
neutral	its easy but its costs more than going your self i always get less_than when i go and do it myself you cant look for the deals either !
neutral	if your trying to save_money go to your local_store
neutral	not great some things are cheap but the rest is overpriced just like b and q
neutral	the screen is too complicated , if it was made simpler perhaps in terminology and function i am sure you would have more adopters .
neutral	i don_'_t know if it is possible but it should also allow the direct exchange between existing users , i think this would increase confidence and use ... other than this excellent and highly_recommended .
neutral	ok so i have an epileptic dog who has meds for life so have order of many companies contact them to say i was sending in prescription and will pay on friday told her what i was buy and everything and not at one point did she say there was going to be a price increase so was very shocked when i went to pay and not only one pence_per_tablet but had gone up about 0 pence_per_tablet so with in 0 days the price had changed and the customer service staff didnt think to tell me this was to late to do any thing as was low on the tablets and could not wait for them to send the prescription back so i could get them cheaper witch i could from 0 different companies as tgey had now put them up to 00pence per_tablet so can saw i was overly_impressed as i do shop around so i can save_money but from all the 0 - 0 years of ordering have never had this it was almost like they new the order was coming so though let put the prise up .
neutral	can '_t say it was the fact but a bit of a convenience for them so have learnt lesson and will keep an eye on this in future if i use again but apart_from that the deliver was fine and iteam arrived the good thing is u do get an email to confirm the exact date of delivery were most just get an email_saying despatch but no exact date
neutral	great website and follow_up but on both_occasions i '_ve_used them the delivery was messed_up .
neutral	first time the flowers were delivered to a mystery person_who '_s never been identified .
neutral	second time the mother '_s day flowers were abandoned in a car_park .
neutral	by pure chanceyum found them the next_day !
neutral	ordered and paid for a landscape photo_book for a recent_trip to london which was for a special_occasion .
neutral	i used the ipad_app which was easy to create and design the photo_book taking you straight the steps through to payment and ordering .
neutral	the photo_book took just over a week to deliver and the quality paper is excellent making my pictures really stand out and display to friends and family who have commented on the paper .
neutral	i would say it was well_worth the wait and the cost for the extra quality paper , my only_concern was the packaging used to deliver the product to my door i don_'_t think this was well thought of .
neutral	my photo_book felt stuffed_into a cardboard envelope which had obviously hadn_'_t been treated with care or attention resulting in bashes to the corners of my photo_book .
neutral	i would have thought that paying extra for the best paper , the condition of delivering my order to my door should have received the same amount of attention .
neutral	it would be something to consider if i did order from jessops_photo again !
neutral	the flowers delivered were mixed with ones i didn_'_t want and not featured and wasn_'_t notified hence two stars .
neutral	perhaps it was a one off so may try again .
neutral	otherwise delivered on the day requested .
neutral	service was alright delivery could of been better but then again i guess thats royal_mail
neutral	please will you cancel the insurance and .
neutral	send the money back to the card 00 pounds
neutral	the villa was great , good location with lovely sea_views .
neutral	great facilities apart_from having to buy toilet_roll !
neutral	thought that was a bit mean but anyway all was nice in the villa .
neutral	only_disappointment was the pool , it was not heated , we asked three_times for someone to fix this and three_times someone came out , it seemed to bit a problem and they apologised but that didn_'_t make up for the fact we couldn_'_t use the pool as it was freezing !
neutral	shame , otherwise would have given 0_stars !
neutral	recently i went online to send a package to coventry . i noticed it would be cheaper to take it myself to a local drop - off point , there were three points very close to me , about 000 hundred yards to be exact . i went to the first , who said they did not do it anymore .
neutral	i then went to the second , exactly the same response , and also the third one .
neutral	i then spent the rest of the day , parcel in hand , looking for the ups base which i eventually found in kentish town . my question is this , why keep obsolete drop - off points on the website ???
neutral	?.
neutral	good initial price but then a booking_fee added .
neutral	if something is non - optional then please include it in the headline cost , cos you have to pay it .
neutral	products a good price .
neutral	products dispatched promptly
neutral	when products arrived they were well_packaged and matched the descriptions accurately .
neutral	web_site was easy to use .
neutral	unfortunately dsl do not have the same customer service values and failed to deliver , failed to communicate_effectively , failed to call back , failed to prioritise resolution of the problem .
neutral	simply lighting were ineffectual in addressing the issues after the fact .
neutral	the wallet ordered was delivered on time and to specification .
neutral	i suppose what i ordered i got so thank_you .
neutral	you may have gathered from my rather weak comment that whilst i was not enthralled by the item , i was ok with it .
neutral	i suppose i expected something rather more than arrived - it was satisfactory rather_than excellent and the item could have been purchased for less on the high_street i feel .
neutral	would i use again ?
neutral	undecided .
neutral	flowers were delivered on time and well received .
neutral	nice presentation but poor value for the cost paid .
neutral	tried it , hated it .
neutral	full of shops that have very poor service .
neutral	you get what you pay for , always check out the shops fully before ordering and their stock_levels .
neutral	the service was very good and helpful indeed
neutral	ordered seeds , got them in only 00 days_later , which is good , my order was correct , but the seeds i germinated , only 00 out of 00 cracked .
neutral	im hoping the ones that did crack turn out ok .
neutral	ive ordered from this company before , the order is always correct & speedy .
neutral	so_far , all my orders with herbies has turned_out good !
neutral	the stuff purchased £ 0000 was received but 0 items were missed off ( bottle trap and chain waste link ).
neutral	theses are things that were missed off the initial order .
neutral	we trust those who collate the order to be expert st ensuring the order is complete as such items do not register on the non - professional .
neutral	when you order a sink then you expect the sales_person would ensure that all items to produce a fully_functional sink are included .
neutral	when each item was not noted to be present we ordered them and received them the next_day which was excellent however in doing so incurred two further p_&_p_charges which grated somewhat .
neutral	fairly good selection but very expensive when used to buying wholesale
neutral	good product at a good price !
neutral	vendors have to edge on the cautious side when giving delivery estimates but these days rarely do you have to wait more than a few_days and especially for goods that are in stock !
neutral	the shoes ordered were in stock , ordered on the 0th and despatched on the 00th !!!!
neutral	i don_'_t consider that to be good service !
neutral	easy website to use and order arrived promptly but oh boy !
neutral	what a difference_between the pictures on the website and the packet !
neutral	don_'_t think i '_ll be buying again .
neutral	when ringing to check my car in at the airport approx .
neutral	fifteen_minutes away i was told i had rung too early according to the chauffeur . on arrival at the airport was told off for not being outside the correct door . baring in mind the parking_bays were full so pulled in where available .
neutral	on returnto our vehicle after our holiday we discovered an extra seventy four miles on the clock . we will not use this company again .
neutral	i am robs wife .
neutral	i ioved my ghd_straighteners they lasted years .
neutral	ghd even repaired them eventually at very low_cost .
neutral	so when i returned from holiday without them i was v . unhappy .
neutral	i chose the ghd website over others because they offered 00 hour delivery .
neutral	but my straighteners took 0 days to arrive and that was only because i e_mailed and rang ghd and parcel_force then rang parcel_force again .
neutral	parcel_force lied and said they had tried to deliver but someone is always home and they did not .
neutral	ghd rang them but i had already spoken to someone at parcel_force .
neutral	he actually asked me ' how urgently do you need them ?'
neutral	- this was 00hr delivery !
neutral	!
neutral	the man who came from the post_office was clearly not happy about being sent out .
neutral	what a fiasco !
neutral	i will consider buying fromghd again but only if they change their postal facility
neutral	had 0 wait 0 hour '_s 0 have 0 tyre fitted !!!
neutral	!
neutral	produit_conforme livré rapidement .
neutral	support technique assez médiocre comparé à ce qu ' on peut trouver rue montgallet ou auprès des constructeurs .
neutral	i was pleased to find the item i hadn_'_t been able to find elsewhere and contact from seller was good initially .
neutral	disappointed that delivery was estimated at 0 days , maximum 0 .
neutral	i received it 00 days after_placing the order .
neutral	i tried to email them when it hadn_'_t arrived and got no reply , which was disappointing .
neutral	great until you sell something expensive then the charges get way to much ...
neutral	on reviewers
neutral	i think it is a great idea in principle to rate a restaurant , the fact is that ( not your fault ) it is difficult to assess how honest and unbiased the reviews are , how sensitive is the palate of the reviewer is .
neutral	it is very democratic that everyone has an input but not everyone has the same standards .
neutral	for instance ( not disrespect ) i read quite often less experienced reviewers going to a particular restaurant saying that was the best tai , chinese , italian etc .
neutral	in the country .
neutral	in order to do that , i guess , you have to have visited at_least 00_% of all restaurants of that particular cuisine .
neutral	i find that slightly over - eager .
neutral	on advice
neutral	whenever i follow trip_advisor ’_s top_rated restaurants quite a number of times , i get disappointed about the quality of the food and the big hole in my pocket .
neutral	it works better when i pick restaurants in the middle of the classification !
neutral	on my persona
neutral	i always write_reviews that are unbiased , honest and with a touch of humour where possible .
neutral	i remember reading a professional reviewer of someone saying that when he was writing a review , he would write it like the reader was with him in the restaurant and that is what i try to do myself
neutral	on suggestions
neutral	a while ago i wrote to you but received no reply about what i think personally regarding the rating system which i believe should be reviewed as follows_:
neutral	0_star should change from terrible to poor because poor already encompasses very low standards and is a little gentler , or elevate the score from 0 to 0_stars
neutral	0 poor
neutral	0 average
neutral	0 good
neutral	0 very good
neutral	0 excellent .
neutral	the passage from average to very good is too wide and as a matter of fact quite a few of my reviews although i rate them as 0_stars , i always mention in the actual review that the reader should read it as 0 and a half .
neutral	on free interpretation
neutral	if it ’_s true that i am among the top worldwide 00_% most read reviewer , when are you going to employ me ?
neutral	!
neutral	p . s .
neutral	in reference to what i said earlier read 0 and an half instead of 0 .
neutral	good price of products
neutral	excellent packaging and invoice
neutral	over priced delivery for a 0nd_class post
neutral	never had any_problems with orders till now but the order arrived as normal but one of the sand paper belts was ripped , not a major problem but its expense you don_'_t really need at this time
neutral	paypal takes such a massive cut out of your transactions , it almost isn_'_t worth it .
neutral	ebay takes such a huge cut , it '_s almost not worth selling on it .
neutral	i ordered and paid the premium for a saturday delivery .
neutral	they tried to deliver wednesday and left a card saying they would " try tomorrow ".
neutral	i tried_calling city_link to explain that i wanted a saturday delivery but an_automated answeting service advised me that , " your shipment is on the van for delivery !
neutral	".... i could not soeak to a person !
neutral	i then had to stay home on the thursday until the van arrived around 0 - 00pm .
neutral	surely it should not be that difficult ?
neutral	i was searching for accomodation for 0 - 0 feb , after finding what i thought was a good deal i booked .
neutral	after confirming my payment i realised the booking was for the next_day 0 / 0 even_though i had never changed any of my search dates .
neutral	as this was at 00 . 00pm i tried the manage my booking bit on the website but the booking wasn_'_t on there ( and still isn_'_t 00_hours_later ), i tried_phoning the customer_services number which was closed but did give an_emergency contact number which was also closed .
neutral	i then emailed them which i was told hadn_'_t been received and was then told that the email address i sent it to wasn_'_t monitored ( this was the email from the confirmation )
neutral	i finally got through at 0am the next_day , even_though the website says they are open from 0am to be told i would still have to pay as they will be charged by their suppliers but they didn_'_t seem interested in contacting their suppliers to look into this .
neutral	i was also told that bookings can take up to 00_hours to come up on the manage my bookings bit .
neutral	as they use hotelbeds as their supplier you may as well go direct to them .
neutral	we got a message from the customer_services team a couple of days_later to say that they were going to give me a full_refund and that has_been done so i have changed my rating from 0 to 0_stars
neutral	i still think they need to look at their 0st line customer_services as the standard answer is " it is in the terms and conditions " if they took the time to look into something i would have been happier even if it hadn_'_t have gone my way .
neutral	i am_afraid the product was faulty and is being returned for a replacement
neutral	too many_times ordered parts are of poor quality , dont fit , rusty , already broken .
neutral	other times you get a quick and easy service .
neutral	confused ?
neutral	so am i .
neutral	the item was at a competitive price and the communication from this seller was good too .
neutral	unfortunately they are let_down by a poor courier service who state they have tried to deliver but don_'_t leave cards and information given when phoning them conflicts with information given by email .
neutral	but i got it eventually .
neutral	i ordered a towel_radiator and straight ( inline ) thermostatic valve set .
neutral	delivery was quick - by 00 . 00am next_day so full_marks there .
neutral	sadly the rad had suffered damage in transit , being dented and scratched on the bottom_rail and the packaging & tape was hardly pristine , suggesting it had done the rounds well and truly before reaching me ..... and the valve set sent was the angled variety .
neutral	didn_'_t bode_well for a good experience on my first order from this company .
neutral	i reported this via their online foms , where it is possible to attach an image to show any damage .
neutral	doing that is not very intuitive and my image didn_'_t get attached to the form , resulting in a request to send it before they could deal with my query .
neutral	that delayed things by 00_hours but the end_result was replacements for both parts being immediately despatched for next_day delivery and pickup of the damaged / wrong parts by the same courier .
neutral	turned_out all right in the end and dealt_with politely and efficiently .
neutral	things can and do happen in transit but there '_s really no excuse for sending a wrong part in the first instance .
neutral	slow in loading and processing orders .
neutral	too many options without adequate descriptions to explain differences_between them .
neutral	charge a booking_fee for using service .
neutral	first payment did not process .
neutral	booked a next_day pick_up with citi link - item was collected on a thursday ( citi link say it was friday but it was my sister who handed the parcel to the driver ) & item was then delivered on the monday .
neutral	no refund offered .
neutral	not interparcels fault exactly but still a bit off that citi link try & pull the wool over your eyes and your just expected to live with it - people usually book a service and pay more for it for a reason .
neutral	car parts 0 less is the sister company of <_external link_removed_> without the daft promotions every week / day .
neutral	when it comes to service items they can '_t be_beaten on price , things like filters , brake disks , pads etc .
neutral	and parts of common cars which is what i use them for .
neutral	but if you need any kind of buying help such as making_sure you ordering variant specific parts they are hopeless at best .
neutral	i recently tried to buy shocks for the m - sport variant of an bmw e00 .
neutral	firstly they ignore two emails to check that the parts listed were indeed for the m - sport not the se model and then when i phoned the women had no idea .
neutral	i did the part number search and ordered what i thought was the right part and then got a call to say it was no_longer a stock item .
neutral	all the person wanted to do was cancel my order , they were not interested in making_sure i ordered the right part .
neutral	as the title_says , great for service items but thoroughly hopeless for anything_else
neutral	if your reading this chances are your thinking of getting this company to do some home improvements of which , they offer many .
neutral	a note of caution then .
neutral	first lets get something very clear i have had 0 triple glazed windows fitted that were fitted to perfection and the units themselves i cant recommend highly_enough .
neutral	excellent quality .
neutral	so whats up then ?
neutral	i hope advanced read this and take_heed because they could be a 0_star company and in there line of work that '_s rare and recommends are even rarer .
neutral	problems are lack of information no calls returned and worse misinformation .
neutral	problems started when in my order i picked a composite_door was given a price and guide date of 0_weeks this became 00 and many phone_calls later and a threat to cancel the order the door was indeed ready .
neutral	the truth apparently advanced seen fit ti quote me on the thinking they could make it cheaper themselves by buying the machine that makes a composite_door well the machine flopped and no one decided its prudent to me any of this , and into the bargain because of there failure to make it it would now cost £_000 extra to outsource i was offered a cancellation but no movement on price very unfair after some thinking and now 00 weeks_later i decided yes ill pony up the extra , was promised the door within a week still nothing after me chasing them and another cancel threat the door arrived and was duly fitted , is this customer service , !!
neutral	no its not its appalling its only 0_stars purly because of flawless fitting by mcdonald windows sub contractors from linwood totally professorial fitting , as for advanced its 0_star sort your customer service out
neutral	iv been using play for some time and watched it grow and grow it used to be excellent but now its just mediocre really delivery issues aplenty and call_centers that are difficult to get through to , an ever_expanding range of goods to choose from , one word of caution if you buy an item and it gets lost in our great postal_system you have to wait two full weeks before you can report it to play as lost .
neutral	then you could in theory go through it all again .
neutral	although to be fair a free replacment is usually sent if this happens rightly so !
neutral	!
neutral	samsung note 0 has a s pen the only way to use it by removing the phone from a very nice cover but missing your company logo as on a co worker '_s s0 i will get another when i require 0
neutral	the tyres were delivered a day late causing a great deal of frustration .
neutral	when speaking to customer service it was obvious that they did not have a means of tracking order .
neutral	continually suggested that they would be delivered on the 0nd dec .
neutral	i was in the garage when the tyres were delivered .
neutral	all credit to the tyre_fitters as they had had a horrendous morning , where one had been involved in an rta .
neutral	i question whether i will use tyre_shopper again
neutral	good prices , good after sales & verity but a small family run company that often has downtime if they are going on holiday or if someone is ill .
neutral	phone_call 00 . 00 to advise delivery 0 - 0 , and duly_arrived 0 . 00 .
neutral	packed quite well but ripped where slight bulge in cardboard where bag of components were - no damage though .
neutral	took a screwdriver_set and adjustable spanner only to find not sufficient , neccessitating a long round_trip to obtain spanner .
neutral	something in the paperwork to say whats required before opening the box , or a cheap spanner in the bag .
neutral	ok if you assemble every day you will be ok , but the instructions were poor but i did like the numbered bags to determine the correct fxings .
neutral	the handedness of the curved leg supports was not evident in the instruction .
neutral	however once assembled a good table for the money .
neutral	regards
neutral	martin
neutral	as advertised we were notified by companies for our impending move .
neutral	we were disappointed that they were not local companies so all lacked that personal care that we expected i would like to add that we did not select any of the companies
neutral	the matress was as_described and delivered on the day promised .
neutral	however , the delivery man was not willing / able to put it in my bedroom !!
neutral	!
neutral	great product and price , although i they would have helped my wife ( home on her own ) bring in the products in doors .
neutral	only the final stage was a let_down .
neutral	the ordering_process was easy and the office staff very helpful .
neutral	our worktops however took nearly 00 weeks to reach us !!!
neutral	i know that this was not the fault of worktop_express but i did always had to call them they did not call me to keep me informed .
neutral	i have used this company on many occasions but did not have a favourable experience this time !!
neutral	package arrived opened with item missing , customer service did send out replacement but took a considerable time to receive !

neutral	delivery could be quicker !
neutral	!
neutral	i will probably use them again but with a little caution !
neutral	!
neutral	bought 0 new myson radiators but 0 of them arrived damaged , plumbnation would not accept responsability because it was not reported within 0 days .
neutral	i didnt know they were damaged until the plumber was here to fit them , word of advice open all packaging as soon as you get your radiators incase the grilles are damaged like my ones .
neutral	i '_ve had better online service from other_retailers hence the 0_stars .
neutral	friendly helpful staff , good quality goods at a competitive price .
neutral	prompt despatch and arrival of goods ... all 0_star / excellent
neutral	be aware that if you need to return things you will have to pay postage which is non_refundable .
neutral	i dont_think that is fair when there is no facility to try on goods beforehand
neutral	i know that people are generally opposed to change in all forms , but in facebook '_s case i think that user opposition is justified .
neutral	layout and feature overhauls aren_'_t uncommon , and after they are introduced it doesn_'_t seem to matter what people think - the changes are permanent .
neutral	they could do well by listening to feedback .
neutral	other than that , it is a solid social_networking site .
neutral	they '_ll probably stay on top for a long time , but the way that they ' re running things is giving plenty of opportunities for better sites to swiftly take away their users .
neutral	first off , i do purchase my music , but the prices on itunes are just off - putting sometimes .
neutral	i would go for the occasional album , but they just don_'_t seem to be throwing a lot of offers out there nowadays .
neutral	it can also be frustrating to search for music on their site and find out that they don_'_t have it .
neutral	rarely you '_ll find an original and interesting article on ign .
neutral	however , their videos can be decent , ranging_from informative to humourous , and is the strong point of the site .
neutral	unfortunately , they are given an incentive to review certain games favourably , which really tarnishes ign '_s reputation amongst gamers .
neutral	for some reviews this is really obvious and distracting , especially compared to other gaming review sites ( but this practice of companies pushing for good reviews doesn_'_t just fall onto ign , don_'_t get me wrong ).
neutral	you might as well be reading a piece written by the lead developer of a game in some cases .
neutral	they do have some good writers , but they ' re just not given enough free will .
neutral	an overhaul is needed of their commenting system , which is poorly implemented and usually just serves the purpose of breeding criticism and arguments between users .
neutral	haven_'_t had a huge_amount of history with them , but they have a fairly good site and i haven_'_t run into any_problems ( yet ).
neutral	however , there '_s just something about paypal that i can '_t quite put my finger on ; it really feels_like they ' re lacking a useful presence .
neutral	i get the feeling that it would be a nightmare to resolve a problem with an exchange .
neutral	also , adding / changing addresses on the site is stupidly overcomplicated .
neutral	only had this a week and the band it is already splitting .
neutral	had a bit of trouble with the purchase as i cam up as a security " risk " on tier_0 '_s system .
neutral	not sure why , i buy online all the time and have never been categorised as such .
neutral	initally , tier_0 wanted me to send them a copy of my bank_statement as proof of my identity .
neutral	this is totally_inappropriate as there is a lot of information on there which i don_'_t wish to share .
neutral	in the end it was resolved as all they really wanted was proof of address and this was easily_obtained by other means .
neutral	the requested for my bank_statement made me deeply suspicious of their intentions and made me think_twice about dealing_with them but it was all o . k .
neutral	in the end
neutral	i might be demanding , but when i see " next_day delivery " when i order something on the friday , i don_'_t think the following wednesday is " next_day "...
neutral	however , they were very good with their communications to explain when they were sent out , although no explanation as to what the delay was caused_by .
neutral	love the sunglasses and the price was excellent .
neutral	having been ripped_off for years by western_union , it was refreshing to find a new company that operated a transparent foreign_exchange transfer .
neutral	despite a few_teething troubles the company provided a consistently good service .
neutral	in the past few weeks the standards have declined , transfers are either unavailable or offered in unsuitable currencies .
neutral	cheap but not with the support and knowledge of a bike shop when contacted
neutral	malaga_airport is well_designed for car_rental if arriving on a flight .
neutral	but if picking_up a car having arrived in malaga by other means , or earlier , locating the collection_point is not obvious .
neutral	the goldcar check in and collection is in the same place , unlike_other rental_companies there , meaning the car_park is busy and chaotic , and the collection queue is long and slow ( i was there for at_least 00_minutes ).
neutral	in that queue , several had just arrived on a flight and were therefore at the wrong desk ( there is a separate desk inside the arrivals area , which outsiders cannot reach because of security ).
neutral	these_people had to re - enter the building , but were only told this after queueing for 00_minutes .
neutral	the car itself was very good and i have no_complaints , neither do i of the staff who issued the car , once i had reached the front of the queue .
neutral	the signage and thus car_park directions are very poor .
neutral	the actual description of the car_park changes from ' surface ' to ' short_term ' to ' multi story ' and are thus confusing for people arriving at the airport .
neutral	they are unsure and thus hesitating while they decide which car_park to go into .
neutral	they even reverse out and try again ...... all this because the signage on the web_page and at the airport are confusing .
neutral	why can you not just use the same name for the car_park .
neutral	why not just call it for eg ...' car_park numeber 0 ' on the web_pages and also on the airport signage .
neutral	also the car_park was full but i had to go along the one way system round and round the same way until i eventually_managed to find a way out of the system to a empty space .
neutral	i assume it was designed by a non car driver !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	merlin_cycles are cheapest for a lot of things and they deliver fast but if you need any help over the phone they are pretty poor .
neutral	a couple of the items i had to return and this is not easy to do either .
neutral	i am a first time user of tyre_shopper , initially found site ok found prices good , so decided to place an order .
neutral	thats when fun started , when looking for fitting_centre nothing .
neutral	phoned helpline all one got on numerious occasions was we are working on system it may take a week to fix , but some orders are getting through . totally unaxceptable get better it support , only because of price did i persist other wise i would have shopped elsewhere . speed up order process , and opperators be a little more helpfull
neutral	as above did not say if would be back in stock so i could re order - so found someone_else to order from
neutral	everything ok , the space for logo could be bigger .
neutral	we purchased a mandolin recently .
neutral	delivery etc was all good .
neutral	however , we are a bit disappointed with the performance of the equipment in relation to the one thing we have tried so_far ... to make chips .
neutral	we followed the instructions carefully and find that the chips are sliced very thinly , much more thinly than one would normally find them .
neutral	the french fries , of course , will be even thinner .
neutral	we would welcome pro_cook '_s comments .
neutral	kr jones
neutral	ordered radiator which was supposedly in stock .
neutral	confirmation of order but no dispatch note .
neutral	contacted after 0 days with great difficulty 0000 number - told not in stock awaiting delivery ( still showed in stock online ).
neutral	eventually got 00000000000 number ( why do amazon customers get an_alternative to the 0000 number ) and spoke to team_leader .
neutral	offered alternative which was delivered next_day .
neutral	great quality products .
neutral	next_day delivery failed ( order at 0 . 00pm , waited in all next_day , cam day after !!
neutral	).
neutral	when arrived wrong hinges in box although invoice said correct , have returned for refund .
neutral	not really impressed with these winter tights they are warm from the knee down but above the knee thay are not that good even with a pair of cycle_shorts over the top you can feel the cold and i havent been out proper winter conditions yet i wpo ; d have sent them back if i could
neutral	ordered a washing_machine from them , as i really needed it next_day .
neutral	delivered as promised , so_far so good .
neutral	however , somewhere between the order and delivery i got a phone_call from them where they started by confirming my delivery details and then_proceeded pushing me for an extended protection scheme with monthly_payments .
neutral	i don_'_t know why i agreed - i must be slow thinking over the phone .
neutral	got the papers today , did some calculations , and was shocked by how much of a rip_off it was !
neutral	by the end of my 0 year normal warranty , i would have already paid a third of the appliance '_s cost !
neutral	cancelled the policy immediately , without paying anything .
neutral	but hell , they knew pretty well it was a rip_off when they pushed me for it !
neutral	therefore , 0_stars .
neutral	if they try to bug me further , even calling to apologize , an additional star will go for each call ...
neutral	should be quicker and less confusing
neutral	as above , the process and notification was very good .
neutral	as it wasn_'_t available in the store , i was going to be charged £_00 to get delivered from the warehouse .
neutral	suggest a little staff training .
neutral	sent my step mother birthday bouquet - had text_messages and email to say they had been delivered - was happy .
neutral	had a call from my step mum to say she had recieved the bouquet but would only say " use bunches . co . uk next time "
neutral	not very happy
neutral	good service at black_circles but a day late due to courier problems
neutral	the flowers were very easy to order came on time they were just smaller than_expected but for the cost they were fine and my wife liked them abd they were for our 00th_wedding_anniversary would order again
neutral	tesco have an offer on at the moment , buy a 00 pack of coke and get 0p off a litre of fuel , use up to 0 0p off vouchers per fuel transaction .
neutral	the wife and i bought 0 x 00 packs of coke and recieved just 0 voucher so we complained to be told " oh no you only get one voucher for with coke on each transaction !
neutral	so i had them credit me for two packs of coke and then bought them again in 0 transactions .
neutral	each extra transaction attracts a charge upon tesco from the card_issuer so they actually ended_up making less money than they would have done if they didn_'_t have the silly rule in the first place !
neutral	is it any wonder that this country is going down the pan ?
neutral	the price was good and included free delivery but unfortunatly the feliway was simply thrown into a bag in it '_s flimsy outer_box .
neutral	by the time it arrived the evaporator had been damaged and the bottles of pheromones had leaked a little .
neutral	i didn_'_t return it because the cat was going frantic and i needed to get it in and working otherwise i would have done .
neutral	shame really as i would like to have dealt_with them again if only for the good price .
neutral	ordered gift_voucher and was informed delivery had to be by royal_mail recorded delivery .
neutral	nothing arrived .
neutral	after 00 days i queried and was told it must have been lost in the post , queried how this could be if recorded delivery was involved but no explanation given .
neutral	voucher arrived two_days_later .
neutral	high prices , good quality gear .
neutral	slow delivery times unfortunately .
neutral	i ordered a top - of - the - range washer_/ dryer from electricshop .
neutral	they imply they offer a price match , but when i phoned since i ' d found it a few_quid_cheaper_elsewhere , i was told because they offer a longer warranty , they couldn_'_t price match .
neutral	bah .
neutral	but they had it in stock , so i ordered anyway .
neutral	but despite_being in stock , it still took a week to deliver .
neutral	when it arrived , it was in perfect_condition , and the delivery guys where helpful enough and arrived with a text notification before they got there .
neutral	overall not blown_away by the experience , but not that disappointed either .
neutral	would i recommend to a friend ; probably not , but only because i wouldn_'_t necessarily remember the lukewarm service .
neutral	yet to use table_saw but has caused drama with fitting of blade .
neutral	the infill washer seems to be to big resulting in the outer flange not being_able to tighten on the blade .
neutral	assembled today but had to take to engineer to fix the infill washer and cost me money an time .
neutral	blade seems to be good now after fix .
neutral	main boddy had a few scratches on it when it arrived .
neutral	der manglede dog en faktura med pakken .
neutral	vi skal_bruge en faktura med pris_og antal på for at få pengene refunderet .
neutral	da_vi ringede til jeres kundetjeneste lød det som om at det havde de aldrig været ude for før .
neutral	og_vi_har aldrig været ude for ikke at få_en ordentlig faktura med_en forsendelse .
neutral	derfor ikke flere stjerner .
neutral	i ordered two t - shirts in june , and after one month i wrote and asked when they would arrive .
neutral	no reply .
neutral	after two month , i wrote again , and still no reply .
neutral	in september i wrote that i would ask my bank to withdraw the money if i didn_'_t hear_anything .
neutral	then i got the reply that they would send me my goods within 00 days .
neutral	0_weeks_later i got my two t - shirts .
neutral	i must_say that the quality is above_average , but i do feel the company could have written that they where delayed .
neutral	phrankie
neutral	very easy to book on line , and competitive_prices , but slightly_confusing in terms of process when arriving at airport .
neutral	that said , you don_'_t have to do anything other than collect your card on entry and put it back in the machine when you leave , but a few lines to that effect on the confirmation_email would have been good .
neutral	the website is better but the app makes finding some details hard to find .
neutral	for example it '_s hard to find details on excess and how to include loss cover ( i don_'_t think it '_s possible with an ipad but i still can '_t be sure ).
neutral	also the summary of cover document is just too generic .
neutral	summary of cover should tell you exactly_what your particular cover includes and should have clauses such as " if you have selected this at time of purchase ".
neutral	it should state clearly what is and isn_'_t covered for the chosen policy .
neutral	sound product and attentive service .
neutral	however the website was but misleading about delivery dates , giving a short date (" within 0 days ") in the product description then a much longer one in the order process so that i felt_pressured to sign up for the guaranteed date charge as i needed the product within a week .
neutral	at £_00 against a product price of £_000 this was exorbitant .
neutral	also having visited the website several_times before ordering i could have done so sooner had i not been misled by the delivery schedule given with the product description .
neutral	i purchased an evic from joyetech and am very pleased with the actual ecig .
neutral	the control ring design is very poor , it is loose and dosen '_t always do what you wnat it to do .
neutral	it is slow to start when you press the activation button , the lcd is difficult to read and it seems underpowered .
neutral	i spoke to a customer service person and they didnt seem to know what they were talking_about .
neutral	a good idea and very flexible self - editing tools - more choice of size would be good .
neutral	## blank_pages spoiled the overall effect ##
neutral	at_least one photo should have warned me that the quality was not good enough .
neutral	took too long to get to me .
neutral	failed to give me the ' first - timers ' discount .
neutral	the google_checkout wouldn_'_t accept the delivery address .
neutral	so i returned to checkout and used the standard checkout .
neutral	the standard checkout showed a summary of the delivery address ( i thought ) from a previous usage ( i guessed ) and i completed using it .
neutral	next_morning at 000am the florist called asking for the full address and so on .
neutral	i supplied this and in a couple of hours my mum called to thank me for the flowers .
neutral	perhaps the problem was due to using the google or the chrome_browser -- no idea .
neutral	i would use iflorest again .
neutral	considering postage was so expensive for something that wasn_'_t very heavy it took 0 days to arrive .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	i phoned drum_stop as i wanted to buy a drum_kit in part_ex for my kit which was in very good condition .
neutral	the person i spoke to said yes they do part_ex & reccomended that i send them photos and they would get back to me .
neutral	to cut a long_story_short i did not get a reply after a week so i sent a reminder asking them to name their price , again no reply , not even acknowledgement of the effort i went through to set my kit up , take photos etc so that was a little annoying .
neutral	even if they didn_'_t want the kit a reply at_least would have been courteous .
neutral	i also recently_bought a brand_new snare_drum from them which according to the manufacturers website is supplied with a padded_bag which i didn_'_t get .
neutral	when i phoned drum_stop to question this i was told that they received it from the manufacturer without the bag .... and that was it !
neutral	dissapointed !
neutral	although i '_m happy with the snare_drum
neutral	this is the worst survey format i have ever_seen .
neutral	not structure or marketing focus .
neutral	bad coloured print out page after payment .
neutral	not clear it was coming from spain
neutral	delivery take a long time , via germany .
neutral	on the plus_side got what i wanted where everywhere_else was sold out , plus cheaper .
neutral	then the cons , like most people had to wait with poor communication , and had heard_nothing until i posted on here .
neutral	this was only based on a simple mot .
neutral	i have a friend locally who is a mechanic and does all the work on my car so knew that it would pass without_any_issues .
neutral	i '_m not sure i would be prepared to have my car serviced through them though based on previous reviews , though this will all come down to the garage doing the work on their behalf and i think on this occasion i got lucky .
neutral	orser sent without box ...
neutral	contacted and a box was sent with no_problems .... been better if not had to ask for box ...
neutral	sounds petty but they were for a present
neutral	i have been with o0 for a number of years , around about 00 i would say .
neutral	i am on a very low monthly_tariff which suits my needs perfectly and have a very up to date phone .
neutral	they offer early upgrades and usually have the latest handsets .
neutral	when , and usually before the contract_expires , a free upgrade is offered .
neutral	both the o0 store and o0 online have very good deals with extremely competitive_prices .
neutral	their latest advantage is offering customers home broadband for a very good price , with the cheapest line installation around .
neutral	however , one disadvantage is that although they try to keep existing_customers , they no_longer break their backs to do so and will not back down even over a small_amount meaning they are no_longer benefiting their existing_customers , who may now decide to leave .
neutral	like i said the flowers were great but they were a day to late for my wifes anniversary
neutral	the item arrive and as i expected some things didn_'_t line up .
neutral	the leg extention is not in line .
neutral	the cable on the bottom pully on the leg extention slips off if not monitored .
neutral	bench press is a little low even for me but as i said u get what u pay for pretty_much
neutral	couldn_'_t login as a guest for some considerable time , whatever_reason .
neutral	i entered the promo_code not realising that you also had to activate it .
neutral	the delivery secdtion was unclear - i thought i had not asked for some kind of delivery but i had - therfore paid £ 0 . 00 for some kind of delivery .
neutral	but the mother - in - law will get her flowers - i hope
neutral	excellent range of products , generally the prices are really good , but the promotional items aren_'_t as keenly_priced as the supermarkets .
neutral	service is always very good , although the postage is a bit on the steep_side (£ 0 . 00 postage for a £ 0 . 00 order )
neutral	one of the products i ordered was out of stock but i was not notified of this until i rang them two_days_later after i paid for next_day delivery ., although they refunded the £ 0 . 00 in the end that i paid for the delivery again i was not offered or notified of this until i rang up and goods ended_up being 0 days late .
neutral	still_waiting for delivery ordered 00nd_march no notification that the purchases were out of stock monies taken from bank 00th phoned twice expecting call_backs to advise when order would be available if out of stock still_waiting not impressed expect will get purchases when least expect it and will have to run around chasing for delivery if delivered and i am not at home come on get your customer service in order does not take 0 mins to lift up the phone as bt says its good to talk //////////////////
neutral	banglads has some great items unfortunately my first order consisted of two sale items neither were nicely fitted or styled .
neutral	once i receive a refund i will be sure to make some better choices
neutral	i got my iphone_unlocked very quickly and works great , although pricing was very unclear .
neutral	my total expense came out to be about 00 $ usd and was expecting to pay about 00 $.
neutral	website should be more clear in usd .
neutral	satisfied but feel_cheated .
neutral	we recently rented a fiat from maggiore at florence railway_station .
neutral	it was a lot of fun and big enough for two people and luggage ( including back seat !)
neutral	one tip - don_'_t rely_on them to have a gps as they were all out when i was there and they don_'_t have maps !
neutral	if you do get caught the tobbaconist sells maps
neutral	i was insured with multitrip last_year , this year when the renewal came in my premium had increased by £_00 , i learned that the increase was because i was no one year older and that at 00 years of age the premiums increased , despite this i was offered a very small discount .
neutral	i said i would insure elsewhere and asked for the renewal to be cancelled .
neutral	i shopped_around and tried multitrip again and to my surprise i was quoted a price just a few_pounds higher_than last_year .
neutral	surely as a repeat_customer i should be offered the best price , my having to start as anew customer again seems to me to be a waste of time , multitrip are not being honest with repeat_customers as new customers get better deals ..
neutral	unfortunately the recipients were away celebrating their golden_wedding and flowers were left under the hedge
neutral	ordering system ok , phone contact and delivery information very poor .
neutral	on hold for 0 hour + and still never spoke to anyone
neutral	ok , good service .
neutral	sadly expensive on most items .
neutral	for example l was looking for 0 , 000 c0 greeting_card bags ... kite are £_00 per 0 , 000 plus_vat plus 00 delivery ' my current supplier is £_00 per 0 , 000 including_vat / delivery .
neutral	l have also had some single walled boxes , ok , but not the same quality as my previous_supplier
neutral	as l have said good service .
neutral	not the best for price or quality .
neutral	negatives were absence of cafetto cleaning products and europe shipping charges , which were absurd .
neutral	music samples are to short .
neutral	have used same car_hire company before through different agent and had a better experience .
neutral	charge of 00_euros in advance is a rip_off as it is impossible to put that much fuel in a micra even at the most expensive filling_station on the island
neutral	the arm support for tennis_elbow sufferers , is well made and a real help .
neutral	however , there are no instructions on where to wear it on your arm , or how tight it needs to be fitted .
neutral	the product came with 0 different strengh rubber strips which are supposed to be used to perform exercise '_s that eradicate the tennis_elbow .
neutral	once again , there where no instructions on what to do with these strips .
neutral	the tens machine is good , although it takes a while to get used to the feelings it generates .
neutral	when the cheque came my name was misspelt .
neutral	after two phone_calls still_waiting for the replacement cheque which i am assured is in the system .
neutral	otherwise pleased with the value and the level of communication
neutral	the results were great but the experience was horrible .
neutral	i wasn_'_t prepared to be clamped down with a big contraption attached to my eye ball - no one had explained that to me .
neutral	i felt abused afterwards - i was furious .
neutral	i also had bloodshot eyes for about 0_weeks after the operation which wasn_'_t great as i didn_'_t want to tell anyone i ' d had my eyes_lasered .
neutral	again , they told me there would be some redness but not to this extent .
neutral	did what it said on the tin , no problem
neutral	when ordered and paid it was not clear the item was not in stock .
neutral	i did not receive an email with log in details either .
neutral	days_later i enquired and was told of delay in stock arrivals .
neutral	then i got an email_telling the story of airport and customes delay but will be despatched the same day they receive it ( friday 00th ).
neutral	lets_hope so becuase confidence is ebbing away during this process .
neutral	however i like the sound of this company from their early beginings and hope they don_'_t ever forget what made them today .
neutral	if my product arrives on time as promised and is as good as i '_m expecting then i '_ll dish the praise unreservedly .
neutral	i was happy to find a replacement smoke_alarm at a good price with electricpoint .
neutral	delivered quickly too .
neutral	but i was disappointed to find that when i attached the enclosed battery to the connections , the red light immediately started flashing intermittently .
neutral	the enclosed battery was dead .
neutral	so i have to go to the supermarket and pay a couple of pounds extra for a fresh battery .
neutral	shine taken off an otherwise good experience .
neutral	the guitar was bought secondhand when it turned_up iit clearly hadn_'_t been checked before leaving the shop .
neutral	the action was shot and the pick_up was faulty .
neutral	i sent the guitar straight back and then had to wait a week before receiving back .
neutral	the shop did look after me here keeping_me informed through email etc .
neutral	on receiving it the guitar was perfect and i '_m very happy with it .
neutral	shop needs to watch its procedures process as they get bigger .
neutral	the company needs to get its act_together .
neutral	i have bought an identical item at £_00 . 00 at different times about a fortnight apart & charged £ 0 . 00 carriage firstly & £ 0 . 00 on the second occasion .
neutral	quality of glasses ok .
neutral	delivery and ordering_process was good .
neutral	security ques are ridiculously long ( twice at around 0am )
neutral	purchased an odessey premier flute which was advertised as ex_display and was valued at a fair price .
neutral	in the description , it stated that the flute had slight blemishes and marks , but to see them you would have to look very closely in the light to spot them .
neutral	upon_receiving the flute , i was dissapointed to find a flute with heat blemishes from the soldering process and stains as though it had be pre_owned that were very obvoius and clear , even the premier stamp was mis_- spelt on the body and was spelt premter .
neutral	the flute works and produces a good quality sound , but due to it being an ex_display and discounted , i felt it would be more hastle to return it as this was probably the last one and i would be asked to pay the difference for a new one , which i can '_t afford .
neutral	this was my first purchase from gear for music and it has left me a bit dissapointed , as they look to be a very proffesional vendor with plenty of decent stock .
neutral	i do feel that if something is described as being practically new , then it should be just that .
neutral	i tried numerous home_trials which was a fantastic way of trialling new frames !
neutral	it is such a good idea and i was always really excited to receive the package of trial_frames to test out !
neutral	i found two great pairs of very reasonably_priced frames and ordered them .
neutral	although i had to send the frames back twice as i could not see properly through them ( i suspect that the lenses were put in the wrong way around ), when they eventually arrived back corrected , i was so pleased with the glasses overall and i love the new frames i have that are very different to my old pair .
neutral	so i had a few_hiccups , but i still believe the service is excellent , and the glasses are great !
neutral	very convenient that the online service meant i did not have to travel to an optician to do any of this .
neutral	ordered from safercigs as a bit of a change and unfortunately my order got cancelled over some £ 0 delivery charge or something along those lines .
neutral	might just have been an unlucky once off for me though as i '_ve since received a follow_up explanation from darren , so your mileage may vary .
neutral	hi , i was really pleased to find your site , and you offer a great variety of low - cost trophies which were perfect for the informal awards_ceremony for my football_club .
neutral	the one quite serious disappointment however was with the " gold windmill football trophy 00cm ( 0 . 00 ")" i ordered .
neutral	it '_s clearly pictured on the website with a football in the centre , but when mine arrived , it had some sort of flaming torch emblem .
neutral	given that i had no spare time before the awards dinner , i used it anyway , rather_than seek a refund or replacement .
neutral	but it was a bit_disappointing .
neutral	above title perhaps not a fair reflection on sweatband as the ordering_process on their site was straightforward and included a healthy discount .
neutral	i was contacted by phone the following_day to be informed of the delivery process and to arrange a date for delivery .
neutral	the product did not arrive on the specified date .
neutral	in the end this was merely inconvenient but had it been 0_weeks earlier before i had gone part time , i would have taken a day off work for nothing .
neutral	the product arrived the following_day with no explanation and again , had it been 0_weeks earlier , nobody would have been there to receive it .
neutral	perhaps an_oversight on my part for not studying the details of the purchase but i had assumed the product would have come pre_- assembled or assembled on site ( as i was informed it would be a 0 man delivery i had assumed this - this had been the procedure when i purchased my first treadmill ).
neutral	however this was not the case but i was not overawed as the instructions seemed reasonably clear .
neutral	the assembly has_proven anything other than straightforward mainly as most of the screws are exceedingly difficult to screw into their allotted hole .
neutral	the reviews on the treadmill are excellent , hence the reason for my purchase , but at the moment my treadmill remains partly assembled !
neutral	no_probs until i needed to fill the car prior to handing back and i found out the fuel indicator did not work correctly .
neutral	this resulted_in me filling the car instead ot returning it half full .
neutral	when , on its return , i pointed this out to the bloke checking the car that it had cost an extra 00_euros he just said " you win some you loose some ".
neutral	very good but small price !
neutral	delivery was prompt but 0 item was missing " not in stock " yet it was when i ordered the items , and i had no phone_call / e_- mail to tell me this fact and i still have not had my item delivered or any indication when it will be .
neutral	delivery was slow and dressings had no sticky on themcheap but useless
neutral	only_concern is that the yellow_roses were very pale and after a few_days almost white ?
neutral	?
neutral	not a bad_experience but i found it was just too expensive and also too costly to change booking details . i know that aferry have no control over border control but customs at dover are just as annoying as those terrible officers at heathrow . will use the eurostar or tunnel next time ... a much more pleasurable / relaxing experience !!
neutral	!
neutral	so every time i send a laptop i tick the box to say im aware of the cover policy , i put in big capital_letters im aware of cover policy , yet every time this is all ignored and i get an email_saying " are you aware of our cover policy ?"!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	every time i say yes , please read your own order form and stop sending me this yet i still keep getting it , what is the point of the tick_box and the notes if they are ignored !
neutral	?
neutral	also the new sms option , why is the not defaulted to no ?
neutral	why does is demand that i select an option !
neutral	its done nothing other than slow down the process
neutral	the site was easy to navigate through .
neutral	they were responsive to all my emails
neutral	when the flowers didn_'_t show up on the day
neutral	i paid extra to have them delivered on .
neutral	but after many emails and two_days_later
neutral	they finally arrived and they were beautiful .
neutral	i would recommend tyre_shopper to anyone .
neutral	the thing that let the whole_experience down for me was the fitting_centre .
neutral	i arrived unannounced and they said there would be a 0 . 0 hour wait at_least as they were short_staffed and they had 0 staff sitting doing nothing and one car in the fitting_bay with no one on it !
neutral	as above - very expensive but service good
neutral	good as usual
neutral	after keying all payment details when booking flights got a processing transaction message for two minutes followed_by an error_message .
neutral	had to ring company ( phone picked_up quickly by staff ) to find out payment not processed .
neutral	they sent email with a link to sagepay to pay for flights .
neutral	as other users have mentioned you need to have some confidence in a site especially when paying quite a lot of money for flights and unfortunately this site did not provide that .
neutral	you need to seriously look at improving the payment process as i '_m_sure its crucial to your customers , as well as your company .
neutral	also - just realised , after spending some time on the internet and booking through this company , money is taken straight_away , but tickets not issued until 00hrs_later , and there is no guarantee you will get the tickets at prices quoted ( see their terms and conditions ) so there is a chance you dont get tickets at all .
neutral	if you dont want hassle and peace of mind , book with someone_else and pay that little extra .
neutral	i found it tricky to get my design authenticated and had to do it two or three_times .
neutral	it was fine in the end but was slightly_annoying at times .
neutral	købte et sd hukommelseskort og_modtog det uden_problemer .
neutral	jeg opdagede ved modtagelsen at jeg i farten havde_bestilt et forkert kort skulle have været micro_sd så sendte det retur samme_dag i den originale emballage .
neutral	debusy bekræftede nogle dage_efter at de_havde modtaget sd kortet retur men ville ikke kreditere beløbet da emballagen var brudt ????
neutral	men de kunne da sende det tilbage_til_mig hvis_jeg lige betalte 00 ,- for fragten .
neutral	jeg_har på intet tidspunkt brudt emballagen da man tydeligt kunne se at det_var et sd og_ikke micro_sd kort i pakken , dette gjorde jeg debusy opmærksom på i en mail samme_dag_og skrev at jeg stadig forventede at få mine_penge retur .
neutral	nu_er_der så gået 00 dage uden jeg_har hørt noget som_helst fra debusy og_de tilbageholder stadig mine_penge :-(
neutral	rettet 00 / 00
neutral	har ændret til 0 stjerner nu da_jeg_har modtaget mine_penge retur .
neutral	ordered by phone after_reviewing dutch barn shed and base online and needed to ask a few questions , which were answered fully .
neutral	prompt delivery as promised and good quality materials .
neutral	unfortunately the instructions were not as exact as they should be for the base and after ring the customer_services had to disassemble and reassemble .
neutral	customer_services were very unhelpful suggesting that i hadn_'_t read the instructions throughly even_though i highlighted some of the unspecific guidance on assembly ( which they have not noted or intend to change ). will shop around when buying summer_house as i '_m not too confident with quality of instructions and level of customer service .
neutral	orderet for my mum '_s birthday but could sense she slightly_disappointed .
neutral	eventually said they maybe noy 000_% fresh and just bit dull looking .
neutral	went for prince of cambridge as my choice so now wishing i ' d picked something else !
neutral	received part shipment as my speakers had to be ordered in .
neutral	no_indication of this on website .
neutral	customer service promised to send me an email update on the friday if they came in with the possibility of a saturday delivery .
neutral	no response to my email asking if this was going to happen , no delivery on saturday .
neutral	now have to waste a days holiday from work to accept delivery next week , providing of course they notify_me when they intend to deliver .
neutral	all in all , not great service considering the £ 0 . 0k i spent with them .
neutral	tom .
neutral	paid for express delivery might as well brunt the money
neutral	i found that the goods were easy to order and there was the promise of a swift delivery .
neutral	goods were to be delivered on a tuesday .
neutral	the delivery didn_'_t go well or according to plan !
neutral	first tube arrived bent like a banana !
neutral	second ( replacement ) arrived promptly and in one piece .
neutral	not happy , because , i got less_than i thought for i - phone . it was damaged in transit while being posted . it was immaculate , when it left me . thanx . otherwise , i am happy .
neutral	the flowers were lovely , delivery was excellent , however i think that at £_00 . 00 was very much overpriced .
neutral	ordered some flowers on a monday to be sent on the thursday , they never showed up despite_being told at 0 : 00 in the evening they had been sent .
neutral	then had to wait_until the following for them to be delivered .
neutral	not the companies fault courier to blame but lack of communication was frustrating .
neutral	product delivered was brilliant though so will be using them again .
neutral	always excellent prompt service but paying £ 0 . 00 for a small ' o ' ring is something i could experience less , i got a pack of 00 in the local_diy for 00 pence .
neutral	however ..... convenience and an_enormous collection of spares almost makes up for it .
neutral	i will be back .
neutral	good selection of sunglasses .
neutral	stock quickly replenished , delivery fast .
neutral	not the cheapest but then the do guarantee to match prices of the competition .
neutral	however be aware the conditions are not published .
neutral	i sent golf_support an email regarding the free delivery that was offered on their website if you purchased adidas adizero 00 golf_shoes which was never answered !
neutral	i ended_up ringing them 0 days_later and they rectified the problem while i was on the phone .
neutral	i place the order and i received the delivery within a week .
neutral	my only complaint is that they had been tried on previously and the soles were quite dirty , but did not look as though they had been worn for a round of golf so i kept them .
neutral	shipping is very expensive
neutral	promptness of delivery :
neutral	was good and packaging is great .
neutral	capsules ( pods ):
neutral	- they are hard on the machine .
neutral	plastic pod is too solid especially when you compare to the competition with who you are taking on .
neutral	flavours :
neutral	some flavours are very good but others are just too wishy washy ( weak ) which turned me off .
neutral	just like warm milk in the lungo
neutral	with time - i think you will get there as you have some good lines already
neutral	not 000_% convinced but will reorder and keep an open mind .
neutral	thanks mvp
neutral	i find it very simple to order what i need from the website and do get contacted if the stock is out .
neutral	but after this communication slows and i have to make many follow ups to get an answer .
neutral	i actually have two orders on at the moment and do not know when they will be arriving to me , so i will be making another follow_up today .
neutral	ordered a jane pram , not happy with quality , wanted to return , phone number not active so had to email returns team , got reply next_day however need to pay £_00 surcharge for collection !
neutral	they will not pay for return postage .
neutral	very quick service , but the record that i ordered pressing was terrible ,( burton inc la make you pay ) not very happy as i '_m a dj and i could never play it out .
neutral	i understand this is a rare track and has long been out of press but this is a pointless repress .
neutral	that said i would still shop with this site as they are not responsible for the pressing .
neutral	i have tried many_times to download the booklet which gose with the policy i bought from you without_any joy .
neutral	the page freezes the internet .
neutral	hope you can sort it out thanks
neutral	i had to spend £_00 to get my order on top of the purchase price because your delivery company are stupid
neutral	ordered birthday card 0 days before my sons_birthday still has not arrived 0 days after his_birthday .
neutral	was it ever sent ?
neutral	very pleased with the service and price of my new bosch shreader , will use them again
neutral	hpc may get a good deal from shipping with yodel , but they were difficult to deal with , and that ultimately i nearly returned the products as they were too late .
neutral	he tried to deliver , we were out .
neutral	fine , normal card through the door .
neutral	i made an arrangement with him ; he ignored / forgot it and put another card through the door .
neutral	central website and phoneline totally_unhelpful .
neutral	texted again and was ignored / not replied to .
neutral	eventually i went to collect from his house , ( on the morning of my daughters_birthday ), in order to get the items on time .
neutral	don_'_t get me wrong , the guy was not unpleasant , just inept .
neutral	that was over a week_later .
neutral	surely they can '_t be that cheap as to warrant loosing business .... you are as good as your weakest point .
neutral	price cheapest at the time , but took a week to arrive .
neutral	after ordering some cable tidy '_s for my new desk on the 00th_january , i only now have received them ( 0th_february ).
neutral	whilst i understand that eurofit were not_necessarily responsible for the delay in delivery , i would have thought that they would keep an eye on if things as the item was ' traceable '.
neutral	after a week of no delivery , i called eurofit and asked them where my items were .
neutral	they told me they would look into it .
neutral	after another 00_minutes , they called me back and gave_me the number to the courier to sort it out myself , rather_than call them directly and find out what had happened .
neutral	i then had to drive 00_minutes to the depot and 00_minutes back as i couldn_'_t trust apc to re - deliver .
neutral	all in all , a good product , but my experience has left a bitter_taste in my mouth and i probably would not use this company again .
neutral	it is the small things that make such a big_difference and i was totally underwhelmed by the lack of personal service i felt i had .
neutral	a real_shame .
neutral	the first charge was for 00 times my usage and i had to contact the company to straighten it out despite having quoted usage figures in my application
neutral	first time i have used serenata_flowers , had problems with the website from the start when trying to select the delivery address , interflora much_easier .
neutral	however on raising the issu , e the staff were brilliant and overcame this quickly .
neutral	very happy with flowers and balloon , however delivery driver would not go up one flight of stairs , even_though address was 0nd floor so instead of lovely surprise for my girlfriend , i had to phone her to tell her i had ordered them and ask her to go and look for them , add to fact the card i asked to be added to the gift was missing this did spoil the effect some what .
neutral	heals is a great store and their website is very clear and easy to use .
neutral	we did have a problem with the wrong delivery address being used , despite updating this on the website and contacting the heals service department directly , who promised us it would be delivered to the correct address - and it wasn_'_t .
neutral	apart_from this issue , everything else was fine and i ' d use them again .
neutral	perhaps they need to ensure that the service department and their dispatch agency are better communicated in future though .
neutral	stung just slightly with the additional_costs for mobile_phone confirmation and cancellation_cover which admittedly were shown up in the top right hand_corner of the payment screen , but i just didn_'_t see them and they were added to my charges .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t have added these if i ' d been paying attention .
neutral	reckon they should be active opt in rather_than passive .
neutral	can '_t review meet &_greet_parking service yet as have just booked and been asked for review already by skyparksecure .
neutral	let '_s hope the service lives upto expectations
neutral	item was out of stock but was not e_mailed
neutral	to be kept_informed had to mail to ask what
neutral	had happened still_waiting for item , it will not
neutral	be available till end of month but have been
neutral	charged no problem waiting for stock but
neutral	lack of information very poor
neutral	good place to shop
neutral	best to shop
neutral	good place to buy
neutral	my first experience with watchfinder was excellent with an immaculate rolex daydate sold to me as quoted , no_complaints and a lovely new model .
neutral	my reason for 0_stars is that i went back to them for a submariner on the basis of initial service and this time it was terrible .
neutral	no interest in me at all and when they said they would call back they never did .
neutral	when i spend this kind of money i expect excellent service and this time they didnt deliver .
neutral	bought my sub from finewatchco instead .
neutral	i ordered 0 different items from four different shops online in the first week of january within the same hour .
neutral	0 came within 00_hours but 000 golf took 000 hours almost exactly .
neutral	none had next_day extra payments on them .
neutral	to be fair their ups delivery was easy to follow on tracking except that i had an email to say it would be delivered wednesday and it came tuesday_lunchtime - fortunately someone was present to receive the goods ( not 000golf '_s fault of course ).
neutral	i notice another_reviewer complained similarly .
neutral	there are many online golf shops now - and those who respond quickest will make it .
neutral	food was in poor condition !
neutral	stick to purchasing in store !
neutral	big_mistake !
neutral	i have ordered several_times from ebuyer and sometimes they will just cancel the order and ask you to send in id don_'_t think so i will just order from elsewhere never given id to amazon
neutral	i have been on ebay for years and do think it is great but it is getting very expensive to sell on ebay now the final valuation fee is making it very difficult to make any money
neutral	i had book a car with another company but they could not give me the ford_mondeo so i cancelled and book with you because you could give me one , but on arrival at europcar in derby they said they dont even have on at that branch .
neutral	the car i had was ok but very cheap finish and not the treat that .
neutral	i was looking for .
neutral	when i stoped to refuel i could not get the petrol_cap of and after a long peroid of time and effort had to phone the derby branch to be told how to get the petrol_cap off .
neutral	the information cards in the door of the car were not for the car that i was driving
neutral	this is the second time i have tried these pods .
neutral	although they have been redesigned they still make it difficult to pull down my nespresso_machine arm .
neutral	i also feel that the coffee is just below the quality of nespresso_pods .
neutral	bom fiquei_muito satisfeito_com o preço para a bota millet davai por u $_000 . 00 , efetuei a compra e transcorreu tudo da melhor forma e após dias de espera sou informado que não entregariam no brasil por questões de alfandega , sugeri um endereço na italia pois tenho um amigo que mora em trento , e mesmo assim minha compra foi cancela e a bota passou a custar u $_000 . 00 , foi uma decepção muito grande pois agora nem o preço esta bom para compra , então espero que no futuro comuniquem onde realmente são feitas entregas antes que seja feita a compra pois é_muito desgastante esta situação , o site é_muito_bom e confiavel , o_atendimento excelente porem neste ponto fiquei_muito chateado e por ultimo gostaria de saber se vcs fazem entregas na italia ok . atenciosamente - paulo .
neutral	goods arrived on time .
neutral	first time of wearing a seem has come_undone and required repairing .
neutral	to much hassle to send back and ask for replacement .
neutral	all very efficient but i got charged_twice
neutral	the site was easy to use and goods were didoatched ok .
neutral	the hoods were expensive for what they are but similar peice as elsewhere .
neutral	happy with everything except we chose the bed ahead of a competitor on the basis that the ends were made of a single peice of oak .
neutral	we even asked the salesman , who it turns_out was the assistant_manager whether it was solid or not .
neutral	he assured us that it was and the bed in the shop certainly looked solid .
neutral	however , when we unpacked our delivery , we were dissapointed and angry to see that the bed ends were made of 0 peices of oak stuck together .
neutral	overall , the product is good but the company '_s credibility has_been seriously undermined in our eyes and we would think seriously about shopping there again and we would recount this story to anyone who asked our opinion of oak_furniture_land .
neutral	the bed was also very difficult to assemble as the bolts for the slats were very tight and took a great deal of head_scratching to work out how to fit them as the holes for the bolts did not line up exactly .
neutral	i ordered the tyres and booked fitting on line .
neutral	the booking process showed the available fitting slot at my chosen fitter ( tuesday am ).
neutral	however , i had a call from tyre_shopper the day before saying that my tyres would delivered to the fitter by 00pm on tuesday .
neutral	not helpful !
neutral	ideally tyres should be delivered before i have them fitted , duh !
neutral	just make_sure you know the delivery of your tyres to the fitter .
neutral	then make absulutely sure if a fitting_appointment is needed .
neutral	i used national_tyres for fitting .
neutral	called the day before to make_sure they could fit at my chosen date and time .
neutral	they said yes , no appointment needed .
neutral	arrived at the centre and as if by incompetant magic , they said they didn_'_t have an appointment for me .
neutral	grrrrrr .
neutral	lesson_learned .
neutral	micro - manage people !
neutral	i ordered flowers as a present for my girlfriend while she is at uni .
neutral	i wrote the full address of her flat in the delivery , she would have to collect the flowers from a drop_off office , but it wasn_'_t there !
neutral	not happy at all .
neutral	i have no idea where the flowers must have been delivered too , and i am very annoyed that it did not get to her .
neutral	i am embarrassed and highly unimpressed .
neutral	edit after response ; thank_you very much for responding to my review , after ringing you and telling the driver the circumstances the flowers were delivered on the monday , she has just picked them up on tuesday due to the office being closed very early monday_afternoon .
neutral	all be it a few_days late , she says she_loves them .
neutral	slightly worrying though with flowers having the tendancy to die , hopefully they aren_'_t too gone over !
neutral	thank_you again .
neutral	tom
neutral	it '_s the pricing thing that annoys_me .
neutral	do they ever sell anything at the list price ?
neutral	if so and you bought glasses at list price , you would be extremely annoyed that every other week they offer the same things for up to 00_%_off .
neutral	the staff are generally good and helpful , but you get the odd one that doesn_'_t seem too bothered whether you buy from them or not and talks to you accordingly .
neutral	i recently ordered a medium bunch of ' silver_lining ' flowers for my wife to celebrate_our 00 year pearl wedding_anniversary .
neutral	i have to say the ordering_process is very easy and my wife '_s flowers were delivered at her_workplace , as requested , before she finished for the day .
neutral	however , although my wife_loved the flowers she did say the roses , included in the display , looked a little_tired when delivered .
neutral	now after a week the flowers are still on display in our lounge , apart_from the roses that died off within four days .
neutral	i have to say this was most disappointing as i would obviously have expected them to last longer .
neutral	there is a lot of competition for our business online so next time i '_ll look at another e_- florist ?
neutral	always pay but at times slow
neutral	looked on website .
neutral	guaranteed 00th delivery - delivered on 00th .
neutral	flowers chocs and teddy great .
neutral	its not so good
neutral	one of the epson 0000 ink purchased in a full set , had a ' best by ' date of less_than 00 months .
neutral	upon questioning this shorter life , the reply can be summed_up as " not in our power - its all down to our supplier " which is not the response anticipated and was different to my previous purchasing experiences with this supplier .
neutral	very hard to communicate with when ringing their office asked if i could pay over the phone and was told to send an email and they would respond their email was confusing and couldnt pay phoned back to a somewhat dopey young guy_who said he would send an email and didnt so rang again and eventually got through to another dopey guy then thank_you god got put through to a young_lady_who was very helpfull and efficient so managed to pay over the phone and get the perspex acrylic polish product !!
neutral	superb product but the young_men i spoke to were dopey and didnt seem bothered it almost seemed that as i was ordering just one bottle that it was an effort for them , im saying what i have experienced not to moan but to hopefully improve their telephone service !!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	ramada .
neutral	room was ok but food was very poor and my partner had an upset_stomach by the morning .
neutral	it didnt help that there was a wedding_reception , so it was really busy and noisy when we just wanted to relax .
neutral	the fire_alarm went off at 0 . 00am and no body knew what to do , it was over 00_minutes before everyone came out and because of the chaos we ended_up paying for a taxi to get us to the airport .
neutral	it is a very nice worktop which was well_protected when arrived .
neutral	i had a pre_oiled and undermount sink_cut out .
neutral	all done correctly .
neutral	shame that the upstand ordered was not pre_- oiled .
neutral	the ordering_process and the speed was a different matter .
neutral	drawing were send back 0 times and each time a response took a day .
neutral	i decided to pay extra for a fast manufacturing process .
neutral	this did not work as it took 0 days to process my confirmation and the fast process only starts after processing the confirmation .
neutral	so basically paid £_00 extra for no gain .
neutral	although i mentioned this to them i have not heard of paying this back .
neutral	so all in all for me a good product but inefficient company processes which is fine when you have a lot of time but not for me
neutral	good thing is that the customer service are polite and looks_like trying to help but the servers are too slow with many outages and especially when i need to login to domain control_panel the cloudnext system is not working .
neutral	i '_m using monitoring service and in month of monitoring i have recorded 0 server down in averages 00 - 000 minutes mainly during a day when the clients want to see theirs websites ... moving to different provider
neutral	well , they got there in the end , but very slowly .
neutral	sent some packages using my hermes , after dispatching the items via yourselves , not a lot more_expensive , and they arrived before you .
neutral	i ordered a 00 month_xbox_live_subscription , working it out that it would arrive by the latest first_class delivery rate of 0 days , before my gold ran_out .
neutral	so_far it is day 0 and still no product in the post .
neutral	the customer service team have however been very good and considerate answering any and all questions i have put to them .
neutral	ok hotel , but breakfast cost left out with no obvious means of including it .
neutral	made visit a little of problem in the restuarant .
neutral	hilton was gracious about it .
neutral	the process was easy enough but you need to fill in full detail if you want to try and match exactly_what you are after but in my case there were zero returns so cannot review nothing .
neutral	my initial experience was very good .
neutral	had amazing vision in my right eye and my left eye was only ok , but my combined vision was good .
neutral	my left eye never got any better or worse but my right eye started to deteriorate after about 0 months .
neutral	i have had to go back to optical_express for them to monitor my vision , monthly for 0 months and they want me to come_back another time in another month to see if i need further corrective_surgery .
neutral	in my opinion i should be wearing_glasses again and the time it is taking them to accept this is ridiculous .
neutral	having the freedom of not wearing_glasses is great but i don_'_t believe i should be waiting 0 months for them to do anything about sorting my vision when it is clearly getting worse month on month .
neutral	the site was okay and the staff were helpful , but when ordering multiple items it isnt ' clear that you need to hit the update button for the numbers to take .
neutral	the update button is on the other side of the page as well so it is not clear that this related to the action of changing the required qty .
neutral	i also don_'_t remember the system ever presenting me with a final order to confirm everything before it went_onto payment , though i might be mis_- remembering .
neutral	dear dino_pc
neutral	please advise your couriers to " leave with a neighbour ".. if that is the request that i have made .
neutral	it makes everyone '_s life so much_easier .
neutral	i actually didn_'_t go through with another order with dino_pc because i knew i wouldn_'_t be home when it was delivered & then i would have to drive 00 miles to pick it up from the couriers because ..... you don_'_t leave with neighbours .
neutral	it '_s a great that you were here when this message was delivered but , rest_assured , i would have allowed this mail to be left with your neighbour .
neutral	nick .
neutral	after recently ordering flowers from serenata i found the website a little_confusing when i wanted to amend my order for a delivery time eg i was getting asked to ' press go button on right hand column ' this did not appear or i could not find it which led me to sending several e_mails as . this is the only way to contact you . i found this a little frustrating .
neutral	also i would like to say i was a disappointed in the quality of the flowers , the roses are a little ' jaded ' and for the price i would of expected better quality .
neutral	i have purchased 0 phones from cash_generator but i am sad to say - that even thought they work ok they are all scratched and scuffed not the ideal for a mobile_phone and can not be given as presents
neutral	the turnaround time was fantastic , but when this book came i found the print quality was not great .
neutral	many photos were darker_than when printed out at home , and most were grainy .
neutral	contrast seemed unnaturally enhanced at times too .
neutral	i got a book done by blurb last_year and for around half the price the quality of the photos was much_nicer and more natural looking - although even these were less good than when printed on a photo printer .
neutral	used anyvan shipper to collect a motor scooter for me , took a week and a half to collect it from seller then disappeared with my goods for a fortnight !
neutral	used a different shipper to collect a motorcar absolutely perfect !
neutral	no issues , polite etc ..
neutral	ended_up sending the second shipper to collect from the first ( reported to me that it looked like shipper was trying stealing ) they continued the job a month from when it first started with complete_satisfaction ...
neutral	the bad shippers will spoil it for the good ones , the good ones will do_business outside anyvan !
neutral	order agreed and dispatched on schedule , but the week end intervened - they tried to deliver on a saturday , no one in , so no delivery .
neutral	today , spent over 00_mins at various time trying to get through on the telephone - without an answer .
neutral	sent email requesting re - delivery ; no answer there either .
neutral	finally got through on phone in late_afternoon monday , and the delivery is rescheduled for tuesday 0 - 0 : 00 ( which is really good ) but i didn_'_t know .....
neutral	dg
neutral	the service and speed of delivery was excellent .
neutral	but the costume had a hole in the leg .
neutral	some of the products were not in the parcel
neutral	a spare plastic tray for a fridge door was available ( great !)
neutral	but quite expensive .
neutral	packaging was inadequate and the back of the tray was cracked on delivery .
neutral	i needed to put it into my mum '_s fridge as soon as possible so i have not tried to return it for replacement , it still is functional .
neutral	like ed , i ordered my battery ( sony vgp - bps0 ) before i saw the reviews and assumed i ' d thrown my money away .
neutral	however , eleven days after ordering , the battery arrived , fits_perfectly , was recognised by my lap - top , and so_far , works as it should .
neutral	hopefully it will_continue to do so .
neutral	i decided to check the reviews when pay_pal confirmed that my payment had been made to a xianghua luo , rather_than a british company as i was expecting .
neutral	their e_- mail address is a uk one and they display a post_office symbol on their home page .
neutral	( the gpo did provide the final leg of the journey .)
neutral	the company is in fact based in singapore .
neutral	the web_page from which i ordered my battery shows a picture of a sony battery and i did think i was ordering a genuine sony product .
neutral	when i went back and read the small_print , as i should have done at first , it was clear that this was not so .
neutral	given the price , i decided to sit tight and hope for the best .
neutral	the battery is made in china , appeared to be new , was well_packaged and as i '_ve said , so_far so good .
neutral	however , if this company wishes to achieve as they themselves say , ' 000_% customer_satisfaction ' they need to be far more open and honest about who they are , where they are , and exactly_what the product they are selling is .
neutral	in view of this , despite my apparent success with them this time , i should be very wary of trading with them again .
neutral	i choose serenta_flowers be cause they seem more reasonable than the competitors .
neutral	i had sent them to my niece who live in a different city , i was very surprised that i got text updating me when the flowers had left ..... and when they were actually delivered .... which to me was fantastic ... i will use serenta_flowers
neutral	hello ,
neutral	goods received thank_you .
neutral	postage a bit expensive .
neutral	also thought all goods were vat free till it came to check out .
neutral	doubt we will use your service again .
neutral	thanks
neutral	the selling experience has_been ok the values they give are somewhat lower_than one could expect elsewhere but the process is simple and is acceptable .
neutral	there is no incentive to return though as there is so much competition i believe that unless there is a change in either their pricing policy or offer an incentive scheme to repeat sellers then they will just be another company use once and disregard there after .
neutral	there best feature is the bar_code scanner but that is one of those apps that can be picked_up free almost anywhere .
neutral	the process in general is ok , however there is nothing memorable about it either .
neutral	if the process was a drink it would have to be water instead of a shot of whiskey .
neutral	had the part i was looking for at a fair price .
neutral	took two_days for it to be dispatched and then 0 days to actually arrive .
neutral	would use again but with the knowledge that dispatch and delivery are slow - would be_happier to pay correct postage for better delivery time , especially as i needed the part quickly .
neutral	i was sent a shopping_basket instead of an under seat piece of luggage .
neutral	this meant i had to wait for another 00 days before i could get the piece of equipment for which i had paid .
neutral	frustrating .
neutral	ordered a case from them for a very good price but item took longer then expected to arrive and also case was damaged on arrival , not badly but still damaged , thankfully does not effect the working of it or the aesthetics .
neutral	i did not contact customer_services to get this replaced as it was fun and games enough trying to find out why it took so long .
neutral	also ordered a fan controller on a seperate order and this arrived in the given time but on closer_inspection i can see that the courier has manhandled the item and all the knobs were slightly_bent , again no reason to get it replaced as the item works and unless your really looking you wont see it .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t order from them again , rather pay the extra and order from another company .
neutral	but you don_'_t allow two letter names !
neutral	why ?
neutral	oz
neutral	rebtel is pretty good in terms of rate and just loved the new rebtel android application .
neutral	but making calls over wifi / 0g was not a smooth ride .
neutral	the first call using wifi / 0g would always be bad ( sound cut up ) but the next call is always a better one .
neutral	i dont_know why but that has_been my experience .
neutral	and the other thing about the android_app .
neutral	whenever i tried selecting a contact using the dial pad from the rebtel app , the number of the contact that i choosed never shows up , it always comesback with a uk phone number it can be very annoying .
neutral	please fix that .
neutral	and lastly please make rebtel available in bangladesh , so that we both can talk at a local rate .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	the rump_steak we ordered was delivered on time and so_far we have only opened one pack .
neutral	we were both disappointed with the meat which was tough .
neutral	we have had worse , but equally , we have had a lot better .
neutral	i ordered a strimmer which came with a free starter_pack containing safety mask , ear_defenders , gloves and fuel mixing bottle .
neutral	the strimmer arrived within a few_days and all seemed good , however it was missing the safety mask with ear_defenders ( worth £_00 )
neutral	i emailed customer_services with all the details and received an_automated_response saying that most enquiries were dealt_with a day later , however more complicated issues might take two working_days for a response .
neutral	two_days_later ... nothing , so i sent another e_- mail .
neutral	three_days_later nothing ....
neutral	so i phoned , to be told that the masks and ear_defenders were out of stock but that one would be sent as soon as stock was received .
neutral	now why couldn_'_t they have put a note in with the order to explain that , or why could they have not replied to the email to that effect .
neutral	besides that the strimmer looks good , but i haven_'_t had a chance to try it yet until the facemask arrives .
neutral	i thought the instructions re the layout of photos on mug could have been made simpler .
neutral	my computer skills are limited !
neutral	i bought an electronic product from them some time ago and it failed after a couple of months .
neutral	their website to return it just put me in a loop .
neutral	filling out info , going to next page etc_., finally being returned to entry page .
neutral	buy books from them will not buy technical products they are too much hassle if things go_wrong .
neutral	found my tyre shpper experience to purchase tyres a very easy and simple process .
neutral	however - having got the tyres_fitted at national_tyre_centre in dunfermline they put the wrong pressure in all my tyres which led to my in - car tyre pressure warning_light to come on and i then had to find a garage so i could inflate them to the correct pressure .
neutral	school boy error to make !!!
neutral	dont_forget to send my £_00 voucher x
neutral	i ordered 0 taps .
neutral	two taps arrived with no delivery note .
neutral	i did not know if they thought they had delivered the full order so i emailed to ask .
neutral	they asked me to check if the third tap was in the delivery as the warehouse said they had packed all the taps .
positive	good very good
positive	great price , great seller , lightning_fast delivery within 00_hours of purchase , many_thanks

positive	i feel the friendliness of the staff really make the experience for me , and despite having access to labs in london i choose to print with spectrum because of the friendliness and simplicity of service , and i feel the costs are fair too .
positive	the website is informative and simple , and if mistakes have happened they have been rectified quickly and professionally .
positive	a couple of frames i '_ve ordered have had scuff_marks when arriving up by van - so perhaps more padding on the floor / between other frames in the van would be good .
positive	though this may have been a one - off !
positive	i hope spectrum is also strong in recycling and caring for the environment , i '_ve a feeling it is !
positive	and whenever someone '_s asked me where to get work printed i '_ve always given them your site .
positive	thank_you !
positive	i have had ecco_shoes before and the quality and comfort remain very high .
positive	why would any self respecting company buy all new equipment when reliable , reasonable spec ' clean computing ( for general office use ) is so cheaply available ?

positive	finally - what a first_class service !
positive	magic 0 - 0 day delivery was next_day .
positive	you don_'_t get much for your money in business so squeeze the pips and buy from these_guys !

positive	they seem to be holding up pretty well , are easy to clean and because they fit so well , they don_'_t let much dirt get under the carpet around the edges
positive	buying clothing and footwear on line is always a little_bit_risky when it comes to the sizing , and especially when you ' re purchasing from far away in australia , making returns both inconvenient and expensive .
positive	i '_m pleased i took the decision to buy a pair of quality shoes through pediwear , and i was delighted at the efficiency of the service .
positive	even better was the discount offered for further_purchases , which i took up when in the market for another pair of quality shoes almost a year later .
positive	once again , i experienced speedy reliable service , a more than competitive price and a high_level of satisfaction with the shoes when they arrived soon_afterwards .
positive	i would certainly buy from pediwear again and recommend this company without_reservation to others .

positive	fantastic !
positive	the product was excellent value coupled_with an excellent five_star service ..

positive	we hav ' nt fitted it yet , but as an electrician i will have no trouble ( they even supplied the plugs and screws )
positive	we will_certainly praise your product and the way you kept us informed during the purchase time to the time it arrived here at the shires .

positive	will_definitely use next time the need_arises .
positive	got the speaker wire from audiovisual_online my wife wanted at the lowest_price available .
positive	dpd delivered the package and it came with some of the cables insulation damaged , wire thankfully still intact .
positive	it was obviously the fault off dpd , not audiovisual_online as the dpd bag was ripped through where the damaged cable was and there were crush and wear marks on cable and bag consistent with transit_damage .
positive	i would recomend audiovisual to anyone , dpd however gives me socond thoughts .
positive	.................................................................................
positive	new website and company to myself .

positive	having never owned kitchen knives not purchased from a supermarket before , was always happy to let someone_else attempt to carve the meat , cut the veg etc .
positive	scoring the joint of pork ( we all love cracklin ') was impossible .

positive	so_far i have had no issues and everything has_been collected / delivered okay .

positive	keep_up the good work interparcel :)
positive	i was initially concerned when a day after i placed my order they telephoned me to say the 0000 model i had ordered was no_longer available but they could supply the 0000 model at an additional_cost .
positive	the price they stated still compared very favourably with the prices of the 0000 model offered my by others .

positive	very please i did .
positive	delivered on time by very pleasant delivery driver .
positive	great tv and great value .

positive	new hydration_pack needed , research online camelbak hawg the chosen one , now i '_m the happy one
positive	bought the 0x0 natural oak extending_dining_table and eight chairs .
positive	what you should know is its part self_assembly , which was not explained to us in the showroom .
positive	the table needs to have the legs installed and you have to apply a coating of the supplied wax ; do this to the legs before you install them , and once the legs are in place you need to turn it over - and oh_yes , it weighs a lot .
positive	anyway , the quality is very good , with proper joints and well finished too .
positive	however i think a better quality wax will help even more in the long run , so will try a good coloron beeswax .
positive	all - in - all we are delighted , and we went on to purchase some bedroom_furniture too .
positive	needed tyres urgently and caqrl at their call_centre was really helpful and sorted_out quickly and without_fuss !
positive	great prices on the tyres too !

positive	well_done .
positive	i ordered my item of clothing on country_attire '_s website at 0pm and they arrived , as promised , next_day .
positive	the packaging was excellent and all of the correct paperwork was enclosed .

positive	returned phone and received cheque two_days_later .
positive	all trackable on the website site and e_- mails from mazuma at every_stage .
positive	re - usable plastic wine tags and pen were delivered as promised .
positive	they look great hanging from the bottles in my cellar and make wine selection much_easier without having to disturb the bottles to read the label .
positive	the only_downside it that they are a real struggle to get over a few fat neck bottles , though perseverance does prevail .
positive	however they won_'_t fit over champagne cork cages .
positive	excellent fast and professional team . my order was processed and dispatched efficiently and quickly - highly_recommended .
positive	( also very compitetive price )
positive	good price and fast delivery .
positive	excellent thanks
positive	contacted mazuma next_day recieved details and postage to send mobile
positive	returned immediately within 0 days recieved my argos_voucher informed by email all the way
positive	a very satisfied customer
positive	i have been a user for over a year now and this is the best cask back site i know .
positive	one small reservation i have is that some times the vendors do not confirm the purchase ; especially when one has to clarify the placed order / s with the vendor / s .
positive	got a fancy_dress party at the end of march , was , nt to keen at first until my better half got this web_site up , loads of choice at good prices , my roo came pretty quick and give us a laugh when i tried it on , there was plenty of information about deliver etc , give them a try

positive	i would sell my old_iphone 0 but it is too useful as an ipod
positive	the web_site was really easy to navigate and find the light_bulbs i wanted .

positive	i have used light_bulbs direct before and would definitely use them again .
positive	nothing more to say .
positive	this review will come_across a little_bit fan boyish , but i really love this website .
positive	you can pick_up some really cheap games , and it '_s perfectly legal ( at_least by uk law ).
positive	the prices are similar to steam sale prices , and most of the cd_keys are for steam .
positive	i '_ve bought about four games from here now and it '_s been reliable and fast every time .
positive	i ' d defiantly recommend this site .
positive	i bought the multi led outdoor_lights , together with the transformer and an extension_cable .
positive	these arrived very quickly and i soon had them working .
positive	i was so pleased with them that i bought another two packs of lights .
positive	it was the week before_christmas , yet they again arrived very quickly .
positive	i connected these to my original set and i am very pleased with the display on the bushes around our kitchen garden .

positive	so refreshing to deal with an order like that
positive	having_trawled the internet for broadcast equipment rcb_logic came out as the best priced and well described reviews .

positive	i just purchased a 00 . 0mm omega_planet_ocean ( 0 months old ) and a tag link ( 0 years old ) from watchfinder ( my 00th_birthday_gift from my beautiful wife ).
positive	my wife was willing to purchase a new planet_ocean from my local omega dealer , but we managed to buy both watches from watchfinder for slightly less_than the planet oceans rrp .
positive	i had the privilege of dealing_with cherise from watchfinder , who made the full experience a pleasure .
positive	cherise kept me up to date with both my requests and helped_me through the purchase process .
positive	i received the tag the very next_morning , with the omega following on the day after .
positive	both watches are in excellent condition ( both are 00 / 00 ), and the omega was even originally sold by my local omega dealer ( very small world ).
positive	i am already searching watchfinder for my next watch , and hope to be in contact with cherise shortly .
positive	do not be afraid to make them an offer if you see a wach you want , but it '_s slightly out of your price range - i did on both watches and saved an additional £_000 of the asking price - no cheek , no chance .

positive	i have been through many pairs of sunglasses over the years , and am very fussy when it comes to finding the right ones .
positive	i saw a pair of raybans whilst on holiday in canada , and wanted to but them , but they were very expensive so i thought i would wait and see if i could_find them on the internet .
positive	upon_arriving home i spent a lot of time trying to find them for a reasonable price , and after much searching found that one of the first sites i had been on had them for the best price !

positive	fantastic service from_start to finish
positive	i would highly_recommend this service calendars are of an excellent quality .
positive	i would defiantly use them again
positive	i contacted parts_gateway because i needed a wheel in a hurry ; i entered my details on the website , and within 00_mins i had 0 offers !
positive	i selected one of them and was delighted with the service ; they even sent a photo of the wheel to ensure it was the correct one .
positive	it was sent out the same day , and i received it the following_day .
positive	i saved over £_000 . 00 by buying second - hand , and the wheel is in very good condition .
positive	give them a try ; you will be pleased you did .
positive	the blind was easy to order from the website , was delivered on time , and fitted_perfectly with no adjustment needed .
positive	i '_ve bought vertical_blinds and venetian_blinds from blinds0go , and have always been delighted with the fit and finish .
positive	i '_ve been visiting gv for years_now and it '_s always something of an event for me .
positive	just the beautiful old building is worth the trip alone , even if it wasn_'_t packed to the rafters with wonderful gear .
positive	this sunday i dropped in on a whim to get a bad contact in the jack_socket of my 0000 tele sorted_out .
positive	barnaby fixed it there and then in about half an_hour and wanted to charge me nothing for doing it .
positive	brilliant service , brilliant shop .
positive	i found axminster through a recommendation and have bought numerous items since .
positive	the product range is exceptional and they have some really good offers from time to time .
positive	i '_ve only ever had one problem , where a pickiing error meant that my order quantity was one short .
positive	however , a brief phone_call was all it took to resolve the matter and the missing item arrived the next_day .
positive	i have no connection with the business other than being a very satisifed customer .
positive	customer_focused and kept me in the picture all the time
positive	price , delivery and service were all very good , the processor was well_packaged when it arrived and we were kept_informed to within a couple of hours as to when it would arrive .

positive	i wouldn_'_t hesitate to purchase from the company again .
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	i used tyre_shopper and not only did i get my tyres at a discount , but i was able to select date and time of my choosing and at a location convenient to me .
positive	the tyres were far cheaper_than at any of my other local tyre_centres and yet incredibly will be fitted_locally by a well_known tyre_centre .
positive	great website !
positive	easy to pick by price range or blooms .
positive	good special_offers and well_presented bouquet .
positive	all with 00_%_discount if you search on line .
positive	second time i '_ve_used serenata and have not been dissappointed on either occasion .
positive	really good service .
positive	we '_ve had our air_ram and the smaller hand_held model for a few weeks now and they are both great .
positive	i didn_'_t think you could get this much power and performance from a re - chargeable vacuum_cleaner .
positive	we live in a fairly large apartment with carpet , ceramic tiles and " karndean " type flooring and it handles them all with ease .
positive	additionally the air_ram is so light and manoeuvrable with no flex to worry_about .
positive	we also use the small hand_held model 0 - 0 times a day for quick tidy ups of crumbs etc from the kitchen_floor and around the toaster - it is also great for the car .
positive	would thoroughly_recommend both models !
positive	!
positive	excellent service - good prices - would definitely use again
positive	no_problems at all , no criticism at all .
positive	great car , great price and great service .
positive	cyberpower did a great job with my pc , it runs very well .
positive	they also managed to build and ship it in about a day when i only paid for 0 day fast track !
positive	great service .
positive	in my experience though , i can '_t say anything great about the courier which was used ( uk mail ?
positive	), as it got held in one of their depots for a few_days missing the saturday delivery i paid extra for .
positive	nothing cyberpower could have done about that though of course so not a criticism on them .
positive	after_searching several websites , found best price at tyreleader .
positive	product delivered as promised .
positive	fully recommend
positive	this is the third appliance we have purchased from ao . com & they never_fail us .
positive	i ordered the latest item , a slimline dishwasher late evening & it was delivered [ by ao . com '_s own drivers / vehicle ] the following afternoon , free of charge .

positive	i '_ve heard plenty of horror_stories from startups who offer more then don_'_t pay out .
positive	mazuma don_'_t always come top for big payouts , but they are one of only a handful of companies i ' d trust .

positive	prompt service , device returned as good as new ( totally smashed_screen )

positive	while trying to find some promotional usb_drives to give away on behalf of my company while at exhibitions and the like , i certainly found places online which perhaps were a little ( but not much ) cheaper_than flashbay .
positive	so , being sensible i emailed the companies whom i believed had the right products for me .
positive	within an_hour only flashbay had contacted me back .
positive	i politely_declined their free usb pack as i didn_'_t wish to feel obligated to buy from them , though they sent one anyway with the assurance i ' d not receive any other unwanted emails or marketing .
positive	sure_enough , the next_day i received the usb sample_pack , which was beautifully_presented ( the addition of free haribo went down extremely well in the office (!)).
positive	this was the game changer .
positive	by this point i had received some half - hearted emails from other_companies asking for greater detail as to what i wanted , but by now i ' d forwarded my company '_s logo over and had received several ' proofs ' of how the finished product would look .
positive	long_story_short , flashbay ( and allan_meldrum in particular , who handled my case exceptionally ) were entirely professional , and were happy to be flexible with my needs .
positive	as such i did not_hesitate to make an order , and will_definitely be visiting again in future when our stocks become low .
positive	a thoroughly decent experience .
positive	my sincere_thanks go to flashbay for their professionalism , friendliness and quality of service .
positive	bought 0 stair carpets , both different lengths ... excellent quality .. and the price was well_worth what you get ... and delivery speed to mainland_uk is excellent too .. very pleased and well impressed with overall service ... will_certainly be buying from them again ...

positive	still nice and cool and even separated the raw meats from the other items like peanut_butter and oats which i had also ordered , another thumbs_up from me .

positive	a great site , service and product
positive	delivery quality is ok .
positive	however no options for delivery for specific time ex .
positive	00 am etc .
positive	i am just writing to show my appreciation of your company .
positive	the delivery times were excellent , and the price was very reasonable .
positive	the memory i purchased was for a very old laptop !
positive	a compaq armada 0000 !
positive	i must let you know that the bios needs resetting after installing this memory .
positive	this requires removing the battery for at_least one minute .
positive	after this the cmos will report the change in the memory size .
positive	windows 00 is now reporting 000_mb of ram in my system !
positive	which is a big_improvement from 00 meg by default .
positive	apparently these laptops are very picky in which type of memory you can install .
positive	000mb pc 000 00 x 0 arrangement was correct .
positive	once again , thank_you for your excellent service and speedy delivery times .
positive	i will_definitely be recommending you to friends !
positive	regards ,
positive	john gildert
positive	from works in hackney , east_london these_guys have a great personal service at superb quality for prices cheaper_than the big brands like photobox and others .
positive	i ' d go striaght back to these_guys next time i need canvas_prints etc .
positive	- accurate product description
positive	- best prices i have found on the net
positive	- next_day delivery was inckluded as standard for me ( possibly due ot order size - £_000 )
positive	- excellent service ; once i ordered an incorrect item by mistake and they offered a no_quibble next_day exchange even before i sent back the incorrectly ordered product .
positive	this was dead easy arrange - all online .

positive	i used their drop_off and collect service which suited me , and the recipient down to the ground .
positive	the drop_off point was only a few_hundred yards from my home and the collection_point was only o . 0 miles from my friends home .
positive	he could collect at his leisure , no need to wait at home for the delivery .
positive	on top of all that it was delivered the very next_day .
positive	it even included their tracking service .
positive	how can they do it for that price ?
positive	i will be ordering new spectacles from selectspecs within the next few weeks .
positive	having purchased from them before i have no_hesitation in using them again .
positive	when your prescription changes every two years , as mine does , it seems silly to pay hundreds of pounds for them each time .
positive	at these prices i can buy new glasses and have spare pair to use when i have mislaid the other .
positive	which happens quite often these days .
positive	it makes_sense to me .
positive	the flooring was delivered on the advised date .
positive	a very pleasant lorry_driver placed the pallet two steps from my front_door which made it easy to take inside .
positive	i have laid the flooring in the lounge and dining_room , i will tackle the hall tomorrow .

positive	flooring_supplies have made it easy for me .
positive	would i recommend them to a friend ?
positive	i have already , the friend being a carpenter .
positive	he was most impressed with the quality of the flooring for the price .
positive	what more can i say .
positive	ink works well and delivery two_days after order .
positive	does the job , only let_down was the post_office with delivery .
positive	the white lenses arrived day after ordering .
positive	took a few minutes to focus with them but then ...... great !

positive	the dino_pc website is easy to negotiate and choosing a computer was easily accomplished due to the various helps available ; for instance , customising was straightforward as such a lot of guidance is available with respect to the various upgrades and their benefits of these .
positive	my choice of computer is working well and i am just getting used to windows 0 .
positive	the only slightly negative_aspect of the computer is that the case of my desktop_computer , although adequate , is not as robust as others i have had in the past .
positive	i chose the basic case and perhaps it is advisable to bear this in mind if one is likely to have cause to move your computer around from location to location .
positive	overall , i am very pleased and on my experience i would highly_recommend dino computers .

positive	thanks for the fuji_hs00 , i ordered it 0pm on thursday and it arrived mid_morning friday using the next_day delivery service .
positive	i will not hsitate to recommend you to friends and family .
positive	if like me you are self - employed and googled " annuity " when nearing retirement , then you would have found a bewildering choice of companies promising the earth .
positive	some of the differences in the quotes and the amount of commissions some comparison_sites wanted for a very little work , was daunting .
positive	my pension_expert did what they said they would do .
positive	they compared the market for me , came up with better quotes than i had been able to find myself , consolidated my four pension_pots into one and liaised with all the insurance companies on my behalf .
positive	the whole_process was hassle_free , all the staff were very helpful and i would certainly recommend them to others .
positive	did what they said , completely stress_free
positive	best online service ever , i '_ve never known a company so efficient .
positive	there '_s only been one occasion when my order didn_'_t come the next_day and that was down to royal_mail and contactlenses . co . uk supplied me with free lenses to keep me going and then resent my order when the originals didn_'_t turn_up .
positive	perfect , 00 out of 00 .
positive	keep_up the good work .
positive	mats arrived a few_days after the order & looked exactly as hoped .
positive	i ordered a couple of packs of lures .
positive	they were dispatched the next_day and arrived a couple of days_later .
positive	can '_t ask more than that .

positive	worked out £ 0 cheaper_than the next cheapest online_retailer .
positive	delivery was quick and items packed well .
positive	the service from digitalrev was excellent and surpassed many uk electronic sellers , who can take up to 0 days to deliver .
positive	my sony e_- mount lens was ordered on may 0st and delivered to my address in the uk on may 0rd - i didn_'_t even realise international_shipping could be that quick !
positive	the parcel was very well_packed and the contents in pristine factory packed condition .
positive	if digitalrev can continue to undercut uk prices i will use them in future for my camera needs .
positive	the only potential downside is that i assume goods purchased from_hk will not be eligible for a uk warranty ( classed_as grey_imports ), but should anything go_wrong with the lens or future_purchases , then i just hope digitalrev can deal with the return in an efficient and painless manner as they were to deal with when buying the goods in the first place .
positive	ordered on the sunday and both items delivered on tuesday .
positive	despatch confirmation received by email .
positive	no_complaints here , the transaction went very smooth and i am very happy with the service .

positive	i went online last monday_morning to look for a spare_part for our aging power_shower and came_across the shower_doctor website .
positive	it was a breeze to navigate and not only found the part i needed but also the solution to stop the annoying slow drip underneath the shower_head which has_been annoying ' er_indoors for years .
positive	i better point out that the ' slow drip ' was water and not our son !
positive	i ordered everything that i needed at 00 . 00 and imagine my surprise and delight when at 00 . 00 the next_morning our smiling postie rang the doorbell with my order in his hands .
positive	twenty two and a half hours from ' click ' to ' bing - bong '!
positive	i wasn_'_t able to figure_out where to fit the valve to stop the drip from the shower_head so went to their website and explained my dilemma with their online tech_support .
positive	within half an_hour shower_doctor replied not only with clear_instructions on how to fit the valve but a link to a clear diagram of the workings of the power_shower .
positive	if you want fast , efficient , professional service on any_issues you might have with your shower , if you don_'_t go straight to their website , you ' re a plonker !

positive	despite_being relatively new to the technical side of recording , i knew i needed a certain spec of equipment for my projects and i also knew that i was on a budget .
positive	i looked at dolphin_music , among others , as the prices that they had for the kit i needed was excellent .
positive	rather_than order blindly on the internet , i decided to seek a little advice and gave dolphin a call .
positive	i was put through to a man called paulo who was patient with a luddite like me and listened to what i had planned and what i thought i needed .
positive	he talked_me through every_step of what was required and made some suggestions that hit the button perfectly .
positive	i even changed the order to ensure that my new kit ( mixing desks , mics , amps , the whole nine yards ) would be able to cope with future_projects and allow me to cover all bases .
positive	paulo then set about putting all of my wish_list into a suggested order and emailed me with his thoughts .
positive	a couple of changes and i placed the order .
positive	some of the equipment would have to be ordered from the manufacturers so there would be a wait so that the ordered could be sent in one go .
positive	perfectly understandable .
positive	i got news that some work would be heading my way that meant i would need parts of my order sooner_than_expected .
positive	a quick email to paulo and he called me to find out what i needed and he then set about packaging up all of the , now , urgent stuff and has just informed me that it is being despatched today , with the rest to follow once it comes in from the manufacturer .
positive	not only was paulo , and dolphin , excellent in pointing me in the direction of the kit i needed , but also very responsive when my timescales changed .
positive	they have gone out of their way to make_sure they can get me the best stuff , at the best price and at the time i need .

positive	if there is a problem , i am confident ch0000 will back me up .

positive	it was doddle to fit ( not needing a major boiler dismantle , as the ravenheat manual said .
positive	when the boiler was swiched back on it then began to fire up each time on demand perfectly .
positive	before fitting this part it might go through the ignition motions 0 to 0 times or more , before the main burner would eventually ignite .

positive	00 year_old boiler now working like new !

positive	after having my prescription_oakleys stolen from the car i needed a new pair !

positive	delivery was quicker_than_expected and a lot quicker_than some retail opticians were quoting !
positive	!

positive	the villa has many plus points , it was spacious , clean and had everything you needed for a lovely holiday .
positive	the pool and the garden area were attractive , and although early in the season , we were able to swim in the good size pool thanks to the pool_heating which was a real_bonus .
positive	the only minus_points were that a new house has_been built close to the property and reduces the privacy .
positive	most of the pool_area and the upstairs bedrooms are now overlooked .
positive	also several of the nieghbours now keep peacocks which can be very noisy both day and night .
positive	great service , best price , delivered bang on time will_definitely use again

positive	i later rang the fitting_centre the day before my chosen fitting date & they confirmed my order and what '_s more informed me i could have them fitted that same day as the tyres were already in stock .
positive	to top it all , the price i paid was quite a saving to the prices i had been quoted from other local_garages .
positive	highly_recommended 😃😃😃

positive	fast despatch , all in all very please , would recommend and use again !
positive	stumbled_across digitalrev whilst looking for a good price on a nokia 000 .
positive	they had the cheapest price so i explored further .
positive	the website was exceptionally well_laid_out - easy to understand and use , with clear_explanations on the warranty and returns options .
positive	i didn_'_t spot anywhere that explained why the products were cheaper was due to them coming from the far_east , however i gathered as much because of the detailed_information on the available warranties .
positive	this and the consistently good feedback made me decide to place me order with them .
positive	registering on their site gave_me many options of further interaction and i felt that there is a strong emphasis on creating an exceptional on - going customer experience .
positive	after_placing my order it updated instantly with the order and then tracking_details , and i was delighted with the speed of delivery .

positive	they email you when they receive your phone and keep you in the loop with the progress of your order .
positive	once confirmed that the phone is as_described you get another email tellingyou that all is ok and tell you the date that the payment will be made .

positive	as soon as the email with the attached pictures arrived i knew i had to purchase the watch .
positive	kieran was very helpful answering any questions i had and also assisted_me when there was an issue when i tried to check out the watch online .
positive	a day later the watch was waiting for me once i got home , and absolute love it .
positive	it ’_s as though i ’ ve gone back in time and brought a brand_new omega_seamaster from 0000 .
positive	that was the exact_model and year i was after so was great to be able to find it on here .

positive	whether this is down to m0yp or the royal_mail , i don_'_t know .
positive	be sure to send your phone as special delivery as this covers you up to £_000 .
positive	signed for mail i believe is only £_00 .
positive	emails for when my phone arrived with them and was tested are good , meaning you are kept in the loop .
positive	payment does admittedly take a number of days after this ( i had the money in my account in full , 0 days before the date they stated however ) so if you ' re in a rush for the money , you may have to look_elsewhere .
positive	given the amount they gave for my phone , and ignoring the envelope and delayed payment issues , i would definitely recommend these_guys .
positive	they paid the most for my phone by a good 00 or 00_% i ' d say .
positive	very happy .

positive	and it '_s not always because they are the cheapest .
positive	if i see something somewhere_else that '_s a few_pounds_cheaper , i still purchase from amazon .
positive	why ?
positive	because i know i '_ll get my stuff and superfast .
positive	they don_'_t use the royal_mail as far as i '_m aware and that '_s why most of the time your items arrive on time .
positive	with the royal_mail it '_s always a gamble if they will arrive at all ...
positive	yesterday for the first time ever , something i bought didn_'_t turn_up .
positive	so i called them or rather i clicked the link for them to call me .
positive	which they did in seconds .
positive	the customer service person apologised and said they would send me another one out immediately and that they would try and find out what happened to the original package - but that i didn_'_t need to worry_about it , it was all taken_care of .
positive	lush .
positive	i like them even more now .

positive	recommended .
positive	i '_ve been buying skis and ski stuff from edge and wax for about four years_now and service has always been perfect .
positive	skis arrive beautifully_wrapped and properly prepared and waxed , not just slung in a box like a lot of other_retailers .
positive	they got me going on waxing and prepping my own skis as well and now i enjoy looking after my own skis and the family '_s skiing is better for it .

positive	the things i look for in a supplier is the product i need , at the right price and quick delivery .

positive	we had decided we needed to invest in some company branded_usb_sticks and after some online research flashbay seemed to come out on top .
positive	i asked for some quotes and sent our logo so their designers could render a sample design .
positive	the quotes and designs came promptly back and i was presented with a very professional looking set of designs .
positive	without_hesitation we placed an order for 00 and they were delivered ahead of schedule the following week .
positive	we were over the moon with what we received as the end product had been made to the highest_standard .
positive	the laser_engraving that we had requested was really impressive .
positive	i would highly_recommend flashbay to anyone looking for a professional company that gets results with very cheap prices .
positive	i recommend skiddle . com to any one .
positive	easy to pay and i got my e ticket straight_away .
positive	i had no_problems with both my purchases from echo .

positive	also very fast delivery of purchased items , would definitely recommend to friends & definitely going to buy again in the future !
positive	would normally use bikediscount in germany as it is the cheapest but pedalon was comparable in price for what i wanted
positive	i purchased a chocolate smart phone and a chocolate games hand control for two of my nephews .
positive	as they are grown up easter_eggs would be inappropriate but these gifts are just right .
positive	reading some reviews of these products they said the items were expensive for the size but i did not find this to be so .
positive	they were the actual size of the real items and very well detailed .
positive	my nephews will be thrilled with them .
positive	i like that they make it easy to price match from other_sites , because i '_m cheap !
positive	we took the bug spray on holiday with us to goa .

positive	!
positive	my order was submitted saturday_afternoon with free_postage , which basically meant i had to wait 0 working_days .
positive	no problem but , when my order arrived tuesday_morning i was very pleasantly_surprised .
positive	i ordered the lens on sunday and i was unpacking it on the wednesday .
positive	i don_'_t think that i '_ve ever_seen so much bubble - wrap before - it took me ages to unwrap it and underneath was my brand_new lens in perfect_condition .
positive	i can '_t fault the service that i have received from digital - rev .
positive	i just wish that all companies_operated as well .
positive	a very pleased customer indeed .
positive	i needed a us itunes voucher to purchase a documentary for a university project that isn_'_t available in my country yet .
positive	i ordered said voucher from ebay but as it '_s a physical copy i am still_waiting for it to be delivered , and i was afraid it wouldn_'_t be delivered in time for when it was needed .
positive	so i did some extensive_searching and came_across this website .
positive	it all looks a bit untoward and the website appeared amongst a slew of similar_sites after a google_search , but i was beginning to get desperate .
positive	after deliberating for over an_hour on whether or not to take the plunge , imagine my relief when the voucher_code turned_up in my account a few minutes after ordering .
positive	a confirmation code is sent to your phone and you need to set_up a security question before accessing your voucher ( there is also a warning that appears stating you cannot be refunded once you view your code , which made me even more nervous , but i suppose it '_s to cover their own backs ).
positive	the voucher is presented as a scan of the back of the voucher , which makes it appear more legitimate .
positive	the whole_experience still makes me feel a little_uneasy even now , but that '_s probably due to my initial reservations and the fact that there are a lot of scam websites out there .
positive	i wouldn_'_t like to purchase from here too often but based on my experience if you really need something then you have nothing to worry_about .
positive	shoes were exactly as_described and delivered quickly as promised .
positive	i was kept up to date with order tracking and didn_'_t have to pay extra for postage .
positive	what more could you ask ?
positive	ordering was easy , they kept me informed on delivery and it was delivered when they said they would .
positive	what else do you want
positive	i have tried four websites and i got so many questions before i actually was told didnt do that route or the times were wrong .
positive	a ferry was straight_forward and clear to use .
positive	keep it up and don_'_t get clotted aferry
positive	thanks
positive	received memory ram plugged it in booted my old sluggish desktop and now i have a flying machine .
positive	this is the way that all companies should treat their customers .
positive	i found what i was looking for and it was reasonnably priced .
positive	quick delivery , i will consider frost for future_purchases
positive	truly_amazed_how good , efficient and cost_effective ' buyabattery . com ' are !
positive	i ordered a rat trap on a sunday via the internet .
positive	there was an email reply within an_hour , and the package was delivered on the tuesday , on the day and at the time advised .
positive	all in all a very efficient service .
positive	( the only minor ' problem ' was getting emails from " pest_control ", as i kept wondering_why banksy was emailing me !
positive	this is an ' in joke ', but if you google " pestcontrolbanksy " you will see why !
positive	).
positive	this is a really excellent service which not only saves money but the delivery time was shorter_than_expected .
positive	no competition .
positive	i had the money in my account day after_posting the phone .
positive	i '_m actually quite impressed with the service .

positive	the whole_experience with fonebank was a breeze .

positive	the confirmation_email was in my inbox by the time i got back to my desk around 00mins later .
positive	an_absolute_pleasure to deal with such a friendly and efficient company as mazuma .
positive	in my experience with mazuma , i was requested to phone an employee on a certain number and that person answered the phone !!!!!
positive	i could not recommend mazuma highly_enough .
positive	great experience , great accommodation ( quirky , ancient exposed brick and timber ceilings ) and inexpensive ( a fully_kitted_out studio for 0 with courtyard for less_than a standard hotel_room ).
positive	great !
positive	took my printer in for repair .
positive	i was phoned a couple of days_later and told the problem would be quite expensive and on the borderline between having the repair done or buying a new printer .
positive	i asked them to dispose of the printer since it did not seem worth repairing .
positive	i was asked whether i wished for their sales_department to contact me and i agreed .
positive	the sales_person agreed to get back to me with a recommendation .
positive	this he did an suggested an epson 000 , a new model , at £_00 .
positive	i checked this out on line and agreed this was ideal .
positive	the price on line was £_00 .
positive	i had asked for a model that used the same ink as my previous printer since i had a new set of epson 000sx inks by me .
positive	since the 000 used different inks the sales_person agreed with epson that i could swap the inks for a new set of 000 inks .
positive	this extra help made it a far better deal than the 000 on line !
positive	i did not need to discard inks that cost some £_00 and had no need to buy new ink at about the same cost .
positive	this save me me some £_00 if my maths are right .
positive	all of this was dealt_with in a friendly , efficient way .
positive	i was extremely pleased with the service and am now extremely pleased with the product .
positive	if your paitent and have your ticket ready to scan your fine !

positive	although at the beginning there was no follow_up call to see if my bank_statements arrived in the post - which was disappointing and i still do not know where they ended_up !
positive	chris beecher and his_team did a sound job in going above and beyond delivering the car in a short amount of time .

positive	we have liked every choice we have made from westin .
positive	their bacon and ham are the best we have tasted in recent years .
positive	the bacon is not full of water like other well_known_brands , we have used donald russel for many_years for their quality standards even_though we find it expensive .
positive	the only meats we buy from them now are chateaubriand and lamb racks ( when they are on offer ) and since beginning to use westin_gourmet we haven_'_t seen them advertised in their sales literature .
positive	i personally believe a lot of relatives and friends of ours have already ordered fro wg with our recommendation .
positive	my new ( secondhand ) pc arrived the day after ordering ( even_tho ' i was a cheapskate and went for the free delivery option 0 - 0 working_days ).
positive	it was well_packaged , in good condition , and is working fine .
positive	this is the second pc i have bought from you , and would recommend you to anyone .
positive	the first purchase - 00 august_0000 was a lenovo t000 laptop , after much dithering , went for a grade 0 item , with win0 pro 00 installed .
positive	although i was a cheapskate ( again ), and went for free delivery ( 0 - 0 days ), it arrived next_day , complete , well_packaged and working .
positive	it shows signs of its previous life ( polished corners and keys on the keyboard ), but no damage , no dead_pixels , no cracks scratches or other marks .
positive	lenovo showed that it was just on 0 years old .
positive	i have upgraded it with wwan , and more memory , upgraded to 00 bit ( using the same license ) and off we go , a great performer for not much money .
positive	only_snag , i didn_'_t realise it didn_'_t have an sd_card slot , cos i didn_'_t read the spec closely enough .
positive	would like a built in version for portability , but i '_ll sort that .
positive	overall , great performance from tier0 .
positive	i was very pleased with the efficient service received from personal_injury assist .
positive	they took care of all the necessary_documents and made the process seem so easy .

positive	samsung printed user instructions sufficiently comprehensive and clear .
positive	booklet should be larger than a0 and printed on heavier paper in bolder type for easier quicker reference .
positive	amazon has some great deals , especially as they like to undercut the rest of the big_players on the internet , ie .
positive	play . com zavvi . com etc ...
positive	so to find a site that promised to undercut amazon is a godsend !
positive	just log in & paste the amazon link & they '_ll send you an offer , usually within_00hrs .
positive	i '_ve had several deals from them .
positive	they also let you know when the item will be delivered so you ' re not guessing .
positive	like amazon ?
positive	love flubit !
positive	good prices , quick delivery .
positive	good communication .
positive	i ordered a tv from 000 since they were the cheapest on the net .

positive	i rang before i ordered a wetsuit & was re - assured i could return it if it didn_'_t fit .

positive	the price was the best in the western world with over 00_%_discount .
positive	highly_recommended ; would use again !
positive	i have used several packs of bombyx_mori - it contnues to do an excellent job ...... i am in my early 00 '_s but quite fit for my age :_o and it has made me very virile .

positive	very good facilities , all very well and conveniently situated , with minimal walking .
positive	i used the valet_parking , business lounge and duty_free shop .
positive	all provided excellent service .
positive	will always choose southend_airport if flights are available from it .
positive	i decided to use hatched to sell house because in my opinion there is no justification for the crazy amouunts of money that traditional_estate_agents charge .
positive	0 %, 0 % or even 0 . 0 % is a rip_off considering what they set out to achieve - which is to sell a property .
positive	through experience of selling my late father '_s house i can clearly see that some estate_agents are so much_better_than others , but these days most potential_buyers have a good idea of where they want to buy , what they want the property to be like and how much they have to spend .
positive	so all you need is some clear property details , online exposure through the popular property search websites , and a guide price .
positive	if you are prepared to show potential_buyers around then hatched is absolutely ideal .
positive	i preferred showing people around becasue i could answer all their questions straight_away and i can get a feel for whether they are serious or not .
positive	it also stops nosey neighbours and so called friends wasting time by viewing for their own curiousness .
positive	when i was buying a house i was appauled at some estate_agents inability to conduct a reasonable viewing .
positive	so i tried to sell my house myself by creating my own website and having a for sale sign made .
positive	but , i only got interest from one or two people and that '_s because you need to be online , hatched solves that issue , plus they provide a for sale sign and deal with all enquiries .
positive	they charge a reasonable and flexible fee which is in line with the service that they provide .
positive	traditional_estate_agents can sell your house and make the whole_process fancy but still just as painful , so save_yourself some money and only pay for what you need - online exposure , for sale sign and an office to handle to correspondance .
positive	i did and i saved .
positive	i have used these_guys hundreds of times and only had 0 breakage and 0 lost parcel ... not bad i say !!
positive	!
positive	i purchased a pacman hoodie for my bro at christmas time 0000 & not only was it an exclusive product but at £_00 . 00 inc delivery i nthink it was a good deal too .
positive	ill bear them in mind for the future .
positive	the amazon platform is very easy to use & i like the way the site knows you and has reccomendations .
positive	the mp0 store is also very convenient and quick .
positive	i would like to see them creating jobs for young people - they are a big company and can make a difference to the uks unemployment problem .
positive	i recently_purchased a chauvet gobo 0 . 0 from these_guys and the service and pricing was good .
positive	thanks and keep it up !!
positive	!
positive	very good site and great prices !
positive	i love this site its very useful and has helped_me save_money
positive	they have always been quite helpful and give me good discounts for being a loyal_customer
positive	never had any_issues with them , very quick delivery and allways accurate
positive	i had occasion to return a tool to ffx as faulty .
positive	the people i corresponded with by email and by telephone were very helpful and sent a replacement very quickly .
positive	i am a delighted customer and i have added ffx to my list of favourite suppliers .
positive	i have been using rentalcars for many_years_now , and i can not think of one occasion where i have had a cause to complain .
positive	first_class operation .
positive	will_certainly be using your company again !
positive	i '_ve been using quidco for over 0 years and i simply cannot stop !
positive	i have already received over £ 0000 . 00 cash_back .
positive	i am buying everything via quidco - ebay , holiday , insurance , printers , pcs , stationary ...
positive	i found the prices a couple of pounds better_than the other advertising companies on each phone i sent in .
positive	it only took a few_days and the money was clear in my account .
positive	great service .
positive	would recomend this merchant
positive	top quality goods plus cash_back
positive	will use again
positive	a good and easy way to buy records always been happy with the service good customer service would recommend to friends happily
positive	seriously slick service and payment was super quick .
positive	firstly , the price was great and so much_better_than the high_street rip - offs .
positive	i need ultra_thin_lenses , which are about £_00 at glasses_direct compared to £_000 + (!!)
positive	on the high_street .
positive	then their ( fairly regular ) 00_%_off discount offer bundled with bogof on frame enabled_me to get 0 pairs for about £_000 ( same price the high_street would have charged just for one pair of lenses ).
positive	but other_websites are pretty_much the same price , so what is the difference ?
positive	glasses_direct '_s free home_trial ( for its full range , including designer ) was the deciding_factor .
positive	besides the ( unavoidable ) time it takes , it really was hassle_free and allowed_me to try on quite a few pairs before_deciding .
positive	this is really important as the ones i went for in the end were completely not the favourite ones when browsing the website .
positive	the order was turned around fairly quickly - just over a week for mine with fairly high prescription and astigmatism .
positive	unfortunately , it turned_out that one of the lenses was scratched when it got to me .
positive	while this isn_'_t ideal , i returned the glasses and as it was within their no - quibble timeframe they didn_'_t ask any questions and promptly replaced the lenses and sent them back to me after a week or so .
positive	so unless you absolutely need your glasses urgently ( why ?
positive	), i really see no reason to be paying for high_street_opticians ' crazy prices .
positive	it '_ll help me save up for my laser_eye_surgery and finally be rid of glasses altogether !
positive	this is my favourite kind of online shop , which is backed by a physical shop , which usually means great customer service .
positive	and the product i bought ( magimix le blender ) was the lowest_price on the internet .
positive	ordered sunday_night and the item was despatched monday_morning , got to me tuesday .
positive	free delivery as well !
positive	superb !
positive	der opstod ingen_problemer , mine varer kom i fin stand , og_de_var hjemme ved mig indenfor 0 - 0_dage .

positive	i often send drinks as birthday_presents and the drink_shop is always where i go .
positive	they are reliable and have a cracking range of rum ( among other things , but it is always rum i buy ).
positive	the only thing i would say is they take about a week to deliver ( to scotland ).
positive	their prices and range are excellent though so as i am generally happy in the knowledge that if i were more organised this wouldn_'_t be an issue .
positive	i phoned the technical_advice department and described the product i required .
positive	they quickly told me exectly what i needed to order and my order was posted out same day .
positive	i ordered it on thursday and it came on friday .
positive	it was a cube amp 00 watts .

positive	i recommend them to everyone
positive	quick website response and ordered the tyres within 0 mins , and confirmed a location for fitting .
positive	as it happened the fitting_centre had no stock for a few_days , so i was called by tyre_shopper and they rang round to arrange a different fitting_centre who has stock .
positive	great service and would thoroughly_recommend them to others .
positive	very impressive as i placed my order on the tuesday , the postage envelope turned_up on the thursday , posted the phone and the money was in my account on the friday lunch time .
positive	would highly_recommend mazuma to anyone who has a phone to sell & will myself be using them again in the future .
positive	found it very easy to identify the correct parts and place the order .
positive	a super quick delivery .
positive	espares are my first_port of call when i require parts .
positive	not been let_down yet .
positive	felt i needed to get extra cover for things like collision_damage and all those things the normal car_hire insurance does not cover or charge silly money like € 00 a day .
positive	when i unfortunately had to make a claim it couldn_'_t have been easier .
positive	will use them again , couldn_'_t fault the web_site , keep right up to date with how the order was going , didn_'_t wait that long for my goods neither .

positive	great service & price ; very convenient

positive	loads of products at knock down crazy prices !
positive	it has_been a pleasure to deal with such an efficient company . we wanted an item ( a new loo_seat to be exact ) but weren_'_t sure of size etc .
positive	one phone_call to really pleasant , helpful guy sorted the issue and we were able to order on line .

positive	many companies do not deliver here so full_marks and a big_thankyou ! we hope they prosper as they deserve .
positive	i have been very impressed with the quality of service , particularly , price and prompt delivery of affordable_supplements .
positive	i got a very good bargain ( half price ) plus following_day delivery when i ordered usn whey_protein .

positive	i have since recommended affordable_supplements to 0 of my friends and will_continue to use the website .

positive	their products are not only moreishly tasty but some of the best nutritional_values i '_ve seen for a reasonable price .
positive	the customer service is great , they are quick to contact and eager to fix any_problems .
positive	they are quick and easy to contact , more than happy to help with problems and they deliver extremely fast too .
positive	i have nothing bad to say about them and in an instant would recommend to anyone who is wanting supplements and workout fuel .
positive	if you ' re looking for a straight transfer service , you can go no further as this service delivered perfectly .
positive	one improvement would be to have a login account service that remembered your details so that the next time you book you can use default details that saves time and effort .
positive	i ordered a shower and received it in two_days .
positive	unfortunately there was a small damage i emailed immediately and they solved the problem within an_hour i had the new unit next_day how about that for good service fantastic
positive	i had used a . different site to order my ski_goggles and with 0days before my trip i was advised they wouldn_'_t reach me in time .

positive	will_definitely order from these_guys again .

positive	the ring arrived into store in plenty of time and my now finacee absolutely_loves it .
positive	we even needed a small re - sizing after the surprise proposal which was done with ease and free of charge .

positive	hi i finding the company very good in services price and the goods very , very good many_thanks
positive	so ..
positive	i made a horrible mistake and went initially to some cowboy_outfit called ' rpc recycle ' simply as i thought i was going to be getting the most for my phone .
positive	let_me tell you if you read this beforehand - do not give your phone to them , hopefully they will get shut_down soon as they are a shambles and not honest in any sense of the word .
positive	instead just stick with mazuma , these_guys are professional , quick , no_hassle , easy and make selling your phone safe and a pleasureable_experience .
positive	i am not affiliated with them at all , just a really satisfied customer .
positive	if you don_'_t believe me then go to rpc first and see what an_absolute sham they are - then go to mazuma and see the difference !

positive	i ordered from bulkpowders after_discovering that my usual_supplier adds gluten into the majority of their protein supplements , but doesn_'_t advertise the fact on their website ( which , as a celiac , is a tad inconvenient ).
positive	their protein_powder is a lot finer than other brands , probably due to the lack of gluten , but it mixes_well in super shakes , and the unflavoured stuff doesn_'_t leave a bad_taste in your mouth , like some other brands .
positive	i '_ve placed two orders with bananafingers so_far , the first one was missing an item , and when i contacted the company to tell them , it was sent out the same day and lead to an interesting email conversation with one of the guys there .
positive	the second order was for a 00m rope , which they ' d run out of , so they upped it to a 00m , which turned_out very handy for those 00m sport routes .
positive	the company does what it says it does .
positive	who_wants more ?
positive	diamond ice grippers are the bench_mark for quality reliability and durability .

positive	if i ever had a minor_issue i just picked_up the phone and spoke to an actual real_life person_who answered my question there and then .

positive	fantastic range of products to choose from , extremely reasonable prices , fast and free next_day delivery .
positive	just cannot find anything negative about the service .

positive	i received both orders the very next_morning , which were packed professionally .
positive	i have already_recommended this company to family and friends .
positive	excellent company , always quickly delivered and i would recommend anybody to use animeddirect .
positive	we came_across round the world_experts when we were pricing a trip to the far_east .
positive	there was a special_offer on the website for a city break : lgw to lisbon , lisbon to miami and return new_york to lgw via lisbon .
positive	the price looked really good .
positive	we wanted to visit lisbon for a short_break and as our son lives in nyc this seemed too good to miss .
positive	so we ended_up booking 0 nights in lisbon , 0 nights in the florida keys and 0 nights in new_york .
positive	we did our own thing on accommodation and the internal flight from miami to newark .
positive	rwe '_s flights were with tap portugal .
positive	ollie smith looked after our booking and it couldn_'_t have been easier .
positive	everything was confirmed and our itinerary emailed over to us with e_- tickets .
positive	we ' d never flown tap before but they were brilliant and even the food was better_than normal airline standard .
positive	can '_t fault the trip at all and we '_ve already booked again with rwe for a bespoke trip to the caribbean .
positive	well_done rwe .
positive	the quality was good and the instructions adequate .
positive	i would recommend this item .
positive	i bought my first mod from ecigzoo when i first started_vaping .
positive	items are sent out very quickly and well_packaged but what makes this company really stand out is the outstanding customer_support .
positive	i had a problem with an item i bought and it was withdrawn from sale immediately while they investigated and i was compensated with a gift_voucher for my trouble .
positive	on another occasion , a simple product inquiry turned into an email conversation with a knowledgeable , polite and friendly member of staff .
positive	occasionally , i find prices cheaper somewhere_else but i come_back because these_guys really care about their customers .
positive	keep_up the good work !
positive	!
positive	easy to use website and swift despatch of remote contol .
positive	as above ....
positive	they gave the best rate of all the companies i checked and delivered on time
positive	i have been purchasing products from amazon for almost a year and they have never disappointed .
positive	for such a large organisation , they are extremely efficient and their customer service is second to none .
positive	i was very impressed with both the products themselves and the site .
positive	myprotein offers good , honest advice about their products and they are very good value for money .
positive	i didn_'_t have any_problems with receiving my products either .
positive	i will be purchasing my supplements from them in the future .
positive	having lost out when r points failed i was not too enthusiastic when signing_up for top cash_back .
positive	i decided to claim whenever i had accumulated £_00 and so_far i have received over £_000 .
positive	the system is easy to understand and payment prompt after claiming .
positive	i have also had almost 000_% payment through from retailers some of whom i had never_heard of previously !
positive	having_searched the net for the best price on a berghaus_jacket from a retailer i had heard of i was disappointed to find that my size was not in stock . however i took_advantage of the suggestion to receive email notification when my size was in stock ( an estimation had appeared on the website ).
positive	this duly_arrived a few_days_later , i ordered the jacket the same day and it arrived ( standard delivery at low_cost ) 0 days_later .
positive	brilliant .
positive	before pharmacy_0u i had to telephone my gps surgery for a repeat_prescription and 0 days_later drive 0 mile_round_trip to collect and take to chemist .
positive	then hang_around for 00_minutes or so until medication ready .
positive	sometimes i would only receive half of my prescription because of local shortages ( like when hay_fever season_starts ) and have to go back a couple of days_later ( another 0 miles ).
positive	now i just go on line , tick the product i need , and it arrives in the post usually next_day .
positive	magic !
positive	choosing the lenses was easy and the whole ordering procedure was a doddle .
positive	great website with fast and efficient service from date of order to delivery .
positive	i would definitely recommend this company to all my friends
positive	bought zoomed reptile light tubes .

positive	packaging exceptional .
positive	second time of using this company and not had a problem .
positive	i have used ffx at_least 0 times for furniture and diy restoration / decoration products such as paint stripper .
positive	a lot of the products i can not get in the local_diy_stores such as button polish .
positive	the prices are very competitive and i have always received my order within the next couple of days .
positive	communications are good informing when , how and why relating to my order .
positive	one order , an item was seriously damaged in transport ( not their fault ) and was promptly replaced without_any cost to me .
positive	i have used tgem several_times and have always had good service and product .
positive	ordering the peacoat from superdry was a doddle .
positive	it arrived on time and was exactly as i had expected and the perfect size .
positive	it '_s made really well , great quality and fit .
positive	we placed our rental flat with urban_sales and lettings and got an immediate_response .

positive	i received the item 0 days_later .
positive	great service .
positive	thanks .
positive	quick , easy , prompt and did the job !
positive	i would recommend serenataflowers to anyone .
positive	great website - easy to use and order .

positive	i know this may sound like a ' fixed ' review but i have nothing to do with the company - just my opinion of them !
positive	exactly_what ordered at a good price and fast delivery - cant_ask for more .
positive	great product coupled_with prompt , friendly and efficient service .
positive	would always use festive_lights .
positive	the costumes were awesome !!
positive	great fit , great quality and we definitely created attention !!
positive	the service was spot on .
positive	many_thanks , will_definitely be using your company again :-) :-) :-)
positive	have used " glasses_direct " previously so was not disappointed in the product .
positive	the only_concern i usually have is in the fitting of the glasses .
positive	i could do with hints on how to adjust the fit .
positive	this is an area where high_street_opticians score of course .
positive	i nearly always use travel_republic to arrange my holidays .
positive	the on screen experience is easy and very informative with an exhaustive choice of flights and hotels and the prices are rarely bettered .
positive	if you ' re looking for a well priced holiday and have time to go through and check out all the options , i haven_'_t found better .
positive	i '_ve booked with them at_least a dozen_times and have never had a problem .
positive	try travel_republic against other holiday sites and i '_m_sure you won_'_t be disappointed , even if its just to give yourself a comparison .
positive	great choice probably enough to spend a whole day going through .
positive	would be back in no time .
positive	a well_designed website , easy to use especially for , i have to admit , a senior_citizen like myself who is just about au_fait with technology .
positive	a joy to use clear , concise and a splendid range of reasonably_priced products .
positive	thank_you prestige_flowers i '_ll be back !
positive	best_wishes to you all

positive	keep_up the good work in the new year .
positive	difficult to see how companies like this will suffer too much in the resession .
positive	merry_christmas .
positive	anyone looking to treat their pet should use viovet instead of getting_ripped of with some vets prices for their animals welfare .
positive	i '_m new to the e_cig world and tried my first try of e_liquid from you guys , firstly , express delivery next_day to the isle of wight !
positive	i thought i ' d have a try of the ciggaweed flavour , it tastes extremely sweet and fruity with a nice amount of vapour , love it !

positive	many_thanks and keep_up the good work !
positive	was looking to boost the ram on my imac i0 to the full 00gb .
positive	apple would have charged me £_000 for this upgrade .
positive	i decided to look around and found mr . memory and behold - a full upgrade to 00gb for £_00 . 00 ( inc . delivery ).
positive	imac is working_perfectly with new memory and it was kingston branded too ( i presumed it would be unbranded or a poorer name but no ).
positive	anyway , as you can probably tell i '_m pretty pleased about the whole_thing and would recommend mr_memory to anyone_thinking of an upgrade ...
positive	many_thanks for the first_class service with my order for my future requirments i will order from you .

positive	great local company , fast service and very helpful , cant go_wrong with these_guys .
positive	the title_says it all .
positive	bought a prs se000 from them and the first guitar to arrive was a dog , cosmetically .
positive	they swapped the guitar with a perfect one and collected the dog within 0 days .
positive	great service and grest price !
positive	i don_'_t do reviews , can '_t genuinely remember ever doing one before but was determined to do one for westin_gourmet .
positive	ordered christmas turkey and the process was faultless from_start to finish .
positive	aside from this ... the product itself was the best i can remember .
positive	it was a crown and a huge one .
positive	i paid for 0 . 0kg and received 0 . 0kg at a price i was more than happy with for the original size .
positive	perfectly packed , well butchered and delivered exactly when promised .
positive	take a bow wg .... i '_m definitely coming_back for more !
positive	!
positive	ordered 0 audio items the same day , one from music_matters and one from a competitor . the music_matter '_s item arrived 0 days ahead of the rival '_s . excellent service and no_hesitation using them again .
positive	i made a mistake on original order , so phoned them up .
positive	they answered the call straight_away , changed the order on the fly and dispatched the correct goods the same day .
positive	does not get any better_than that .
positive	ordered the cheapest beech_worktop on sale for a utility_room , and was expecting a very " blotchy " affair made up of cheap multicoloured woods .
positive	what arrived , although not as good as a prime worktop , was considerably better_than_expected .
positive	delivery chaps also phoned ahead as promised to tell me when they would be arriving .
positive	all in all i was very pleased , and fail to see why anyone would by a worktop from the big diy_stores at nearly twice the price .
positive	ok - the diy_store worktops are already oiled - but by the time you have cut them to fit they need re oiling anyway - and it does not take long to oil from scratch .
positive	i made my purchase on line and found the web_site simple to navigate .
positive	my purchase was made during the afternoon and my batteries arrived first thing the following_day , excellent .
positive	i was truly_amazed when i ordered my mothers_birthday_present on the friday_afternoon and had it delivered first thing saturday_morning .
positive	even better , when the jacket was returned because it was the wrong_size a replacement arrived 00hrs_later .
positive	its refreshing to find such good service still_exists .
positive	well_done !
positive	fast delivery .
positive	excellent service .

positive	technician who fitted a new one was on time , very helpful and polite .
positive	can '_t fault the service and have recommended etyres to others .
positive	nothing but respect for these_guys , have always come through with great service and top quality packaging .
positive	if the item is in stock , urban_industry will always be opt he first place i order my kicks from !
positive	all i can say is if you are looking for a company to repair or supply parts for your iphone ipad this company are probably the best you will find , there customer_services is second to none and they really do go the extra_mile to make things write , riki has done more then i could of asked for and there are very few companies that will treat you this way anymore .
positive	i used a local shop to me that not only made my phone worse but also broke other things and denied all knowledge they had done this , i am more then happy to recommend this company they really do go the extra_mile .
positive	e_- buyer is a company i ' d recommend for a good range of products , at a fair price , with quick delivery , and good back - up , if needed .
positive	i have now placed two_separate_orders with first0magnets .
positive	both packages were delivered rapidly , and were well_packed , with a warning message about accidental injury included in the packet .
positive	the magnets do what is expected of them , and they are robust and powerful .
positive	the chrome_plating should protect them from atmospheric problems for a good while , but of course , i '_ve not had the items for long enough to prove or disprove this .
positive	would i purchase from this supplier again ?
positive	yes , if and when the need_arises .
positive	i ordered several items , and they were all delivered together , a few_days_later , unlike another national_chain - who on a previous occasion sent one of the items one week , one the next , and the third a month later , then had the cheek to charge carriage three_times !
positive	i '_ve not used them since .
positive	great service - friendly and helpful staff when i rang prior to ordering online to ask a question and delivery the following_day as promised .
positive	i placed my order via the telephone rather_than online and the person dealing_with it was most helpful .
positive	my order , budgetshelving mega deal , arrived when they said it would .
positive	the shelving is easy to put_together and once you '_ve done one unit very quick to do further units .
positive	my garage is now much tidier and i can actually get down the middle now !
positive	i would recommend this product to anyone_wanting shelving for their garage or shed etc .
positive	great value , particularly considering the weight capacity .
positive	i have been using the vitabiotics range for several months now and am totally impressed not just with the service but also the product , it '_s true what the old_adage says " it does_exactly_what it says on the tin " asked if i would recommend them the answer would be yes without_any reservations , keep_up the good work guys .
positive	have now ordered several items from this company , searched the internet looking for various clothing items and what can i say ……. what a find !
positive	the service is first_rate with super_fast , reliable delivery , products are excellent , as_described and also reasonably_priced compared to a lot of other_outlets i '_ve looked at , really refreshing to find a company such as this and i would have no_reservations_whatsoever about recommending them to anyone .
positive	ordering via their web_site is very easy and safe and delivery has always been extrememly fast , really reliable company .
positive	very good price
positive	repeat order delivered quickly as usual
positive	best price by far and quick delivery
positive	it was like what it said in the details
positive	quality delivery time only took a couple of days .
positive	product itself is really good quality and looks great .
positive	definately would recommend to a friend !
positive	fantastic site with so many sunglasses to choose from it took me forever to make my mind up - luckily they advise what face_shape each pair of sunglasses suit , helped_me make a much more informed_decision !
positive	the whole_process was easy from choosing my glasses straight through to checkout , and they arrived far quicker_than i expected ; well_packaged as well !
positive	all in all i would whole_heartedly_recommend sunglasses - shop . co . uk to anyone looking for suitable shades - just hope we get a summer now !
positive	will i use this company again .
positive	very simply , yes .
positive	there is nothing not to like about them .
positive	great range , very competative price and quick delivery .
positive	great service by viovet item arrived next_day .
positive	well_done many_thanks .

positive	this company deserves much praise for what it provides !
positive	e buyer is great for various electronic goods
positive	the national_tyres website is convenient to place order , competitively_priced for its services and parts , and finally the website is very user_friendly .
positive	storage_unit is good and access secure but easy to operate .

positive	however ..... for storing cardoard flat_pack cardboard cartons then they attract the moisture within the building and i am finding that they are beginning to lose their strength due to this problem .
positive	great prices .
positive	i was also impressed with the service as the item was couriered the following_day .

positive	a very good site to use and i have used it many_times with no_problems at all .
positive	excellent delivery , well_packaged .
positive	challengeing and rewarding for the children to build and get an insight_into how clocks work .
positive	bit noisy when running .
positive	the chat service provide by parcel0go was a most convenient way to resolve my small problem and the representative that i was in communication with was most helpful and understanding .
positive	the issue was quickly resolved ater a few question and answers and i found the service easy to use and would recommend the process to all .
positive	cannot recommend highly_enough .
positive	bought my now fiancée an_engagement_ring , so was a little reluctant at first to buy such an expensive item online .
positive	however , i was soon put at ease by the professionalism of the customer service and attention to detail .
positive	i am very happy with the service and product i received and will hopefully be buying our_wedding_rings from you in the future !

positive	i was fed_up with the usual spring type mattresses that you can buy as , after a very short time , they would end up with hollows where you laid and become quite uncomfortable .
positive	my friend_suggested that i try the memory_foam mattress and after finding these competitively_priced at the memory_foam warehouse , i decided to try one .
positive	well i must_say , that i will not be going back to the conventional type mattress !
positive	these memory_foam mattresses are very comfortable and shape thereselves around your body .
positive	where i use to wake_up with back_ache and neck ache , i now wake_up refreshed and rested .
positive	i cannot compliment this type of mattress enough and thank my frien very much for recommending them to me .
positive	i now have a very peaceful nights_sleep .
positive	try the memory_foam pillows !
positive	i use to detsroy pillows within a couple of months , but this memory_foam pillow has now lasted me over a year and is still as comfortable as the day i purchased it .
positive	zzzzzzzzzz
positive	everything_went_smoothly , they phoned me to confirm delivery details .
positive	the tiles were great .
positive	they were having some problems with answering their phones ( oct 00 ) which caused me problems but hopefully that is a thing of the past .

positive	i have used it every day for about 0_weeks now .

positive	i travel a lot and tend to vary my hostel / guest - house booking websites depending on the places fellow_travellers have recommended to me and whether they are advertised on a particular website .
positive	i have consistently found hostelbookers to be the easiest , cheapest and most informative website to use .
positive	for these reasons it is my preferred choice .
positive	it is easy to navigate each page from the homepage / guest - house pages / map layouts etc_etc with clear headers for guidance , in all instances i can remember it was comparatively the cheapest and also not only is the depth of information about each guest - house detailed but also local information is readily_available - and this is almost always reliable as it is not only ratified by yourselves at hostelbookers but by other_travellers who have reviewed , commented and posted about various aspects .
positive	i look_forward to continuing to use the hostelbookers website in the future !
positive	from_start to finish , placing my order was fast and simple right through to checking out & payment , easy .. order arrived packaged well and in good time , ten out of ten 00 / 00

positive	got my quote friday_afternoon . return pack turned_up saturday .
positive	had my vouchers the following_tuesday .
positive	faultless .
positive	it '_s nice to get a response from a genuine company providing a good service .
positive	so many want to just take the money and run .
positive	my only_concern with the whole of the inkjet cartridge business , is the return of used cartridges .
positive	i now understand that those with integral print heads could actually be returned , refilled and tested , and put back into circulation .
positive	i wouldn_'_t mind getting back my re - used cartridges that have been refilled , if a suitable return and delivery service could be provided .
positive	i understand cartridges without integral print heads are only good for melting down and so can be disposed of through my local re - cycling centre .
positive	thanks for the response and the new cartridges .
positive	i have never used tyre_shopper before but i will be from now on .
positive	the website was easy to use , offering great value for money on quality tyres .

positive	i recently_purchased some zamberlan vioz walking_boots from openair . co . uk .
positive	unfortunately the boots were not big enough even in the largest_size available .
positive	( i suggest possibly ordering half a size up from normal in this brand )
positive	however when it came to arranging an exchange / refund i was very impressed with the customer service .
positive	they were very quick response to email and telephoned me back to discuss what they could exchange for in my size .
positive	unfortunately they didn_'_t have anything i wanted so agreed a refund which was issued promptly .
positive	i would use them again and recommend them to anyone as they clearly take_pride in giving quality customer service .

positive	will_definitely use priory again for my next lot .
positive	excellent service throughout .
positive	well_done and thanks .
positive	was at first sceptical , but all your arrangements were fully honoured , and i shall use your service again , and let my friends know too .
positive	if you remain at a price level differential that now exists with e . g .
positive	long_stay car_park charges , where the parking is often more_expensive that the flight costs , there '_s no reason for your business not to grow .
positive	probably you are limited in how much you can grow , without having scores of employees however .
positive	i used hellocanvas through an offer , and am_delighted with the result . i have a previous canvas photo from another company , but there is no comparison , the hellocanvas is far_superior . i selected a water scene from a recent_trip to venice , and friends & family comment on how great it looks , transforming a holiday snap into a canellto !

positive	the happy_puzzle catalogue is packed with fun things to catch and hold the attention of children , covering a wide_range of ages and interests .
positive	materials are clean , chunky and durable .
positive	assembly of the more complicated structures can take an adult some time , but for most mums / dads that can be a plus .
positive	so , too , is the evident learning value of many games / puzzles .
positive	in all the happy_puzzle collection is a resource parents should never be without .
positive	i would recommend serenata to friends and family in the future .
positive	it was the first time i used the site .
positive	my mother was most pleased with her surprise birthday gifts , as i couldnt make the travel_arrangements to see her .

positive	on this occasion , i was unhappy initially , with the finished_article .
positive	however , i was immediately contacted by the company , they re - processed the canvas and it arrived the following_day from europe ( i live in the uk ).
positive	it looks fantastic !
positive	this is what i call service .
positive	hello_canvas actually care about the service they provide .
positive	wow - that '_s rare in this day and age .
positive	this type of service restores your faith in internest shopping .
positive	thank_you , thank_you , thank_you ...
positive	with cabrera_medina the up - front price you see is what you pay - no_hidden_extras like cdw , extra driver etc .
positive	they don_'_t even want a credit_card - you can pay in cash .
positive	if you book on line and pick_up at lanzarote_airport you can be driving away in 0 minutes .
positive	brilliant !
positive	the second i clicked the submit button on the checkout , i received my code via_email ... never_experienced anything quite so fast !
positive	thanks you guys !
positive	!
positive	had this vodka in a breakfast cocktail at the rugby world_cup in nz last november and have been looking for it ever_since .
positive	pleased to say , i found it at the drink_shop and it was delivered to my glass in next to no time .
positive	let the good times roll .
positive	excellent helpful and efficient service ,
positive	when my son army spec .
positive	joshua johns told me it was time i started incorporating supplements into my workout routine ( s ) i was very skeptical .
positive	for 00 years i have lifted heavy weights & trained my butt off , worked through the car crashes , surgeries , injuries etc .
positive	because i wanted nothing unnatural put into my body .
positive	after informing_me of the pros & cons he turned me onto the supplier he has used for a few_years_now supplement_warehouse .
positive	i was still skeptical & unsure i would use them however after_researching & reading their promise ( s ) to me ( the consumer ) as well as the ingredients in the products they sell & their guarantee ( s ) i made my first purchase .
positive	now approximately 0 months later i am sold on them .
positive	they have done all they say they do & in me have a customer for life .
positive	the service was really good , quick_turnaround and the print quality was excellent .
positive	good contact , & updates , product just as expected on arrival & on schedule
positive	i was looking for the wonderful philharmonik orchestral samples to buy and this was by far the cheapest price online - and then the delivery was incredibly quick as well !
positive	i would recommend this online shop to anyone and everyone and i have no doubt i will be using them again - i am always looking for new samples and vst collections in my work as a music producer and composer .
positive	great range , everything in stock i ordered , superb delivery service , only tiny downside was the last gardenia sprinkler ( exactly same model ) i bought was made of at_least 00_% metal , new one is all plastic , hope they don , t go same way as hozelock who '_s products are utter garbage
positive	thx
positive	i was sceptical_about using a service like mazuma as i worried they would receive my phone and make up some excuse to lower the price i had been quoted but i was pleasantly_surprised .
positive	the whole_experience took hardly_any time .
positive	filled in the form , printed_off the shipping label and the money was in my account by the end of the next_day .
positive	excellent
positive	they have a first_class comprehensive_range of products at good prices , excellent stocks are held , they had everything we wanted and the delivery was very quick .
positive	first_class service !
positive	just our first order but very impressed with the service and the prices for the worming medicine for our dogs were the lowest anywhere

positive	i was being_pestered by what i thought was a solitary mouse .
positive	tried one of those sound repellants .
positive	( sounds allegedly only audible to mice ...)
positive	one evening i spotted the mouse about 00 times in the front room , where the sound gadget was switched on .
positive	decided to buy a mouse trap , but didn_'_t want to kill the dear little fellow .
positive	so decided to try the pest stop humane trip trap .
positive	within hours of being set - i ' d got him ..( or her )
positive	i was wrong about there being only one .
positive	two_days_later in a different site , i had another .
positive	then the following_day .. a third .
positive	all taken for a little drive and deposited in a local wood .
positive	visited 0 shops looking for a certain lamp with no one having the right one in stock .
positive	looked on lamps on line site and not only did they have the right lamp , the right colour , they were also the cheapest , so even with postage_charges i saved time and money .
positive	excellent fast service , will use again .
positive	i have been looking for a personalised label printer and came_across patlabels .
positive	was exactly_what i was looking for , ordering was simple and goods despatched very promptly .
positive	prices also reasonable and offer much_better value than of the shelf labels at my local_wholesaler .
positive	will_definately_use again .
positive	once again kenable has delivered in more than one way .
positive	products were easy to order and all items in stock .
positive	prices are still the best i have found and quality of items match .
positive	excellent communication from couriers and all items delivered on time and in perfect_condition .
positive	will_definitely use again for all my data needs .
positive	i '_ve found cpc very handy for those normally hard to find gizmos and gadgets that i use for both work and personal use .
positive	they are a one stop_shop for all electronic accessories and a whole lot more , all at excellent value for money .
positive	regular mailouts handy but i do find website a bit_tricky to locate items on .
positive	brilliant service - have used them in the past and will do so again
positive	everything was perfect : first i got quick reply for my answer , than shipment was done very fast and finally i got memory which are very good and in a good price .
positive	thanks !
positive	i was dubious at first but did a bit of research and was happy with going ahead , and didn_'_t regret it .
positive	fast delivery of code , brilliant .
positive	brilliant items on sushisushi , with reasonable prices .
positive	quick response time and fast delivery .
positive	i am defiantly purchasing again from this company .

positive	i wiuld not_hesitate to recomend mazuma they are excellant
positive	i ordered my wife '_s new sunglasses from this website on a saturday_night received an email from them the next_day to say my order had been processed and was being shipped and will be with me shortly 0 days_later they arrived via_ups in a very secure package so that they would not get damaged .
positive	my wife is very pleased with the glasses an i am very pleased as the website was so easy to use plus they had a great offer on them .
positive	( new wayfarer ray_bans )
positive	easy to use website , quality products at competitive_prices .
positive	comms were excellent too and delivered in good time .
positive	i ' d be happy to recommend click_fragrance .
positive	i read various feedback from other_sites and decided to try mazuma .
positive	requested a quote , waited for the packing to arrive , which it did the next_day .
positive	i bubble_wrapped the phone to be safe and sent it special delivery .
positive	the following_day i recieved an email to say the full_amount would be in my account by midnight .
positive	i recieved the full_amount even_though the back case had a crack in it where the connector fits ( standard iphone_0gs problem ) and the money was in my account that afternoon .
positive	quidco works really well and gives me money back on purchases i would have made anyway .
positive	sometimes it takes months for money to come through but when it does it is a nice bonus .
positive	you can search for most products but need to make_sure you couldnt purchase the same items or service at a lower price outside of quidco
positive	great service form chris although i had to chase up the delivery date a couple of times .
positive	i have now had the time to form an opinion of the vw_transporter sportline .
positive	the vehicle itself is exceptional , the build quality is superb , so why do vw spoil the overall effect by penny pinching ( thats all i can assume it is ) on the interior finish .
positive	ok its a transporter kombi and therefor a commercial vehicle but its also a sportline and we pay a premium for a sportline , as such i would have expected a better finish to the rear roof lining with a couple of half decent lights , side loading door capings would have been a nice_touch and maybe carrying the sportline finish through to the rear loading area and only speakers in the front doors !!
positive	for the rear passengers to be able to listen to any music , the volume has to be excessively loud in the front .
positive	i would quite happily have paid extra for a better factory fit finish as it is i am now having these things corrected by an after market company .
positive	i think my next choice may well be the caravel .
positive	thank_you very much for your speedy delivery .
positive	they have plenty of costumes and accessories available and deliver quickly and reasonably i would buy from them again
positive	cannot_fault the service or delivery time .
positive	easy to book , best price i could_find .
positive	bought frozen for £ 0 . 00 at amazon got £ 0 . 00 paid back .. free dvd
positive	trying to upgrade the ram on my old pc and my order was logged at 0 . 00pm .
positive	parcel received at 00 . 00 the next_morning .
positive	pretty_impressive you might think except this is to highland , scotland where half the companies charge a ridiculous surcharge for delivery or won_'_t deliver at all .
positive	fantastic service :)
positive	flowers were as pictured and arrived not damaged from courier .
positive	really found the whole_experience very easy , well_laid_out information , very easy to compare , if you shop around you can also get further cashback , i used quidco who offered me a further 0 %_discount as well as 0 % cashback - very pleased !
positive	i placed an order with express_pharmacy not having dealt_with them before , but the order was sent promptly and arrived quickly no_hassle noproblem
positive	i find bodybuilding_warehouse are cheap but the thing i like best is when you order
positive	you get an email_telling you what day they will deliver on and a one hour time_slot
positive	when your package will arrive i take my hat off to these_guys five_star the best
positive	ordered some batteries which arrived quickly and i even got a chocolate with them !
positive	excellent service !
positive	they have never_let_me down reminded_me when my order is due , simple re order process and when there where postal strikes they recommended delivery dates , and ways to get my lenses to me
positive	don_'_t knock it until you have tried it , believe me , they will pleasantly surprise you with their choices , quality , value , helpful knowledge & super service .
positive	i can '_t be fairer or more honest than that
positive	ordered online , received the pack within a couple of days .
positive	posted my old phone off as soon as i ' d transferred the details to the new one .
positive	cash in my bank_account a couple of days_later .
positive	simples
positive	the service is excellent ,..... thank_you
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone .
positive	the staff were efficient and to the point .
positive	they advertise a next_day service and that '_s what we got .
positive	thank_you
positive	great service , simple , cheap , delivered to a client in the netherlands with no_problems
positive	my wife and i were going away for our ruby_wedding_anniversary which was on sunday 0st september .
positive	we were travelling on the saturday with little idea of our time of arrival , so it was with some_trepidation that i placed my order for flowers with a company i had picked from the net with no prior knowledge , for delivery at the home of a friend who i didn_'_t know would be in !
positive	i was reassured by a text_message re safe delivery halfway_through our journey .
positive	when i picked_up the package from my friend after the journey i was delighted by the quality of the roses , the vase , the teddy_bear , and the card , as well as with the care with which they had been packed .
positive	my wife was also delighted with her gift the following_morning .
positive	i would certainly recommend serenataflowers .
positive	well_done .
positive	the order process was so easy and the chosen dealer called me to confirm the order .
positive	i was able to follow the order online and track my car from order through the factory to delivery to the uk .
positive	i was kept_fully_informed once the car had arrived at the dealer and the car was delivered to my drive on trade plates so that i had it ready for 0st march .
positive	i wouldn_'_t hesitate to use this process again and would have no problem in recommending carwow to anyone_else looking to purchase a new car .
positive	the new sink was delivered within four days of ordering .
positive	it was everything i wanted so what more can i say ?
positive	the order was delivered exactly when it was promised and the quality of the goods was excellent and at a reasonable price
positive	delivery service was spot on , most of my items arrived the very next_day and this was with the free delivery option .
positive	very very impressed .
positive	i bought some audioquest four strand speaker_cable and a dozen fusal ??
positive	banana_plugs recently . the order was promptly delivered and i had to check with audioviual online on how to configure thr four strand speaker_cable . in next to no time a gentleman explained what to do . that is five_star performance . audiovisual_online were reccomended to me and i know where to go when needs be .
positive	great service at a fantastic price - couldn_'_t be_happier :-))))
positive	immediate sending and delivery of what i needed
positive	found parts_gateway a good choice from_start to finish found me people who could supply what i wanted and was a totally fast efficient service
positive	ordered a pair of climbing_shoes which arrived swiftly after i ordered them , however they did not fit .
positive	i returned them to banana_fingers , but did not receive an email_confirming that they had received them ( even_though royal_mail tracking indicated that the package had been delivered ).
positive	it turns_out that the postman had left the package in an unusual place , which i found out with an email that was replied to promptly .
positive	my replacement shoes were then despatched to me the next_day .
positive	overall great service , and i would recommend your company to others without_hesitation .
positive	i wish more companies treated their customers like this !
positive	ordered 0000 microsoft_points at 00pm , and the code was in my email inbox by 00 :_00pm - you can '_t ask for more than that .
positive	also , the price for the points was very competitive , which led me to the site in the first place .
positive	overall , i would unreservedly_recommend this company .
positive	i needed to post off a parcel with some speakers which weighed a not - so - small 00kg .
positive	at this weight royal_mail becomes ridiculously_expensive , so i looked to couriers for help .
positive	firstly i went directly to the couriers , which i ( wrongly ) assumed would be the cheapest thing to do , and my favourite courier is ups .
positive	so i logged_onto the ups website and got a quote of £_00 . 00 for them to collect and post my parcel .
positive	this was too much for me to pay , so i researched and found this company , parcel0go .
positive	so i went_ahead and got a quote from them , and gave_me a huge list with various couriers and varied speeds that my parcel would be delivered .
positive	ups were my first choice , and i needed it delivered quickly , so i opted for the express ups service which only set me back £_00 . 00 +_vat ( this was £_00 . 00 for me ).
positive	i did initially wonder_how it was so cheap , as it was half the price that ups are offering on their own site !
positive	and i assume that parcel0go takes a share of the price i pay !
positive	well , i should never have doubted anything as the next_day the ups driver came and collected my parcel , and was delivered the day after .
positive	great service !
positive	oh but a word of warning , don_'_t use tnt or hermes as they receive a lot of criticism , just pay a couple of quid extra and use dhl or ups !
positive	thanks a lot parcel0go !
positive	i will_definitely be using you again !
positive	like many others , i came into contact with this courier through purchasing off amazon .
positive	i ordered a bulky computer case ( weighing a solid 0kg ) and it was delivered within two_days of me purchasing the item , kudos to amazon for the quick dispatch also .
positive	however , this courier showed it '_s quality when i wanted to return an item also bought on amazon , they come to your house and collect it straight from you .
positive	this went_smoothly with the yodel van turning_up on the correct day and the driver being very helpful , telling_me about how long it would take for my package to be returned to amazon .
positive	overall , i couldn_'_t ask for more from a courier !
positive	amazon are an indisputably great company , with the right ethos to make it ideal for the customer .
positive	their pricing is always very competitive , to the point where you have to look second_hand to get items cheaper ; they offer a great free ' super_saver ' delivery option on all their products which is as speedy as many other_companies paid - for alternatives .
positive	another area amazon excel at is refunding purchases , they offer a no questions_asked 00 day guarantee on everything they sell , which they actually keep to ( again much_better_than the competition ).
positive	amazon even pay for a courier to collect the item you want to return from your house !
positive	you really can '_t get better_than that .
positive	however , one thing i would urge you to be wary of is unknowingly buying from random companies through the amazon website .
positive	this is very easy to do , with items from amazon themselves looking aesthetically identical to their affiliate counterparts .
positive	the way to check is by checking if the item offers the ' amazon free super_saver delivery ' option .
positive	if it offers this then the sale is fully completed through amazon themselves .
positive	however if you but from a random company , this is like buying the same item off of ebay , albeit a new item off [_external_reference_].
positive	give amazon a try , you will soon realise why many people swear by it !
positive	i have to admit , the reason i purchased from this company is that i had money in my paypal_account ( from selling on ebay ) and it takes 0 days to transfer money into your bank_account , so i was looking around various speaker sites and found that audiovisual_online accepted paypal ( surprisingly the only speaker company i found that does ).
positive	so , i had little choice who to order from , however i am very happy that i stumbled_across this site !
positive	as i mentioned earlier the prices they offer are competitive offering the same price as amazon for the speakers i wanted .
positive	however , having ordered many thing from unknown sites before , i was expecting a large postage cost be be included with my purchase ( in total the speakers weighed 00kg ) but no , the postage was free !
positive	being the skeptical person i am , i was expecting it to be sent by economy post and take a week or more to arrive with me .
positive	however this was anything but the case , for free they used dpd '_s next_day premium service !
positive	this is a great service , with dpd texting me straight_away telling_me the date when my package would arrive .
positive	even better was than on the day of arrival ( i ordered this a 00 at night and it arrived two_days_later !)
positive	dpd texted me giving me a 0 hour delivery slot and sure_enough the dpd van turned_up slap_bang in the middle of the slot !
positive	i couldn_'_t believe i got this postage service for free , it must have cost audiovisual good money to use that particular service .
positive	the condition of the item was perfect , with the box in perfect_condition ( just as it should have been ).
positive	i am now enjoying listening to my new speakers !
positive	i wouldn_'_t hesitate to use this company again !
positive	they would even be in preference to amazon and such like !
positive	( yes they are that good !)
positive	if only all companies were this good !
positive	as uual , the service was first_class in all_respects .
positive	easy to navigate website and really quick efficient service .
positive	had difficulty in finding the product i wanted locally , did a search saw it , ordered it , received it .
positive	well recommended !
positive	first time i have topped_up a mobile_phone and it was easy , next time it will be easier
positive	excellent transaction , very quick , goods as_described , would use again , thank_you !!!
positive	!

positive	we have never used a parking company before and this was our first time so we didn_'_t know what to expect .
positive	we booked a meet and greet service and all i can say that it was excellent service .
positive	rang them 00 min before arriving to gatwick and friendly man was ready waiting .
positive	on return of our holiday it was the same , rang them when collecting the luggage and car was waiting outside .

positive	selection is easy on their website , you can enter your vehicle_registration to get your tyre size in case you are not sure .
positive	you then have a huge_selection of tyres which you can sort by make , price or performance .
positive	and i '_ll tell you something else too ... search on - line for the price of the same tyre size from other well_known fitters and you will be amazed at tyre_shoppers prices .
positive	even the fitting experience is excellent with knowledgeable and friendly staff .
positive	you can '_t beat em .
positive	we ordered a new washing_machine from appliances_online as our other one had died in a cloud of smoke on the friday_morning .
positive	we chose appliances_online because for value but also because they delivered free on a sunday .
positive	we were promised a text on the sunday morning to confirm our delivery window , which duly_arrived on time .
positive	we also got a call from the delivery driver to check we ' d received the text and to confirm the slot .
positive	you ' re able to check online to confirm status of delivery including a delivery slot .
positive	we were given 00 - 0 and at approx_0pm the van arrived .
positive	washing_machine delivered to where we needed it and old one taken_away .
positive	we didn_'_t take the option of the installation service .
positive	hassle_free service - just what we wanted !
positive	i use millet_sports for all my tennis equipment , so i can only comment on that , but all i have to say is positive .
positive	the website is very usable and intuitive and the range of products offered is excellent .
positive	deliveries are all in a timely_fashion and prices are highly competitive .
positive	i would recommend to anyone .
positive	i have long thought that i should support high - street_stores , but amazon makes it so difficult !
positive	they offer a massive_range of products , the best prices , excellent customer service and a great website to boot .
positive	i cannot recommend them highly_enough .
positive	excellent experience , would definitely recommend to a friend .
positive	will be buying my next purchase here too

positive	quickly got what i ordered
positive	the best hatchbag i buy
positive	brilliant service
positive	i was after a replacement stylus for my audio_technica at00e cartridge .
positive	seeing as juno were offering the entire cartridge for less_than other_places charged for just the stylus - and only a couple of pounds more than the stylus by itself - it was a no - brainer .
positive	i chose to buy the makita 0000mg circular_saw from toolstop as they had it at the lowest_price i could_find , and also offered free overnight delivery .
positive	i noticed the bundle deal for this saw , which included a spare_blade for only a few_pounds more ; superb value .
positive	i had to call to cancel the original order , got straight through to a human and merely had to give them the order number and the email_notifying_me of a card refund arrived only minutes later .
positive	i then ordered the saw bundle , and it arrived promptly the next_day .
positive	couldn_'_t ask for more .
positive	i '_ll be using these_guys again .

positive	i recently used watchfinder to source an omega_seamaster .
positive	i had been looking at various_models over a period of time .
positive	having bought from watchfinder previously i knew the service was hassle_free .
positive	i spoke to luke who was totally professional and gave some good advice .
positive	i eventually chose a year_old seamaster which was £_000 cheaper_than the new model .
positive	everything was sorted_out in no time at all and the watch dispatched the following_day .
positive	the quality is exceptional and you would be hard_pressed to tell it wasn_'_t brand_new .
positive	i would not_hesitate to advise anyone with any_doubts_about buying from the internet to make their first stop off at watchfinder .

positive	i guess when you do anything on line you are always nervous in that you are dealing_with a computer and not a person .
positive	most companies want to avoid any personal contact .
positive	diamondgeezer are different in that there is also the personal service at the end of the telephone line , no queue and wait for hours , and you can actually speak with the owner of the company and get his advice .
positive	if you are at all concerned or nervous of making a purchase in that you havn '_t seen the article in the flesh , you have a money back guarantee with no strings_attached
positive	i have to say my experience so_far is excellent .
positive	impressed !

positive	following all the advice on glasses_direct , i gained the info from my prescription at the high_street_optician , selected the frames i wanted and went_ahead with the transaction .
positive	i liked the way that even_though i didn_'_t initially have all the info they needed , glasses_direct '_s query line was manned by helpful humans and e_- mails kept me informed about my selections and purchase .
positive	the glasses arrived and are everything i had wanted ; two_sets of glasses for probably less_than i would have paid for one in the high_street .

positive	i received very good email communication and the watch was delivered exactly as promised / described .
positive	it was well_packaged to prevent any damage and delivered royal_mail special delivery .
positive	my only other comment is that i was asked to provide my wrist_size when i ordered the watch but the bracelet wasn_'_t resized for me .

positive	i thought , " what the heck , it wont work , but it '_s so cheap , i may as well give it a go " well : it works .

positive	top_marks to animed for supplying caninsulin and the syringes at less_than half the price from my local_vet .
positive	not only is it cost_effective - ( also postage free ) - but i can order at my own convenience on the internet and be sure that the medication will be delivered in chilled packaging within a day or two of my order .
positive	by obtaining a six month prescription from my vet , ( i have to pay them £_00 for that !)
positive	i don_'_t even have to worry_about that part of the transaction , because animed keep me informed of how much " credit " is left on the prescription .
positive	when you have a dog that needs regular medication -( mine is diabetic ) - animed helps to manage the responsibility .
positive	other products available are a bonus !

positive	fantastic .
positive	there was a slight_problem with parcelforce failing to find my house ( but looking at trustpilot reviews of parcelforce it doesn_'_t seem unusual for them to get things wrong !).
positive	after emailing nevada who i believe got onto them , things started happening and i received my new guitar .

positive	thankfully iphone_surgery lived_up to all the good reviews on this site - sent my phone off on thursday and got it back this morning all fixed !
positive	my only ( small ) criticism was that the i missed the express postage option on the website as i was checking out , probably just my bad eyesight and in this instance it wouldn_'_t have made a difference since it was close to a weekend .

positive	i will use better_bathrooms again .
positive	i bought these gloves for my wife , who has reynaulds and carpal tunnel and she tells_me that since using the gloves , the pain in her hands has_improved tremendously .
positive	the gloves do everything that you say in your ads and my wife now has a good nights_sleep without being woken_up in pain .
positive	she also informs_me that she now has the use of her hands as soon as she wakes up in the morning , rather_than having to wait for an_hour for decent circulation in her palms .
positive	i would certainly recommend these gloves to anyone who has the same medical_condition .
positive	i also could not believe_how quickly i received the gloves through the post , i was pleasently_surprised .
positive	this product is great . had massive problems with my arm - couldn_'_t even hold a cup of tea without pain . recieved the strap within a couple of days . used it straight_away and pain eased . 0 days_later played in a golf comp again kept the strap on and it worked a treat . would def reccomend

positive	what more could i ask .
positive	well_done broadbandbuyer and all who make it possible .
positive	having found them while google searching for hotel / theatre breaks , i booked after they had tickets for the show i wanted ( war horse , fantastic ) with good seats and a hotel within a reasonable budget .
positive	they came back to me very quickly saying the hotel had no rooms for the date i require , although on - line it showed rooms available , jack at tickettree said they could offer another hotel , whilst a little more exspensive , tickettree would cover the difference .
positive	i accepted ( it was a little nearer to the theatre anyway ) my wife and i arrived at hotel , ( holiday_inn , kingscross road , also excellent ) all was booked with no_problems as was the theatre when we collected our tickets .

positive	i cannot recommend glasses_direct highly_enough !
positive	i had previously always bought my glasses on the high_street because i wanted to be able to try the frames on first , but gd '_s free home_trial service meant i could be sure to get the right styles online .
positive	the 00 - day no_quibble money back guarantee makes buying from them totally risk - free , not to mention excellent value .
positive	i accidentally gave them incorrect details at the ordering stage but they corrected my glasses free of charge , even_though the mistake was mine .

positive	service was easy to arrange and only required a few simple steps to request pre_paid_envelope .
positive	once phones were sent back in envelope the money was credited to account very quickly .
positive	although replacement cordless_phones are cheap it seemed worth_checking the availability of replacement batteries .
positive	buyabattery '_s stock is comprehensive and well indexed .
positive	it was quick work to locate the exct replacement for our binatone for juast a fiver .
positive	delivery was quicker_than predicted for the selscted first_class post .

positive	the service at the fitting_center was also as expected , overall i will_def_use this site again
positive	i ordered a computer for my girlfriend in the uk , i myself live in the netherlands .
positive	the fact that i can pick out the parts on the website myself , so i actually know what i buy and pay for was the winning factor in comparison to other shops .
positive	when i went through towards payment , i made a stupid mistake , i made the payment with paypal , but forgot to change the delivery adress to my girlfriends adress .
positive	as the payment was allready done , i had to cancel my paypal payment and make a new order as transferring my money back to my bankaccount would take several days .
positive	the entire time i was working on getting my payment done , i was helped very professionally and with nice care .
positive	the care i wasn_'_t expecting as i was messing_about with my payment !
positive	i am now awaiting the computer to be shipped out and delivered , i am truly happy with how things have gone so_far .

positive	on opening the meat , it was clearly of a far_superior quality to the usual supermarket stuff , with no shrinking when cooked , just juicy tender meat .
positive	i will_definately recommend you to a friend .
positive	i purchased this type of rim lock for my brand_new back gate which i made a few_years_ago .
positive	the elements had got to it , so as it was no_longer in working order , i thought i would ' treat ' myself to a new one .
positive	typical for the town in which i live , the builders merchant where i purchased my old lock had stopped_stocking it and said that they only sell what is on show .
positive	a trip to another local_store which used to sell everything that you could_possibly need to build things , revealed that they also didn_'_t stock it and only sold what is on show .
positive	i didn_'_t want to go to the bother of drilling new holes in the door for fixing centres , etc .
positive	i wanted the ease of fitting , ' like for like '.
positive	surely these rim locks must still be available , i thought .
positive	disillusioned , i went home , searched the internet and found that sds had the lock for sale .
positive	i am really pleased with what has_been delivered , it is exactly_what i was looking for and has made the job of fitting the lock onto the gate a whole lot_easier .
positive	from initial sample to deliver , my experience with worktop_express has_been top_class .
positive	the product ( bamboo_worktop and accessories ) are excellent , the price unbeatable and their customer service is first_rate !
positive	i used their pre_- oiling service which is well_worth it , their follow - ups ( one call and several emails ) are re - assuring and not at all pushy , and their own delivery assistants were polite and knowledgable , arriving bang on time .
positive	quite possibly , my most satisfying online buying experience !
positive	these contact_lenses are fantastic and very comfortable .
positive	they came the next_day in the post and were very well priced .
positive	give them a try and you will not regret it .
positive	excellent service and a really good courier who delivered exactly when they said they would , will use again 😄
positive	compared to all other_suppliers that i checked , ' insulation place ' were very competitively_priced , particularly as i was only needing a small_quantity of insulation .
positive	friendly staff contacted me to arrange a delivery slot ( morning or afternoon choice ).
positive	toolstop offered a makita tm0000c at £_00 delivered which was the cheapest online price found .
positive	not so competitive on accessory blades though , which i bought elsewhere .
positive	would certainly use again .
positive	i have ordered decadent e_- liquid both for myself and for friends , and we have all been delighted with the quality of the product .
positive	some of my favourite flavours come from their range ( the lemon meringue , blackcurrant ice and green giant all come with my hearty recommendation ) and the delivery service from the website is reasonably swift , even on large orders .
positive	add to this the money - off coupons they frequently post on facebook and you '_ve got a must - try vape store .
positive	a great experience from order to receipt !
positive	good quality items as prescribed , next_day delivery and very well_packaged .
positive	a pleasure to deal with .
positive	highly_recommended and will_certainly deal with again .
positive	thank_you .
positive	extremely good value for money , great products and fast free delivery !
positive	for those of us on a budget but want a decent camera , look no farther than digitalrev . com .
positive	i had not bought from them before and was a little_dubious .
positive	i decided to give it a go because of the great low price and free delivery from_hong_kong !!!
positive	i paid through pay_pal so i felt_confident that i was covered .
positive	i needn_'_t have been concerned .
positive	five days_later , my brilliant nikon_d0000 was delivered by courier , beautifully_packed in swathes of bubble_wrap and in perfect_condition .
positive	a disc with an english reference manual was included so no_problems with information and set_up .
positive	i am very pleased indeed with digitalrev !
positive	great communication , extremely fast delivery , a great deal and value and an excellent product !
positive	i have no_hesitation in recommending this excellent company !
positive	i used lenses for hire_ltd for the first time and it was worth it :) got nikon 00 - 00 f . 0 . 0 for a weekend .
positive	great lens and as i was shooting an indoor all day festival it was perfect for the job .
positive	great communication with the company and i '_m pretty sure i will get back to them :)
positive	i have regularly used tooled_- up . com for purchasing tools and equipment for my handyman business .
positive	they offer great value and a fast , efficient and free delivery service .
positive	i received a txt_message on the day i ordered the items telling_me they had been dispatched and would arrive the following_day then gave_me the options of different delivery dates or ' leave with a neighbour '.
positive	on the day of delivery another txt gave_me the name of the driver and an exact 0 hour_slot for the time of delivery .
positive	i arrived home at the designated time and actually followed the delivery van down the road to my house , perfect_timing !
positive	will_definitely use them again .
positive	having not completed a cv in the last 00 years , i struggled not with my content but was it god enough to put it out to the market .
positive	i looked on the internet , and identified cv_lizard .
positive	by taking this step i have ended_up with a cv which i am confident in the knowledge that it is first_class .
positive	the team at cv_lizard have provided a great service to my needs and i am very happy with the outcome , to which i have a cv i am confident in the knowledge that i can send it out with pride .

positive	was looking for a keyboard , realized i needed to do some homework , and this site was extremely_helpful in assisting with the decision .
positive	very good service , turned_up when said they would , driver was very helpfull .
positive	i looked for batteries online and this looked like the best site and it was . very good and so quick .
positive	this is the first time i have ever ordered a roller banner .
positive	i used thesignbuilder as it had a design it yourself section which i found intuitive and quite easy to use .
positive	it was a breeze to build my desired sign .
positive	however , i am no techno - whizz and the image i had sent them when expanded to roller - banner size would have been blurry and unprofessinal looking .
positive	that '_s when amy and the wonderful customer service came to the rescue .
positive	she got back to me very quickly stating the issue with the image i had sent and even suggested a few images i could use instead .
positive	i subsequently took another picture and we went with this one .
positive	but amy was fantastic and i received my banner 0 days ago ( about 0 days from ordering ) and it exceeded my expectations with the quality of printing and construction .
positive	in this day and age of slapdash printing firms thesignbuilder are a breath of fresh_air .
positive	i would have no_hesitation in recommending them and am about to order another banner from them .
positive	no_nonsense , excellent speedy service , as well as being the cheapest for my brand of dog_food .
positive	all in all a very good experience , i will_definitely use again .
positive	after sales communication was good and the skis have arrived in first_class condition - very impressed with the extra waxing .
positive	toolstop had the complex electrical test equipment i needed and delivered the next_day as promised !
positive	that '_s service ?
positive	i was dubious of buying glasses through glasses_direct as my eyes are quite bad and i need 0 . 0 + in one eye and 0 . 0 + in the other .
positive	i thought sites like this were for people with near perfect eyesight !
positive	i was wrong .
positive	my glasses are perfect and it took 0 days from ordering to delivery .
positive	i can wait weeks at my well_known high_street_opticians .
positive	thank_you for a great product and service !

positive	i didn_'_t have to pay anything extra at delivery time .
positive	a card for the 0 year_warranty from digitalrev came with the camera .

positive	this website has_become my new first_port of call for supps .
positive	their own_brand stuff is pretty_damn good quality and cheap as chips .
positive	the newsletter is actually worth signing_up for as well rather_than being an annoyance like with most other_sites .

positive	i '_ve been buying my cycling_gear from prendas for more than 00 years_now , and have never had to wait more than a day for delivery - amazing service .
positive	its brilliant but you have to double_check when clicking for your orders .
positive	i have clicked for one item then end up with 0 then its seems hard to get your money back .

positive	this order was as smooth as the first 0 .
positive	ordering_process on their website is quick and easy , the payment was secured through palpal and delivery arrived when expected on all 0 occasions .
positive	most definitely will order from greenman again in the future .
positive	i ordered a new desktop off the arbico website and found it very easy to use with many customisable_options .
positive	the system itself that i chose was great value for money , as were several other systems listed on the site .
positive	after ordering , you are kept up to date with every_stage of the testing / preparation of your new system with regular_emails and you are also given several options of delivery dates .
positive	my pc arrived dead on time and any follow - up queries i had were dealt_with via_email in a matter of minutes .
positive	highly_recommended !
positive	great products , easy to find and pay for , and they arrived sooner_than i expected .
positive	if you want a quick service i would recommend official phone unlock
positive	honestly i was sketchy at first , but the order was quick , simple and perfect , got my game & currently playing , excellent service !
positive	bargin price , arrived quickly , one happy customer
positive	i was pleased at how easily i could_find the article i wanted .
positive	also , the price was lower_than competitors .
positive	myself and friends from work have used event_tyres a number of times now , its really convenient as they come to you , they '_ve come out both to my home and work , i '_ve never had a problem with any of the work done or the tyres and they are the cheapest i '_ve found ( usually a lot cheaper_than the regular tyre_fitting garages ).
positive	i sent my phone off using the free_postage system .
positive	payment was received quickly .
positive	very good service and hassle_free .
positive	where do i start ?
positive	pull up a chair and get a brew on .
positive	are you sitting comfortably ?
positive	a neighbour had his car stolen a while ago .
positive	this prompted me to look at cctv as i have a van full of goodies ( address withheld lol ).
positive	i am from a property_maintenance / building background and an electrician to boot .
positive	i also like electronics , computers and gadgets !
positive	so i had a pretty good idea what i am looking at ?
positive	i am very careful when it comes to buying tools and equipment etc .
positive	so , i spent literally weeks deciding on a company and a product .
positive	i research and then research again ...
positive	i '_m mad like that ....
positive	i read countless threads etc .
positive	and i kept coming_back to these_guys , patrick and colin .
positive	i used the handy chat_facility on their website to fire questions at then ( mainly colin ).
positive	i got informed and clear answers to my ( many ) coffee time and sometimes ' going home time ', questions .
positive	( colin has a very good sense of humour too ).
positive	so , i eventually bought a 0 camera system ( bespoke , not a bundle ).
positive	and it arrived the next_day .
positive	v . well_packaged etc ...
positive	superb .
positive	up went 0 of the 0 cams .
positive	top tip ....
positive	install the phone app asap !
positive	it makes aiming and focussing the cams a doddle !
positive	you can be up the ladder and see the camera view on your phone !
positive	the dvr was / is easy to use and set_up ..
positive	i am still learning , but the guys are there if you need them .
positive	a fixed ip is esssential if you want to view your cams while away from home ..
positive	the guys can tell you how this is done .
positive	some isps will help , others ( like aol ) wont .
positive	don_'_t worry though , colin / pat have a solution to that too .
positive	otherwise you can use the app linked to your wifi in your home ( if you have wifi of course !).
positive	thats what i did .
positive	so , i got the cams up one saturday .. . amazing clarity etc .... a few small niggles ref the camera design , which aren_'_t worth_mentioning ( you '_ll see why next ).
positive	however , the night_vision turned_out to be poor , due to fogging in the dome .
positive	i tried several * fixes * ( extra silica gel etc_.)
positive	but nothing worked !
positive	:(
positive	so .....
positive	i sent a few screen_shots from the dvr along with other observations , that night ...
positive	the next_morning , the guys emailed me at around 0000 !
positive	they had seen the poor quality of the night images and had already removed the camera from their site and , immediately came up with the offer of a refund or an_alternative camera .
positive	the replacement cams arrived the next_day !
positive	they went up in no time ( they are xc0000v ip cams .
positive	0 . 0mpix ).
positive	superb daytime pictures and , the night_vision is good too !
positive	even my wife commented " i cannot_believe_how clear the pictures are ", and that '_s an accolade coming from her !
positive	you do have to be a bit mindful of reflections of the i . r .
positive	from nearby objects as this can degrade the image at night so some degree .
positive	i overcame all my problems in this regards easily by slight adjustments of camera angles .
positive	as for hdcctv as a company ?
positive	i have always said that any idiot can run a business when its going well .
positive	it '_s the measure of the company ( and its staff ), how they deal with problems when things go_wrong though .
positive	i have experienced things going wrong before and been faced with ( on one occasion ) going to court .
positive	i had no such worries with this company .
positive	they sorted_out my * problem * quickly and politely and therefore , professionally .
positive	all in all , i reckon i got the best value for money on the net .
positive	i got shed loads of free advice ( boy , i thought i knew a bit about cameras etc .???).
positive	i got superb service and i am confident that i will get advice whenever i need it .
positive	honestly , what more do you need or expect ?
positive	i could write reams ( this is edited anyway ), but you get the idea by now !
positive	save your time , don_'_t bother surfing the net for hours like i did .
positive	i ( like many others ) have done the legwork for you .
positive	if you want a camera or a system ....... get it here !
positive	ps .
positive	no , i dont work for cctv , i have never met colin or patrick ...
positive	i live in hampshire and they are in telford .
positive	but i believe in * credit where its due *, and they certainly deserve the five_stars .
positive	cheers_guys !
positive	ian .
positive	i have used these_guys a few_times now ...
positive	i always check the net for the best prices and , to date , these_guys have the most competitive_prices .
positive	their communication is good , i have had a few_times where they have phoned me to check delivery details etc .
positive	( i love their irish accents too !)
positive	if all companies were this * on the ball * life would be a joy !
positive	i needed a new dewalt sds + battery drill .
positive	vvx had the best price on the net .
positive	it was delivered very quickly ( within 00_hours i think ).

positive	if you buy from them you wont be dissapointed with the service !
positive	very happy with the service and the price .
positive	will buy from them again for sure .
positive	best price on the net .
positive	drill well_packed , good comms , superb .. would deffo_use them again !
positive	pros ...
positive	blinds are generally very good value for money .
positive	the service is pretty good too !
positive	i like the site and the way it remembers what choice of blind you have chosen when making multiple_orders .
positive	cons .
positive	it is really annoying me now that every time i make an order , i have to repeatedly enter my address and delivery address details ( they are different ) !!!
positive	!
positive	why cant the site rember my address details like other_sites do , so i only have to enter it once then just confrim it hasnt changed with each further order ???
positive	?
positive	please sort this out !
positive	i live in the uk , but on a visit to the us i brought a rather expensive keyboard which on return to the uk i inspected the keybaord and found the us keyboard layout was different to the standard uk keyboard layout .
positive	d ' oh the mistake was my fault i should have checked the keyboard immediately on receipt , as should be done with all mail order goods .
positive	i looked to send the keyboard back from the uk to the us but the cost was too much .
positive	two months went by with the unused keyboard sitting in the box , ( with me very much considering putting it on ebay ), when found that i was taking a trip back to the states in a couple of weeks .
positive	i wasn_'_t really expecting the amazon . com to do anything , after all i was well outside the the return time frame of 00 days , but i ' d thought i ' d ask .
positive	to my sheer_delight customer service got back to me saying that they would accept this late return , providing it was unused and new ( of course ).
positive	i '_m delighted with this amazing good natured and helpful customer service , willing to bend the rules for me .
positive	thanks amazon . com .
positive	btw amazon . co . uk rocks to !
positive	can only recommend , good price and quick delivery and beautiful flower as !
positive	compared more well_known_brands a bargain ;)
positive	the items i bought arrived extremely fast and there where no_problems with the products i purchased
positive	as above the place needs some money spent on it !
positive	good quality at a fair price and prompt delivery
positive	exactly as ordered !
positive	perfect fit and top quality .
positive	always use eflorist and the flowers are always perfect
positive	i was very pleased with mazuma .
positive	sent them my old_phones and recieved a cheque for the full_amount_quoted about 0 - 0 days_later .
positive	overall very happy .
positive	ordered online on an easy to use site , good
positive	discounts and the tools arrived two_days earlier_than predicted .
positive	says it all really , spot on .
positive	if you are looking for special spots that dont cost an arm and a leg , this is the site .. great pic '_s of the property '_s and a good run down on the amenities and a map to let you find the way ... the owners of the property '_s respond promptly and give great directions to the property if you make the reservation ... would recomment them highly ...
positive	i would reccomend simplygames to everyone as it stands_out from other_websites .
positive	the delivery is very fast and effiecent ( 0 - 0 days ).
positive	i was very impressed with the prices .
positive	a really good gaming website !!!!!
positive	i will_definitely buy my next game from here !!!
positive	!
positive	just bought a blind for my kitchen from blinds to go very pleased and a good price
positive	will be buying again
positive	i needed a fuelhawk fuel_gauge but needed to know the length of the universal model .
positive	i phoned in and was given the answer with little delay and received the item the next_day .
positive	excellent service
positive	absolutely no_problems at all .
positive	however , given the advancements of technology , it '_s hard to be aware of all the changes happening in cars .
positive	e . g .
positive	pressing the clutch in order to start car , having the motor turn off when gear in neutral and car stationary .
positive	i would have found an owners_manual very handy .
positive	even if i had to leave a refundable_deposit to ensure its return .
positive	brilliant , thank_you , very speedy order for my twin homeplugs 000 .
positive	was online basically instantly , so simple to set_up .
positive	now got a more stable connection now instead on wireless .
positive	looking to order some more now for the other pcs in our house .
positive	thanks - colin leonard
positive	fast and efficient service with goods delivered promptly and in good working order . i would definitely recommend them to anyone on my experience .
positive	first_class service , part arrived the next_day and sorted the problem
positive	in hiring at christmas time we faced hefty prices on car_rentals .
positive	my usual car_rental company was charging nearly_double what rentalcars . com was offering -- and even then they were not listing any cars availalbe at that time .
positive	i was a little_sceptical at first of online companies , but this service on rentalcar . com turned_out to be very easy , accurate and much_cheaper .
positive	i was , frankly , pleasantly_surprised .
positive	rentalcar . com uses reputab ; e local rental car companies which makes the whole rental process very easy .
positive	i will_definitely need use rentalcar . com again !
positive	the chair arrived the next_day well_packed and it is very comfortable and just as advertised .
positive	speedy delivery of a good product well_packed and arrived in good order .
positive	from order to delivery it was a painless operation and it was quick and i received exactly_what i asked for
positive	i would recommend glasses_direct very highly .
positive	i received two_pairs of single - vision specs for driving .
positive	they are to my exact prescription and were excellent value .
positive	i would not have been surprised to have received specs of lower quality than this , given the excellent price .
positive	as it is , they are very well made and every bit as good as any you could_find in high_street_opticians at four or five times the price .
positive	well_done and thank_you .
positive	the expression , " you get what you pay for " is nuts .
positive	what you pay for is the item , plus the profit which goes to the seller .
positive	quidco can get some of that profit and pass it on to you !
positive	for almost everything i buy , i go via quidco , and so get a discount .
positive	the best amount is on insurance ( e . g .
positive	£_00 back on my car insurance ) and special_offers negotiated by quidco .
positive	i get about £_000 back every year , and it '_s tax free , as it is a discount on purchases .
positive	if you ' re not using quidco , you ' re missing out on decent savings .
positive	this is a very nice online store where i can find all my aviation " toys " and receive them quickly .
positive	quick delivery - item as_described !
positive	brilliant !

positive	first time i have used this site and was very satisfied with stock , prices , speed of delivery and service .
positive	usual and predictably faultless service experienced again and again ...
positive	the item arrived very quickly and my daughter absolutely_loved it .
positive	i would recommend mega_fancy_dress to anybody .
positive	i have purchased the sunny cam and hope to use it skiing and flying in the near_future , so_far though the cam seems really great .
positive	service as always is excellent and the prices fair .
positive	its not always the case to expect quality service from a supplier , although we should expect it , these_guys simply do without_question , order , delivery and follow_up , would reccoment them to anyone !
positive	we run a bed & breakfast in the limousin , france .
positive	we were reccomended this site by fellow bnb owners as vanilla_pods are very expensive here !
positive	very impressed by the whole ordering experience and delivery was very speedy .
positive	will most certainly use them again in the future .
positive	ipsl has a wide_range of products at a good price .
positive	in fact , it was cheaper to buy from them and have the goods shipped to me than to buy from a local company selling similar products .
positive	the goods arrived well - packaged and on the due date .
positive	the ipsl staff i dealt_with were friendly and helpful .
positive	their website is user - friendly and a good source for easy - to - understand installation guides .
